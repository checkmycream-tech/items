    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>good luck with this.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and has a pleasant taste but have not noticed any remarkable difference in the color of my teeth</li>
            <li>YOU lost a sale from me and who knows how many others!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t do that unless this had some good effect. :)</li>
            <li>WE HAD BETTER EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS PRODUCT.WE&#x27;VE</li>
            <li>BUT NOTHING, AS ISAID BEFORE, BAKING SODA WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li>Would not recommend to buy - the whitening strips are better.</li>
            <li>I feel that if this first order didn&#x27;t do it for me, more was not going to be better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I used more bleach than paste for each brush, but the bleach tube seemed to run out quickly</li>
            <li>It really works better with the bleaching gel.</li>
            <li>I use toothpaste for sensitive teeth most of the time, but about 3 to 5 times a week, I use this system to remove some of the accumulated stains from food/beverages.</li>
            <li>As a senior, my teeth are not as bright as they used to be...nor do I want very white shiny teeth that look like new &amp;#34;plates&amp;#34;;  this product clears up my teeth, shines them up and whitens a bit more than other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes....and does not hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it worked VERY well.</li>
            <li>really works you must try it.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll run out too fast.</li>
            <li>It works!several sades better than other like products.  </li>
            <li>it only made them feel clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Supersmile for two weeks and, WOW, what a difference!  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I have avoided a dentist for whitening because I don&#x27;t want to overly sensitive my already sensitive teeth.</li>

            <li> All other products only work on natural teeth -</li>
            <li> However, I suggest you use slightly less of the bleaching gel (the clear one)</li>
            <li> and I was left with a half a tube of paste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other products, but they were somewhat limited.  </li>
            <li> I just reordered it and will also purchase other Supersmile products.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not worth it.</li>
            <li> But I drink a lot of coffee and tea, and I notice it has an effect on my teeth (which are not white to start with, so don&#x27;t need to be made worse, ya</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I tired this product for over 2 weeks, did see some results, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The product is very small, the gel is 32 oz while the paste is 50oz which is the reason why the gel always runs faster than the paste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a dazzling difference, mind</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the level of whitening.  </li>
            <li> Not a good value for the size !!!</li>
            <li> Failed to work as promised, did not alter whiteness at all.  </li>
            <li> What the heck is wrong with these stupid sellers who never put ALL the info on the item</li>
            <li> Very disappointing for all four people I purchased it for</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not work at all!!!!!  Want to tell everyone that this product is a scam!!!!  I  did not see a change at all&lt;br /&gt;!!!!!</li>
            <li> WE HAD BETTER EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS PRODUCT.WE&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT TO A WHILE BUT NOTHING, AS ISAID BEFORE, BAKING SODA WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using GoSmile for awhile now but, despite the expense and hype, it didn&#x27;t do a lot.  I&#x27;ve been using Supersmile for two weeks and, WOW, what a difference!  I just reordered it and will also purchase other Supersmile products.  Yes, folks, it works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I used more bleach than paste for each brush, but the bleach tube seemed to run out quickly and I was left with a half a tube of paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it worked VERY well. I saw results within a couple of days!</li>
            <li> really works you must try it.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the level of whitening.  Plus it seemed like I ran out of one product way before the rest of it.  I feel that if this first order didn&#x27;t do it for me, more was not going to be better.</li>
            <li> I have avoided a dentist for whitening because I don&#x27;t want to overly sensitive my already sensitive teeth. But I drink a lot of coffee and tea, and I notice it has an effect on my teeth (which are not white to start with, so don&#x27;t need to be made worse, ya know?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has worked for me. I use toothpaste for sensitive teeth most of the time, but about 3 to 5 times a week, I use this system to remove some of the accumulated stains from food/beverages. I notice a difference. It&#x27;s not a dazzling difference, mind you--you&#x27;re not gonna look like some movie star. But it&#x27;s enough that I NOTICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for several months (prior to that I used the Supersmile for four years by itself). It really works better with the bleaching gel. However, I suggest you use slightly less of the bleaching gel (the clear one) or you&#x27;ll run out too fast. The directions say use equal measures of both, but somehow, I always run out of the bleach before I run out of the toothpaste, even when it looks like I&#x27;m using equal measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always keep a spare of this system in my bathroom cabinet. I wouldn&#x27;t do that unless this had some good effect. :)</li>
            <li> Did not working for me</li>
            <li> Not a good value for the size !!!</li>
            <li> Failed to work as promised, did not alter whiteness at all.  Very disappointing for all four people I purchased it for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.  All other products only work on natural teeth - I have crowns in front so they haven&#x27;t worked - Supersmile does.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has a pleasant taste but have not noticed any remarkable difference in the color of my teeth</li>
            <li> I tired this product for over 2 weeks, did see some results, but not what I expected. I would rather use Power Swabs instead. Nothing more then an expensive tooth paste.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth at all. Very disappointed with this product. Would not recommend to buy - the whitening strips are better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not worth it. The product did not whiten my teeth it only made them feel clean. I can use regular toothpaste if I want \\&quot;clean\\&quot;. Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have used this periodically for the last several years.  As a senior, my teeth are not as bright as they used to be...nor do I want very white shiny teeth that look like new &amp;#34;plates&amp;#34;;  this product clears up my teeth, shines them up and whitens a bit more than other &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; toothpastes....and does not hurt my gums.  I get compliments from my dentist too.  good luck with this.</li>
            <li> It works!several sades better than other like products.  I have used other products, but they were somewhat limited.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I would never buy this from this seller because the size is not mentioned and i could not get the pic bigger to see it.....What the heck is wrong with these stupid sellers who never put ALL the info on the item they are selling???..YOU lost a sale from me and who knows how many others!</li>
            <li> well I guess the title says it all. The product is very small, the gel is 32 oz while the paste is 50oz which is the reason why the gel always runs faster than the paste. Also the product made my inner mouth irritated, probably I have supersensitive skin of whatever, in any case I won&#x27;t buy this item anymore</li>
