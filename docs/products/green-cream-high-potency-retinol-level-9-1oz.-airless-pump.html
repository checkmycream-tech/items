            <li>This cream has been the best product I have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Best wishes to all you beautiful people out there!!!</li>
            <li>I would say all three levels are very good products, I just wish they would come up with something that will remove the flaking all together, and or something that hydrates the face during the peeling</li>
            <li>very good for controlling acne and acne scares.</li>
            <li>Great product and wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>Great vendor great stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Retin-A and Retinol and this is easier on the skin with beautiful results.  </li>
            <li>After switching to the Lvl. 6, it has been great.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 3 weeks and have noticed a great improvement on my acne scars!!!!YAY</li>
            <li>Great peel effect.</li>
            <li>I did experience a 3 week period where my skin went through almost a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; from the product, but now I can honestly say, my face feels INCREDIBLE and remarkably improved.</li>
            <li>Dermatologists are amazed that my skin is so good for my age.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything on the market because I&#x27;ve never had good skin.  </li>
            <li>When your peeling, use a good exfoliator and keep using the cream.  </li>
            <li>Using it 4 or 5 times a day is a good thing too.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see any good results either.</li>
            <li>Good product showing results in just weeks.</li>
            <li>You need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Along with this, the skin on my face didn&#x27;t feel good anymore.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>:-D if you&#x27;ve never used retinol before try using the level 3 first and work your way up to it.</li>
            <li>I love this product..noticed results after a couple of days!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when it needs to be replaced!</li>
            <li>So I did my own research and learned about retinol.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best skincare product that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>The New Orleans dermatologists who came up with the formula were brilliant!</li>
            <li>ive used many retinols and i think this is better than skin medica tri retinol es!  </li>
            <li>It did a nice job smoothing out my fine lines and preventing acne.</li>
            <li>It feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>I wanted more results then what level 3 and 6 offer</li>
            <li>I will have to give it more time to see the results.</li>
            <li>I love the Glycolic Lotion and know it works.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products ever.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you wear your sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I never looked any better.</li>
            <li>If I miss too many days, then you can tell.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li>This is about the most I can take at this point but will probably up it soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard copper peptides produce better results than retinol for thightening the skin, and diminishing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Make sure to start with level 3 or level 6.</li>
            <li>Some drying and peeling may occur but it will get better with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As retinols go it is my hands-down favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is a potent retinol cream.</li>
            <li>Love this product, purchased twice now...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every night for about 8 months and will keep using it until I find something that works better.</li>
            <li>skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the skin I always wanted but never knew how to get. :-)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>the years of use, I have received many compliments about the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>The company and product are both awesome, try their website, it is a true inspiration to learn about the quality ingredients and wonderful people and Doctors behind this gem of a product.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this kind of product!</li>
            <li>I am lucky to already have nice skin for my age</li>
            <li>I think it also helps me that I use a strong alpha-hydoxy acid peel pads once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li>This one is just too strong to begin a treatment plan with.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a strong Alfa Hydroxy cream for awhile</li>
            <li>Well, the stuff is definitely strong, and I like that.</li>
            <li>If you do use these products, I strongly recommend you do as they say at start with a lower level.</li>
            <li>This is a strong product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how strong it was</li>
            <li>Retinol is a tried and true ingredient for better skin</li>
            <li>My girlfriend recommended that I try a retinol product, and she recommended this one to me since she&#x27;d heard that it was pretty effective.  </li>
            <li>I have notice subtle differences since my wife has started to use this product (plus happy wife &#x3D; happy life)</li>
            <li>I am 53 years old and have always had acne prone skin until about 5 years ago when I started taking Perfect Oils (Omega 3, 6, 9 supplements from Nutritional Therapeutics  - I highly recommend).  </li>
            <li>much smoother healthy looking skin!</li>
            <li>My face seems to look so much healthier with a nice glow to it.  </li>
            <li>Any and all questions will be answered by browsing their fantastic site.</li>
            <li>and so I welcome the initial peeling that comes with that.</li>
            <li>Fantastic results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great product, and I will definitely be re-purchasing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels good so far</li>
            <li>and I advise all of you to start with the level 6 because it takes some time for the skin to get used to this product, don&#x27;t use level 9 first!!</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>Original Review</li>
            <li>I use a number of high quality skin products, visit a derm and plastic surgeon for micro and botox and generally take very good care of my appearance and my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a good light cream that makes your skin feel younger as you continue use.  </li>
            <li>I have had 2 fairly large horizontal neck rings for most of my life.</li>
            <li>Level 6 is a good product for daily use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken the advice of all dermatologists to use a good sun screen daily, which has become a habit -- rain or shine!</li>
            <li>If you are like me, make sure to apply a facial moisturizer after you apply this product, and make sure to use a moistorizing sunscreen product during the day.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin more sensitive to light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46, athletic, overall very healthy.  </li>
            <li>I Love the workin process of green cream, it made me feel a lot more confident than I was before,</li>
            <li>The peeling is because the cream is getting rid of all the dead skin to create new, more beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>My whole face peeled like a sunburn when I used it a couple times because it was too strong.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than 25 years, beginning when it was available as a prescription only from the outstanding dermatologist Dr. Nia Terezakis in New Orleans.</li>
            <li>I have very light skin, so even minor blemishes and discolorations are easily noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, be sure to just use it at night, since it does make you sensitive to sun.</li>
            <li>I had gotten a prescription for Retin-A many years ago, and this product works identically, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It looks dewy, fresh and glows.</li>
            <li>First week of using it my skin peeled a little and it was kind of irritated, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I have been using green cream for about a month along with MD Forte and my skin is clear bright and very smooth</li>
            <li>I am slowly getting the softening of fine lines, but after three bottles I was hoping for more recovery from breakouts and a better tone from discoloration by now.</li>
            <li>Today my skin absolutely glows; fine lines are practically non-existent &amp; I have gotten many comments about how much younger I look.</li>
            <li>it seems effective and keeps my aged skin smooth without too much wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I love this product - bought my first bottle at my Derm&#x27;s office, now purchase on eBay, where I was able to score it for less than Amazon.</li>
            <li>fine lines are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just found out about Retinol recently and decided to go straight for a very strong cream.</li>
            <li>Apparently the other two did not go through when hitting the appropriate keys etc; I will not waste any more of my precious time if this one disappears into space.</li>
            <li>When I use it consistently after a scrub, my skin tone evens out and have fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>The retinol content is much higher than anything I have found elsewhere.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more affordable and the results are similar.</li>
            <li>Overall my skin is clearer, smoother, with a more even tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very grateful that I found this product!</li>
            <li>Apply at night time only because it works better while you sleep.</li>
            <li>One pump of the cream applied over my face at night and my skin looks and feels better the next day.  </li>
            <li>When I went to the dermatologist with one of these deep cystic zits, she just lanced it, drained it, and injected it up with a steroid shot (not the most practical or helpful method of treatment since I was getting them</li>
            <li>Overall, this product has made my life better by relieving me of the burden I had with my cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>Since this cream came up several times on a skin-care forum I was looking at, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I really do love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>B000SAPE3A Devita Devita-C Accelerator, 1-Ounce]], and the combo of the two has been leaving me with smooth, clear</li>
            <li>I went to the dermatologist today, and I have a case of perioral dermititis, which is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had it.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a product with a higher retinol content than the ROC retinol</li>
            <li>Most people think I am younger than my age.</li>
            <li>So smooth so soft</li>
            <li>This will probably make your skin peel a lot at first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be cautioned that you should start with the lower levels and work up higher.</li>
            <li>I make teeny-tiny dots of the product on my forehead first and then rub in.</li>
            <li>But all good things come to those who wait and this retinol product is truly a five star gem, I am just too darn impatient.</li>
            <li>I still continue to wash my face there times per day (with Proactiv renewing cleanser which seems to work well for me) since I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d get some surface level blemishes if I didn&#x27;t, but the green cream has effectively eliminated the major cystic zit problem I was having.  </li>
            <li>I must have some kind of durable skin, because I did not experience any peeling, reddening etc: as the other reviewer did.</li>
            <li>so I really haven&#x27;t seen very much change as of yet.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and works as well, or better, than many other, more expensive products!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of retinol products out there, but I chose the green cream level 9 because it was so far the most potent.</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely across my face, and isn&#x27;t filled with perfumes or other potential irritants.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when my skin gets super sensitive</li>
            <li>Just be smart with it for certain, since your using this at home without a doctor&#x27;s supervision.ce frequency of use or consider stopping altogether.  </li>
            <li>Once I stepped up I finally began to see wrinkles become less prominent, and my acne more manageable.</li>
            <li>I took a suggestion from a woman at a salon and went straight to the highest level.  </li>
            <li>so I went straight to Level 9</li>
            <li>I should be ready to go to the Lvl. 9 soon.  </li>
            <li>but I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>, none of them really cured my acne.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li>I had recurrent acne in my body and nothing that I did, made much difference.  </li>
            <li>I was very reluctant to try again.</li>
            <li>I have used this product and it did absolutely nothing for my complexion or lines.</li>
            <li>I believe that there are even stronger formulas still available from Dr. Terezakis by prescription only, but this is sufficient for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to make a difference.</li>
            <li>While the Green Cream feels  nice on my skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything.</li>
            <li>There are far better retinol treatments on the market, especially for the amount that is paid for these products.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s been a slight diminishing of some very fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth.</li>
            <li>The price is also great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve had better results with other products.</li>
            <li>I will say that if you are new to a retinol this potent, you want to be careful with it.</li>
            <li>, I have no burning, no rawness just peeling but believe it or not I use MaryKay Microderm Abrasion and it sloughs off the dead skin and leaves it super smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to say that I have not had any large cystic zits around my jaw line since I&#x27;ve started rubbing a corn kernel sized dab of green cream onto my jaw line every night before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>I also use a retinol formula that is more gentle than green cream</li>
            <li>The acne that I&#x27;ve had since I was about 25 until recently was a deep, cystic variety that occurred mostly around my jaw line.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good level of retinol for me and seems to be doing what I want, repairing my skin and creating an occasional peel without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li>I am thinking the price is too high to pay for something that does  nothing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>**: M2 High Potency Skin Refresh 20%.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as a OTC retinol product without a prescription.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more natural than any other skin cream.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle and started using it, and much to my delight, my cystic acne completely went away.  </li>
            <li>so I got more green cream and use it when I want quicker results.</li>
            <li>I broke out, which is normal</li>
            <li>So make sure to apply BHA tones before applying Green Cream.</li>
            <li>Among the products that I tried and never had any true, long term success with were differin, epiduo, tazorac, benzefoam, aczone, and countless others.  </li>
            <li>this is what was most likely making my skin dry.</li>
            <li>I would caution that it is strong and if you have sensitive skin you have to be really careful.</li>
            <li>My skin got super smooth, pores and blackhead minimized, no more cystic acne!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a similar situation with acne problems of your own, I highly recommend you try out a bottle of green cream and see if it changes your life too.</li>
            <li>I will probably just finish the bottle I have now, and then go with a new copper cream I just bought.</li>
            <li>As a result, I began a new project on how to make some improvement and slowdown what is happening to my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s work from the bottom up to encourage new skin cell growth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used prescription Retin-A for about ten years, and credit it with keeping my skin smooth and relatively wrinkle-free.</li>
            <li>On nights that my skin feels especially dry, 30 minutes after Retinol or AHA application, I spread on a very light layer of German Nivea.</li>
            <li>This retinol cream is pretty gentle on the skin although I can&#x27;t use it every single night.  </li>
            <li>First time users, I would suggest to apply on face every other day for the first couple weeks, then if your skin doesn&#x27;t peel anymore, you can use it every night.</li>
            <li>initial peeling and breakouts were pretty severe and lasted about four months.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin so much better once I got past the peeling stage.</li>
            <li>think this product has one benefit that really gives it an edge over the competition with other retinol products: the bottle is specifically made to be air tight, so the retinol on the inside is never exposed to any air, which has a tendency to make it less potent (read up on retinol on wikipedia it for more details about potency and exposure to air).</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend staying far away from this product!</li>
            <li>It is very strong, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Green Cream in general has a high alcohol content, and I first became aware of this when I started using Level 9 and found out</li>
            <li>I have been using since I was 29 years old.</li>
            <li>but start using in the fall and all during winter/early spring when it does wonders for my skin as far as wrinkle reduction and skin smoothing is concerned.</li>
            <li>I have finally recovered, I am using the cream as directed, and my skin is looking much brighter.  </li>
            <li>The product does dry really quickly after being applied and doesn&#x27;t really feel like a cream once it is dry.</li>
            <li>I do tend to get blemishes once in a while even though I am 59 years old.</li>
            <li>This item has seemed to help with that problem so far.</li>
            <li>But overall I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old, and had completely lost all glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Now, after a couple months, the skin on my face is glowing and feels SO INCREDIBLY soft.</li>
            <li>I plan to update this at the 6 month mark, but so far out of all of it, the Green Cream made the most drastic difference to my skin appearance and texture overall.</li>
            <li>If you are new to retinols I would work up to Level 9, but if you&#x27;ve been using other brands you can go right to this one.</li>
            <li>I was previously using and this is one of the only ones available without a prescription.  </li>
            <li>I apply this in a similar manner to the Green Cream except that it is more fluid and seems to spread easier.</li>
            <li>I recommend you only use it every other day or less, because as I said, this is very strong, and your skin needs to get use to it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be frustrated it your skin tends to get sensitive at first because I swear to you this product is so worth it if you wait 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered my second bottle not knowing how long my first one was going to last, It&#x27;s going to be 2 months on 11/11/11</li>
            <li>I had used a different level but went up to the Level 9 as I have adult acne.  </li>
            <li>The cream did not get rid of them completely but definitely helped fade them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin became VERY red and pealed, like a sunburn, but the acne went away, and eventually the skin healed completely.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that on my neck I can do nightly applications without much irritation, so I suppose the neck is less sensitive.</li>
            <li>I did have some slight peeling at first</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely hard to treat, no pimples, just very congested, extremely oily, nose full of blackheads.</li>
            <li>This works to resurface the skin, but it is a different type of Alpha Hydroxy acid which activates and exfoliates the uppermost layers of skin cells, while the Retinol in the Green Creamis absorbed to do</li>
            <li>It works very well on my dark spots.  </li>
            <li>A bit harsh at first</li>
            <li>I suffered from acne since I was in high school, tried every hyped up product out there like proactive, bounced from one dermatologist to the other</li>
            <li>Use toner Allow to dry completely.</li>
            <li>I started out using the level 9 of the product and never had any problems (probably because I have pretty tough skin), but my girlfriend&#x27;s skin is too sensitive for the level 9, so if your skin is sensitive, you might want to start with the level 3 or</li>
            <li>My face was fire engine red and extremely sensitive to touch for two days, and now I have crepe-y looking and incredibly dry skin.</li>
            <li>The zits were so large and deep that they made my face swollen where they were, and they were very painful, but too deep under the surface of my skin for me to successfully pop.  </li>
            <li>The first week I used it, my skin got very tight - as if I had a sunburn</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s that good!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Best wishes to all you beautiful people out there!!!</li>
            <li> I would say all three levels are very good products, I just wish they would come up with something that will remove the flaking all together, and or something that hydrates the face during the peeling</li>
            <li> very good for controlling acne and acne scares.</li>
            <li> Great product and wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> Great vendor great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Retin-A and Retinol and this is easier on the skin with beautiful results.  </li>
            <li> After switching to the Lvl. 6, it has been great.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and have noticed a great improvement on my acne scars!!!!YAY</li>
            <li> Great peel effect.</li>
            <li> I did experience a 3 week period where my skin went through almost a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; from the product, but now I can honestly say, my face feels INCREDIBLE and remarkably improved.</li>
            <li> Dermatologists are amazed that my skin is so good for my age.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market because I&#x27;ve never had good skin.  </li>
            <li> When your peeling, use a good exfoliator and keep using the cream.  </li>
            <li> Using it 4 or 5 times a day is a good thing too.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see any good results either.</li>
            <li> Good product showing results in just weeks.</li>
            <li> You need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Along with this, the skin on my face didn&#x27;t feel good anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> :-D if you&#x27;ve never used retinol before try using the level 3 first and work your way up to it.</li>
            <li> I love this product..noticed results after a couple of days!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when it needs to be replaced!</li>
            <li> So I did my own research and learned about retinol.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best skincare product that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> The New Orleans dermatologists who came up with the formula were brilliant!</li>
            <li> ive used many retinols and i think this is better than skin medica tri retinol es!  </li>
            <li> It did a nice job smoothing out my fine lines and preventing acne.</li>
            <li> It feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> I wanted more results then what level 3 and 6 offer</li>
            <li> I will have to give it more time to see the results.</li>
            <li> I love the Glycolic Lotion and know it works.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products ever.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you wear your sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and I never looked any better.</li>
            <li> If I miss too many days, then you can tell.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li> This is about the most I can take at this point but will probably up it soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard copper peptides produce better results than retinol for thightening the skin, and diminishing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Make sure to start with level 3 or level 6.</li>
            <li> Some drying and peeling may occur but it will get better with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As retinols go it is my hands-down favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is a potent retinol cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product, purchased twice now...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every night for about 8 months and will keep using it until I find something that works better.</li>
            <li> skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the skin I always wanted but never knew how to get. :-)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> the years of use, I have received many compliments about the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> The company and product are both awesome, try their website, it is a true inspiration to learn about the quality ingredients and wonderful people and Doctors behind this gem of a product.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this kind of product!</li>
            <li> I am lucky to already have nice skin for my age</li>
            <li> I think it also helps me that I use a strong alpha-hydoxy acid peel pads once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> This one is just too strong to begin a treatment plan with.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a strong Alfa Hydroxy cream for awhile</li>
            <li> Well, the stuff is definitely strong, and I like that.</li>
            <li> If you do use these products, I strongly recommend you do as they say at start with a lower level.</li>
            <li> This is a strong product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how strong it was</li>
            <li> Retinol is a tried and true ingredient for better skin</li>
            <li> My girlfriend recommended that I try a retinol product, and she recommended this one to me since she&#x27;d heard that it was pretty effective.  </li>
            <li> I have notice subtle differences since my wife has started to use this product (plus happy wife &#x3D; happy life)</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and have always had acne prone skin until about 5 years ago when I started taking Perfect Oils (Omega 3, 6, 9 supplements from Nutritional Therapeutics  - I highly recommend).  </li>
            <li> much smoother healthy looking skin!</li>
            <li> My face seems to look so much healthier with a nice glow to it.  </li>
            <li> Any and all questions will be answered by browsing their fantastic site.</li>
            <li> and so I welcome the initial peeling that comes with that.</li>
            <li> Fantastic results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great product, and I will definitely be re-purchasing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels good so far</li>
            <li> and I advise all of you to start with the level 6 because it takes some time for the skin to get used to this product, don&#x27;t use level 9 first!!</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> Original Review</li>
            <li> I use a number of high quality skin products, visit a derm and plastic surgeon for micro and botox and generally take very good care of my appearance and my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a good light cream that makes your skin feel younger as you continue use.  </li>
            <li> I have had 2 fairly large horizontal neck rings for most of my life.</li>
            <li> Level 6 is a good product for daily use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken the advice of all dermatologists to use a good sun screen daily, which has become a habit -- rain or shine!</li>
            <li> If you are like me, make sure to apply a facial moisturizer after you apply this product, and make sure to use a moistorizing sunscreen product during the day.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin more sensitive to light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46, athletic, overall very healthy.  </li>
            <li> I Love the workin process of green cream, it made me feel a lot more confident than I was before,</li>
            <li> The peeling is because the cream is getting rid of all the dead skin to create new, more beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li> My whole face peeled like a sunburn when I used it a couple times because it was too strong.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 25 years, beginning when it was available as a prescription only from the outstanding dermatologist Dr. Nia Terezakis in New Orleans.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin, so even minor blemishes and discolorations are easily noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, be sure to just use it at night, since it does make you sensitive to sun.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a prescription for Retin-A many years ago, and this product works identically, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It looks dewy, fresh and glows.</li>
            <li> First week of using it my skin peeled a little and it was kind of irritated, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I have been using green cream for about a month along with MD Forte and my skin is clear bright and very smooth</li>
            <li> I am slowly getting the softening of fine lines, but after three bottles I was hoping for more recovery from breakouts and a better tone from discoloration by now.</li>
            <li> Today my skin absolutely glows; fine lines are practically non-existent &amp; I have gotten many comments about how much younger I look.</li>
            <li> it seems effective and keeps my aged skin smooth without too much wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love this product - bought my first bottle at my Derm&#x27;s office, now purchase on eBay, where I was able to score it for less than Amazon.</li>
            <li> fine lines are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just found out about Retinol recently and decided to go straight for a very strong cream.</li>
            <li> Apparently the other two did not go through when hitting the appropriate keys etc; I will not waste any more of my precious time if this one disappears into space.</li>
            <li> When I use it consistently after a scrub, my skin tone evens out and have fewer breakouts.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> The retinol content is much higher than anything I have found elsewhere.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more affordable and the results are similar.</li>
            <li> Overall my skin is clearer, smoother, with a more even tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very grateful that I found this product!</li>
            <li> Apply at night time only because it works better while you sleep.</li>
            <li> One pump of the cream applied over my face at night and my skin looks and feels better the next day.  </li>
            <li> When I went to the dermatologist with one of these deep cystic zits, she just lanced it, drained it, and injected it up with a steroid shot (not the most practical or helpful method of treatment since I was getting them</li>
            <li> Overall, this product has made my life better by relieving me of the burden I had with my cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> Since this cream came up several times on a skin-care forum I was looking at, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I really do love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> B000SAPE3A Devita Devita-C Accelerator, 1-Ounce]], and the combo of the two has been leaving me with smooth, clear</li>
            <li> I went to the dermatologist today, and I have a case of perioral dermititis, which is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had it.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a product with a higher retinol content than the ROC retinol</li>
            <li> Most people think I am younger than my age.</li>
            <li> So smooth so soft</li>
            <li> This will probably make your skin peel a lot at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be cautioned that you should start with the lower levels and work up higher.</li>
            <li> I make teeny-tiny dots of the product on my forehead first and then rub in.</li>
            <li> But all good things come to those who wait and this retinol product is truly a five star gem, I am just too darn impatient.</li>
            <li> I still continue to wash my face there times per day (with Proactiv renewing cleanser which seems to work well for me) since I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d get some surface level blemishes if I didn&#x27;t, but the green cream has effectively eliminated the major cystic zit problem I was having.  </li>
            <li> I must have some kind of durable skin, because I did not experience any peeling, reddening etc: as the other reviewer did.</li>
            <li> so I really haven&#x27;t seen very much change as of yet.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and works as well, or better, than many other, more expensive products!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of retinol products out there, but I chose the green cream level 9 because it was so far the most potent.</li>
            <li> It spreads nicely across my face, and isn&#x27;t filled with perfumes or other potential irritants.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when my skin gets super sensitive</li>
            <li> Just be smart with it for certain, since your using this at home without a doctor&#x27;s supervision.ce frequency of use or consider stopping altogether.  </li>
            <li> Once I stepped up I finally began to see wrinkles become less prominent, and my acne more manageable.</li>
            <li> I took a suggestion from a woman at a salon and went straight to the highest level.  </li>
            <li> so I went straight to Level 9</li>
            <li> I should be ready to go to the Lvl. 9 soon.  </li>
            <li> but I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> , none of them really cured my acne.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li> I had recurrent acne in my body and nothing that I did, made much difference.  </li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to try again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it did absolutely nothing for my complexion or lines.</li>
            <li> I believe that there are even stronger formulas still available from Dr. Terezakis by prescription only, but this is sufficient for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to make a difference.</li>
            <li> While the Green Cream feels  nice on my skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything.</li>
            <li> There are far better retinol treatments on the market, especially for the amount that is paid for these products.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s been a slight diminishing of some very fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> The price is also great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve had better results with other products.</li>
            <li> I will say that if you are new to a retinol this potent, you want to be careful with it.</li>
            <li> , I have no burning, no rawness just peeling but believe it or not I use MaryKay Microderm Abrasion and it sloughs off the dead skin and leaves it super smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to say that I have not had any large cystic zits around my jaw line since I&#x27;ve started rubbing a corn kernel sized dab of green cream onto my jaw line every night before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> I also use a retinol formula that is more gentle than green cream</li>
            <li> The acne that I&#x27;ve had since I was about 25 until recently was a deep, cystic variety that occurred mostly around my jaw line.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good level of retinol for me and seems to be doing what I want, repairing my skin and creating an occasional peel without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I am thinking the price is too high to pay for something that does  nothing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> **: M2 High Potency Skin Refresh 20%.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as a OTC retinol product without a prescription.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more natural than any other skin cream.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle and started using it, and much to my delight, my cystic acne completely went away.  </li>
            <li> so I got more green cream and use it when I want quicker results.</li>
            <li> I broke out, which is normal</li>
            <li> So make sure to apply BHA tones before applying Green Cream.</li>
            <li> Among the products that I tried and never had any true, long term success with were differin, epiduo, tazorac, benzefoam, aczone, and countless others.  </li>
            <li> this is what was most likely making my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I would caution that it is strong and if you have sensitive skin you have to be really careful.</li>
            <li> My skin got super smooth, pores and blackhead minimized, no more cystic acne!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a similar situation with acne problems of your own, I highly recommend you try out a bottle of green cream and see if it changes your life too.</li>
            <li> I will probably just finish the bottle I have now, and then go with a new copper cream I just bought.</li>
            <li> As a result, I began a new project on how to make some improvement and slowdown what is happening to my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s work from the bottom up to encourage new skin cell growth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used prescription Retin-A for about ten years, and credit it with keeping my skin smooth and relatively wrinkle-free.</li>
            <li> On nights that my skin feels especially dry, 30 minutes after Retinol or AHA application, I spread on a very light layer of German Nivea.</li>
            <li> This retinol cream is pretty gentle on the skin although I can&#x27;t use it every single night.  </li>
            <li> First time users, I would suggest to apply on face every other day for the first couple weeks, then if your skin doesn&#x27;t peel anymore, you can use it every night.</li>
            <li> initial peeling and breakouts were pretty severe and lasted about four months.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin so much better once I got past the peeling stage.</li>
            <li> think this product has one benefit that really gives it an edge over the competition with other retinol products: the bottle is specifically made to be air tight, so the retinol on the inside is never exposed to any air, which has a tendency to make it less potent (read up on retinol on wikipedia it for more details about potency and exposure to air).</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend staying far away from this product!</li>
            <li> It is very strong, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Green Cream in general has a high alcohol content, and I first became aware of this when I started using Level 9 and found out</li>
            <li> I have been using since I was 29 years old.</li>
            <li> but start using in the fall and all during winter/early spring when it does wonders for my skin as far as wrinkle reduction and skin smoothing is concerned.</li>
            <li> I have finally recovered, I am using the cream as directed, and my skin is looking much brighter.  </li>
            <li> The product does dry really quickly after being applied and doesn&#x27;t really feel like a cream once it is dry.</li>
            <li> I do tend to get blemishes once in a while even though I am 59 years old.</li>
            <li> This item has seemed to help with that problem so far.</li>
            <li> But overall I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old, and had completely lost all glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Now, after a couple months, the skin on my face is glowing and feels SO INCREDIBLY soft.</li>
            <li> I plan to update this at the 6 month mark, but so far out of all of it, the Green Cream made the most drastic difference to my skin appearance and texture overall.</li>
            <li> If you are new to retinols I would work up to Level 9, but if you&#x27;ve been using other brands you can go right to this one.</li>
            <li> I was previously using and this is one of the only ones available without a prescription.  </li>
            <li> I apply this in a similar manner to the Green Cream except that it is more fluid and seems to spread easier.</li>
            <li> I recommend you only use it every other day or less, because as I said, this is very strong, and your skin needs to get use to it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be frustrated it your skin tends to get sensitive at first because I swear to you this product is so worth it if you wait 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered my second bottle not knowing how long my first one was going to last, It&#x27;s going to be 2 months on 11/11/11</li>
            <li> I had used a different level but went up to the Level 9 as I have adult acne.  </li>
            <li> The cream did not get rid of them completely but definitely helped fade them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin became VERY red and pealed, like a sunburn, but the acne went away, and eventually the skin healed completely.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that on my neck I can do nightly applications without much irritation, so I suppose the neck is less sensitive.</li>
            <li> I did have some slight peeling at first</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely hard to treat, no pimples, just very congested, extremely oily, nose full of blackheads.</li>
            <li> This works to resurface the skin, but it is a different type of Alpha Hydroxy acid which activates and exfoliates the uppermost layers of skin cells, while the Retinol in the Green Creamis absorbed to do</li>
            <li> It works very well on my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> A bit harsh at first</li>
            <li> I suffered from acne since I was in high school, tried every hyped up product out there like proactive, bounced from one dermatologist to the other</li>
            <li> Use toner Allow to dry completely.</li>
            <li> I started out using the level 9 of the product and never had any problems (probably because I have pretty tough skin), but my girlfriend&#x27;s skin is too sensitive for the level 9, so if your skin is sensitive, you might want to start with the level 3 or</li>
            <li> My face was fire engine red and extremely sensitive to touch for two days, and now I have crepe-y looking and incredibly dry skin.</li>
            <li> The zits were so large and deep that they made my face swollen where they were, and they were very painful, but too deep under the surface of my skin for me to successfully pop.  </li>
            <li> The first week I used it, my skin got very tight - as if I had a sunburn</li>
            <li> If you are like me and complain that you shouldn&#x27;t have to fight wrinkles as well as periodic breakouts, then this is your new little friend.</li>
            <li> And if you live in a dry climate, you WILL have to apply some regular moisturizer an hour or so after applying the green cream.</li>
            <li> The first few nights I used it, I had some dryness/peeling skin in the morning, but my skin has since settled down, and I don&#x27;t get the dry patches that I do with Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to jump from one skincare line to another if results are not fast enough.</li>
            <li> , I spent literally enough money to buy a car over the years on products, dermatologists, and prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> I went through two cycles of accutane, tried four sessions of laser hair removal on my entire beard area, had four laser acne treatments as well, and spent tons of money and time going to the dermatologist and picking up prescriptions for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, Green cream  took care of it.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive products (like Replenix), but the results are truly with the Green Cream.</li>
            <li> This was the only change in my skincare routine, and the red bumps started as soon as I started using Green Cream six weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Green Cream for almost 2 months and you can see a vast improvement, pores are much smaller, less oil and</li>
            <li> After using Green Cream- Level 3 in the past, I was ready to move up to Level 9.  </li>
            <li> small pea-sized amount is all you need to cover your face, and I also use a tiny bit extra on my neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be patient and careful -</li>
            <li> This is number three review written from an email I received from Amazon asking me to review my recent purchase of Green Cream Level 9.</li>
            <li> and this was to be expected.</li>
            <li> has been about one of the only few products that I can tell is helping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it&#x27;s closer to a serum than a cream, not very hydrating.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> Although I no longer need to use the hydroquinone daily, I do use the green cream</li>
            <li> If occasional redness occurs, as it does on just one side of my neck, then rest the area for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am just about to purchase my 3rd bottle of Green Cream.</li>
            <li> After comparing several products, I took the plunge on AST Green Cream 9.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over seven months now and the improvement is only very very slight.</li>
            <li> Even when washing my face three times per day with expensive product, I would get one or two of these very large cystic zits per week.  </li>
            <li> This product burned my face after three uses (every other night, waiting thirty minutes after my face dried, not combining with other products, with a smaller than pea sized amount).</li>
            <li> But with this one product, all the other stuff can be thrown away.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times from this vendor it arrives every time with lightening speed - usually within one to two days.  </li>
            <li> I started in as the instructions recommend with applications every other night.</li>
            <li> took the advice of other reviewers who said that you can start with Level 9 if you&#x27;ve been using prescription Retin-A, and it has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 6-3-13:  This product ended up causing my skin to break out in small red bumps all over my face and chest.  </li>
            <li> EVERY OTHER NIGHT.</li>
            <li> it is very irritating at first.</li>
            <li> and I am tired of wasting my money on every new gimmick that comes down the pipeline.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of putting it too far under the chin and it seriously peeled the skin and caused irritation (itching for a few days).</li>
            <li> The results I did see were not worth the side effects and were not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;ll go back to using this product, as it at least did something.</li>
            <li> my usually oily skin began to dry out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a week and a half now.</li>
            <li> In fact, probably even less than retinol.</li>
            <li> I never really thought about until the last few years where they started to look darker, larger and unhappy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used prescription retinol products before with little irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using green cream about 7 years.  </li>
            <li> If you remove the dead outer skin cells it makes it easier for the green cream to penetrate.</li>
            <li> Green Cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Cream as part of</li>
            <li> but I missed the results of green cream</li>
            <li> Upon using Green Cream Level 9, there was a bit of breaking out</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re fair-skinned, this will tint your skin green.</li>
            <li> and sometimes the green would rub off onto my pillow case.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Cream since 2007.</li>
            <li> so I figured I could take the potency of Green Cream 9.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post again in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-14-12&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried retinol products from Skinceuticals, Peter Roth, Skin Medica, Roc and prescription Retin-A.  Green Cream beats them all.  </li>
            <li> &quot;, they just put green coloring in it.  </li>
            <li> GREEN CREAM</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but I&#x27;d rather not.</li>
            <li> I get a redness that&#x27;s not easy to camiflouge.  </li>
            <li> Softer and brighter without the peeling, dry, tight uncomfortable feeling left by some retinols (or worse, nothing at all.)  </li>
            <li> It was very dull and rough in texture.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I like that aspect of it.</li>
            <li> love that - hate waiting!  </li>
            <li> But no more than that.</li>
            <li> Expect results with Green Cream!</li>
            <li> have used it for the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I try to wait at least 10 minutes here before doing the Green Cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My (very few and small to begin with)</li>
            <li> I was prepared for that as a known side effect, especially because I have acne-prone sensitive skin, but the adjustment period exceeded my worst expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lately, my skin has felt so well</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will need to work up slowly to Level 9 or your skin will be virtually burned.  </li>
            <li> I tell my secret ~ Green Cream.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin that gets even drier in the cold months.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than the designer products, easier than a prescription.</li>
            <li> I thought it looked a little weird</li>
            <li> I applied this without moisturizing, and it was not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I apply this three days a week without fail.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase it again as it is useless</li>
            <li> If I use it casually</li>
            <li> I got this, started out using it twice a day, and within 5 days I looked like one of those villain&#x27;s dipped in some weird acid from a batman movie!  </li>
            <li> I had try another brand of Retinol in the past with disastrous consequences, my acne got so much worst.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it</li>
            <li> It was awful for me.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is a miracle worker.  When I use it consistently after a scrub, my skin tone evens out and have fewer breakouts. When you start out, start with lowest concentration every 2-3 days and then go to every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using green cream about 7 years.  I have fewer lines and wrinkles than I did when I started it-- at age 46.  Dermatologists are amazed that my skin is so good for my age.  I have had people peg me for 20 years younger than I am (though I personally don&#x27;t think I look *that* good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to work up slowly to Level 9 or your skin will be virtually burned.  It took me over a year to work up from Level 3 to Level 9.  I think it also helps me that I use a strong alpha-hydoxy acid peel pads once or twice a week.  If you remove the dead outer skin cells it makes it easier for the green cream to penetrate. And I use sun screen daily.</li>
            <li> it WORKS! I have been using since I was 29 years old. I am now going to be 46. No one believes my age. Be patient and careful - it is very irritating at first. But your skin adjusts.</li>
            <li> As a patient of the creator of this cream, I must say this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my skin. I have tried everything on the market because I&#x27;ve never had good skin.  But with this one product, all the other stuff can be thrown away.  Yes it does cause peeling but the key is keep using it!  The peeling is because the cream is getting rid of all the dead skin to create new, more beautiful skin.  When your peeling, use a good exfoliator and keep using the cream.  Dr. Terezakis says the key to using this cream is consistency.  Using it 4 or 5 times a day is a good thing too.</li>
            <li> I took a suggestion from a woman at a salon and went straight to the highest level.  While the Green Cream feels  nice on my skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything. I have been using it every night for two weeks. No drying, no peeling... no nothing.  I can&#x27;t say anything bad about it but I don&#x27;t see any good results either. I am thinking the price is too high to pay for something that does  nothing.</li>
            <li> After using Green Cream- Level 3 in the past, I was ready to move up to Level 9.  I use it to combat wrinkles from years of sun worshipping, but it also works on my teenage son&#x27;s breakouts! If you are like me and complain that you shouldn&#x27;t have to fight wrinkles as well as periodic breakouts, then this is your new little friend. It is amazing and works as well, or better, than many other, more expensive products!</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I have EVER bought for my face in my 35 years of life! My skin is extremely hard to treat, no pimples, just very congested, extremely oily, nose full of blackheads. I KNOW my skin so I went straight to Level 9, I have no burning, no rawness just peeling but believe it or not I use MaryKay Microderm Abrasion and it sloughs off the dead skin and leaves it super smooth. I&#x27;ve only been using Green Cream for almost 2 months and you can see a vast improvement, pores are much smaller, less oil and much smoother healthy looking skin! I ordered my second bottle not knowing how long my first one was going to last, It&#x27;s going to be 2 months on 11/11/11 and I haven&#x27;t opened the second bottle! I use once a day, nightime...best thing I have ever bought! Will use FOREVER!!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do.  I had to purchase a Lvl. 6 to start however.  This one is just too strong to begin a treatment plan with.  My whole face peeled like a sunburn when I used it a couple times because it was too strong.  After switching to the Lvl. 6, it has been great.  I should be ready to go to the Lvl. 9 soon.  My face seems to look so much healthier with a nice glow to it.  It feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Works for wrinkles and breakouts. I have bought it several times. Would recommend to anyone. I do not think I have bought it from Amazon, though.</li>
            <li> One of the best products on the market. You must build up from level 3, to level 6 and then use level 9 . Must adhere to skin recommendations. Good product showing results in just weeks.</li>
            <li> I stepped to level 9, after using level 6 for about eight months. Once I stepped up I finally began to see wrinkles become less prominent, and my acne more manageable. However, my skin became so red and irritated and my usually oily skin began to dry out. The results I did see were not worth the side effects and were not worth the money. Green Cream in general has a high alcohol content, and I first became aware of this when I started using Level 9 and found out this is what was most likely making my skin dry. There are far better retinol treatments on the market, especially for the amount that is paid for these products.</li>
            <li> Great product and wonderful results.  I&#x27;ve used Retin-A and Retinol and this is easier on the skin with beautiful results.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is number three review written from an email I received from Amazon asking me to review my recent purchase of Green Cream Level 9. Apparently the other two did not go through when hitting the appropriate keys etc; I will not waste any more of my precious time if this one disappears into space. Anyway, I am on number two bottle of level 9, I started last Fall with level 6. I must have some kind of durable skin, because I did not experience any peeling, reddening etc: as the other reviewer did. I am slowly getting the softening of fine lines, but after three bottles I was hoping for more recovery from breakouts and a better tone from discoloration by now. But all good things come to those who wait and this retinol product is truly a five star gem, I am just too darn impatient. I tend to jump from one skincare line to another if results are not fast enough. Green Cream is the real deal with quality based retinol and I will keep using it because I know I can get my desired results with continued use. The company and product are both awesome, try their website, it is a true inspiration to learn about the quality ingredients and wonderful people and Doctors behind this gem of a product. Any and all questions will be answered by browsing their fantastic site. I think I finally found my answer to all my skincare woes and I am sticking with this one. Retinol is a tried and true ingredient for better skin and I am tired of wasting my money on every new gimmick that comes down the pipeline. Yea!! Green Cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product - bought my first bottle at my Derm&#x27;s office, now purchase on eBay, where I was able to score it for less than Amazon. I know that some have issues with sensitivity, but I do not and so I give this a thumbs up. I do NOT use this at all during the summer when I&#x27;m out on the beach, etc. but start using in the fall and all during winter/early spring when it does wonders for my skin as far as wrinkle reduction and skin smoothing is concerned. I started at level 6, am now using level 9.</li>
            <li> I thought I had  \\&quot;tough\\&quot; skin because I used ROC for 2 months without any reaction.  I got this, started out using it twice a day, and within 5 days I looked like one of those villain&#x27;s dipped in some weird acid from a batman movie!  I have finally recovered, I am using the cream as directed, and my skin is looking much brighter.  The retinol content is much higher than anything I have found elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Cream as part of my night skin care for over 6 years.  it seems effective and keeps my aged skin smooth without too much wrinkles.</li>
            <li> If I use it often (3-4) times a week I get a redness that&#x27;s not easy to camiflouge.  If I use it casually (1-2) times a week I get flaking that intensifies when wearing foundation.  I was a user of level 3 for months and then the 6 so it&#x27;s not a question of adjusting to this strength.  I wanted more results then what level 3 and 6 offer and this is the reason I moved up to level 9.  I would say all three levels are very good products, I just wish they would come up with something that will remove the flaking all together, and or something that hydrates the face during the peeling process.&lt;br /&gt;With money getting tighter I think I may go back to ROC wrinkle cream or Olay ProX.  They&#x27;re more affordable and the results are similar.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about a week and a half now. I did have some slight peeling at first and this was to be expected. That is what you want the product to do! The product does dry really quickly after being applied and doesn&#x27;t really feel like a cream once it is dry. I am not sure that I like that aspect of it. I am lucky to already have nice skin for my age so I really haven&#x27;t seen very much change as of yet. I do tend to get blemishes once in a while even though I am 59 years old. This item has seemed to help with that problem so far. The jury is still out as to whether or not I will reorder this item. I will have to give it more time to see the results. I do use 10% Glycolic Lotion on my face in the mornings and this retinol product at night. I love the Glycolic Lotion and know it works.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products ever.  It goes to work immediately.  I also use a retinol formula that is more gentle than green cream but I missed the results of green cream so I got more green cream and use it when I want quicker results.</li>
            <li> Great price! I love this stuff! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had used a different level but went up to the Level 9 as I have adult acne.  It can be drying but I really like the product.  Level 6 is a good product for daily use.  Make sure you wear your sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am African-American with oily, combination skin and am prone to hyper-pigmentation after a blemish so I started using Retin-A on the advice of my dermatologist. I broke out, which is normal but I was told it would stop. After 4 months it did not; it caused skin darkening and peeling and I never looked any better. Not to mention, I broke out in areas that were not even problem areas for my skin. Upon using Green Cream Level 9, there was a bit of breaking out but it cleared up and the resulting marks have faded in the fastest time I have ever seen. Overall my skin is clearer, smoother, with a more even tone. The price is also great and a little goes a long way. I have used more expensive products (like Replenix), but the results are truly with the Green Cream. I would caution that it is strong and if you have sensitive skin you have to be really careful. I made the mistake of putting it too far under the chin and it seriously peeled the skin and caused irritation (itching for a few days). But overall I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks and have noticed a great improvement on my acne scars!!!!YAY Im so happy.&lt;br /&gt;This has been about one of the only few products that I can tell is helping. Definitely something you should try if you have&lt;br /&gt;acne scars and are trying to get rid of. A bit pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> This is seriously a miracle cream. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost two years now. I use it after i wash my face with a glycolic acid cleanser every night. Sometimes when my skin gets super sensitive I use it every other night. I&#x27;m very grateful that I found this product! I suffered from acne since I was in high school, tried every hyped up product out there like proactive, bounced from one dermatologist to the other, none of them really cured my acne. So I did my own research and learned about retinol. There&#x27;s a lot of retinol products out there, but I chose the green cream level 9 because it was so far the most potent. I did start with the level 6 and I advise all of you to start with the level 6 because it takes some time for the skin to get used to this product, don&#x27;t use level 9 first!! try 6 then after you&#x27;re done but the level 9. First time users, I would suggest to apply on face every other day for the first couple weeks, then if your skin doesn&#x27;t peel anymore, you can use it every night. Apply at night time only because it works better while you sleep. First week of using it my skin peeled a little and it was kind of irritated, but it&#x27;s ok it&#x27;s supposed to do that! Don&#x27;t be frustrated it your skin tends to get sensitive at first because I swear to you this product is so worth it if you wait 2 weeks!!! My skin got super smooth, pores and blackhead minimized, no more cystic acne! wrinkles gone! OMG i would die without this product! Buy it now!!!</li>
            <li> Every time I am complemented on my skin I tell my secret ~ Green Cream.  The New Orleans dermatologists who came up with the formula were brilliant!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used alpha hydroxy acids and retinol before, so I did see results from this. It did a nice job smoothing out my fine lines and preventing acne. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it&#x27;s closer to a serum than a cream, not very hydrating. If you have dry skin this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you. Also, if you&#x27;re fair-skinned, this will tint your skin green. I thought it looked a little weird and sometimes the green would rub off onto my pillow case. Not a huge deal, but I&#x27;d rather not.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times from this vendor it arrives every time with lightening speed - usually within one to two days.  love that - hate waiting!  Great vendor great stuff!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said retinol and vitamin c serum are the best things I can use on my face.  This green cream is much cheaper than buying the prescription retinol.  It works very well on my dark spots.  I have been using it for years.  Hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I apply this three days a week without fail. If I miss too many days, then you can tell. It keeps my skin tone even, and I think even adds a glow. And there&#x27;s the extra benefit of helping with breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be sure to just use it at night, since it does make you sensitive to sun. And if you live in a dry climate, you WILL have to apply some regular moisturizer an hour or so after applying the green cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using Green Cream since 2007. I love the way it makes my skin feel and look. I will always use this product.</li>
            <li> I just found out about Retinol recently and decided to go straight for a very strong cream. I have been using a strong Alfa Hydroxy cream for awhile so I figured I could take the potency of Green Cream 9. Well, the stuff is definitely strong, and I like that. I want to see results and so I welcome the initial peeling that comes with that. I started in as the instructions recommend with applications every other night. This is about the most I can take at this point but will probably up it soon. I have noticed that on my neck I can do nightly applications without much irritation, so I suppose the neck is less sensitive. I had gotten a prescription for Retin-A many years ago, and this product works identically, as far as I can tell. So save yourself a trip to the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;Update 9-2-2011&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over seven months now and the improvement is only very very slight. There&#x27;s been a slight diminishing of some very fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth. But no more than that. I&#x27;m a little disappointed. I will probably just finish the bottle I have now, and then go with a new copper cream I just bought. I&#x27;ve heard copper peptides produce better results than retinol for thightening the skin, and diminishing wrinkles. We&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;ll post again in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-14-12&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;Eh, save your money, copper peptide creams and serums don&#x27;t do a lot either. In fact, probably even less than retinol. I suppose I&#x27;ll go back to using this product, as it at least did something.</li>
            <li> I have been using green cream for about a month along with MD Forte and my skin is clear bright and very smooth now it cleared up all my break out I just can&#x27;t believe it this cream is the truth</li>
            <li> very good for controlling acne and acne scares. Make sure to start with level 3 or level 6. Some drying and peeling may occur but it will get better with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol by itself does not hear acne. So make sure to apply BHA tones before applying Green Cream.</li>
            <li> I have tried retinol products from Skinceuticals, Peter Roth, Skin Medica, Roc and prescription Retin-A.  Green Cream beats them all.  One pump of the cream applied over my face at night and my skin looks and feels better the next day.  Softer and brighter without the peeling, dry, tight uncomfortable feeling left by some retinols (or worse, nothing at all.)  I&#x27;m 46, athletic, overall very healthy.  I use a number of high quality skin products, visit a derm and plastic surgeon for micro and botox and generally take very good care of my appearance and my skin.  This stuff is the real deal.  As retinols go it is my hands-down favorite.  If you are new to retinols I would work up to Level 9, but if you&#x27;ve been using other brands you can go right to this one.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best skincare product that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has transformed my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now.  I started with Level 3 and worked my way up to Level 9.  Fantastic results.</li>
            <li> This is a potent retinol cream. It spreads nicely across my face, and isn&#x27;t filled with perfumes or other potential irritants. I will say that if you are new to a retinol this potent, you want to be careful with it. I have always had dry skin that gets even drier in the cold months. I applied this without moisturizing, and it was not good. If you are like me, make sure to apply a facial moisturizer after you apply this product, and make sure to use a moistorizing sunscreen product during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used prescription retinol products before with little irritation. This product burned my face after three uses (every other night, waiting thirty minutes after my face dried, not combining with other products, with a smaller than pea sized amount). My face was fire engine red and extremely sensitive to touch for two days, and now I have crepe-y looking and incredibly dry skin. I&#x27;m 30 and look 45. Trying to reverse the damage with vitamin E. I thought because I had used prescription retinol products before, I could start at level 9 but that was not the case. If you do use these products, I strongly recommend you do as they say at start with a lower level.</li>
            <li> Love this product, purchased twice now...  everyone says I look younger and my face is smoother! AND when you look younger you feel younger!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over a year.  I am 64 years old, and had completely lost all glow to my skin.  Today my skin absolutely glows; fine lines are practically non-existent &amp; I have gotten many comments about how much younger I look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since last spring, and I wanted to wait a while before writing a review to see how it worked out for me beyond an initial \\&quot;honeymoon\\&quot; period.  I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s time to finally write a review, and I must say, and this is not an exaggeration, that this product has changed my life.  I&#x27;m a man in my 30s who has suffered from acne since I was about 16.  The acne that I&#x27;ve had since I was about 25 until recently was a deep, cystic variety that occurred mostly around my jaw line.  Even when washing my face three times per day with expensive product, I would get one or two of these very large cystic zits per week.  The zits were so large and deep that they made my face swollen where they were, and they were very painful, but too deep under the surface of my skin for me to successfully pop.  When I went to the dermatologist with one of these deep cystic zits, she just lanced it, drained it, and injected it up with a steroid shot (not the most practical or helpful method of treatment since I was getting them so frequently).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I spent literally enough money to buy a car over the years on products, dermatologists, and prescriptions.  I went through two cycles of accutane, tried four sessions of laser hair removal on my entire beard area, had four laser acne treatments as well, and spent tons of money and time going to the dermatologist and picking up prescriptions for my skin. Among the products that I tried and never had any true, long term success with were differin, epiduo, tazorac, benzefoam, aczone, and countless others.  Nothing really worked.  I&#x27;d gone to three different dermatologists over the years, and for some reason, none of them had recommended any form of retinol. My girlfriend recommended that I try a retinol product, and she recommended this one to me since she&#x27;d heard that it was pretty effective.  I bought a bottle and started using it, and much to my delight, my cystic acne completely went away.  I&#x27;m glad to say that I have not had any large cystic zits around my jaw line since I&#x27;ve started rubbing a corn kernel sized dab of green cream onto my jaw line every night before going to bed.  I still continue to wash my face there times per day (with Proactiv renewing cleanser which seems to work well for me) since I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d get some surface level blemishes if I didn&#x27;t, but the green cream has effectively eliminated the major cystic zit problem I was having.  I started out using the level 9 of the product and never had any problems (probably because I have pretty tough skin), but my girlfriend&#x27;s skin is too sensitive for the level 9, so if your skin is sensitive, you might want to start with the level 3 or 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product has one benefit that really gives it an edge over the competition with other retinol products: the bottle is specifically made to be air tight, so the retinol on the inside is never exposed to any air, which has a tendency to make it less potent (read up on retinol on wikipedia it for more details about potency and exposure to air). Overall, this product has made my life better by relieving me of the burden I had with my cystic acne.  If you&#x27;re in a similar situation with acne problems of your own, I highly recommend you try out a bottle of green cream and see if it changes your life too.</li>
            <li> This cream is not a miracle worker but it does deliver visible results. I&#x27;ve been using it every night for about 8 months and will keep using it until I find something that works better. I&#x27;d give it about 3.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is more even. I have very light skin, so even minor blemishes and discolorations are easily noticeable. The cream did not get rid of them completely but definitely helped fade them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My (very few and small to begin with) fine lines are completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial peeling and breakouts were pretty severe and lasted about four months.  I was prepared for that as a known side effect, especially because I have acne-prone sensitive skin, but the adjustment period exceeded my worst expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream did nothing for my nasolabial folds or forehead lines - I&#x27;ve had better results with other products.</li>
            <li> This retinol cream is pretty gentle on the skin although I can&#x27;t use it every single night.  Expect results with Green Cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used prescription Retin-A for about ten years, and credit it with keeping my skin smooth and relatively wrinkle-free. Since my insurance doesn&#x27;t cover it, however, I thought I&#x27;d look for an alternative product.  Since this cream came up several times on a skin-care forum I was looking at, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I really do love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the advice of other reviewers who said that you can start with Level 9 if you&#x27;ve been using prescription Retin-A, and it has worked well for me. The first few nights I used it, I had some dryness/peeling skin in the morning, but my skin has since settled down, and I don&#x27;t get the dry patches that I do with Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small pea-sized amount is all you need to cover your face, and I also use a tiny bit extra on my neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mornings, I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B000SAPE3A Devita Devita-C Accelerator, 1-Ounce]], and the combo of the two has been leaving me with smooth, clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great product, and I will definitely be re-purchasing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 6-3-13:  This product ended up causing my skin to break out in small red bumps all over my face and chest.  I went to the dermatologist today, and I have a case of perioral dermititis, which is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had it.  This was the only change in my skincare routine, and the red bumps started as soon as I started using Green Cream six weeks ago.  I now have to take an oral antibiotic and a topical one for six weeks.  If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend staying far away from this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 month.  I am 53 years old and have always had acne prone skin until about 5 years ago when I started taking Perfect Oils (Omega 3, 6, 9 supplements from Nutritional Therapeutics  - I highly recommend).  I do not intend to have plastic surgery and am opting to use anti aging products instead.  I&#x27;ve done alot of research and it all points to the use of a product with retinol.  I was looking for a product with a higher retinol content than the ROC retinol I was previously using and this is one of the only ones available without a prescription.  This is a strong product.  I put it on my eye lids and they got red so be careful. The first week I used it, my skin got very tight - as if I had a sunburn but I didn&#x27;t peel.  I had to use alot of extra moisturizer.  My skin feels good so far but I am going to wait another month then I will update my review.</li>
            <li> This is Awesome.  I had recurrent acne in my body and nothing that I did, made much difference.  I had try another brand of Retinol in the past with disastrous consequences, my acne got so much worst.  I was very reluctant to try again. I was pleasantly surprised, Green cream  took care of it. It is very strong, so a little goes a long way. My skin became VERY red and pealed, like a sunburn, but the acne went away, and eventually the skin healed completely. I recommend you only use it every other day or less, because as I said, this is very strong, and your skin needs to get use to it.  I also used sunscreen and avoided the sun as much as possible.</li>
            <li> I am now 68 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for the past 10 years.  Most people think I am younger than my age.</li>
            <li> ive used many retinols and i think this is better than skin medica tri retinol es!  i will buy this again.</li>
            <li> A bit harsh at first I didn&#x27;t realize how strong it was but once you adjust to it it&#x27;s like it peeled my skin off and replaced it with a fat babies skin. So smooth so soft it&#x27;s the skin I always wanted but never knew how to get. :-) it does take a while to get used to but it&#x27;s worth it. I love it and I will def buy again! :-D if you&#x27;ve never used retinol before try using the level 3 first and work your way up to it. It does make your skin more sensitive to light so use a sunblock in the summer time.</li>
            <li> AWESOME  RESULTS! I Love the workin process of green cream, it made me feel a lot more confident than I was before, Thanks to this kind of product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Best I&#x27;ve used. Great peel effect.</li>
            <li> This is a good light cream that makes your skin feel younger as you continue use.  I have notice subtle differences since my wife has started to use this product (plus happy wife &#x3D; happy life)</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it did absolutely nothing for my complexion or lines. I would not purchase it again as it is useless</li>
            <li> This will probably make your skin peel a lot at first. It was awful for me. You need a good moisturizer. It made my skin so much better once I got past the peeling stage. Cleared up acne, pores look smaller, skin just fresher and brighter altogether.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it&#x27;s a good level of retinol for me and seems to be doing what I want, repairing my skin and creating an occasional peel without being too harsh.  Less expensive than the designer products, easier than a prescription. One caveat: it&#x27;s not \\&quot;green\\&quot; as in \\&quot;organic\\&quot; or \\&quot;environmentally neutral\\&quot;, they just put green coloring in it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more natural than any other skin cream.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 25 years, beginning when it was available as a prescription only from the outstanding dermatologist Dr. Nia Terezakis in New Orleans. I believe that there are even stronger formulas still available from Dr. Terezakis by prescription only, but this is sufficient for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years of use, I have received many compliments about the appearance of my skin. This product has helped me control my hyper-pigmentation in conjunction with 4% hydroquinone. Although I no longer need to use the hydroquinone daily, I do use the green cream nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be cautioned that you should start with the lower levels and work up higher. If occasional redness occurs, as it does on just one side of my neck, then rest the area for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have taken the advice of all dermatologists to use a good sun screen daily, which has become a habit -- rain or shine!</li>
            <li> I love this product..noticed results after a couple of days! I will be ordering more when it needs to be replaced!</li>
            <li> *****9 MONTH UPDATE***** I am just about to purchase my 3rd bottle of Green Cream. This cream has been the best product I have ever used on my face. It looks dewy, fresh and glows. The surface is softer to touch and brighter overall. The 2 bottles have lasted me 9 months!!!!!! You don&#x27;t need much to make a difference. It&#x27;s that good!!!!!  *****Original Review***** I have had 2 fairly large horizontal neck rings for most of my life. I never really thought about until the last few years where they started to look darker, larger and unhappy. Along with this, the skin on my face didn&#x27;t feel good anymore. It was very dull and rough in texture. As a result, I began a new project on how to make some improvement and slowdown what is happening to my skin. After comparing several products, I took the plunge on AST Green Cream 9. I did experience a 3 week period where my skin went through almost a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; from the product, but now I can honestly say, my face feels INCREDIBLE and remarkably improved. I wish I had started with this 5 years ago.  1) Remove makeup  2) Use hands to wash face and neck with a cleanser 3) Use toner Allow to dry completely. I try to wait at least 10 minutes here before doing the Green Cream. 4) GREEN CREAM NO. 9. EVERY OTHER NIGHT. Squeeze out a pea size. I make teeny-tiny dots of the product on my forehead first and then rub in. Moving to the cheeks, nose, chin and finally neck (especially the rings!!!) as I rotate around my face and rub in. I do not put this on my eyelid area but do apply on the under eye area above my cheekbones. If I have ANY left over, I rub this into the back of my hands. ****ALTERNATE NIGHTS*****: M2 High Potency Skin Refresh 20%. I apply this in a similar manner to the Green Cream except that it is more fluid and seems to spread easier. This works to resurface the skin, but it is a different type of Alpha Hydroxy acid which activates and exfoliates the uppermost layers of skin cells, while the Retinol in the Green Creamis absorbed to do it&#x27;s work from the bottom up to encourage new skin cell growth.  5) On nights that my skin feels especially dry, 30 minutes after Retinol or AHA application, I spread on a very light layer of German Nivea. Only the German Nivea tin which is closest to begin La Mer, without the price tag. I also sometimes use the Waxelene or even Coconut oil, depending upon my mood. Lately, my skin has felt so well, I have gone to bed without a layer of moisturizer.  Now, after a couple months, the skin on my face is glowing and feels SO INCREDIBLY soft. It feels like my much younger face and I my neck rings have lightened. I plan to update this at the 6 month mark, but so far out of all of it, the Green Cream made the most drastic difference to my skin appearance and texture overall. I highly recommend it as a OTC retinol product without a prescription. Just be smart with it for certain, since your using this at home without a doctor&#x27;s supervision.ce frequency of use or consider stopping altogether.  Best wishes to all you beautiful people out there!!!</li>
