            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this lotion!! It really moisturizes your skin, leaving it smooth as silk. And it smells so good! I use it everyday after my bath. This lotion is also fairly priced, making it affordable. I highly recommend &#x27;Spirit For Women&#x27; body lotion, by Antonio Banderas!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great quality. I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like it because it goes on with a very strong scent. After an hour you smell a light, lovely smell. So Antonio is a keeper,</li>
            <li> And I also love the lotion just as much! I use both after the shower and always get compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Scent is GREAT GREAT..LAST LONG..LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I received a tube that was one quarter empty, not sure if someone squeezed some out of it prior to shipping. This lotion is watery, scent does not last at all, not sure if it was diluted somehow.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this lotion, I get so many vompliments on it when I wear it.</li>
            <li> It has an aunty smell. I thought it would smell more luscious and sweet and fresh but it&#x27;s just very perfumey. If ur like 40-50 this scent is for u.</li>
            <li> Blind purchase. The price was right and I gave it a chance. Didn&#x27;t like it at first, but it&#x27;s growing on me. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. it smells wonderful. and it is especially good for summer as it has a cooling effect as you apply it. not at all greasy, more of a gel feeling.</li>
            <li> This lotion is absolutely heaven - leaves my skin so smooth and silky where it was so very dry before.</li>
            <li> lo recomeindo ampliamente, pueden comprar con confianza, el articulo fue el esperado o solicitado, la compra se efectuo sin problemas, el articulo llego en el tiempo estimado, sin contratiempos.</li>
            <li> My likes in fragrances has just had this added to the top of the list.  If you like fragrances from Spain or the Mediteranean, then you will find this absolutely wonderful and feminine.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife because it&#x27;s Antonio Banderas and she loves it.</li>
            <li> My Wife had previously received this product as a gift and could not find it in local shops. The tube she had was almost empty.I found it on Amazon and shipment was quick and well packaged and she uses it daily. We agree that it has a wonderful scent and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Smell so good on my hands and my clothes.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, but I could only smell when I put it on.  Even on going outside shortly afterwards there was no scent left.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to soften your skin either so it is just a short lived scent.  Like it enough not to send it back, but if you are looking for a scent to stay with you during the day - this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
