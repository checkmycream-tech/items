            <li>This is perfect.</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>I think this would be awesome to add sparkle to any polish for a fancy celebration or just a night out on the town.  </li>
            <li>;, so it adds the slightest hint of shimmer to nail polish (IMO best for matte colours).</li>
            <li>I give this polish a 5 star rating because it is just beautiful!</li>
            <li>My favorite color!!!</li>

            <li>Best when put on top of a darker polish!</li>
            <li>The best glitter top coat ever!</li>
            <li>It is a great addition to any shade of polish.</li>
            <li>This is the best glitter topcoat I own.</li>
            <li>Great Formula</li>
            <li>Works great over any color or by its self.</li>
            <li>But like I said, fairy dust is a great nail polish.</li>
            <li>Still a great nail polish alone or paired with another color.</li>
            <li>Great for a swag nail.</li>
            <li>This is a great polish.  </li>
            <li>Great solution for aging nails.  </li>
            <li>It will work great over any color.</li>
            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy.</li>
            <li>The formula is great too; I just use one coat over whatever polish I&#x27;m using, but you could also wear it alone.</li>
            <li>Love this!!</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love glitter?!!</li>
            <li>The very fine holo glitter is beautiful!!</li>
            <li>The glitter is amazing!</li>
            <li>However, that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me because the shimmer is just amazing!</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful glitter top coat!</li>
            <li>&quot; Kristin, I hope you don&#x27;t mind me plagiarizing your excellent and accurate</li>
            <li>Honestly I bought the summer colors from China glaze in matte and have not been happy with those either.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been looking for a really good holographic glitter....</li>
            <li>one with good color,  but not too chunky</li>
            <li>Good polish, not as shiny of a glittery coat as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a great top coat for any color.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this polish!</li>
            <li>then hurry up because you will fall in love!</li>
            <li>Love, Hugs, &amp; Butterfly Kisses!</li>
            <li>My favorite glitter nail polish!</li>
            <li>I totally love this polish!</li>
            <li>The sparkles are so fantastic!!</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite nail polish of all time!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this polish!</li>
            <li>and I am glad to have it!</li>
            <li>I am in love!  </li>
            <li>i wear it on top of every polish!</li>
            <li>I love the sparkles and the shimmers!</li>
            <li>Am glad i purchased it!</li>
            <li>Lovely polish!</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FAVORITE GLITTER POLISH EVER!</li>
            <li>You can wear it alone on your nails or paint on top of your polish to give it spark!</li>
            <li>I surely would recommend getting your hands on this polish!</li>
            <li>but this is really amazing holo glitter.....</li>
            <li>The polish is amazing and glides on like butter.</li>
            <li>Adds a nice glimmer to your nail and like someone said</li>
            <li>Nice alone or over any color.</li>
            <li>THIS IS NICE COLOR.</li>
            <li>It got here on time, it is even more gorgeous than I imagined.</li>
            <li>But this is sensational top coat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been discontinued, love that i&#x27;m able to find it on here!</li>
            <li>Love the fairy dust as a top coat!</li>
            <li>Against my better judgement, I ordered this product hoping for Glistening Snow, but I received fairy dust, which I already own.  </li>
            <li>I have bought budget polish I liked just as well or better in the silver glitter style.  </li>
            <li>but i love it best wearing it on top of all my polishes its real glittery but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sparkly and holographic and adds an amazing, magic quality over any colour.</li>
            <li>Love, love love!</li>
            <li>It goes on clean with a fairly even distribution of the sparkles.</li>
            <li>I really like it and it lasts and covers beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It was EXACTLY what I wanted, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>I bought this to dress up regular polish but it also looks great on it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li>I slapped it on a bare nail, and loved it... then slapped it over \\&quot;For Audrey\\&quot; and it looks great as a top coat too.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>The seller wrapped each bottle in the bubble wrap, so it arrived safely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, I tried Fairy Dust and it is a lovely glitter top coat as well,</li>
            <li>Love China Glaze Nail Polish.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>Love the nail polish</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s sparkly without being overkill.</li>
            <li>I can see myself going through many bottles of this since I plan to use it a lot.</li>
            <li>, most of the store brands just didn&#x27;t cut it....</li>
            <li>You can go to any chain store and do better.</li>
            <li>I love the way it sparkles in the sunlight</li>
            <li>This is more of an overcoat.</li>
            <li>Looks exceptionally wonderful in top of blue&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this glitter.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite &amp;#34;diva&amp;#34; polish at the moment</li>
            <li>I love the color, it is so fairy.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely scattered holographic coat.</li>
            <li>and im glad i found it here</li>
            <li>I really love china glaze polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this polish.</li>
            <li>Love the shine.</li>
            <li>IS CUTE 2 COATS</li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better in person than in the swatches I had seen online.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can use it on pretty much ANY color and it will look great!!</li>
            <li>This is a lovely very fine glitter (pics can&#x27;t seem to capture how well light catches the rainbow nature).</li>
            <li>The glitter is very fine and goes on evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This polish would be great if you wanted a clear topcoat.</li>
            <li>This polish is discontinured and it is the perfect polish to add to your collection to make other colors that you already have pop.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered it and hoped for the best since I was already getting other polishes from this seller.  </li>
            <li>this is one of those glitters that is best used to enhance other glitters.  </li>
            <li>The seller packaged it very carefully and it got to me perfect.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have several that I love, but this one isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to remove for a glitter polish.</li>
            <li>This looks so beautiful when outside in the sunshine</li>
            <li>It is perfect to use as an accent coat over dark polish</li>
            <li>Firstly, it&#x27;s China Glaze (and I understand why so many people love this brand).</li>
            <li>Mild sparkle with one coat, lovely glimmer with two, tons of bling with three.</li>
            <li>I really think this is a cute polish, best suited for accenting a color or as a single coat all by itself.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect glitter to add some sparkle without looking like a little child.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fine glitter, very sparkly, distributes evenly, and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I even read another review from another customer stating this same thing, but everyone else seemed happy with their product</li>
            <li>This is so fun for a top coat to liven up any shade.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a light amount of glitter in the nail polish because it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>and I enjoy the effect that it makes when I do that.  </li>
            <li>Just one coat over any color adds a nice holographic type glitter but not too much.  </li>
            <li>Looks great over regular polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably strong, but required a couple of coats for coverage and the color is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Gives just the right amount of sparkle to any color of nail polish when used as a top coat.</li>
            <li>it arrived kinda below the fill line already, but overall,  i love this polish!!</li>
            <li>It comes off very easy as well, which is always a problem I have with glitter that has large pieces.  </li>
            <li>You still get the typical glitter feel, but that can and should be masked by a good top coat!</li>
            <li>I think this is my new favorite glitter top coat.</li>
            <li>what it does for me is give any glitter a more consistent look and some depth.  </li>
            <li>I got this to put over the fun colors I use on my nieces!</li>
            <li>I love this polish so much that I stocked up!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so much fun to look at!</li>
            <li>I find all of the China Glaze nail polishes to be great and long wearing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of most glitters, especially the ones with larger bits, so this is great!</li>
            <li>microfine glitter...dries quickly and relatively smooth....</li>
            <li>it catches the light a million different ways and looks good over any color.</li>
            <li>Love this - it will be perfect over my blah creme colors like white and light pink, or even for the holidays!</li>
            <li>It holds up almost as well as my other favored brand of nail polish does and is house work friendly.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I love this polish sooo much</li>
            <li>The formulation is good, it dries well, and adds an extra element to just about any color.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a clear coat, you cannot use it on its own.</li>
            <li>Nope, they gave me a stamping plate instead, which I love, but I really, really wanted this polish.</li>
            <li>so I recommend Seche Vite top coat for a nice, shiny and quick dry!</li>
            <li>I especially love this over french tip manicures as it makes it more interesting, but still subtle.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth on the surface that I didn&#x27;t even need a clear top coat.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was quick as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute but like most glitter polishes, will need a specific color underneath.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited and used it right away.</li>
            <li>Too micro-fine to really be considered a &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34;, removes like a regular polish (not gritty), and looks great over every color cream polish you own.</li>
            <li>I have applied it over three different colors so far and the results are consistently beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Gives a pretty holigraphic like glow!  </li>
            <li>Lovely clear, glittery coat!  </li>
            <li>Very sparkly, very pretty!</li>
            <li>it was likely not an honest mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it looked like it had been used because it was exactly quite full either.</li>
            <li>I don;t feel this was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Its not crazy glittery where u can wear it by itself</li>
            <li>You do need to put a clear top coat over this to make the glitter effect pop.</li>
            <li>When I first used it as a top coat I didn&#x27;t see much sparkle, but when I went outside on my terrace the sparkle was much more radiant.  </li>
            <li>they get it right.</li>
            <li>but I did it, and got some positive comments!  </li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t in stock, wasn&#x27;t notified til later, love this polish, put it on top of all my colors .it doesn&#x27;t feel rough when top coat is put on.</li>
            <li>THE SHIPPING IS SUPER DUPER FAST</li>
            <li>so pretty in just one coat.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to the \\&quot;Northern Lights\\&quot; topcoats you see but more glitter</li>
            <li>I have left a review in the appropriate seller feedback location as well.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a a more solid color.</li>
            <li>I really love how the tiny particles are uniform as well as holographic and spread evenly over the nail.  </li>
            <li>Im willing to make.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this.  </li>
            <li>THIS COLOR IS SO PRETTY BUY IT</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m willing to put up with that for the effect it gives on even the lightest polish.</li>
            <li>Outside, the sparkle is pretty intense and beautiful, and inside it looks more subtle.  </li>
            <li>It is basically clear polish with lots of amazing tiny glitter that sparkles and shines.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other glitter polishes that I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and comes off with regular nail remover.</li>
            <li>This glitter is beautiful but it takes FOREVER to dry and it was super thick.</li>
            <li>it just isn&#x27;t the Stainless steel color I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this wasn&#x27;t going to be just another glitter nail polish.</li>
            <li>I personally highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much because it will bubble.</li>
            <li>It really does look like you have fairy dust on your nails.</li>
            <li>It is fast drying</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too much glitter.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that it is much easier to remove than glitter polish.  </li>
            <li>thanks guys</li>
            <li>My whole nail is covered in glitter.</li>
            <li>If someone can email me or something, I&#x27;d really like to have the polish I paid for.</li>
            <li>It really dresses up the nails without looking tacky.</li>
            <li>Very afforable.</li>
            <li>HAHA</li>
            <li>for buying it through this seller, that also went better than expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sad this is discontinued, because it is the fave sparkle top coat I own.    </li>
            <li>It even looks nice on plain nails.</li>
            <li>This is a very subtle glitter polish, it looks great over any color of polish.</li>
            <li>One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the fast shipping and the polish I got, only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the consistency.</li>
            <li>The polish shows up on both dark and light colors!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a leap of faith to wear sparkling polish as an older woman (I&#x27;m 66) -</li>
            <li>It arrived on the third or fourth day, nicely packaged and unharmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets in buying this polish, and recommend everyone else does too!</li>
            <li>This polish gives such a pretty sparkle to your polish!</li>
            <li>It is glittery without looking childish and does not require more than one coat.</li>
            <li>In fact, I am going to actually go order another one right now because mine is almost out.  </li>
            <li>I actually found this exact nail polish at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply... confirming my point that this nail polish is not discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The polish itself is pretty thick and to me, there is just the right amount of sparklies!</li>
            <li>Fairy Dust is a clear coat with multi-colored micro-glitter.  </li>
            <li>The color is a soft glitter that you can apply over any color polish.</li>
            <li>My 5-year-old loves the name and really believes it&#x27;s actually &amp;#34;fairy dust.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This nail polish arrived before the expected due date and was exactly what I thought, just the right amount of sparkle!  </li>
            <li>Similar to Essie Pure Pearlfection but more of a subtle holographic glitter and not as show-y.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle glitter and</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for Christmas time to try it over a red cream and make it look like pretty Christmas lights twinkling against the red.</li>
            <li>I love this color, however, when I got it in the mail it was slightly open and really goopy, like it was half dried and then resealed or something.</li>
            <li>A little bit of Fairy Dust will bring back the gloss of your original manicure while adding the tiniest bit of iridescent/holographic sparkle.  </li>
            <li>In some indoor light it&#x27;s hard to see the sparkle at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear enough to go over any shade/color and provide the glittery sparkle.</li>
            <li>As another reviewr said \\&quot;The nail polish is clear with tiny glitter.</li>
            <li>The nail polish is clear with tiny glitter.</li>
            <li>The seller is timely and careful but the product itself leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li>The glitter was barely visable after two coats.</li>
            <li>This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; topcoat to revive a manicure that is already several days old.  </li>
            <li>The glitter is super micro fine and suspended evenly in a clear base.</li>
            <li>came close with NYC  105 starry silver, but the chunks of blue &amp; silver were a little much....</li>

            <li> Absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> I think this would be awesome to add sparkle to any polish for a fancy celebration or just a night out on the town.  </li>
            <li> ;, so it adds the slightest hint of shimmer to nail polish (IMO best for matte colours).</li>
            <li> I give this polish a 5 star rating because it is just beautiful!</li>
            <li> My favorite color!!!</li>
            <li> This polish is AMAZING!!</li>

            <li> Best when put on top of a darker polish!</li>
            <li> The best glitter top coat ever!</li>
            <li> It is a great addition to any shade of polish.</li>
            <li> This is the best glitter topcoat I own.</li>
            <li> Great Formula</li>
            <li> Works great over any color or by its self.</li>
            <li> But like I said, fairy dust is a great nail polish.</li>
            <li> Still a great nail polish alone or paired with another color.</li>
            <li> Great for a swag nail.</li>
            <li> This is a great polish.  </li>
            <li> Great solution for aging nails.  </li>
            <li> It will work great over any color.</li>
            <li> This is great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy.</li>
            <li> The formula is great too; I just use one coat over whatever polish I&#x27;m using, but you could also wear it alone.</li>
            <li> Love this!!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love glitter?!!</li>
            <li> The very fine holo glitter is beautiful!!</li>
            <li> The glitter is amazing!</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me because the shimmer is just amazing!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful glitter top coat!</li>
            <li> &quot; Kristin, I hope you don&#x27;t mind me plagiarizing your excellent and accurate</li>
            <li> Honestly I bought the summer colors from China glaze in matte and have not been happy with those either.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a really good holographic glitter....</li>
            <li> one with good color,  but not too chunky</li>
            <li> Good polish, not as shiny of a glittery coat as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat for any color.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this polish!</li>
            <li> then hurry up because you will fall in love!</li>
            <li> Love, Hugs, &amp; Butterfly Kisses!</li>
            <li> My favorite glitter nail polish!</li>
            <li> I totally love this polish!</li>
            <li> The sparkles are so fantastic!!</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite nail polish of all time!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this polish!</li>
            <li> and I am glad to have it!</li>
            <li> I am in love!  </li>
            <li> i wear it on top of every polish!</li>
            <li> I love the sparkles and the shimmers!</li>
            <li> Am glad i purchased it!</li>
            <li> Lovely polish!</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE GLITTER POLISH EVER!</li>
            <li> You can wear it alone on your nails or paint on top of your polish to give it spark!</li>
            <li> I surely would recommend getting your hands on this polish!</li>
            <li> but this is really amazing holo glitter.....</li>
            <li> The polish is amazing and glides on like butter.</li>
            <li> Adds a nice glimmer to your nail and like someone said</li>
            <li> Nice alone or over any color.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NICE COLOR.</li>
            <li> It got here on time, it is even more gorgeous than I imagined.</li>
            <li> But this is sensational top coat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been discontinued, love that i&#x27;m able to find it on here!</li>
            <li> Love the fairy dust as a top coat!</li>
            <li> Against my better judgement, I ordered this product hoping for Glistening Snow, but I received fairy dust, which I already own.  </li>
            <li> I have bought budget polish I liked just as well or better in the silver glitter style.  </li>
            <li> but i love it best wearing it on top of all my polishes its real glittery but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sparkly and holographic and adds an amazing, magic quality over any colour.</li>
            <li> Love, love love!</li>
            <li> It goes on clean with a fairly even distribution of the sparkles.</li>
            <li> I really like it and it lasts and covers beautifully.  </li>
            <li> It was EXACTLY what I wanted, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to dress up regular polish but it also looks great on it&#x27;s own!</li>
            <li> I slapped it on a bare nail, and loved it... then slapped it over \\&quot;For Audrey\\&quot; and it looks great as a top coat too.  </li>
            <li> I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> The seller wrapped each bottle in the bubble wrap, so it arrived safely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, I tried Fairy Dust and it is a lovely glitter top coat as well,</li>
            <li> Love China Glaze Nail Polish.</li>
            <li> Love this color.</li>
            <li> Love the nail polish</li>
            <li> I am in love.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s sparkly without being overkill.</li>
            <li> I can see myself going through many bottles of this since I plan to use it a lot.</li>
            <li> , most of the store brands just didn&#x27;t cut it....</li>
            <li> You can go to any chain store and do better.</li>
            <li> I love the way it sparkles in the sunlight</li>
            <li> This is more of an overcoat.</li>
            <li> Looks exceptionally wonderful in top of blue&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this glitter.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite &amp;#34;diva&amp;#34; polish at the moment</li>
            <li> I love the color, it is so fairy.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely scattered holographic coat.</li>
            <li> and im glad i found it here</li>
            <li> I really love china glaze polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this polish.</li>
            <li> Love the shine.</li>
            <li> IS CUTE 2 COATS</li>
            <li> I love this polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better in person than in the swatches I had seen online.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can use it on pretty much ANY color and it will look great!!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely very fine glitter (pics can&#x27;t seem to capture how well light catches the rainbow nature).</li>
            <li> The glitter is very fine and goes on evenly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> This polish would be great if you wanted a clear topcoat.</li>
            <li> This polish is discontinured and it is the perfect polish to add to your collection to make other colors that you already have pop.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered it and hoped for the best since I was already getting other polishes from this seller.  </li>
            <li> this is one of those glitters that is best used to enhance other glitters.  </li>
            <li> The seller packaged it very carefully and it got to me perfect.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have several that I love, but this one isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to remove for a glitter polish.</li>
            <li> This looks so beautiful when outside in the sunshine</li>
            <li> It is perfect to use as an accent coat over dark polish</li>
            <li> Firstly, it&#x27;s China Glaze (and I understand why so many people love this brand).</li>
            <li> Mild sparkle with one coat, lovely glimmer with two, tons of bling with three.</li>
            <li> I really think this is a cute polish, best suited for accenting a color or as a single coat all by itself.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect glitter to add some sparkle without looking like a little child.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fine glitter, very sparkly, distributes evenly, and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I even read another review from another customer stating this same thing, but everyone else seemed happy with their product</li>
            <li> This is so fun for a top coat to liven up any shade.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a light amount of glitter in the nail polish because it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> and I enjoy the effect that it makes when I do that.  </li>
            <li> Just one coat over any color adds a nice holographic type glitter but not too much.  </li>
            <li> Looks great over regular polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably strong, but required a couple of coats for coverage and the color is nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Gives just the right amount of sparkle to any color of nail polish when used as a top coat.</li>
            <li> it arrived kinda below the fill line already, but overall,  i love this polish!!</li>
            <li> It comes off very easy as well, which is always a problem I have with glitter that has large pieces.  </li>
            <li> You still get the typical glitter feel, but that can and should be masked by a good top coat!</li>
            <li> I think this is my new favorite glitter top coat.</li>
            <li> what it does for me is give any glitter a more consistent look and some depth.  </li>
            <li> I got this to put over the fun colors I use on my nieces!</li>
            <li> I love this polish so much that I stocked up!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so much fun to look at!</li>
            <li> I find all of the China Glaze nail polishes to be great and long wearing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of most glitters, especially the ones with larger bits, so this is great!</li>
            <li> microfine glitter...dries quickly and relatively smooth....</li>
            <li> it catches the light a million different ways and looks good over any color.</li>
            <li> Love this - it will be perfect over my blah creme colors like white and light pink, or even for the holidays!</li>
            <li> It holds up almost as well as my other favored brand of nail polish does and is house work friendly.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I love this polish sooo much</li>
            <li> The formulation is good, it dries well, and adds an extra element to just about any color.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a clear coat, you cannot use it on its own.</li>
            <li> Nope, they gave me a stamping plate instead, which I love, but I really, really wanted this polish.</li>
            <li> so I recommend Seche Vite top coat for a nice, shiny and quick dry!</li>
            <li> I especially love this over french tip manicures as it makes it more interesting, but still subtle.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth on the surface that I didn&#x27;t even need a clear top coat.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was quick as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute but like most glitter polishes, will need a specific color underneath.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited and used it right away.</li>
            <li> Too micro-fine to really be considered a &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34;, removes like a regular polish (not gritty), and looks great over every color cream polish you own.</li>
            <li> I have applied it over three different colors so far and the results are consistently beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Gives a pretty holigraphic like glow!  </li>
            <li> Lovely clear, glittery coat!  </li>
            <li> Very sparkly, very pretty!</li>
            <li> it was likely not an honest mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it looked like it had been used because it was exactly quite full either.</li>
            <li> I don;t feel this was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Its not crazy glittery where u can wear it by itself</li>
            <li> You do need to put a clear top coat over this to make the glitter effect pop.</li>
            <li> When I first used it as a top coat I didn&#x27;t see much sparkle, but when I went outside on my terrace the sparkle was much more radiant.  </li>
            <li> they get it right.</li>
            <li> but I did it, and got some positive comments!  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t in stock, wasn&#x27;t notified til later, love this polish, put it on top of all my colors .it doesn&#x27;t feel rough when top coat is put on.</li>
            <li> THE SHIPPING IS SUPER DUPER FAST</li>
            <li> so pretty in just one coat.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to the \\&quot;Northern Lights\\&quot; topcoats you see but more glitter</li>
            <li> I have left a review in the appropriate seller feedback location as well.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a a more solid color.</li>
            <li> I really love how the tiny particles are uniform as well as holographic and spread evenly over the nail.  </li>
            <li> Im willing to make.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this.  </li>
            <li> THIS COLOR IS SO PRETTY BUY IT</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m willing to put up with that for the effect it gives on even the lightest polish.</li>
            <li> Outside, the sparkle is pretty intense and beautiful, and inside it looks more subtle.  </li>
            <li> It is basically clear polish with lots of amazing tiny glitter that sparkles and shines.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other glitter polishes that I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and comes off with regular nail remover.</li>
            <li> This glitter is beautiful but it takes FOREVER to dry and it was super thick.</li>
            <li> it just isn&#x27;t the Stainless steel color I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this wasn&#x27;t going to be just another glitter nail polish.</li>
            <li> I personally highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much because it will bubble.</li>
            <li> It really does look like you have fairy dust on your nails.</li>
            <li> It is fast drying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too much glitter.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that it is much easier to remove than glitter polish.  </li>
            <li> thanks guys</li>
            <li> My whole nail is covered in glitter.</li>
            <li> If someone can email me or something, I&#x27;d really like to have the polish I paid for.</li>
            <li> It really dresses up the nails without looking tacky.</li>
            <li> Very afforable.</li>
            <li> HAHA</li>
            <li> for buying it through this seller, that also went better than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad this is discontinued, because it is the fave sparkle top coat I own.    </li>
            <li> It even looks nice on plain nails.</li>
            <li> This is a very subtle glitter polish, it looks great over any color of polish.</li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the fast shipping and the polish I got, only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the consistency.</li>
            <li> The polish shows up on both dark and light colors!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a leap of faith to wear sparkling polish as an older woman (I&#x27;m 66) -</li>
            <li> It arrived on the third or fourth day, nicely packaged and unharmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets in buying this polish, and recommend everyone else does too!</li>
            <li> This polish gives such a pretty sparkle to your polish!</li>
            <li> It is glittery without looking childish and does not require more than one coat.</li>
            <li> In fact, I am going to actually go order another one right now because mine is almost out.  </li>
            <li> I actually found this exact nail polish at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply... confirming my point that this nail polish is not discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The polish itself is pretty thick and to me, there is just the right amount of sparklies!</li>
            <li> Fairy Dust is a clear coat with multi-colored micro-glitter.  </li>
            <li> The color is a soft glitter that you can apply over any color polish.</li>
            <li> My 5-year-old loves the name and really believes it&#x27;s actually &amp;#34;fairy dust.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This nail polish arrived before the expected due date and was exactly what I thought, just the right amount of sparkle!  </li>
            <li> Similar to Essie Pure Pearlfection but more of a subtle holographic glitter and not as show-y.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle glitter and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for Christmas time to try it over a red cream and make it look like pretty Christmas lights twinkling against the red.</li>
            <li> I love this color, however, when I got it in the mail it was slightly open and really goopy, like it was half dried and then resealed or something.</li>
            <li> A little bit of Fairy Dust will bring back the gloss of your original manicure while adding the tiniest bit of iridescent/holographic sparkle.  </li>
            <li> In some indoor light it&#x27;s hard to see the sparkle at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear enough to go over any shade/color and provide the glittery sparkle.</li>
            <li> As another reviewr said \\&quot;The nail polish is clear with tiny glitter.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is clear with tiny glitter.</li>
            <li> The seller is timely and careful but the product itself leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> The glitter was barely visable after two coats.</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; topcoat to revive a manicure that is already several days old.  </li>
            <li> The glitter is super micro fine and suspended evenly in a clear base.</li>
            <li> came close with NYC  105 starry silver, but the chunks of blue &amp; silver were a little much....</li>
            <li> The product description was for a faucet and the it was hard to tell from the picture if this was the right product or not.  </li>
            <li> I think if you put several layers on it might be different, but I dont have time to paint several layers and wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> These polishes last--they&#x27;re actually pretty hard to take off.</li>
            <li> As for the actual product like it took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> In can be used over any polish, though I typically use it on solid colors with no other glitter or iridescence.  </li>
            <li> was very disappointed as it really looks more like a clear topcoat.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time, if not early.</li>
            <li> I had to buy to buy two, so I won&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
            <li> Its a very fine, holographic glitter in a clear base.</li>
            <li> I noticed from some of their other reviews that substitutions without notification is a regular occurrence for them</li>
            <li> They dry matte and chip off after one day of wear.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to dry</li>
            <li> so pretty but tough as a bear to remove ..</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ll be super sad when I can no longer find this polish.</li>
            <li> It works well as a standalone topcoat as there is minimal grittiness to touch.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a micro-glitter, it doesn&#x27;t feel that rough, though I still use a topcoat over it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t perform at all like I expected or like any other glitter polish I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> but this stuff feels like concrete and is very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I am giving the product 5 stars because it seems to deserve it from the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> bought this for a different look to some if not all my nail polish;  very delicate sparkle especially in the sunshine or even indoor under teh lights</li>
            <li> but it was really hard to apply the second coat because it just clumps up.</li>
            <li> im actually buying two more bottles of this cuz i am truly addicted to this polish!!!!</li>
            <li> for me this is the equivalent of *the little black dress</li>
            <li> and I noticed that it speeded up the dry time of one of my polishes that was notoriously slow.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to add a little sparkle to your manicures...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little gloopy.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Not your typical overlay polish!  </li>
            <li> Very subtle glitter with multiple colors in the glitter.</li>
            <li> The glitter is very small so you can easily see your base color through it.</li>
            <li> This is not a linear holo, howvever, but if you&#x27;re wanting to jazz up a manicure, a little sparke doesnt hurt!  </li>
            <li> The glitter is small and spreads evenly over the nail, it&#x27;s not patchy at all.</li>
            <li> It turns ordinary polishes into Holographic goodness.</li>
            <li> I had to order a few of these!</li>
            <li> maybe it was because the nail polish was really thick and goopy, but i thought it was used because the sides of my bottle was messy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be that way</li>
            <li> small glitter just like its name</li>
            <li> I usually apply two coats to get the amount of sparkle I want.  </li>
            <li> It was hard for me to find a glitter polish that had small glitters that didnt end up looking opaque...</li>
            <li> Even when I tested it on a piece of paper I could hardly see the sparkles.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find because it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time not putting over every mani i do.</li>
            <li> It also covers imperfections like bubbles and dents so you can hardly see them.</li>
            <li> Once again, I&#x27;m too late on the bandwagon.</li>
            <li> how well the glitter shows after two coats but as soon as I apply one coat it was really thick and goopy.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve actually never tried it by itself on a dark base coat.  </li>
            <li> i mean u can if u want a subtle glitter look</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it if you like to add a little something without detracting from your base color.</li>
            <li> The glitter colour is opalescent and shimmers with a subtle fire.</li>
            <li> It looks almost the same except instead of a clear base it has a silvery base.  </li>
            <li> It I hard to explain why I was unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Too bad they discontinued it, because it is one of the prettiest &amp; delicate glitter polish I have seen.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is discontinued</li>
            <li> The sparkle in this is crazy...</li>
            <li> Are they mad?</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m kinda mad</li>
            <li> Sad it&#x27;s been discontinued!</li>
            <li> Shine like crazy in the sun!</li>
            <li> They are suspended in a jelly-like base, allowing for optimal control.  </li>
            <li> serious sparkle without being in-your-face-obnoxious!!!!</li>
            <li> Sooo sad they discontinued this color!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this!! It is a great addition to any shade of polish. The glitter is very small so you can easily see your base color through it. It even looks nice on plain nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done looking - I can&#x27;t believe they discontinued this. Are they mad? Perfect glitter... so pretty in just one coat.</li>
            <li> Cant wait to wear it. Its exactly what I was expecting. Its a very fine, holographic glitter in a clear base. Similar to Essie Pure Pearlfection but more of a subtle holographic glitter and not as show-y.</li>
            <li> This polish is discontinured and it is the perfect polish to add to your collection to make other colors that you already have pop.  I put it on almost any color and it compliments it.  It goes on easy and comes off with regular nail remover.</li>
            <li> This is the best glitter topcoat I own. It&#x27;s similar to the \\&quot;Northern Lights\\&quot; topcoats you see but more glitter and this is a holographic type. The glitter is small and spreads evenly over the nail, it&#x27;s not patchy at all. Adds a nice glimmer to your nail and like someone said \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t drown out your manicure\\&quot;. I especially love this over french tip manicures as it makes it more interesting, but still subtle.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. It&#x27;s clear enough to go over any shade/color and provide the glittery sparkle. The seller wrapped each bottle in the bubble wrap, so it arrived safely.</li>
            <li> I really think this is a cute polish, best suited for accenting a color or as a single coat all by itself. It holds up almost as well as my other favored brand of nail polish does and is house work friendly. i would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am giving the product 5 stars because it seems to deserve it from the other reviews.  However I can only write this review as a warning to anyone considering purchasing it from the seller XPRESSURSELF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this about a week ago, and while the polish showed up on time and intact, I received &amp;#34;Fairy Dust&amp;#34; instead.  I have left a review in the appropriate seller feedback location as well.  I noticed from some of their other reviews that substitutions without notification is a regular occurrence for them so I&#x27;m going to go out on a limb and state it was likely not an honest mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I tried Fairy Dust and it is a lovely glitter top coat as well, it just isn&#x27;t the Stainless steel color I wanted.  I will try to order it again from someone else and cross my fingers they get it right.</li>
            <li> Love China Glaze Nail Polish. Great Formula</li>
            <li> My favorite color!!! It&#x27;s been discontinued, love that i&#x27;m able to find it on here!</li>
            <li> Not your typical overlay polish!  The glitter is the tiniest I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Gives a pretty holigraphic like glow!  Especially love for toes!  Shine like crazy in the sun!</li>
            <li> Love this color. And all colors I&#x27;ve gotten from China Glaze. They make very good quality products. I&#x27;m Very happy. Works great over any color or by its self.</li>
            <li> Love the nail polish it&#x27;s self but I&#x27;m kinda mad I bought it online when I could have walked into sally&#x27;s and bought it for 4.99! No shipping! I figured they wouldn&#x27;t have it because it&#x27;s \\&quot;discontinued\\&quot; but I&#x27;ve seen it all ulta as well. Strange. But like I said, fairy dust is a great nail polish. I like to layer it over a color for a 3d effect.</li>
            <li> I am in love. It turns ordinary polishes into Holographic goodness. Love it! If you&#x27;re considering it, I say Get it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this polish! It goes on clean with a fairly even distribution of the sparkles. I love that it&#x27;s sparkly without being overkill.</li>
            <li> I just discovered this beautiful polish and I love it so much. I like to apply it over any cream nail color to give an extra uniqueness effect to a colored polish. This looks so beautiful when outside in the sunshine ~ just sparkling! I can see myself going through many bottles of this since I plan to use it a lot. I can&#x27;t wait for Christmas time to try it over a red cream and make it look like pretty Christmas lights twinkling against the red. If you have never tried Fairy Dust... then hurry up because you will fall in love!</li>
            <li> It shipped on time and was packaged well. As for the actual product like it took forever to dry. Also I know glitter polish will have some texture but this stuff feels like concrete and is very hard to remove. It I hard to explain why I was unhappy with it. It&#x27;s like the polish the glitter was in was matte or something. It didn&#x27;t perform at all like I expected or like any other glitter polish I&#x27;ve ever used. Honestly I bought the summer colors from China glaze in matte and have not been happy with those either. They dry matte and chip off after one day of wear. The seller is timely and careful but the product itself leaves much to be desired. I would not recommend any of the China Glaze products.</li>
            <li> Gives just the right amount of sparkle to any color of nail polish when used as a top coat. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for a really good holographic glitter....one with good color,  but not too chunky, most of the store brands just didn&#x27;t cut it....came close with NYC  105 starry silver, but the chunks of blue &amp; silver were a little much....i just wanted the holo glitter dust......then i read a review for fairy dust....with pictures.....and i was intrigued..... of course since *i* like it... it&#x27;s discontinued....story of my life.... but this is really amazing holo glitter..... microfine glitter...dries quickly and relatively smooth....serious sparkle without being in-your-face-obnoxious!!!! a must-have......for me this is the equivalent of *the little black dress*</li>
            <li> This glitter is beautiful but it takes FOREVER to dry and it was super thick.</li>
            <li> Love, Hugs, &amp; Butterfly Kisses! â™¥ â™¥&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As another reviewr said \\&quot;The nail polish is clear with tiny glitter. I thought it was a silver polish with glitter.\\&quot; Kristin, I hope you don&#x27;t mind me plagiarizing your excellent and accurate review.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed as it really looks more like a clear topcoat. Even when I tested it on a piece of paper I could hardly see the sparkles. If you&#x27;re looking for bling, sparkle or glitz this is not the polish for you. You can go to any chain store and do better. Check out China Glaze Snow Globe or Nova. I hope this helps some one..</li>
            <li> bought this for a different look to some if not all my nail polish;  very delicate sparkle especially in the sunshine or even indoor under teh lights</li>
            <li> Lovely clear, glittery coat!  Goes great on everything!!  It is hard to find because it has been discontinued.  Love, love love!</li>
            <li> I did a search for China Glaze Glistening Snow and this seller came up.  The product description was for a faucet and the it was hard to tell from the picture if this was the right product or not.  Against my better judgement, I ordered this product hoping for Glistening Snow, but I received fairy dust, which I already own.  I even read another review from another customer stating this same thing, but everyone else seemed happy with their product so I ordered it and hoped for the best since I was already getting other polishes from this seller.  I could just kick myself.  I am out the 4.59 for the product and the $4 for shipping.  What a waste.</li>
            <li> makes everything shine and is beautiful on ANY color.  I love the way it sparkles in the sunlight and i&#x27;ll be super sad when I can no longer find this polish.</li>
            <li> I love this color, however, when I got it in the mail it was slightly open and really goopy, like it was half dried and then resealed or something.</li>
            <li> The name listed above for this product is not correct. The name on the bottle is Fairy Dust. Still a great nail polish alone or paired with another color. Great for a swag nail.</li>
            <li> My favorite glitter nail polish! I had to order a few of these!</li>
            <li> This polish gives such a pretty sparkle to your polish! Nice alone or over any color.</li>
            <li> so pretty but tough as a bear to remove ..</li>
            <li> this is one of those glitters that is best used to enhance other glitters.  i&#x27;ve actually never tried it by itself on a dark base coat.  what it does for me is give any glitter a more consistent look and some depth.  buy it while you can before everyone&#x27;s stock runs out.</li>
            <li> I got this to put over the fun colors I use on my nieces! It gives their nails a great sparkle! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This is more of an overcoat. The nail polish is clear with tiny glitter. I thought it was a silver polish with glitter.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this wasn&#x27;t going to be just another glitter nail polish. I was hoping for a a more solid color. That I didn&#x27;t have to put on 1000 coats.</li>
            <li> This is a great polish.  I really like it and it lasts and covers beautifully.  The glitter is amazing!</li>
            <li> Great solution for aging nails.  One coat covers all the ugley ridges and spots on the nails - and dries practically immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a leap of faith to wear sparkling polish as an older woman (I&#x27;m 66) - but I did it, and got some positive comments!  Hallelujah!</li>
            <li> This nail polish arrived before the expected due date and was exactly what I thought, just the right amount of sparkle!  It will work great over any color.</li>
            <li> This polish is one of my favorites! It is so glittery! Looks exceptionally wonderful in top of blue&#x27;s. I personally highly reccomend it!</li>
            <li> So easy to apply. It lasts and adds a wonderful shimmer and sparkle to your nails!</li>
            <li> Sooo sad they discontinued this color!!! If you love sparkle and glitter its here, looks awesome over any color, I covet this color in my own collection because I don&#x27;t want it to run out!!!!</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to find a glitter polish that had small glitters that didnt end up looking opaque... like just a silver color. This is perfect.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t in stock, wasn&#x27;t notified til later, love this polish, put it on top of all my colors .it doesn&#x27;t feel rough when top coat is put on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad this is discontinued, because it is the fave sparkle top coat I own.    I really love how the tiny particles are uniform as well as holographic and spread evenly over the nail.  They are suspended in a jelly-like base, allowing for optimal control.  Of all the polishes I use for accents, this is my fave.  Im considering a backup bottle!    This is not a linear holo, howvever, but if you&#x27;re wanting to jazz up a manicure, a little sparke doesnt hurt!  You will come to find this is a staple in your collection.    Removal is the same as any glitter, but it&#x27;s a sacrifice Im willing to make.  I wish China Glaze would change their mind about taking it out of production.  If you are looking for a uniform glitter that doesnt drown out your manicure, I would say you&#x27;ve found it in this polish.</li>
            <li> I totally love this polish! You can use it on pretty much ANY color and it will look great!! The very fine holo glitter is beautiful!! I love this polish so much that I stocked up! I use it all the time!!</li>
            <li> this was a gift for a lady who loves nail polish. there was a sale on nail polish the day I ordered this.</li>
            <li> The sparkles are so fantastic!! The polish itself is pretty thick and to me, there is just the right amount of sparklies! Who doesn&#x27;t love glitter?!! I love this stuff already.</li>
            <li> maybe it was because the nail polish was really thick and goopy, but i thought it was used because the sides of my bottle was messy and it looked like it had been used because it was exactly quite full either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a hybrid of holo and glitter, and thoroughly subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so much fun to look at! You still get the typical glitter feel, but that can and should be masked by a good top coat!</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite nail polish of all time! It is basically clear polish with lots of amazing tiny glitter that sparkles and shines. Nails still look simple and neat, but have an extra glittery attraction to them. Absolutely wonderful! I use it with everything!</li>
            <li> Unlike the gold color, this did not cover in one coat, even after mixing well.  It&#x27;s reasonably strong, but required a couple of coats for coverage and the color is nothing special.  I have bought budget polish I liked just as well or better in the silver glitter style.  I don;t feel this was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to dress up regular polish but it also looks great on it&#x27;s own! Very subtle glitter with multiple colors in the glitter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this glitter. it&#x27;s a fine glitter, very sparkly, distributes evenly, and looks amazing. I have a hard time not putting over every mani i do.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time, if not early. It was well packaged. I LOVE this polish! It is my favorite &amp;#34;diva&amp;#34; polish at the moment and I am glad to have it! I have to hide it from my daughters!!</li>
            <li> Love this - it will be perfect over my blah creme colors like white and light pink, or even for the holidays!</li>
            <li> Beautiful... just SO beautiful! Best when put on top of a darker polish! Don&#x27;t use too much because it will bubble. Takes a while to dry so I recommend Seche Vite top coat for a nice, shiny and quick dry! ;)</li>
            <li> This is the perfect glitter to add some sparkle without looking like a little child. The glitter is very fine and goes on evenly and smoothly.  It is so smooth on the surface that I didn&#x27;t even need a clear top coat.  I am in love!  I have applied it over three different colors so far and the results are consistently beautiful.  It comes off very easy as well, which is always a problem I have with glitter that has large pieces.  Beautiful Fairy Dust polish.</li>
            <li> This nail polish exceeded all my expectations. It really does look like you have fairy dust on your nails. The glitter is super micro fine and suspended evenly in a clear base. The glitter colour is opalescent and shimmers with a subtle fire. It is fast drying and I noticed that it speeded up the dry time of one of my polishes that was notoriously slow. It also covers imperfections like bubbles and dents so you can hardly see them.</li>
            <li> Good polish, not as shiny of a glittery coat as I thought it would be. I think if you put several layers on it might be different, but I dont have time to paint several layers and wait for it to dry. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> The best glitter top coat ever!</li>
            <li> I love the subtle glitter and how well the glitter shows after two coats but as soon as I apply one coat it was really thick and goopy. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be that way but it was really hard to apply the second coat because it just clumps up. Overall, I love the fast shipping and the polish I got, only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the consistency.</li>
            <li> This seller sent me my polish the day after I placed my order! Received it in 24 hours-awesome! The color is a soft glitter that you can apply over any color polish. It&#x27;s not too much glitter. Its literally just a touch of sparkle.</li>
            <li> This is so fun for a top coat to liven up any shade. My 5-year-old loves the name and really believes it&#x27;s actually &amp;#34;fairy dust.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this.  I bought it because of the positive reviews.  When I first used it as a top coat I didn&#x27;t see much sparkle, but when I went outside on my terrace the sparkle was much more radiant.  So, I guess it depends on what type of lighting you&#x27;re in.  I will be buying another one since its discontinued, just to have some on hand. I do like the fact that it is much easier to remove than glitter polish.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes that sparkly almost holographic look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in total agreement... this should be a keeper, China Glaze!!  Once again, I&#x27;m too late on the bandwagon. But this is sensational top coat.  I slapped it on a bare nail, and loved it... then slapped it over \\&quot;For Audrey\\&quot; and it looks great as a top coat too.  I think this would be awesome to add sparkle to any polish for a fancy celebration or just a night out on the town.  I wish CG would reconsider, this is one that I would definitely buy in the future!</li>
            <li> China glaze never dissapoints me, this polish is awsome!!!! I love this polish sooo much i wear it on top of every polish! Its not crazy glittery where u can wear it by itself i mean u can if u want a subtle glitter look but i love it best wearing it on top of all my polishes its real glittery but small glitter just like its name it truly is like fairy dust i would def tell anyone to buy this polish i personally think this should b in any girls polish collection, im actually buying two more bottles of this cuz i am truly addicted to this polish!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the color, it is so fairy. I love the sparkles and the shimmers! Am glad i purchased it!</li>
            <li> Firstly, it&#x27;s China Glaze (and I understand why so many people love this brand). Secondly it&#x27;s &amp;#34;fairy dust&amp;#34;, so it adds the slightest hint of shimmer to nail polish (IMO best for matte colours). It works well as a standalone topcoat as there is minimal grittiness to touch.</li>
            <li> Lovely polish! I bought it, to go by itself and to use during the holidays, or whenever I feel like it, especially during the summer. I do recommend it, if you can find it!</li>
            <li> This polish would be great if you wanted a clear topcoat. However if you want sparkles you should go with a different product!</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE GLITTER POLISH EVER! IT IS A TOPCOAT POLISH AND LOOKS GOOD OVER ABOUT ANY COLOR! THIS COLOR IS SO PRETTY BUY IT NOW! PLUS THE SHIPPING IS SUPER DUPER FAST</li>
            <li> This is a very subtle glitter polish, it looks great over any color of polish. Too bad they discontinued it, because it is one of the prettiest &amp; delicate glitter polish I have seen.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely scattered holographic coat. Mild sparkle with one coat, lovely glimmer with two, tons of bling with three. The formulation is good, it dries well, and adds an extra element to just about any color. I definitely recommend it if you like to add a little something without detracting from your base color.</li>
            <li> it arrived kinda below the fill line already, but overall,  i love this polish!! i&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for it and im glad i found it here AND at a discount! thanks guys</li>
            <li> Fairy Dust is a clear coat with multi-colored micro-glitter.  In can be used over any polish, though I typically use it on solid colors with no other glitter or iridescence.  Outside, the sparkle is pretty intense and beautiful, and inside it looks more subtle.  In some indoor light it&#x27;s hard to see the sparkle at all.  I usually apply two coats to get the amount of sparkle I want.  Since it&#x27;s a clear coat, you cannot use it on its own. If you are looking for an opaque polish with micro-glitter, try Snow Globe.  It looks almost the same except instead of a clear base it has a silvery base.  Since it&#x27;s a micro-glitter, it doesn&#x27;t feel that rough, though I still use a topcoat over it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this 2-3 days ago and got it today in the mail! I was extremely excited and used it right away. The polish is amazing and glides on like butter. There wasn&#x27;t any bald spots or ANYTHING and this polish didn&#x27;t erase itself when you go over it with the brush. My whole nail is covered in glitter. One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t dry very quickly. However, that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me because the shimmer is just amazing!</li>
            <li> I like that it has a light amount of glitter in the nail polish because it goes on smoothly.  It is perfect to use as an accent coat over dark polish and I enjoy the effect that it makes when I do that.  I find all of the China Glaze nail polishes to be great and long wearing.  You do need to put a clear top coat over this to make the glitter effect pop.</li>
            <li> I really love china glaze polish. I have several that I love, but this one isn&#x27;t all that great. The glitter was barely visable after two coats. I know now why it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely very fine glitter (pics can&#x27;t seem to capture how well light catches the rainbow nature). It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to remove for a glitter polish. Sad it&#x27;s been discontinued!</li>
            <li> Nope, they gave me a stamping plate instead, which I love, but I really, really wanted this polish. If someone can email me or something, I&#x27;d really like to have the polish I paid for.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to add a little sparkle to your manicures...look NO further!!  This polish is AMAZING!! In fact, I am going to actually go order another one right now because mine is almost out.  Just one coat over any color adds a nice holographic type glitter but not too much.  it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is discontinued so I had to buy and hope it was what I wanted (tiny glitters instead of those giant ones). It was EXACTLY what I wanted, so I&#x27;m happy. The seller packaged it very carefully and it got to me perfect. Delivery was quick as well. It really dresses up the nails without looking tacky. I&#x27;m not a fan of most glitters, especially the ones with larger bits, so this is great!</li>
            <li> Love the fairy dust as a top coat!</li>
            <li> I actually found this exact nail polish at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply... confirming my point that this nail polish is not discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I love this nail polish. It&#x27;s cute but like most glitter polishes, will need a specific color underneath. I used white and put that overtop and I love it.</li>
            <li> I give this polish a 5 star rating because it is just beautiful! You can wear it alone on your nails or paint on top of your polish to give it spark! The polish shows up on both dark and light colors! I surely would recommend getting your hands on this polish!</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; topcoat to revive a manicure that is already several days old.  A little bit of Fairy Dust will bring back the gloss of your original manicure while adding the tiniest bit of iridescent/holographic sparkle.  Too micro-fine to really be considered a &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34;, removes like a regular polish (not gritty), and looks great over every color cream polish you own.</li>
            <li> Love this polish. Can&#x27;t believe they are discontinued it. Looks great over regular polish. Love the shine.This is great. Very afforable.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful glitter top coat! Unlike other glitter polishes that I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s very easy to remove. I wish China Glaze would continue to make this polish. I had to buy to buy two, so I won&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NICE COLOR. THE SPARKLES ARE LIKE DUST AND ONE COAT IS CUTE 2 COATS AND YOU CAN BE SEEN FROM SPACE HAHA</li>
            <li> I love this polish. It&#x27;s even better in person than in the swatches I had seen online. It&#x27;s sparkly and holographic and adds an amazing, magic quality over any colour. I wish I had owned this years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for buying it through this seller, that also went better than expected. It arrived on the third or fourth day, nicely packaged and unharmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets in buying this polish, and recommend everyone else does too!</li>
            <li> I am so happy. It got here on time, it is even more gorgeous than I imagined. I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it&#x27;s a little gloopy. But I&#x27;m willing to put up with that for the effect it gives on even the lightest polish.</li>
            <li> I think this is my new favorite glitter top coat. The sparkle in this is crazy...it catches the light a million different ways and looks good over any color. The formula is great too; I just use one coat over whatever polish I&#x27;m using, but you could also wear it alone.</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat for any color. It is glittery without looking childish and does not require more than one coat.</li>
            <li> Very sparkly, very pretty! These polishes last--they&#x27;re actually pretty hard to take off. It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s been discontinued. Guess I&#x27;ll have to make this one last!</li>
