            <li>I used this product for the first time last night before bed.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and she actually said it works very well for her.</li>
            <li>After removing it,  it made my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li>But my complexion looking pretty rough and being in sales</li>
            <li>Seriously, made me skin feel clean and fresh and alert (strange word to use for my face</li>

            <li>I pulled a small amount into the palm of my hand, then added a few drops of warm water.  </li>
            <li>so I was a little reluctant to try at first</li>
            <li>I brush the mud on my face then let it dry completely before washing it off.  </li>
            <li>I can use this mask once a week though I have to be careful not to leave it on too long as it really does suck everything (incuding moisture) from your skin.  </li>
            <li>At first I looked at the size of the container and thought it would only last a few applications</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit to cover your whole face, and i left it on  for around 7 minutes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My kids had a laugh when I put this on but nobody is laughing now!  Seriously, made me skin feel clean and fresh and alert (strange word to use for my face but it&#x27;s best description!).  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am kind of a facial mask connoisseur - I&#x27;ve tried many in my  time from the inexpensive drug store to the high-end boutique stores and I must say I am impressed with this one. A little goes a long way and it truly is a hydrating mask. My skin felt wonderful after an 8 minute treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely something to add to the skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect Body Harmony provided this product for my review and feedback.</li>
            <li> Loving this product.  Arrived fast and perfect</li>
            <li> This feels like heaven on your face, with a nice after glow.   Great product!</li>
            <li> I brush the mud on my face then let it dry completely before washing it off.  It leaves my pores clean and my skin soft, without drying or tightening.  I&#x27;ve wanted a good mud product for years and haven&#x27;t been able to find what I wanted until I got hold of this one.  Thanks, Perfect Body Harmony!  You fulfilled a big need for me!</li>
            <li> Kelp, a brown seaweed, is a reliable source of iodine. Kelp and spirulina each provide small, supplemental amounts of essential minerals. Both the kelp (seaweed) and the algae (Spirulina) deliver some of the sea&#x27;s most nutritive skin enhancing benefits. It has a high content of amino acids and it&#x27;s rich in vitamins and minerals. It is an effective anti aging face mask with antioxidants and beta carotene that regenerate skin cells and revitalize and firm skin.</li>
            <li> I do see improvement in my pores being cleaner after using this only twice.  I plan to use even more frequently with sunscreen season here.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin dry and I would not buy it again it also made my teens face break out</li>
            <li> I love this mask. The texture and consistency of it is amazing. My skin and never had such a nice glow and felt so tight before. This is a staple in my beauty routine for now on.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I was a little reluctant to try at first but it left my face feeling great without any irritation.  I hope the continued use will also begin to show smoother skin.</li>
            <li> Gave it to the girlfriend and she loves it. Smells good and she says its works really good too.</li>
            <li> I received my product immediately and tried it that same night. I am continuing to use the mask and it seems to be working well to give my skin a healthier appearance.</li>
            <li> This was a very excellent product. Upon arrival the mask was very thick and stiff but after adding a few drops of water and mixing with a spoon it came out to a very manageable consistency. Although it took a little longer then it said to dry, it was very easy to wash off and left my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just as with any new skin care product, I first tested it out on my hand, I applied the mud, saw how it dried, and made sure my skin was comfortable with all of its ingredients. Personally, my skin was doing well after testing it. However, I did notice a cold sensation on my skin so I was a bit hesitant to try it on my face.  Although the mud itself is room temperature, it had a very cold sensation on my face which turned out feeling refreshing after all.</li>
            <li> This mask is incredible. My skin looked and felt refreshed and like I had just left the spa. I felt more youthful :)  I absolutely love all the products from this line and this one just adds another amazing element to their product line.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this face mask and like the ingredients that are used, since they are high quality ingredients. You only need a little bit to cover your whole face, and i left it on  for around 7 minutes. When i took off the mask my skin looked amazing. This is the best clay product mask i have ever used and would definitely buy it again.</li>

            <li> I am kind of a facial mask connoisseur - I&#x27;ve tried many in my time from the inexpensive drug store to the high-end boutique stores and I must say I am impressed with this one. A little goes a long way and it truly is a hydrating mask. My skin felt wonderful after an 8 minute treatment.</li>
            <li> I would say the only down play to this was the application. But once i got it on i allowed it to sit !! I was so relaxed... let sit until it was dry and the took off with warm water left my skin soft and it had a glow!!! This product is my review on the item... its my honest truth about how i feel...</li>
            <li> Love it!  My skin felt so clean and soft after first use!  I will add this to my weekly routine!  Kept it on for twice the time as instructed.</li>
            <li> I received my Earth and Sea Muddy Face today and tried it after my bath, I was impressed with the mud it didn&#x27;t have a strong smell which is great, because I wouldn&#x27;t want a strong smell on my face. It was very soft and it went on easy. I let it set for 15 minutes and then washed it off with warm water. My face felt softer and I didn&#x27;t need to add any moisturizer afterwards. Very impressed</li>
            <li> I recently got this for my best friend to try and she actually said it works very well for her. She said she liked that it was very natural feeling. I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised that I was able to really see my face looking clear.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night before bed.  First of all, I have VERY sensitive skin!  And it didn&#x27;t cause a bad reaction at all!  I washed my face, then opened the jar (nice quality, sturdy, not lightweight plastic (acrylic or ceramic, maybe?).  The mask is kind of thick (directions read to mix with a little water if too thick).  I pulled a small amount into the palm of my hand, then added a few drops of warm water.  I then smoothed over my entire face and neck (avoiding areas to close to my eyes).  It felt great putting on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then waited about 15 minutes, enough for mask to dry and washed off with warm water and a washcloth, then rinsed with cool water.  My skin felt so clean!  Of course, I had to look in the mirror to see if there were any changes.  My skin did appear more clean, bright and my pores were smaller!  That&#x27;s always a plus.  I then followed with my favorite nighly serum and moisturizer.  My skin felt pampered and wonderful!  I will be buying this for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a note, I did recieved this product free from Amazon in return for my HONEST review.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Smells great have not had it long but,  like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product! It arrived on time and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  The first time I used it was rather quickly before I hopped in the shower. I put it on as directed and let it dry while the shower was heating up then hopped in a rinsed it off.  My face felt awesome and smooth. I followed with the Organic Peppermint Citrus Berry Toner (fabulouso!). So glad to finally have natural and organic face products that work!</li>
            <li> I love this new mask product! I have the clay from Perfect Body Harmony and use it for clay baths...but this ready clay mask is awesome for your face (becuase it already is mixed and you simply apply!) The texture was perfect - I applied it to my face and it dried nicely, then I rinsed off while in the bath. This may be my new Sunday night ritual - hot bath and facial clay mask to start each week :). And, my skin felt amazing after and the next morning...I could literally tell a difference the next day. You will love it - an awesome clay mask!</li>
            <li> Being a guy, not really into masks &amp; facials, etc...But my complexion looking pretty rough and being in sales need to look my best!.I had tried some other &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; items but all required mixing and made a big mess. I really like the fact this is pre-mixed and easy to apply. Wait 10 mins and rinse off. Face does feel good afterwards and seems to be working. Purchased thru a promotion for evaluation.</li>
            <li> The minute I applied this to my face I knew I would like it.  After removing it,  it made my face feel so soft. Opening thoseclogged,  and removing a much needed layer of dead skin. My make up was easier to apply.</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth high quality mud mask.  I skin that is blackhead prone but also dries out very easily.  I can use this mask once a week though I have to be careful not to leave it on too long as it really does suck everything (incuding moisture) from your skin.  I will probably end up only using it every 2 weeks because of how dry my skin gets, but its a great tool for pulling pollution out of yours skin.  it is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t need too much to cover your face.  At first I looked at the size of the container and thought it would only last a few applications but you can defiinetly make a little go a long way with this product.  If you are looking for an easy, pre-mixed clay mask this is a great choice.  Just be careful if you have dry skin!</li>
            <li> Like this mask very much- It is not as drying as some clay masks I have used-&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and wash off- does pull impurities from my skin</li>
            <li> Fantastic mask! Didn&#x27;t have to mix - used straight out of jar.  Easy to use, easy to apply. Nice face tingle while it dried.  Cleaned pores well.  Skin softer.  Great product!</li>
            <li> My skin felt wonderful after using this product.  I already loved the Vitamin C line, but using this first made my face feel refreshed and smooth in a whole new way.  Felt like it helped my moisturizers and serum even more efficient.  I am so glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> Love this mask! It attends to my acne prone skin and also hydrates and replenishes skin! I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for a little at home spa day! A natural way to better skin!!</li>
            <li> My husband complimented how soft my skin was last night!  Love the &amp;#34;muddy face&amp;#34;  as a cleanser and softener!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully.cannot wait to reorder.very refreshing for the body</li>
