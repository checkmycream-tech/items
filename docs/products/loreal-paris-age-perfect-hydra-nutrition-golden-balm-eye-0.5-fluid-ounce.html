            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream - 1.7 oz.]].  </li>
            <li>I can honestly compare this to a brand I&#x27;ve used that cost me almost $200/jar.  </li>
            <li>It is was I. Was expecting my mother is happy with my gift to her. :) :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cream, itself has a nice consistency and it didn&#x27;t make me break out, as some heavier creams do.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again - it is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>It really is age perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product....</li>
            <li>The gal is absolutely correct who said the L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect eye balm contains Mineral oil</li>
            <li>Its nice and creamy,you don&#x27;t need to use a lot</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this eye cream since many I&#x27;ve tried bother my eyes because of ingredients they contain or scent.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very easily.  </li>
            <li>This cream is perfect for mature eye care.  </li>
            <li>It far from the best product on the market.  </li>
            <li>It feels great upon first application; however, 4 hours into the day, my eyes began to feel irritated and burn.</li>
            <li>Love this, have used for years</li>
            <li>Does my eye area feel softer and seem to have more moisture?</li>
            <li>Love, this product, so happy I was able to order it online, so much easier to get, since I had my Stroke.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working any magic, so after I use this pot up</li>
            <li>and i love</li>
            <li>Makes your face smooth as silk!</li>
            <li>packaging states that it rebuilds skin&#x27;s substance with soy seed proteins, improves elasticity for a more toned skin, helps fight the network of skin to promote resiliency (anti-crows feet), contains botanicals to help even out skin tone to reveal brighter skin.  </li>
            <li>Immediate results are stated as skin around the eye area appears brighter and more luminous.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your lines more pronouce.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to locate this at my local drugstore and was very happy to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s so pleased with the results, she&#x27;ll stay with it.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to have no irritation at all from this eye balm.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using Age Perfect Eye Balm for several weeks and can see a difference in the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for more.</li>
            <li>you have to use the top part of your nails to get this stuff out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Maybe it is more for a man with thicker skin..</li>
            <li>This was part of the Amazon Vine Program, so was able to try it at no cost.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, creamy, texture which goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok, I still like it.  </li>
            <li>This is my most used eye balm for daytime use.  </li>
            <li>sure helps with the aging process....</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>most of  L&#x27;oreal t items work  </li>
            <li>so I am sure I will like this product as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>I feel pretty good,</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the best I can do for now - this product didn&#x27;t WOW me right away.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the great price</li>
            <li>For women who have mature skin around the eye this works great.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t detect much scent so that was a good thing.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a good price right now, but if I&#x27;d paid full price, I would have been ticked off.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge improvement, but the skin around my eyes is smooth and it does seem a bit more toned.</li>
            <li>My wife has used the Age Perfect Golden Eye Balm for several years, says nothing else comes close to its&#x27; performance.</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream, not greasy nor heavy, excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>dark circles and bags under my eyes completely dissapeared,Age perfect by L&#x27;Oreal Love it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the one part of the description that I didn&#x27;t find to be true is the \\&quot;Skin-brightening\\&quot; part of this claim: \\&quot;Skin-brightening botanicals help even skin tone to reveal smoother, more refined skin around the eyes.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The cream is smooth and light, non greasy and feels good going on and absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>Have fine lines gone away?</li>
            <li>consider this item especially for winter, it&#x27;s creamy, balmy, rich texture perfect for the naked eye area wonderful price, can&#x27;t bit it!</li>
            <li>This eye balm didn&#x27;t knock me over with excitement, but it moisturized the area it was supposed to, and it felt light going on my skin.</li>
            <li>I found it smooth and soothing.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to use products that are paraben free, so this is not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li>The morning application helps my under eye concealer stay smooth during the day (I am 62).  </li>
            <li>I would purchase again as it is so comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and I can wear it under makeup.  </li>
            <li>And when you screw off the cap you see the jar seems to be filled with cream.  </li>
            <li>well however, this product goes on smooth can be used under make-up every day.</li>
            <li>It is much nicer than most that cost much more.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it does a good job of refreshing the eye area and relieving any redness.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This serves as a fairly rich cream which feels hydrating.  </li>
            <li>I am more concerned with more natural ingredients being in the formulation.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming fragrance, which I really like.</li>
            <li>It went on quickly and covered easily with just a quick application.  </li>
            <li>The fragrence is very soft and nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two weeks, and most manufacturers advise that you&#x27;ll see noticeable results in 4 weeks or more (usually more, of course!)</li>
            <li>though nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Like the sound of golden balm.  </li>
            <li>It is for \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot; and claims to help menopausal and post-menopausal skin rebuild its own substance.</li>
            <li>Ok I just finished using up the whole bottle of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands, and can&#x27;t say, that any thing else has worked better.  </li>
            <li>Here are the things she most likes about it: it is very light weight and non-greasy; it absorbs very quickly and completely; concealer applies very easily over it; and finally she has noticed that it really does refine the texture of the skin beneath the eyes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I found this overly effective, maybe I haven&#x27;t used it for a long enough time to see good results.  </li>
            <li>very hydrating!!</li>
            <li>The package further claims that in 4 weeks, 92% saw more skin elasticity, 83% saw firmer skin, fine and lines and wrinkles were reduced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed recently more fine lines popping up, especially when I smile.</li>
            <li>Very silky and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>They are fresh, we will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Hours later it would kind of ball up.</li>
            <li>A lot of creams aren&#x27;t absorbed but this one seems to be and doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it at night right before going to bed on freshly washed skin.</li>
            <li>This is rich and emollient cream, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>- it states that right in the ingredience.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, the rest of the product description really does ring true ...</li>
            <li>This product is really good, make my dark circles around eye gone.</li>
            <li>Use it first thing in the morning and right before bed, after removing makeup and cleansing face of course.</li>
            <li>For the price of less than $13, it&#x27;s a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to give them a try.  </li>
            <li>Really!  </li>
            <li>would be willing to buy again.</li>
            <li>Sh said the quality of this one is equal to or better than the rest of the product line.</li>
            <li>At first, I noticed a tingling, *</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently discovered the ROC line of products and they work better for me.</li>
            <li>My first time trying L&#x27;Oreal Skin Care products.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this over some of the higher-end products out there (many of which I have used, but were too sticky, greasy, glittery, etc.).</li>
            <li>My wife is the one who uses the product....has been using it since it first came</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice and thick, goes on easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to see some fine lines and decided it was worth it to try this out.</li>
            <li>I believe a daily routine of cleansing your face with a mild soap product, lightly patting it dry or not drying it, applying an eye cream and a face cream--every night and every morning will help to keep your skin moist and more youthful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have always been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Again, I was able to alleviate my chronic dry skin with this system.</li>
            <li>It works nicely and seems to slightly lift the skin around the</li>
            <li>I certainly see an improvement over the Boots No. 7 eye cream I had been using.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually creamy, absorbs very well, doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, and leaves NO residue in the morning.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice little jar of eye cream.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for a solid month to see if it really makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller of this product and prompt service sending it to my home.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye balm.  </li>
            <li>the skin around my eyes feel much softer and appear to have a smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li>I do use it during the day over my foundation for a bit of brightness and it&#x27;s light enough to not smudge my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I gently pat this around and underneath my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dab it on in dots around your eyes and then gently massage it in.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this will work really well for me in winter, when heaters turn my skin into the Sahara.  </li>
            <li>If your eye area tends to get oily, you&#x27;ll want to avoid this or use very sparingly.</li>
            <li>IT DID ABSOLUTELY NADA FOR THE PUFFINESS (BAGS) under both of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Very odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfecting Eye Balm is a very soothing product.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>This product provides intense moisture which reduces the appearance of wrinkles in the eye area.  </li>
            <li>This product plumps up the skin and under eye concealer goes on very well and does not cake.</li>
            <li>Will come back and edit this review as to how it works as far as reducing the appearance of those lines and more from appearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But when you dab into the cream you break the top skin and see that its HOLLOW inside the jar!</li>
            <li>good eye balm that I found was non-irritating but I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t reduce eye puffiness effectively.</li>
            <li>While not giving it full credit for those results, it was part of a regimen that DID and continues to work, and I would definitely use this again.</li>
            <li>After using this product regularly for 4 weeks, I have not noticed a major difference in the appearance of fine lines or puffiness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I do like this eye balm, it sinks in within a minute or two and it does minimize fine lines and hydrate.</li>
            <li>I have not really noticed any improvement of the fine wrinkles that I am trying to treat.  </li>
            <li>While I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, I had hoped for a little more noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since learned to apply it a little more generously.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, but I did not find the results as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll keep watching (and trying not to squint to see them as I kinda think that might be the cause of those fine lines in the first place) and will report back with an update if something changes (for better or worse).</li>
            <li>Great product Sorry it has been discontinued by Loreal</li>
            <li>The fines lines need more work but as this is not an instant eye smoother/plumper but a long term solution to dryness and elasticity I will see what it looks like after a month of use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick, and made me think it was doing something!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had thinning dry eyelids that came with age and were most noticable during flu season last year.</li>
            <li>I will be making this product my new preferred eye cream</li>
            <li>While not giving it full credit for those results, it was part of a regimen that DID and continues to work, and I would definitely use this again.product switching-off with others, I have to say any lines underneath and around my eyes are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and quite soothing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I primarily got this product to help reduce dark circles under my eyes, but also thought the added benefit of skin smoothening/softening would be welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>eye lines seem to be less noticeable, but that is on my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of creams and gels, so I thought I&#x27;d try this one from L&#x27;Oreal since I have used some of their other anti-aging products and been pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since there&#x27;s nothing I can do about the salt-and-pepper hair I&#x27;ve earned, I&#x27;d like to think I can keep certain areas on my face looking young, especially underneath my eyes and getting rid of the \\&quot;frown lines\\&quot; on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>but I can just as easily use the other facial cream.</li>
            <li>Makes my eye area feel soft and look smoother.  </li>
            <li>I think it may be time, to get into this cream, for my mature skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 58-year YOUNG man, and admit wanting to stay looking young.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the skin around the eyes soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>This product does not make my eye area sensitive at all, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Maybe my eye balm was old?</li>
            <li>I have some wrinkles on my upper eyelid, especially when I smile.</li>
            <li>There was no unpleasant scent and no sensations on the skin, other than a feeling of being moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be just as good as the extremely expensive skin care.</li>
            <li>There may be a very slight improvement, possibly from the skin just being more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Although the product does have some moisturizing effects, I haven&#x27;t noticed any marked improvements as far as a reduction in dark circles, which is the main reason I wanted the product in the first place.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid 30s and have dry skin and the beginning of fine lines, and I recently tried this with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Such a tiny amount works, that the price is actually very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this eye balm since I have only had minor success with others.</li>
            <li>Bought this highly recommended product for &#x27;crepe eyes&#x27; which means it would be applied on the upper lid area.</li>
            <li>The hard glass container with plastic lid is 1 5/8 inches wide in diameter x 1 1/2 high and suitable for packing.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and has very little scent.  </li>
            <li>I have really really dry under-eye skin, which leads to a rough texture and prevents makeup from sitting smoothly on the skin.</li>
            <li>Not thick and hydration enough</li>
            <li>Although it moisturized my eye area, I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my little lines or in puffiness.</li>
            <li>It seems like a thicker cream, but it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it seems oily and the oiliness doesn&#x27;t dissipate  much after a full night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li>But I do have one major beef with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>The eye balm moisturizes those little laugh lines around the eye and softens them.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and silky and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The box looks a bit battered, and the texture was a bit too hard and did not apply on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t need much at all, and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update as of 5/31/14:  Well, it&#x27;s been close to a year, and while I&#x27;ve used this product switching-off with others, I have to say any lines underneath and around my eyes are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>If your eyes are sensitive to mineral oil, either skip this product or apply it only to your under-eye area.  </li>
            <li>This product works well with my sensitive skin, causing no adverse reaction after over a month of daily use.</li>
            <li>The ingredient touted by this product is soy seed proteins which \\&quot;stimulate the synthesis of natural fibers found in younger skin.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Other than keeping skin moist it really didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, creamy, and (for me, at least) non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no real way to be objective about this, but I do think that the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Hasn&#x27;t made a noticeable effect on my very puffy eyelids and only minimal effect on puffiness below the eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t have any trouble with burning or stinging on my upper lids while using it, and I do have pretty sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have found that as I get older, I have become obsessed with keeping my eyes from developing any fine lines around them.</li>
            <li>, the dark circles are much better/almost gone now.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how soy seeds or other botanicals will help those areas stay firm, smooth and wrinkle-free (or as close to it as I can get),</li>
            <li>but then I live in an allergy zone, so puffiness is a little hard to get rid of! :)</li>
            <li>As a 40+ with really no wrinkles other than around the eyes, I got this product to help with dark under eye circles and fine lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>You get this little jar that looks reasonably sized.  </li>
            <li>This is the only eye cream I have used that truly moisturizes my very dry skin around my 57 year old eyes.</li>

            <li> I can honestly compare this to a brand I&#x27;ve used that cost me almost $200/jar.  </li>
            <li> It is was I. Was expecting my mother is happy with my gift to her. :) :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cream, itself has a nice consistency and it didn&#x27;t make me break out, as some heavier creams do.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again - it is a nice product.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product....</li>

            <li> Its nice and creamy,you don&#x27;t need to use a lot</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this eye cream since many I&#x27;ve tried bother my eyes because of ingredients they contain or scent.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very easily.  </li>
            <li> This cream is perfect for mature eye care.  </li>
            <li> It far from the best product on the market.  </li>
            <li> It feels great upon first application; however, 4 hours into the day, my eyes began to feel irritated and burn.</li>
            <li> Love this, have used for years</li>
            <li> Does my eye area feel softer and seem to have more moisture?</li>
            <li> Love, this product, so happy I was able to order it online, so much easier to get, since I had my Stroke.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>

            <li> and i love</li>
            <li> Makes your face smooth as silk!</li>
            <li> packaging states that it rebuilds skin&#x27;s substance with soy seed proteins, improves elasticity for a more toned skin, helps fight the network of skin to promote resiliency (anti-crows feet), contains botanicals to help even out skin tone to reveal brighter skin.  </li>
            <li> Immediate results are stated as skin around the eye area appears brighter and more luminous.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your lines more pronouce.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to locate this at my local drugstore and was very happy to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s so pleased with the results, she&#x27;ll stay with it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to have no irritation at all from this eye balm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using Age Perfect Eye Balm for several weeks and can see a difference in the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for more.</li>
            <li> you have to use the top part of your nails to get this stuff out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Maybe it is more for a man with thicker skin..</li>
            <li> This was part of the Amazon Vine Program, so was able to try it at no cost.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, creamy, texture which goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok, I still like it.  </li>
            <li> This is my most used eye balm for daytime use.  </li>
            <li> sure helps with the aging process....</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> most of  L&#x27;oreal t items work  </li>
            <li> so I am sure I will like this product as well.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> I feel pretty good,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the best I can do for now - this product didn&#x27;t WOW me right away.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the great price</li>
            <li> For women who have mature skin around the eye this works great.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t detect much scent so that was a good thing.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a good price right now, but if I&#x27;d paid full price, I would have been ticked off.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge improvement, but the skin around my eyes is smooth and it does seem a bit more toned.</li>
            <li> My wife has used the Age Perfect Golden Eye Balm for several years, says nothing else comes close to its&#x27; performance.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream, not greasy nor heavy, excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> dark circles and bags under my eyes completely dissapeared,Age perfect by L&#x27;Oreal Love it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the one part of the description that I didn&#x27;t find to be true is the \\&quot;Skin-brightening\\&quot; part of this claim: \\&quot;Skin-brightening botanicals help even skin tone to reveal smoother, more refined skin around the eyes.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The cream is smooth and light, non greasy and feels good going on and absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> Have fine lines gone away?</li>
            <li> consider this item especially for winter, it&#x27;s creamy, balmy, rich texture perfect for the naked eye area wonderful price, can&#x27;t bit it!</li>
            <li> This eye balm didn&#x27;t knock me over with excitement, but it moisturized the area it was supposed to, and it felt light going on my skin.</li>
            <li> I found it smooth and soothing.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use products that are paraben free, so this is not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The morning application helps my under eye concealer stay smooth during the day (I am 62).  </li>
            <li> I would purchase again as it is so comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and I can wear it under makeup.  </li>
            <li> And when you screw off the cap you see the jar seems to be filled with cream.  </li>
            <li> well however, this product goes on smooth can be used under make-up every day.</li>
            <li> It is much nicer than most that cost much more.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it does a good job of refreshing the eye area and relieving any redness.</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This serves as a fairly rich cream which feels hydrating.  </li>
            <li> I am more concerned with more natural ingredients being in the formulation.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming fragrance, which I really like.</li>
            <li> It went on quickly and covered easily with just a quick application.  </li>
            <li> The fragrence is very soft and nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two weeks, and most manufacturers advise that you&#x27;ll see noticeable results in 4 weeks or more (usually more, of course!)</li>
            <li> though nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Like the sound of golden balm.  </li>
            <li> It is for \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot; and claims to help menopausal and post-menopausal skin rebuild its own substance.</li>
            <li> Ok I just finished using up the whole bottle of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands, and can&#x27;t say, that any thing else has worked better.  </li>
            <li> Here are the things she most likes about it: it is very light weight and non-greasy; it absorbs very quickly and completely; concealer applies very easily over it; and finally she has noticed that it really does refine the texture of the skin beneath the eyes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I found this overly effective, maybe I haven&#x27;t used it for a long enough time to see good results.  </li>
            <li> very hydrating!!</li>
            <li> The package further claims that in 4 weeks, 92% saw more skin elasticity, 83% saw firmer skin, fine and lines and wrinkles were reduced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed recently more fine lines popping up, especially when I smile.</li>
            <li> Very silky and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> They are fresh, we will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Hours later it would kind of ball up.</li>
            <li> A lot of creams aren&#x27;t absorbed but this one seems to be and doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it at night right before going to bed on freshly washed skin.</li>
            <li> This is rich and emollient cream, very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> - it states that right in the ingredience.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, the rest of the product description really does ring true ...</li>
            <li> This product is really good, make my dark circles around eye gone.</li>
            <li> Use it first thing in the morning and right before bed, after removing makeup and cleansing face of course.</li>
            <li> For the price of less than $13, it&#x27;s a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to give them a try.  </li>
            <li> Really!  </li>
            <li> would be willing to buy again.</li>
            <li> Sh said the quality of this one is equal to or better than the rest of the product line.</li>
            <li> At first, I noticed a tingling, *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered the ROC line of products and they work better for me.</li>
            <li> My first time trying L&#x27;Oreal Skin Care products.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this over some of the higher-end products out there (many of which I have used, but were too sticky, greasy, glittery, etc.).</li>
            <li> My wife is the one who uses the product....has been using it since it first came</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice and thick, goes on easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see some fine lines and decided it was worth it to try this out.</li>
            <li> I believe a daily routine of cleansing your face with a mild soap product, lightly patting it dry or not drying it, applying an eye cream and a face cream--every night and every morning will help to keep your skin moist and more youthful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have always been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Again, I was able to alleviate my chronic dry skin with this system.</li>
            <li> It works nicely and seems to slightly lift the skin around the</li>
            <li> I certainly see an improvement over the Boots No. 7 eye cream I had been using.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually creamy, absorbs very well, doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, and leaves NO residue in the morning.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice little jar of eye cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for a solid month to see if it really makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller of this product and prompt service sending it to my home.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye balm.  </li>
            <li> the skin around my eyes feel much softer and appear to have a smoother appearance.  </li>
            <li> I do use it during the day over my foundation for a bit of brightness and it&#x27;s light enough to not smudge my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I gently pat this around and underneath my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dab it on in dots around your eyes and then gently massage it in.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this will work really well for me in winter, when heaters turn my skin into the Sahara.  </li>
            <li> If your eye area tends to get oily, you&#x27;ll want to avoid this or use very sparingly.</li>
            <li> IT DID ABSOLUTELY NADA FOR THE PUFFINESS (BAGS) under both of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Very odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfecting Eye Balm is a very soothing product.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> This product provides intense moisture which reduces the appearance of wrinkles in the eye area.  </li>
            <li> This product plumps up the skin and under eye concealer goes on very well and does not cake.</li>
            <li> Will come back and edit this review as to how it works as far as reducing the appearance of those lines and more from appearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when you dab into the cream you break the top skin and see that its HOLLOW inside the jar!</li>
            <li> good eye balm that I found was non-irritating but I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t reduce eye puffiness effectively.</li>
            <li> While not giving it full credit for those results, it was part of a regimen that DID and continues to work, and I would definitely use this again.</li>
            <li> After using this product regularly for 4 weeks, I have not noticed a major difference in the appearance of fine lines or puffiness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I do like this eye balm, it sinks in within a minute or two and it does minimize fine lines and hydrate.</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed any improvement of the fine wrinkles that I am trying to treat.  </li>
            <li> While I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, I had hoped for a little more noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since learned to apply it a little more generously.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but I did not find the results as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll keep watching (and trying not to squint to see them as I kinda think that might be the cause of those fine lines in the first place) and will report back with an update if something changes (for better or worse).</li>
            <li> Great product Sorry it has been discontinued by Loreal</li>
            <li> The fines lines need more work but as this is not an instant eye smoother/plumper but a long term solution to dryness and elasticity I will see what it looks like after a month of use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick, and made me think it was doing something!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had thinning dry eyelids that came with age and were most noticable during flu season last year.</li>
            <li> I will be making this product my new preferred eye cream</li>
            <li> While not giving it full credit for those results, it was part of a regimen that DID and continues to work, and I would definitely use this again.product switching-off with others, I have to say any lines underneath and around my eyes are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft and quite soothing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> I primarily got this product to help reduce dark circles under my eyes, but also thought the added benefit of skin smoothening/softening would be welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> eye lines seem to be less noticeable, but that is on my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of creams and gels, so I thought I&#x27;d try this one from L&#x27;Oreal since I have used some of their other anti-aging products and been pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since there&#x27;s nothing I can do about the salt-and-pepper hair I&#x27;ve earned, I&#x27;d like to think I can keep certain areas on my face looking young, especially underneath my eyes and getting rid of the \\&quot;frown lines\\&quot; on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> but I can just as easily use the other facial cream.</li>
            <li> Makes my eye area feel soft and look smoother.  </li>
            <li> I think it may be time, to get into this cream, for my mature skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 58-year YOUNG man, and admit wanting to stay looking young.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the skin around the eyes soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> This product does not make my eye area sensitive at all, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Maybe my eye balm was old?</li>
            <li> I have some wrinkles on my upper eyelid, especially when I smile.</li>
            <li> There was no unpleasant scent and no sensations on the skin, other than a feeling of being moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be just as good as the extremely expensive skin care.</li>
            <li> There may be a very slight improvement, possibly from the skin just being more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Although the product does have some moisturizing effects, I haven&#x27;t noticed any marked improvements as far as a reduction in dark circles, which is the main reason I wanted the product in the first place.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30s and have dry skin and the beginning of fine lines, and I recently tried this with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Such a tiny amount works, that the price is actually very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this eye balm since I have only had minor success with others.</li>
            <li> Bought this highly recommended product for &#x27;crepe eyes&#x27; which means it would be applied on the upper lid area.</li>
            <li> The hard glass container with plastic lid is 1 5/8 inches wide in diameter x 1 1/2 high and suitable for packing.  </li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and has very little scent.  </li>
            <li> I have really really dry under-eye skin, which leads to a rough texture and prevents makeup from sitting smoothly on the skin.</li>
            <li> Not thick and hydration enough</li>
            <li> Although it moisturized my eye area, I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my little lines or in puffiness.</li>
            <li> It seems like a thicker cream, but it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems oily and the oiliness doesn&#x27;t dissipate  much after a full night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li> But I do have one major beef with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> The eye balm moisturizes those little laugh lines around the eye and softens them.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and silky and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The box looks a bit battered, and the texture was a bit too hard and did not apply on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t need much at all, and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update as of 5/31/14:  Well, it&#x27;s been close to a year, and while I&#x27;ve used this product switching-off with others, I have to say any lines underneath and around my eyes are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> If your eyes are sensitive to mineral oil, either skip this product or apply it only to your under-eye area.  </li>
            <li> This product works well with my sensitive skin, causing no adverse reaction after over a month of daily use.</li>
            <li> The ingredient touted by this product is soy seed proteins which \\&quot;stimulate the synthesis of natural fibers found in younger skin.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Other than keeping skin moist it really didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich, creamy, and (for me, at least) non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no real way to be objective about this, but I do think that the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t made a noticeable effect on my very puffy eyelids and only minimal effect on puffiness below the eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t have any trouble with burning or stinging on my upper lids while using it, and I do have pretty sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have found that as I get older, I have become obsessed with keeping my eyes from developing any fine lines around them.</li>
            <li> , the dark circles are much better/almost gone now.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how soy seeds or other botanicals will help those areas stay firm, smooth and wrinkle-free (or as close to it as I can get),</li>
            <li> but then I live in an allergy zone, so puffiness is a little hard to get rid of! :)</li>
            <li> As a 40+ with really no wrinkles other than around the eyes, I got this product to help with dark under eye circles and fine lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> You get this little jar that looks reasonably sized.  </li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream I have used that truly moisturizes my very dry skin around my 57 year old eyes.</li>
            <li> also not sure that I buy into certain moisturizers specifically made for \\&quot;mature skin,\\&quot; or \\&quot;thinner skin\\&quot; due to age.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it really helps with wrinkles</li>
            <li> I also spend a lot of time outside when it&#x27;s nice out, so I&#x27;ve need a serious dose of moisture the past few months.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately I have not seen them realized very well.  </li>
            <li> This balm is very soothing and feels thick and enriching not like a cream.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m slightly younger than the target for this product (no really, I am!), but I want to do some preventative treatments before I reach \\&quot;that\\&quot; age.</li>
            <li> No problems with under eye application, so I will add this jar to the other jars for &#x27;under eye&#x27; use only.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy, but it stays moist much longer than anticipated.</li>
            <li> but they are at the bottom of a very long list of ingredients, to include proteins, and root extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for very long (3 weeks)</li>
            <li> My eye area always feels so dry after washing my face ...</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes still feels dry after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> and they claim to reduce wrinkles, but they dry you out and make them all puckered.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it has not bothered my eyes (upper or lower lid) in the least.</li>
            <li> Overall,  I rate this product as average.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed in a couple weeks, that my upper lids seem less saggy, so anti-sagging and brightening, it does as promised.</li>
            <li> although only been using for 3o days have noticed a slight difference.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit is enough and I am beginning to see a small difference.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for a month and the tiny jar is half gone.  </li>
            <li> A very lush, moisturizer for the delicate skin around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> For that little deception I&#x27;m giving this product only 2 stars.</li>
            <li> All I know is that it was very thick, which meant I had to really tug at my eyes to apply and it did not soak in.</li>
            <li> Not much difference in puffiness,</li>
            <li> but if it did, it was minimal.  </li>
            <li> Also it stings my upper lid for a few minutes after application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products as most women do and found this no better than less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I typically use it at night, though if my eye skin feels dry, I&#x27;ll apply in the morning, too.  </li>
            <li> This little jar lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> small lines underneath my eyes and reduce larger ones on my forehead, where the frown lines are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She applied it usually twice daily: out of the shower and before bed.</li>
            <li> The Loreal eye cream is extremely moisterizing.  </li>
            <li> will say I think it&#x27;s a little expensive for the amount you get - about 3 weeks&#x27; worth</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a heavy eye balm, and it seems to even wait down the skin under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not young, and have bought allot of eye creams,but this is the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> have used other L&#x27;Oreal products with out any problems before this one!&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got this, and as I said, after two days, I now have dark circles and Puffiness under my eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does what is says puffiness gone as well as dark circles will continue&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li> Did nothing for dark spots either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought dozens of eye creams targeted towards wrinkles, dark circles, and anti-aging..</li>
            <li> After 1 week I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes had almost disappeared.</li>
            <li> the down side.</li>
            <li> Just focusing on that seems to plump the skin a little to help with the other issues.</li>
            <li> it costs a lot less than the brand I was buying at the department store and works just as well.</li>
            <li> Not even half of what you thought you might be getting.  </li>
            <li> The dark areas are a little lighter.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream/lotion, and a little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> A little thicker than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> almost* stinging, sensation when I put the cream on, but after a few nights, I didn&#x27;t notice it any longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this once a day, applying before bed as I found it too heavy for daytime use in the Texas</li>
            <li> Did not seem to have any benefit, and was beginning to irritate the eyes a bit, so stopped using it after a few days.</li>
            <li> I find i cannot use this product,a few minutes after using it</li>
            <li> I apply it a few times a day &amp; it seems to make my lines disappear for a bit.</li>
            <li> I also have really pronounced circles under my eyes, and the dryness makes it worse because the skin appears thin and sunken in.</li>
            <li> Item arrived a bit stiff and did not blend well just sat all clumpy under my eyes,had to wipe off and remove</li>
            <li> but we can try to slow down the wear and tear on our bodies a little!  </li>
            <li> It softened and plumped up my otherwise dry and thin skin.</li>
            <li> a little to oily for me, hard to rub in and feels greasy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little thick</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m guilty of trying different moisturizers that say they&#x27;ll \\&quot;get rid of wrinkles, frown lines, and keep my skin looking like...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> However, she is not sure she would purchase based on this trial bottle.</li>
            <li> I am not  sure if I can say it if it is beneficial or not.  </li>
            <li> the date of manufacture is 20k604,just near the expiration date.they didn&#x27;t  mention it,it&#x27;s so bad.</li>
            <li> I used this product for at least a month, and noticed no changes whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It is especially beneficial during cold Midwest winters.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is so thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> While I thought the face cream was too thick and</li>
            <li> I thought this product was too thick and felt waxy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hydrating....and THICK.</li>
            <li> The balm is so thick.</li>
            <li> I am terrible at regularly using ANY product except my daily face cream.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick and hard to pat on around the eye&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> (Not good).</li>
            <li> Mineral oil not good for the eye area.  </li>
            <li> will reduce those lines and keep my skin looking youthful (at the very least, look like it&#x27;s not getting any older!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> But hopefully, this product will keep it from getting worse.  </li>
            <li> I just have a difficult time using creams around my eyes.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately its not for me,but</li>
            <li> so I had to wait for delivery and to my disappointment</li>
            <li> however the box is dirty and rotten.</li>
            <li> have a lot of puffiness under the eyes that is mainly do to a bad thyroid.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Because of the intermittent swelling, it has caused wrinkles in that area, which I just hate.  </li>
            <li> The package is very bad .And</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes the eye area wonderfully hydrated!</li>
            <li> I like this product and I use it every day.  Like the sound of golden balm.  I&#x27;ve been a repeat buyer</li>
            <li> Great service and great product.  I was surprised at the great price this item was.  Thanks to the seller of this product and prompt service sending it to my home.  I like this product because it goes on your skin smoothly, does not feel oily and is a great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product for around my eyes!</li>
            <li> Have always loved L&#x27;Oreal and this price was great too.  Will continue to purchase this item. Looking for a larger size next time.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream I have used that truly moisturizes my very dry skin around my 57 year old eyes. It&#x27;s better than any of the expensive creams. I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> Love this, have used for years</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m slightly younger than the target for this product (no really, I am!), but I want to do some preventative treatments before I reach \\&quot;that\\&quot; age. I&#x27;m starting to see some fine lines and decided it was worth it to try this out. However. I am terrible at regularly using ANY product except my daily face cream. Honest to goodness. So I have used the product several times. I have sensitive skin and it has not bothered my eyes (upper or lower lid) in the least. Your skin mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I haven&#x27;t used it for a solid month to see if it really makes a HUGE difference. Does my eye area feel softer and seem to have more moisture? Absolutely. Have fine lines gone away? Not yet. But I&#x27;ll keep watching (and trying not to squint to see them as I kinda think that might be the cause of those fine lines in the first place) and will report back with an update if something changes (for better or worse). That&#x27;s the best I can do for now - this product didn&#x27;t WOW me right away.</li>
            <li> This eye balm didn&#x27;t knock me over with excitement, but it moisturized the area it was supposed to, and it felt light going on my skin. It felt weightless as the day progressed--so, it didn&#x27;t fail.&lt;br /&gt;I say try it...each person is different. I am more concerned with more natural ingredients being in the formulation.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this since it came on the market.  it&#x27;s a little thick but i guess it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Love, this product, so happy I was able to order it online, so much easier to get, since I had my Stroke.</li>
            <li> Bought this highly recommended product for &#x27;crepe eyes&#x27; which means it would be applied on the upper lid area. No ingredient listing on product information page so I had to wait for delivery and to my disappointment, mineral oil is the 3rd ingredient. Still, influenced by the recommendations, I began using this product. It feels great upon first application; however, 4 hours into the day, my eyes began to feel irritated and burn. No problems with under eye application, so I will add this jar to the other jars for &#x27;under eye&#x27; use only.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It has helped with lines and discoloration.  I will continue to use this now that I have found it.</li>
            <li> This face cream makes you feel like you have the most expensive cream on your eyes.  Feels just wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Along with the serum, I can definitely tell a difference and I am already 69!</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect for mature eye care.  Is has been great for the sensitivity that I experience in the eye area.  Helps keep the skin firmer . I haven&#x27;t found a cream to do as well as this.</li>
            <li> After using this product regularly for 4 weeks, I have not noticed a major difference in the appearance of fine lines or puffiness around my eyes.  There may be a very slight improvement, possibly from the skin just being more hydrated.  I don&#x27;t find the product greasy at all, as some others have reviewed.  I found it smooth and soothing.  It absorbs very easily.  There was no unpleasant scent and no sensations on the skin, other than a feeling of being moisturized.  While I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, I had hoped for a little more noticeable improvement.  I will continue to use this product to finish the jar.  I&#x27;ll add to the review if there are any additional results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 with fair, freckled skin. I&#x27;ve noticed recently more fine lines popping up, especially when I smile. I also spend a lot of time outside when it&#x27;s nice out, so I&#x27;ve need a serious dose of moisture the past few months. I do like this eye balm, it sinks in within a minute or two and it does minimize fine lines and hydrate. I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks and prefer to use it at night before bed. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming fragrance, which I really like. Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working any magic, so after I use this pot up I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this product again.  It had the same texture and feel of one of their facial creams.  It performed well but I can just as easily use the other facial cream.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is so thick and creamy.  It is much nicer than most that cost much more.  The fragrence is very soft and nice.  Makes my eye area feel soft and look smoother.  Will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> THis is described as a balm. I use it at night right before going to bed on freshly washed skin. I pat it around the eye area. Overall, it does a good job of refreshing the eye area and relieving any redness. My only complaint is that it seems oily and the oiliness doesn&#x27;t dissipate  much after a full night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye balm.  I&#x27;ve been using anti aging creams, around my eyes, since I was 13 and I&#x27;m now 60.  I&#x27;ve used many different brands, and can&#x27;t say, that any thing else has worked better.  I think it may be time, to get into this cream, for my mature skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed in a couple weeks, that my upper lids seem less saggy, so anti-sagging and brightening, it does as promised.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30s and have dry skin and the beginning of fine lines, and I recently tried this with [[ASIN:B002PBHQP4 L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream - 1.7 oz.]].  While I thought the face cream was too thick and perfume-y, I really liked this eye cream!  It&#x27;s nice and thick, and made me think it was doing something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I think it&#x27;s a little expensive for the amount you get - about 3 weeks&#x27; worth, I estimate.  Amazon has a good price right now, but if I&#x27;d paid full price, I would have been ticked off.  Also, if I had to buy an eye cream, I would buy one with retinol in it.  This one does not have retinol.  But it seems to be hydrating, so if that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re looking for, give this a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 58-year YOUNG man, and admit wanting to stay looking young.  Since there&#x27;s nothing I can do about the salt-and-pepper hair I&#x27;ve earned, I&#x27;d like to think I can keep certain areas on my face looking young, especially underneath my eyes and getting rid of the \\&quot;frown lines\\&quot; on my forehead.  So, I&#x27;m guilty of trying different moisturizers that say they&#x27;ll \\&quot;get rid of wrinkles, frown lines, and keep my skin looking like...\\&quot; well, you know, everything they claim to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how soy seeds or other botanicals will help those areas stay firm, smooth and wrinkle-free (or as close to it as I can get), but I&#x27;m willing to give them a try.  Towards that end, I decided to try L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s \\&quot;Age Perfect\\&quot; eye cream. It&#x27;s actually creamy, absorbs very well, doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance, and leaves NO residue in the morning.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen, which I like, as I prefer to choose which sunscreen I&#x27;ll use on my face, if any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not sure that I buy into certain moisturizers specifically made for \\&quot;mature skin,\\&quot; or \\&quot;thinner skin\\&quot; due to age.  I just want a product that will reduce (if not eliminate), small lines underneath my eyes and reduce larger ones on my forehead, where the frown lines are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two weeks, and most manufacturers advise that you&#x27;ll see noticeable results in 4 weeks or more (usually more, of course!), it&#x27;s too soon to know if this will be THE product I&#x27;m looking for that will reduce those lines and keep my skin looking youthful (at the very least, look like it&#x27;s not getting any older!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on the plus side, it&#x27;s pleasant to use and like I said above, absorbs well, so that&#x27;s about all anyone can ask from a product as this for now.  Will come back and edit this review as to how it works as far as reducing the appearance of those lines and more from appearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 5/31/14:  Well, it&#x27;s been close to a year, and while I&#x27;ve used this product switching-off with others, I have to say any lines underneath and around my eyes are barely noticeable.  While not giving it full credit for those results, it was part of a regimen that DID and continues to work, and I would definitely use this again.product switching-off with others, I have to say any lines underneath and around my eyes are barely noticeable.

            <li> I primarily got this product to help reduce dark circles under my eyes, but also thought the added benefit of skin smoothening/softening would be welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the one part of the description that I didn&#x27;t find to be true is the \\&quot;Skin-brightening\\&quot; part of this claim: \\&quot;Skin-brightening botanicals help even skin tone to reveal smoother, more refined skin around the eyes.\\&quot;  Having said that, the rest of the product description really does ring true ... the skin around my eyes feel much softer and appear to have a smoother appearance.  So, if that&#x27;s what you are after then this product is for you!</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product.. and am glad that I can  order  it through amazon..</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before and i love it does what is says puffiness gone as well as dark circles will continue&lt;br /&gt;to purchase when i run out.</li>
            <li> My eye area always feels so dry after washing my face ... this stuff feels like I&#x27;m adding a layer of moisture - Really!  I can honestly compare this to a brand I&#x27;ve used that cost me almost $200/jar.  Remember - I use this for hydration, not wrinkles ... I still have those after all the products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> This three part system is great. Again, I was able to alleviate my chronic dry skin with this system. I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was too thick and felt waxy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hydrating....and THICK. Need to rub it in palm before applying. Other than keeping skin moist it really didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. Never even finished the jar.</li>
            <li> although only been using for 3o days have noticed a slight difference. I guess I need to use longer. eye lines seem to be less noticeable, but that is on my fine lines. still have crows feet and wonder if using this longer will correct that or now. goes on smooth and silky and a little goes a long way. would be willing to buy again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but unfortunately I have not seen them realized very well.  Although the product does have some moisturizing effects, I haven&#x27;t noticed any marked improvements as far as a reduction in dark circles, which is the main reason I wanted the product in the first place.</li>
            <li> Over priced for the results. A little goes a long way, but I did not find the results as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> Time was perfect. It is was I. Was expecting my mother is happy with my gift to her. :) :)</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes your face smooth as silk!</li>
            <li> It has only been a couple of weeks but my wife said she notices a difference. She has always used and been very happy with L-Oreal products. Sh said the quality of this one is equal to or better than the rest of the product line. We will be ordering this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have found that as I get older, I have become obsessed with keeping my eyes from developing any fine lines around them. I have tried many different types of creams and gels, so I thought I&#x27;d try this one from L&#x27;Oreal since I have used some of their other anti-aging products and been pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream, itself has a nice consistency and it didn&#x27;t make me break out, as some heavier creams do. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge improvement, but the skin around my eyes is smooth and it does seem a bit more toned. I have been using it morning and night as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the down side. This product, while having some key ingredients to improve aging skin, also contains parabens. I prefer to use products that are paraben free, so this is not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  Leaves the skin around the eyes soft and moist.  Use it first thing in the morning and right before bed, after removing makeup and cleansing face of course. The hard glass container with plastic lid is 1 5/8 inches wide in diameter x 1 1/2 high and suitable for packing.  It has a creamy consistency and does appear to brighten the eye area.  It works nicely and seems to slightly lift the skin around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging states that it rebuilds skin&#x27;s substance with soy seed proteins, improves elasticity for a more toned skin, helps fight the network of skin to promote resiliency (anti-crows feet), contains botanicals to help even out skin tone to reveal brighter skin.  It says it is dermatologist tested, opthamologist tested and non-greasy.  It is for \\&quot;mature skin\\&quot; and claims to help menopausal and post-menopausal skin rebuild its own substance. Immediate results are stated as skin around the eye area appears brighter and more luminous.  The package further claims that in 4 weeks, 92% saw more skin elasticity, 83% saw firmer skin, fine and lines and wrinkles were reduced.  There are some parabens listed in the ingredients but they are at the bottom of a very long list of ingredients, to include proteins, and root extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again - it is a nice product.  I believe a daily routine of cleansing your face with a mild soap product, lightly patting it dry or not drying it, applying an eye cream and a face cream--every night and every morning will help to keep your skin moist and more youthful.</li>
            <li> I used this product for at least a month, and noticed no changes whatsoever.  AND it feels greasy on the skin.  It&#x27;s not worth either the list price or Amazon&#x27;s reduced price.  It would get zero stars if that were an option!</li>
            <li> I needed a product that provided moisture to my eye area. This product does a great job. It doesn&#x27;t make your lines more pronouce.</li>
            <li> My wife has used the Age Perfect Golden Eye Balm for several years, says nothing else comes close to its&#x27; performance.</li>
            <li> since I purchased age perfect work wonders for me,dark circles and bags under my eyes completely dissapeared,Age perfect by L&#x27;Oreal Love it!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed. The skin under my eyes still feels dry after applying the cream. I wish I could find something similar to L&#x27;oreal Idealist eye cream.</li>
            <li> This little jar lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s rich, creamy, and (for me, at least) non-irritating.  I only use it under my eyes, both morning and night.  The morning application helps my under eye concealer stay smooth during the day (I am 62).  I have not been able to locate this at my local drugstore and was very happy to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is really good, make my dark circles around eye gone. I love it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> A little thicker than I&#x27;m used to. Seemed like I was having to do a lot of tugging at the skin around the eyes just to apply it. (Not good). I&#x27;ve since learned to apply it a little more generously.  Does a good job hydrating the eye area. Does nothing for under-eye circles. (I haven&#x27;t found a product that does). Overall,  I rate this product as average.</li>
            <li> Not thick and hydration enough</li>
            <li> As a 40+ with really no wrinkles other than around the eyes, I got this product to help with dark under eye circles and fine lines around the eyes.  I have been using the product for two weeks now, and it did help with noticeably brightening the eye area, the dark circles are much better/almost gone now.  The fines lines need more work but as this is not an instant eye smoother/plumper but a long term solution to dryness and elasticity I will see what it looks like after a month of use.  The cream is smooth and light, non greasy and feels good going on and absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little jar of eye cream. I didn&#x27;t detect much scent so that was a good thing. Very silky and goes on smooth. Although it moisturized my eye area, I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my little lines or in puffiness. I do use it during the day over my foundation for a bit of brightness and it&#x27;s light enough to not smudge my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this eye cream since many I&#x27;ve tried bother my eyes because of ingredients they contain or scent.  This balm has no scent that I can detect and it caused no problems with my allergies.  It went on quickly and covered easily with just a quick application.  It lasted all day.  I would say to apply it twice a day, morning and night.  It does ease the deepness of the crows feet and help illuminate the eyes.  Nothing is going to make time go backwards but we can try to slow down the wear and tear on our bodies a little!  I will be making this product my new preferred eye cream&lt;br /&gt;and it costs a lot less than the brand I was buying at the department store and works just as well.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife, who&#x27;s been using a competing product for a number of years now. She&#x27;s a retired college professor in her sixties. She&#x27;s fair complected and she wanted to try the product for a couple of weeks, but she&#x27;s so pleased with the results, she&#x27;ll stay with it. She applied it usually twice daily: out of the shower and before bed. Here are the things she most likes about it: it is very light weight and non-greasy; it absorbs very quickly and completely; concealer applies very easily over it; and finally she has noticed that it really does refine the texture of the skin beneath the eyes. It really is age perfect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every night for two weeks now.  At first, I noticed a tingling, *almost* stinging, sensation when I put the cream on, but after a few nights, I didn&#x27;t notice it any longer.  I figured it was the fruit acids working.  I gently pat this around and underneath my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now there&#x27;s no real way to be objective about this, but I do think that the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable now.  I certainly see an improvement over the Boots No. 7 eye cream I had been using.  I will continue to use this Age Perfect by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Often eye moisturizer products will cause redness and itching for me.  I was pleased to have no irritation at all from this eye balm.  It is very soft and quite soothing without being greasy.  Seems to have acceptable emollient properties, and probably works as well as any topical cream.  I would purchase again as it is so comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> A very lush, moisturizer for the delicate skin around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Does moisturize well and lessens deep wrinkles like crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t made a noticeable effect on my very puffy eyelids and only minimal effect on puffiness below the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this once a day, applying before bed as I found it too heavy for daytime use in the Texas heat.&lt;br /&gt;A good eye balm that I found was non-irritating but I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t reduce eye puffiness effectively.</li>
            <li> The package is very bad .And it is approaching expiration date .</li>
            <li> They are fresh, we will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My wife says this stuff isn&#x27;t the best she used nor was it the worst...it was middle of the road.  She did like the thickness/creaminess of the product.  However, she is not sure she would purchase based on this trial bottle.</li>
            <li> For women who have mature skin around the eye this works great.  I have been using this for years and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using Age Perfect Eye Balm for several weeks and can see a difference in the skin around my eyes. The dark areas are a little lighter. So far so good!  I will continue the use of the cream until I&#x27;ve used it all.  I&#x27;m hoping for even more improvements!</li>
            <li> I am in the continual search for a good eye cream.  The Loreal eye cream is extremely moisterizing.  It glides on smoothly and has very little scent.  I can&#x27;t say that I found this overly effective, maybe I haven&#x27;t used it for a long enough time to see good results.  There seems to be a temporary benefit in moisterizing the eyes.  I will continue to use this product until it is gone.  I am not  sure if I can say it if it is beneficial or not.  I had hoped for more.</li>
            <li> If your eyes are sensitive to mineral oil, either skip this product or apply it only to your under-eye area.  I personally didn&#x27;t have any trouble with burning or stinging on my upper lids while using it, and I do have pretty sensitive skin.  It is a thick cream/lotion, and a little goes a very long way.  Dab it on in dots around your eyes and then gently massage it in.  I typically use it at night, though if my eye skin feels dry, I&#x27;ll apply in the morning, too.  I feel like this will work really well for me in winter, when heaters turn my skin into the Sahara.  If your eye area tends to get oily, you&#x27;ll want to avoid this or use very sparingly.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick and hard to pat on around the eye&#x27;s. It may be just me I do not see an impovement. There is no problem with the delivery or packaging.</li>
            <li> Update. 5-13-14. I now have a eye infection..Never had one till I started using this eye balm!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used other L&#x27;Oreal products with out any problems before this one!&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got this, and as I said, after two days, I now have dark circles and Puffiness under my eyes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a heavy eye balm, and it seems to even wait down the skin under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not young, and have bought allot of eye creams,but this is the worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you have to use the top part of your nails to get this stuff out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;Now I know to only buy eye cream in a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Maybe it is more for a man with thicker skin.. Maybe my Hubby might like it!!&lt;br /&gt;Or I&#x27;ll use it for cuticle cream around my nails and toes..</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, the brand is also very good.</li>
            <li> I had thinning dry eyelids that came with age and were most noticable during flu season last year. I was determined to find a treatment for this problem.  This product worked.  It softened and plumped up my otherwise dry and thin skin. I&#x27;m grateful for this product. Also, you don&#x27;t need much at all, and it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like how this balm feels on my eye area...very hydrating!! It&#x27;s a nice product....though nothing special. I&#x27;ve recently discovered the ROC line of products and they work better for me. Your mileage may vary of course. This product does not make my eye area sensitive at all, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> My first time trying L&#x27;Oreal Skin Care products. I found it to be just as good as the extremely expensive skin care. Now I often use L&#x27;Oreal Skin Care and make up products.</li>
            <li> a little to oily for me, hard to rub in and feels greasy.  Quit using it.</li>
            <li> [Dec. 2014] the bottle is not opened. however the box is dirty and rotten. [Updated] [Dec. 2015] I ordered this eye cream for my mom as a Christmas gift again this year. OMG! This box is STILL mashed like last year!!! Tell me why!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream! I&#x27;m not sure it really helps with wrinkles but it&#x27;s nice and thick, goes on easy and it&#x27;s not oily or greasy looking!</li>
            <li> This balm is very soothing and feels thick and enriching not like a cream.</li>
            <li> Item arrived a bit stiff and did not blend well just sat all clumpy under my eyes,had to wipe off and remove</li>
            <li> It may be that the product I received was way after the shelf life, I could not tell as there was no expiration date. The box looks a bit battered, and the texture was a bit too hard and did not apply on smoothly. Did not seem to have any benefit, and was beginning to irritate the eyes a bit, so stopped using it after a few days.</li>
            <li> This product works well with my sensitive skin, causing no adverse reaction after over a month of daily use. A tiny bit is enough and I am beginning to see a small difference. I don&#x27;t look 10 years younger (we can always dream), but it does provide moisture and lessons the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes. Such a tiny amount works, that the price is actually very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The gal is absolutely correct who said the L&#x27;oreal Age Perfect eye balm contains Mineral oil - it states that right in the ingredience.  Mineral oil not good for the eye area.  This why you can feel the greasiness for about 1/2 hour after putting in on you eye area.  You need only a wee bit of this product - God knows the jar is tiny itself but don&#x27;t put a lot on under the eyes.  It far from the best product on the market.  IT DID ABSOLUTELY NADA FOR THE PUFFINESS (BAGS) under both of my eyes.  So if your seeking a miracle to eliminate bags forget this product.  Get a shot of botox.  Did nothing for dark spots either.  Only thing I can say is it feels good.  I had no stinging like others suggested, however, I&#x27;ll  never purchase this eye balm again.</li>
            <li> Works well but need to use on daily basis.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Maybe my eye balm was old? All I know is that it was very thick, which meant I had to really tug at my eyes to apply and it did not soak in. Hours later it would kind of ball up. Very odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a picky person with face creams and this turned out to be a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved it to my manicure box and it works great as a heal and cuticle cream so it&#x27;s not a total loss.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products as most women do and found this no better than less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for mom.Good packaging.I feel pretty good,The results to see how to use.If good I will come.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfecting Eye Balm is a very soothing product.  It glides on smoothly and I can wear it under makeup.  I haven&#x27;t used it for very long (3 weeks) and I can&#x27;t say that it has made the skin under my eyes has changed. But hopefully, this product will keep it from getting worse.  The product is said to show result in 4 weeks.It&#x27;s supposed to be anti-sagging (for the eyelids)and brightening (under eye). The ingredient touted by this product is soy seed proteins which \\&quot;stimulate the synthesis of natural fibers found in younger skin.\\&quot; L&#x27;Oreal recommends this product to menopausal and postmenopausal women. You get .5 oz (14 g) of product so don&#x27;t be deceived by the size of the box. For the price of less than $13, it&#x27;s a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this eye balm since I have only had minor success with others. This was part of the Amazon Vine Program, so was able to try it at no cost. It has a nice, creamy, texture which goes on smoothly. It is not too greasy, unlike some of the more expensive products I have tried; also, not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have followed the instructions and now, after only two weeks, I am seeing some improvement in the wrinkles around my eyes. Not much difference in puffiness, but then I live in an allergy zone, so puffiness is a little hard to get rid of! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this over some of the higher-end products out there (many of which I have used, but were too sticky, greasy, glittery, etc.). When I am finished with this container, I plan to buy it again. Definitely a winner!</li>
            <li> Best eye cream hydrating</li>
            <li> I like how it feels when it goes on.  A lot of creams aren&#x27;t absorbed but this one seems to be and doesn&#x27;t just sit on the surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of puffiness under the eyes that is mainly do to a bad thyroid.  Because of the intermittent swelling, it has caused wrinkles in that area, which I just hate.  I was hoping this might help those but if it did, it was minimal.  I have used the product for a month and the tiny jar is half gone.  I use it every day.  When I stop using it, that is when I might notice it was actually working.  Will report back after that.</li>
            <li> Ok I just finished using up the whole bottle of this stuff.  I have some wrinkles on my upper eyelid, especially when I smile. I was hoping (fantasizing?) that this might help.  It didn&#x27;t do much.  But I do like this stuff!  It feels good when you put it on and maybe it does help temporarily by moisturizing the area.  But permanent effect?  No I don&#x27;t think so.  That&#x27;s ok, I still like it.  But I do have one major beef with the packaging.  You get this little jar that looks reasonably sized.  And when you screw off the cap you see the jar seems to be filled with cream.  But when you dab into the cream you break the top skin and see that its HOLLOW inside the jar! Not even half of what you thought you might be getting.  For that little deception I&#x27;m giving this product only 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This is my most used eye balm for daytime use.  It is a little heavy, but it stays moist much longer than anticipated.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I can no longer find!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and have always been very pleased with it.  It seems to help minimize wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product provides intense moisture which reduces the appearance of wrinkles in the eye area.  It is especially beneficial during cold Midwest winters.</li>
            <li> The balm is so thick. You know that eye balm should be used for several months and we can see the effects. Wait and see.</li>
            <li> I have really really dry under-eye skin, which leads to a rough texture and prevents makeup from sitting smoothly on the skin. I also have really pronounced circles under my eyes, and the dryness makes it worse because the skin appears thin and sunken in. This moisturizer immediately hydrates and seems to last longer throughout the day than any others I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve bought dozens of eye creams targeted towards wrinkles, dark circles, and anti-aging.. but it seems the root issue with a lot of those things is hydration. Just focusing on that seems to plump the skin a little to help with the other issues. I definitely recommend trying this cream before purchasing more expensive ones.. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it does more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> My wife is the one who uses the product....has been using it since it first came out.&lt;br /&gt;It sure helps with the aging process....she looks great at 81.</li>
            <li> consider this item especially for winter, it&#x27;s creamy, balmy, rich texture perfect for the naked eye area wonderful price, can&#x27;t bit it!</li>
            <li> Best Eye cream my wife could find and believe me she has tried everything</li>
            <li> the date of manufacture is 20k604,just near the expiration date.they didn&#x27;t  mention it,it&#x27;s so bad.DON&#x27;T BUY IT!DON&#x27;T BUY IT!DON&#x27;T BUY IT</li>
            <li> This cream is like butter that melts in the eye area but does not cause any sting. It is also non-greasy. Two days of use and I could see that my area has become moisturized. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product Sorry it has been discontinued by Loreal</li>
            <li> I just have a difficult time using creams around my eyes. However, this did help with dryness.</li>
            <li> I find i cannot use this product,a few minutes after using it it starts to make my eyes tear.Its nice and creamy,you don&#x27;t need to use a lot but unfortunately its not for me,but it might be perfect for you?</li>
            <li> most of  L&#x27;oreal t items work  well however, this product goes on smooth can be used under make-up every day.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my purse, on the go. I apply it a few times a day &amp; it seems to make my lines disappear for a bit. I like this product; it helps</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream, not greasy nor heavy, excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Age Perfect is well named. This line leaves my skin feeling moist and supple, without the greasy feeling that heavier creams and Blams can leave. The eye balm moisturizes those little laugh lines around the eye and softens them. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This serves as a fairly rich cream which feels hydrating.  I have not really noticed any improvement of the fine wrinkles that I am trying to treat.  Also it stings my upper lid for a few minutes after application.  I think I will try Neutrogena next time.</li>
            <li> i just received product today which was before scheduled time to arrive, which I appreciate.  I have used L&#x27;Oreal products for years so I am sure I will like this product as well.  Also, liked the price!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  No one locally carries it anymore, so I order it from Amazon.  This is rich and emollient cream, very moisturizing.  I have tried every eye cream out there and they claim to reduce wrinkles, but they dry you out and make them all puckered. Not the look to go for!  This product plumps up the skin and under eye concealer goes on very well and does not cake.</li>
            <li> After 1 week I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes had almost disappeared. It seems like a thicker cream, but it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
    </ol>
