            <li>Foundation is light weight and gives good coverage.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin glow and is VERY light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, and this product is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Not chalky like many others, and more colors for a better match, without having to combine two products.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the Ivory color would have been better.</li>

            <li>I am completely satisfied with this produce.  </li>
            <li>Love Bellapierre products.</li>
            <li>So glad I can buy it online.</li>
            <li>I love this powder foundation it covers well, I&#x27;m not as tan as I was beginning of summer</li>
            <li>Your skin can still breath because this powder feels light.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with the first jar that I ordered a second.</li>
            <li>From start to a full face finish</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the third time I have bought Belle Pierre from Amazon, am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The color was right on.  </li>
            <li>This has excellent coverage but in my opinion it is not great for really oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Bella Pierre blends perfectly, and a little go a LONG way.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely married to Bellapierre.</li>
            <li>But overall love it</li>
            <li>I have used other mineral make-ups and have been pleased, but this tops them all.  </li>
            <li>It does not make me have as many pimples as other make up I have tried.</li>
            <li>Like this product but feel that I need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will be better in the winter since it is like 106 in TX everyday.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I ordered this jar of Bella Pierre Mineral Foundation (my second one) because the contents of the first jar  was used up.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this makeup for a few years, it&#x27;s great makeup and the price was a fourth of what you usually pay.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for about two years.  I find this is the best way to replace my supply.  Quick delivery of a perfect product</li>
            <li> Smooth great price. It feels soft on skin perfect color for my face.. I order it all the time..</li>
            <li> Have been using this makeup for a few years, it&#x27;s great makeup and the price was a fourth of what you usually pay. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, and this product is still my favorite.  Not chalky like many others, and more colors for a better match, without having to combine two products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Been ordering regularly every few months.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.  It covers great and feels light.  And the .03 oz size lasts several years, this is my second time purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I have used other mineral make-ups and have been pleased, but this tops them all.  Bella Pierre blends perfectly, and a little go a LONG way.  If you are looking for a five minute face this is it.  From start to a full face finish it takes me all of about seven minutes.  The blend ability of this product is beyond reproach, and it gives and all day wear even in the warmer months.</li>
            <li> I ordered this jar of Bella Pierre Mineral Foundation (my second one) because the contents of the first jar  was used up.  I was so happy with the first jar that I ordered a second.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it because it is way too dark. Latte was the color I ordered.  Maybe the Ivory color would have been better.</li>
            <li> I am definitely married to Bellapierre.</li>
            <li> Perfect consistently!</li>
            <li> Like this product but feel that I need a little more coverage.</li>
            <li> Good price. Mine ran out. The same quality like my last one brought from the mall. Your skin can still breath because this powder feels light.</li>
            <li> It is as I expected...Everybody tells me not to buy makeup on Amazon, because &#x27;they&#x27; put fillers in them.  I have very sensitive skin...my face would know.  This is the third time I have bought Belle Pierre from Amazon, am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the for more than 5 years.  I am completely satisfied with this produce.  I will not change products unless they discontinue this one.</li>
            <li> Love Bellapierre products. It&#x27;s the only makeup I use that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. So glad I can buy it online. Usually I have to go to Vegas to get this product.</li>
            <li> I love this powder foundation it covers well, I&#x27;m not as tan as I was beginning of summer so that&#x27;s a little crapy. But overall love it</li>

            <li> This foundation is the best I have ever used. It stays on all day and feels great. I would recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> The package was not sealed on the out-side or inside.  Did not appear to be new (container was not full) and was very messy.</li>
            <li> While other reviewers stated this is darker than they expected it still looks quite natural and I can&#x27;t wait until summer when it will be perfect. My lighter shade of Belle makes me look a little ghostly in the summer.</li>
