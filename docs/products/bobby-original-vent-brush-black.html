            <li>I have guarded this brush for 26-27 years and happy to now have a backup.  </li>
            <li>and he had to use his own.  </li>
            <li>My mom used my brush during that 2 week period and she liked the way it lifted her hair.</li>
            <li>This time I ordered 4 of them..and am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Use this kind of brush all the time.  </li>
            <li>am very glad to know where to buy this vent brush, I have tried many others and none compare.</li>
            <li>Good basic brush that separates &amp; styles my hair so perfectly.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ll admit that I need to get my own, since I like it too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the one I bought all those years ago, and for me, it is great for using while I am drying my  hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this for someone who is not looking for a beautiful brush, but wants one that works.</li>
            <li>We will both be buying more.</li>
            <li>Glad to see that they still make this product.</li>
            <li>So...never had any idea that I would be able to find one but with the power of the internet, I did.  </li>
            <li>IT IS FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>so I would never be without, because after many many years of use, the bristles do fall out.</li>
            <li>Works better than the store bought vent brushes because it doesn&#x27;t have those nubs and the end which hold dust nubs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to order a couple more in case</li>
            <li>I was looking for this type brush for many years.</li>
            <li>So glad they are still being made.  </li>
            <li>FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Love them because the tips do not have the plastic balls that pull your hair.  </li>
            <li>so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love my Bobby hairbrush - have had 2 since forever - one for home &amp; one for travel.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Able to give hair lift at the crown.</li>
            <li>I had mine for probably 10 years or more.</li>

            <li>Original VENT brush a winner!  </li>
            <li>The original Vent brush still lives!</li>
            <li>This brush will not run through your hair easily and even gets caught up in it.&lt;br /&gt;Comair has a better brush.</li>
            <li>I am still using the originals and they are very old but still in great shape.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see it is available again.  </li>
            <li>It is nice in this world to find something so reasonably priced and yet is a quality product that I hope is around for many more years to come.</li>
            <li>She was excited that I was able to find them.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought his original vent brush more than 30 yrs ago.</li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of brushes that don&#x27;t work for me; just couldn&#x27;t find anything like my tried and true Original Vent Brush!!  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and medium thickness</li>
            <li>The brushes worked fine, but some bristles were bent.  </li>
            <li>Love it reminded me of the first one I got!</li>
            <li>The price is great &amp; delivery only took a couple days.</li>
            <li>Cheap, hurts my head...</li>
            <li>Great for short hair you want to add fullness to.</li>
            <li>Old hair stylists love vent brushes for very fine cat-sucked hair.  </li>
            <li>Can you imagine being so excited about a brush?</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had my original Vent brush longer.</li>
            <li>first I just tried using the brush without touching my scalp, to avoid literal PAIN.</li>
            <li>This brush is not the original vent brush.  </li>
            <li>This is not the original Bobby vent brush.  </li>
            <li>I still have my original Bobby from 20</li>
            <li>, Bobby original has no tips on the ends of the bristles - when these break off, the ends pull your hair (out).</li>
            <li>Thank you, thank you Amazon for helping me find the original Bobby Vent brush.  </li>
            <li>Close, but not the original.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this brush as mine was wearing out after about 25 years.</li>
            <li>My original one also has the patent number on it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have my favorite vent brush back the order and whole experience was</li>
            <li>Was so pleased to see that it was now available and that the new product is like my original brush.</li>
            <li>This style brush does not have knobs on the bristles which make it excellent for thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is what made this brush so good and different from all others.</li>
            <li>This is the best brush as it is easy to hold and easy to brush through both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>Drys hair quickly;  </li>
            <li>That being said, glad I found this one as it is better than all other brands available in retail.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as advertised - not a knock-off!</li>
            <li>Great little vent brush.  </li>
            <li>Well, he was finally happy and actually got rid of that old brush.</li>
            <li>I probably paid more in early 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have been using an old vent brush, for over 20 years, never having been able to find it in any drug store, etc.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m old.  </li>
            <li>This is a smaller size vent brush with a nice handle.</li>
            <li>you want a brush for any other purpose, you should look for a more appropriate design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Today, using the Patent No. on the handle of the brush, I was amazed to find the product right here on AMAZON.  </li>
            <li>The combination of the long an short bristles are what made the original brush work great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my original one for many years &amp; have been looking for replacements for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The most excited I have been in a long time!!!  </li>
            <li>I also bought my first Vent brush from a salon in the 80&#x27;s and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>Then, I found the Bobby Vent Brush and it is exactly like my trusted friend.  </li>
            <li>Vent is the only brush I have enjoyed using.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>It was the exact brush I have had for over thirty years</li>
            <li>I bought my first one of these at my hairdresser&#x27;s about 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>Was at first stunned to find they were no longer being made.  </li>
            <li>I gave the new &#x27;originals&#x27; to my son and his reply was, &#x27;&amp;#34;leave those true originals to me in your will&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I still had my original Vent Brush (40 years old.)  </li>
            <li>I have VERY fine hair &amp; these are the only vent brushes that don&#x27;t have the little balls on the end of the bristles that get tangled in fine hair every time!  </li>
            <li>He uses and likes my brush as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe that I found them  again, thanks to the web.</li>
            <li>so much I purchased two just to have a spare.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for always having the things I thought I could never find again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Conair brush was larger than the Bobby brush, but the handle wasn&#x27;t comfortable to hold when drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>After researching, I found the Bobby Original Vent Brush and learned it was the same patent from years ago.  </li>
            <li>I had an original one for about the last 20 to 30 years.</li>
            <li>and I finally found the original Vent brush.  </li>
            <li>All the other \\&quot;vent\\&quot; brushes have a ball at the top of each bristle and it catches the hair.</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy brush but does not have the long and short bristles like the one I had in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is exactly like his old one...</li>
            <li>I said that I would keep the two brushes that I purchased because I wanted to support an American Made company and now I am not even sure that they are really an American Made company</li>
            <li>so went straight to Amazon &amp; ordered two more - after which I located the missing brush</li>
            <li>I loved this brush because it wasn&#x27;t as heavy as a similar style by Conair.  </li>
            <li>I hope I can last as long as these new brushes..29 years and still going strong on the first one.</li>
            <li>And lo and behold, they were able to get it for me, and I had it in a few days.  </li>
            <li>And - Such an easy brush to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Have been unsuccessful at finding any locally - Thanx Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have had one of these brushes for 30 years and have been looking for a new one for 25.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been looking for a new one for years.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I always check brushes before I touch them to my hair - which is pin straight down to my waist.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first \\&quot;Vent\\&quot; brush from a friend who had a salon back in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>However, it isn&#x27;t exactly the same.</li>
            <li>My original one has two sizes of bristles, each long bristle has a short one right next to it.</li>
            <li>The following day a customer service rep emailed me asking to write a review if my feedback was positive or to email them if I had any issues.</li>
            <li>I bought a couple and surprised my sister with one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>This brush was just like my old brush of 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I have the old brush with the patent number on the handle.  </li>
            <li>The one I had was so old and losing all its &#x27;teeth&#x27;</li>
            <li>Not as big as I had anticipated, but it does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>I have long had to bear the brunt of my children&#x27;s mockery because I still use my original hairbrush from freshman year of college (missing almost all of its bristles)and REFUSED to part with it because I could not find the exact replacement.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other brush on my hair which is fine, thick and long.</li>
            <li>The original has an extra short bristle along with all of the longer ones and this brush has only single straight bristles.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the brush is exactly the same, the handle, raised printing (Vent Brush) on the back of the brush, etc.</li>
            <li>This Brush is close in design but only has the long length bristles; it has no short ones as original.  </li>
            <li>The original has a short brush placed next to each long brush and it does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>The original was slightly heavier and had an extra row...</li>
            <li>With my experience using this brush, I can only conclude that anybody who DOESNT have a proper using it, must have so much hair that the  bristles never even get close to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>How can anyone be so excited about a simple little brush?  </li>
            <li>Price is a little high when comparing to other brushes on the market, but if you are looking for the original</li>
            <li>It has gone everywhere with me, and is the only hairbrush that can get thru my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this brush, but could not as the sharp pieces would result in</li>
            <li>Adds volume to my fine, thinning hair with no static electricity when I blow dry.</li>
            <li>The original had two bristles, one long and one short, next to each other; this one only has the long one.  </li>
            <li>What one person can view as tough can be completely fine to another.</li>

            <li> Can you imagine being so excited about a brush?</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had my original Vent brush longer.</li>
            <li> first I just tried using the brush without touching my scalp, to avoid literal PAIN.</li>
            <li> This brush is not the original vent brush.  </li>
            <li> This is not the original Bobby vent brush.  </li>
            <li> I still have my original Bobby from 20</li>
            <li> , Bobby original has no tips on the ends of the bristles - when these break off, the ends pull your hair (out).</li>
            <li> Thank you, thank you Amazon for helping me find the original Bobby Vent brush.  </li>
            <li> Close, but not the original.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this brush as mine was wearing out after about 25 years.</li>
            <li> My original one also has the patent number on it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have my favorite vent brush back the order and whole experience was</li>
            <li> Was so pleased to see that it was now available and that the new product is like my original brush.</li>
            <li> This style brush does not have knobs on the bristles which make it excellent for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is what made this brush so good and different from all others.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush as it is easy to hold and easy to brush through both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Drys hair quickly;  </li>
            <li> That being said, glad I found this one as it is better than all other brands available in retail.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as advertised - not a knock-off!</li>
            <li> Great little vent brush.  </li>
            <li> Well, he was finally happy and actually got rid of that old brush.</li>
            <li> I probably paid more in early 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have been using an old vent brush, for over 20 years, never having been able to find it in any drug store, etc.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m old.  </li>
            <li> This is a smaller size vent brush with a nice handle.</li>
            <li> you want a brush for any other purpose, you should look for a more appropriate design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today, using the Patent No. on the handle of the brush, I was amazed to find the product right here on AMAZON.  </li>
            <li> The combination of the long an short bristles are what made the original brush work great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my original one for many years &amp; have been looking for replacements for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The most excited I have been in a long time!!!  </li>
            <li> I also bought my first Vent brush from a salon in the 80&#x27;s and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> Then, I found the Bobby Vent Brush and it is exactly like my trusted friend.  </li>
            <li> Vent is the only brush I have enjoyed using.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> It was the exact brush I have had for over thirty years</li>
            <li> I bought my first one of these at my hairdresser&#x27;s about 15 years ago.</li>
            <li> Was at first stunned to find they were no longer being made.  </li>
            <li> I gave the new &#x27;originals&#x27; to my son and his reply was, &#x27;&amp;#34;leave those true originals to me in your will&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I still had my original Vent Brush (40 years old.)  </li>
            <li> I have VERY fine hair &amp; these are the only vent brushes that don&#x27;t have the little balls on the end of the bristles that get tangled in fine hair every time!  </li>
            <li> He uses and likes my brush as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe that I found them  again, thanks to the web.</li>
            <li> so much I purchased two just to have a spare.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for always having the things I thought I could never find again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Conair brush was larger than the Bobby brush, but the handle wasn&#x27;t comfortable to hold when drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> After researching, I found the Bobby Original Vent Brush and learned it was the same patent from years ago.  </li>
            <li> I had an original one for about the last 20 to 30 years.</li>
            <li> and I finally found the original Vent brush.  </li>
            <li> All the other \\&quot;vent\\&quot; brushes have a ball at the top of each bristle and it catches the hair.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy brush but does not have the long and short bristles like the one I had in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is exactly like his old one...</li>
            <li> I said that I would keep the two brushes that I purchased because I wanted to support an American Made company and now I am not even sure that they are really an American Made company</li>
            <li> so went straight to Amazon &amp; ordered two more - after which I located the missing brush</li>
            <li> I loved this brush because it wasn&#x27;t as heavy as a similar style by Conair.  </li>
            <li> I hope I can last as long as these new brushes..29 years and still going strong on the first one.</li>
            <li> And lo and behold, they were able to get it for me, and I had it in a few days.  </li>
            <li> And - Such an easy brush to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Have been unsuccessful at finding any locally - Thanx Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have had one of these brushes for 30 years and have been looking for a new one for 25.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been looking for a new one for years.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I always check brushes before I touch them to my hair - which is pin straight down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first \\&quot;Vent\\&quot; brush from a friend who had a salon back in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t exactly the same.</li>
            <li> My original one has two sizes of bristles, each long bristle has a short one right next to it.</li>
            <li> The following day a customer service rep emailed me asking to write a review if my feedback was positive or to email them if I had any issues.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple and surprised my sister with one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This brush was just like my old brush of 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I have the old brush with the patent number on the handle.  </li>
            <li> The one I had was so old and losing all its &#x27;teeth&#x27;</li>
            <li> Not as big as I had anticipated, but it does the job very well.  </li>
            <li> I have long had to bear the brunt of my children&#x27;s mockery because I still use my original hairbrush from freshman year of college (missing almost all of its bristles)and REFUSED to part with it because I could not find the exact replacement.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other brush on my hair which is fine, thick and long.</li>
            <li> The original has an extra short bristle along with all of the longer ones and this brush has only single straight bristles.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the brush is exactly the same, the handle, raised printing (Vent Brush) on the back of the brush, etc.</li>
            <li> This Brush is close in design but only has the long length bristles; it has no short ones as original.  </li>
            <li> The original has a short brush placed next to each long brush and it does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> The original was slightly heavier and had an extra row...</li>
            <li> With my experience using this brush, I can only conclude that anybody who DOESNT have a proper using it, must have so much hair that the  bristles never even get close to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How can anyone be so excited about a simple little brush?  </li>
            <li> Price is a little high when comparing to other brushes on the market, but if you are looking for the original</li>
            <li> It has gone everywhere with me, and is the only hairbrush that can get thru my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this brush, but could not as the sharp pieces would result in</li>
            <li> Adds volume to my fine, thinning hair with no static electricity when I blow dry.</li>
            <li> The original had two bristles, one long and one short, next to each other; this one only has the long one.  </li>
            <li> What one person can view as tough can be completely fine to another.</li>
            <li> Bought new ones to replace a couple that were at least 20 years old!  </li>
            <li> He had an old brush since the 70&#x27;s that was very similar, but was it was down to about 20 bristles,  and he would not give it up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rating this poorly because it didn&#x27;t detangle your hair well, etc, is like rating an ipad poorly because they don&#x27;t make for good tennis rackets.</li>
            <li> so I would say it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Salon and beauty supply store quit carrying them a long time ago</li>
            <li> This is not exactly the same as the one I have which has tiny little bristles next to the larger ones</li>
            <li> other similar brushes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though this brush fit the criteria I was looking for, the quality was not what I was expecting - the point at which the bristles are attached to the body of the brush had sharp plastic pieces sticking out on a majority of the bristles.</li>
            <li> This is unfortunately one of those ridiculous online purchases where you&#x27;d be much better off going to an actual store, feeling the brush, and buying.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s held up, but with the heat of the hair drying, being crushed in suitcases</li>
            <li> Its the same as my old one that had a lot of broken bristles.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to carry in my purse while doing the job of combing and brushing my hair in the style I want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pretty.  </li>
            <li> I think one would have to work in small sections if one was to use this brush, but I can only speculate....</li>
            <li> Amazon can be tough, because obviously people have different opinions.</li>
            <li> It goes through thick long wet hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> in addition the base (next to the bristles) is full of jagged pieces of plastic and is not smooth.  </li>
            <li> Half of the prongs are gone.  </li>
            <li> Two days later I realized that was ridiculous and stopped using the brush altogether.</li>
            <li> She keeps them hidden in case hers break.  </li>
            <li> Also the brush is not full size.</li>
            <li> Result: still grabs hair just not as firmly.  </li>
            <li> it is not to harsh on the hair.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to return.</li>
            <li> you will destroy your hair.</li>
            <li> a few for my hair stylist who uses this brush exclusively and myself.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are ridiculously hard, as other reviewers have noted.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to replace my Bobby Vent Brush for years but was never able to find another brush like it.  </li>
            <li> One of the bristles in the center was broken upon received as well.</li>
            <li> I had a brainstorm to try Amazon, which can usually find anything I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed not to have found the exact replacement.</li>
            <li> Had to buy a few!</li>
            <li> , It was a little worse for wear.  </li>
            <li> My sister and I bought vent brushes in the late 70&#x27;s from a friends salon.  </li>
            <li> I tried cutting the ends off the bristles of various brushes...</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this doesn&#x27;t get caught in my hair as the brushes that have the round nubs on the bristles do.  </li>
            <li> , the bristles seem a bit too flimsy for use on very thick hair...</li>
            <li> I was even using one with a broken handle for quite awhile because I couldn&#x27;t find one on the market anymore.  </li>
            <li> There seems to be a lot of confused reviews on this</li>
            <li> Not happy with this brush at all.</li>
            <li> But i have had mine years and have never had a broken one.</li>
            <li> When your hairdresser uses the same brush you have at home, it cannot be bad!  </li>
            <li> Why you bought it is irrelevant.</li>
            <li> Pointy in all the wrong places.</li>
            <li> and you will be sorry -</li>
            <li> Disappointing results with this brush.</li>
            <li> Brush does not have rounded points, instead it is pointed and is very uncomfortable when using.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you buy this brush.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Love these vent brushes!!  I&#x27;ve had my original one for many years &amp; have been looking for replacements for a long time.  I have VERY fine hair &amp; these are the only vent brushes that don&#x27;t have the little balls on the end of the bristles that get tangled in fine hair every time!  Bought 4 brushes so I&#x27;ll never be without one.  The price is great &amp; delivery only took a couple days.</li>
            <li> My sister and I bought vent brushes in the late 70&#x27;s from a friends salon.  We have both been using our same brushes for 30+ years. After researching, I found the Bobby Original Vent Brush and learned it was the same patent from years ago.  I bought a couple and surprised my sister with one for Christmas. She was excited that I was able to find them.  We will both be buying more. Best brush out there.</li>
            <li> This is the brush I was looking for. Its the same as my old one that had a lot of broken bristles. It works vary well for styling my hair. Glad to see that they still make this product.</li>
            <li> I also bought my first Vent brush from a salon in the 80&#x27;s and have been using it ever since.  I was even using one with a broken handle for quite awhile because I couldn&#x27;t find one on the market anymore.  I&#x27;m glad to see it is available again.  Great brush at a good price!</li>
            <li> The most excited I have been in a long time!!!  I have been using the same vent brush just like this for over 35 years.  Half of the prongs are gone.  I have a drawer full of brushes that don&#x27;t work for me; just couldn&#x27;t find anything like my tried and true Original Vent Brush!!  I accidentally left my brush in a hotel once and drove 30 miles back to get it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally found this brush, I purchased 4 of them.  I will never go without my favorite brush ever again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband. He had an old brush since the 70&#x27;s that was very similar, but was it was down to about 20 bristles,  and he would not give it up. He does not like nubs on the ends of the bristles, so I searched everywhere for a replacement....on-line and in every beauty supply shop....for years!  I tried cutting the ends off the bristles of various brushes...no luck. I thought it was forever hopeless! They just don&#x27;t make them anymore...&lt;br /&gt;Then my daughter found this brush! Can you imagine being so excited about a brush? Well, he was finally happy and actually got rid of that old brush. OK, I&#x27;ll admit that I need to get my own, since I like it too.</li>
            <li> I have been married to my wonderful husband for 25 years but I&#x27;ve had my original Vent brush longer. He uses and likes my brush as much as I do.  Recently, I was gone for 2 weeks and he had to use his own.  My mom used my brush during that 2 week period and she liked the way it lifted her hair. So...never had any idea that I would be able to find one but with the power of the internet, I did.  I ordered 1 for mom, 1 for hubs, &amp; 1 to have a spare for me.  I have guarded this brush for 26-27 years and happy to now have a backup.  Could not believe the price!!! I probably paid more in early 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in the 80&#x27;s from a hair salon. It has gone everywhere with me, and is the only hairbrush that can get thru my naturally curly hair. A couple of times, I thought I lost the brush, and was in panic mode. I cannot believe that I found them  again, thanks to the web. This time I ordered 4 of them..and am thrilled.  Thank heavens...the brush is indestructible..I hope I can last as long as these new brushes..29 years and still going strong on the first one.</li>
            <li> I bought my first \\&quot;Vent\\&quot; brush from a friend who had a salon back in the 80&#x27;s.  Then I bought another one. Then I bought some for friends...What can I can IT IS FANTASTIC!  Somewhere over the years, I lost one of my brushes after moving to CA.  Fearing I could never find the brush, I looked up the patent number and found that it was not being made...or so I thought.  Then, I found the Bobby Vent Brush and it is exactly like my trusted friend.  They bought the patent and I am elated!  How can anyone be so excited about a simple little brush?  I have fine hair and medium thickness and it lifts the hair and gives a beautiful style.  It is nice in this world to find something so reasonably priced and yet is a quality product that I hope is around for many more years to come.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush like this for years, to replace one I had for years. I actually bought several so I would never be without, because after many many years of use, the bristles do fall out. This is the best brush as it is easy to hold and easy to brush through both wet and dry hair. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had a brush like this I purchased several years ago from a salon.  One of the bristles was bent, so I wanted to replace it.  This style brush does not have knobs on the bristles which make it excellent for thick hair.  I like it so much I purchased two just to have a spare.  Also, the smaller size fits well into your bag or purse.</li>
            <li> Original VENT brush a winner!  Used for years, always perfect!  This Brush is close in design but only has the long length bristles; it has no short ones as original.  Result: still grabs hair just not as firmly.  That being said, glad I found this one as it is better than all other brands available in retail.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy brush but does not have the long and short bristles like the one I had in the 80&#x27;s. I will keep searching.</li>
            <li> Works better than the store bought vent brushes because it doesn&#x27;t have those nubs and the end which hold dust nubs. Love it reminded me of the first one I got!</li>
            <li> This is the best (and cheapest, perhaps) brush I&#x27;ve ever had. It goes through thick long wet hair with no problem. I&#x27;ll need to order a couple more in case I lose it.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a lot of confused reviews on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a vent brush. Vent brushes are designed to be used with a hair dryer for blowouts. That is it&#x27;s ONLY purpose.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a brush for any other purpose, you should look for a more appropriate design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating this poorly because it didn&#x27;t detangle your hair well, etc, is like rating an ipad poorly because they don&#x27;t make for good tennis rackets. Why you bought it is irrelevant.</li>
            <li> Vent is the only brush I have enjoyed using.  It is small enough to carry in my purse while doing the job of combing and brushing my hair in the style I want.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to replace my Bobby Vent Brush for years but was never able to find another brush like it.  Was so pleased to see that it was now available and that the new product is like my original brush.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with item and seller.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these brushes for 30 years and have been looking for a new one for 25. This is the only one I have been able to find. Can&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this brush at all. Bristles are ridiculously hard, as other reviewers have noted. Amazon can be tough, because obviously people have different opinions. What one person can view as tough can be completely fine to another. With my experience using this brush, I can only conclude that anybody who DOESNT have a proper using it, must have so much hair that the  bristles never even get close to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I just tried using the brush without touching my scalp, to avoid literal PAIN. Two days later I realized that was ridiculous and stopped using the brush altogether. The following day a customer service rep emailed me asking to write a review if my feedback was positive or to email them if I had any issues. Well, I emailed them with my issue and haven&#x27;t gotten a response. One of the bristles in the center was broken upon received as well. This is unfortunately one of those ridiculous online purchases where you&#x27;d be much better off going to an actual store, feeling the brush, and buying. Stay away.</li>
            <li> I bought this vent brush to replace one I have had for years and wouldn&#x27;t throw away because I couldn&#x27;t find another one &amp;#34;just like it&amp;#34;.  I am VERY pleased with this purchase!!  Great quality and price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this type brush for many years. I had an original one for about the last 20 to 30 years. This is not exactly the same as the one I have which has tiny little bristles next to the larger ones but it is the closest I&#x27;ve ever found and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  Replaces the one I have had for over 10 years.  Item exactly as advertised - not a knock-off!</li>
            <li> it is a great brush and great price. I recommend this brush it is not to harsh on the hair.</li>
            <li> It was the exact brush I have had for over thirty years so I would say it lasts a long time. It is the only brush that gets through my hair .&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad to know where to buy this vent brush, I have tried many others and none compare.</li>
            <li> This brush was just like my old brush of 20 years.  I was concerned after I read some of the reviews but I didn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one of these at my hairdresser&#x27;s about 15 years ago. I have bought 2-3 since. Works better than any other brush on my hair which is fine, thick and long.</li>
            <li> All bristles are the same length.  The combination of the long an short bristles are what made the original brush work great.  Disappointing results with this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is not the original vent brush.  I have the old brush with the patent number on the handle.  I contacted the company asking them to verify the patent and all they could do is send anE-mail back basically brushing  me off and not verifying anything.  I said that I would keep the two brushes that I purchased because I wanted to support an American Made company and now I am not even sure that they are really an American Made company just advertising that they are.  The brush is not the same.  The original has an extra short bristle along with all of the longer ones and this brush has only single straight bristles.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve owned - bought my first Vent brush 30+ Years ago during the &amp;#34;Farrah Fawcett Hair Craze&amp;#34;. Have used it every day since.  Just bought my 2nd.  So glad they are still being made.  They literally &amp;#34;last forever&amp;#34;!  Only reason I bought another is for the vacation home.</li>
            <li> Brush does not have rounded points, instead it is pointed and is very uncomfortable when using. I threw it in the trash can. Also the brush is not full size.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS! I never thought to look on this site for this brush. The one I had was so old and losing all its &#x27;teeth&#x27; but I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it. I am so happy with my brand new vent brush! Thanks for always having the things I thought I could never find again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanie Musolino</li>
            <li> This is not the original Bobby vent brush.  It&#x27;s okay.  The original has a short brush placed next to each long brush and it does make a difference.  I am still using the originals and they are very old but still in great shape.  I gave the new &#x27;originals&#x27; to my son and his reply was, &#x27;&amp;#34;leave those true originals to me in your will&amp;#34;  [:</li>
            <li> This brush will not run through your hair easily and even gets caught up in it.&lt;br /&gt;Comair has a better brush.</li>
            <li> These are the same as what I bought back in the 80&#x27;s or even earlier.  Love them because the tips do not have the plastic balls that pull your hair.  Price is a little high when comparing to other brushes on the market, but if you are looking for the original like I was, $8.00 bucks in nothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using an old vent brush, for over 20 years, never having been able to find it in any drug store, etc., since I bought it all those years ago.  I had a brainstorm to try Amazon, which can usually find anything I am looking for.  And lo and behold, they were able to get it for me, and I had it in a few days.  It&#x27;s exactly like the one I bought all those years ago, and for me, it is great for using while I am drying my  hair.  Amazon is awesome, and so reliable.</li>
            <li> The only brush I use.  I have thin hair and this doesn&#x27;t get caught in my hair as the brushes that have the round nubs on the bristles do.  I still have my original Bobby from 20+ years ago, but I wanted to get this just in case I couldn&#x27;t ever find them again.  Salon and beauty supply store quit carrying them a long time ago so I was pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love my Bobby hairbrush - have had 2 since forever - one for home &amp; one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Recently thought I lost one - and panicked - so went straight to Amazon &amp; ordered two more - after which I located the missing brush - now I can happily brush my hair forever and ever without losing more hair.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other similar brushes, Bobby original has no tips on the ends of the bristles - when these break off, the ends pull your hair (out). And - Such an easy brush to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Have been unsuccessful at finding any locally - Thanx Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this vent brush for many, many years.  I used this brush when I was a teenager. I am now a grandmother and I finally found the original Vent brush.  All the other \\&quot;vent\\&quot; brushes have a ball at the top of each bristle and it catches the hair. Thank you, thank you Amazon for helping me find the original Bobby Vent brush.  I bought a lifetime supply(my liftime!!).</li>
            <li> Cheap, hurts my head... just tryna&#x27; get my hair looking like real good... uhhhh heck no, not with this brush mmmm mmmm. Dirt product. Pointy in all the wrong places.</li>
            <li> The original Vent brush still lives!</li>
            <li> Close, but not the original.  Okay, I&#x27;m old.  I still had my original Vent Brush (40 years old.)  This is not the same.  The original had two bristles, one long and one short, next to each other; this one only has the long one.  As such, it does not grab your hair as well when blow drying.  The rest of the brush is exactly the same, the handle, raised printing (Vent Brush) on the back of the brush, etc.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this brush as mine was wearing out after about 25 years. However, it isn&#x27;t exactly the same. My original one has two sizes of bristles, each long bristle has a short one right next to it. I believe this is what made this brush so good and different from all others. This brush just has all the same length bristles. My original one also has the patent number on it. This one doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m disappointed not to have found the exact replacement. Too much trouble to return.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive.  It&#x27;s not pretty.  It gets the job done at an incredibly low price.  The material will withstand any hairdryer and the brush should last forever.  I recommend this for someone who is not looking for a beautiful brush, but wants one that works.</li>
            <li> When your hairdresser uses the same brush you have at home, it cannot be bad!  Love this brush.  Bought new ones to replace a couple that were at least 20 years old!  The brushes worked fine, but some bristles were bent.  Yep, you cannot kill this brush unless you throw it in an oven or drive over it ... and it would probably survive that!  I loved this brush because it wasn&#x27;t as heavy as a similar style by Conair.  The Conair brush was larger than the Bobby brush, but the handle wasn&#x27;t comfortable to hold when drying your hair.  You will not be disappointed if you buy this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a smaller size vent brush with a nice handle. The handle is an inch longer then the ones I found at the drug store. That inch is a big help. Great for short hair you want to add fullness to. Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very Effective!  Drys hair quickly;  Able to give hair lift at the crown.</li>
            <li> I have long had to bear the brunt of my children&#x27;s mockery because I still use my original hairbrush from freshman year of college (missing almost all of its bristles)and REFUSED to part with it because I could not find the exact replacement.  Today, using the Patent No. on the handle of the brush, I was amazed to find the product right here on AMAZON.  I am beyond thrilled!  This VENT brush is truly the best(and virtually the only!) hairbrush I have ever used!  I just bought two to carry me through the next 30 years!!!  Thank you AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Great little vent brush.  Not as big as I had anticipated, but it does the job very well.  Adds volume to my fine, thinning hair with no static electricity when I blow dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I wanted a vent brush &amp; did not want one that had balls on the bristles. Unfortunately, though this brush fit the criteria I was looking for, the quality was not what I was expecting - the point at which the bristles are attached to the body of the brush had sharp plastic pieces sticking out on a majority of the bristles. I was really looking forward to using this brush, but could not as the sharp pieces would result in damaged hairstrands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the bristles seem a bit too flimsy for use on very thick hair...I think one would have to work in small sections if one was to use this brush, but I can only speculate....</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have my favorite vent brush back the order and whole experience was a ease thank you Cindy Wynn</li>
            <li> Still one of the best vent brush&#x27;s on the market.</li>
            <li> The hole where the bristles are plugged into have jagged pieces of plastic sticking up from every hole - in addition the base (next to the bristles) is full of jagged pieces of plastic and is not smooth.  One pass-through with this brush and you will be sorry - you will destroy your hair. Luckily, I always check brushes before I touch them to my hair - which is pin straight down to my waist.  I bought three thinking they would be great since they do not have ball tips.  All three are defective as described above.</li>
            <li> My husband bought his original vent brush more than 30 yrs ago. He&#x27;s been looking for a new one for years. We are so happy to find it on Amazon. We bought two pcs so I don&#x27;t have to borrow his all the time. It is exactly like his old one...we are happy.</li>
            <li> Good basic brush that separates &amp; styles my hair so perfectly. I had mine for probably 10 years or more. So glad to find it again and see its still being made. Had to buy a few!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for this brush for probably 10 years before I thought to search on Amazon.  I bought one at a salon probably 25 years ago and it&#x27;s held up, but with the heat of the hair drying, being crushed in suitcases (IT ALWays GOES WITH ME!), It was a little worse for wear.  This brush is perfect for my very fine hair for smoothing and styling.  Works great!</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Use this kind of brush all the time.  Keep one in every location - purse, car, make-up bag, etc.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite brush.  Was at first stunned to find they were no longer being made.  Purchased a bunch...a few for my hair stylist who uses this brush exclusively and myself.  She keeps them hidden in case hers break.  But i have had mine years and have never had a broken one.</li>
            <li> Old hair stylists love vent brushes for very fine cat-sucked hair.  The original was slightly heavier and had an extra row... however that was then now.  I would give this a 4+ and will order again as needed.</li>
