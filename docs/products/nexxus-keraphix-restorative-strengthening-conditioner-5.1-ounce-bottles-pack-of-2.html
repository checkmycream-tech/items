            <li>This is one of the best products I have used on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with that!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but when I used it on my hair it was like magic!!!</li>
            <li>Very nice!</li>
            <li>Great product that I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff.</li>
            <li>The price was great here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>There has been a remarkable improvement in the slowing of hair loss.  </li>
            <li>It also smelled good in the bottle, but when I started using it, it smelled like roach spray.</li>
            <li>It is good after your shampoo</li>
            <li>Before Keratin products became popular, Nexxus had this product out...</li>
            <li>I have been using Keraphix for years, and love the product.  </li>
            <li>My hair started to fall even more.</li>
            <li>so glad to find it on Amazon and at multi-pack prices.</li>
            <li>Excellent conditioner it definitely made my hair stronger, and it stopped the breakage.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels after using any Nexus product.  </li>
            <li>Really glad I ordered two.  </li>
            <li>, I rub a pea-sized amount into my hair and it helps to make it more manageable.  </li>
            <li>But it seemed to do work pretty good.</li>
            <li>and I remember that it happened to me once when I used a cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering the Humectress in a double tube pack, but this is a welcome mistake</li>
            <li>Unfortunately like all great beauty products this has been taken off the shelf of the local pharmacy leading me here to buy it (at a great price)!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use all the various Keratin products, (most very pricey) - Coppola, Liquid Keratin, Matrix, and more....</li>
            <li>When hairdressers compliment my self color treated hair as unbelievably healthy, it&#x27;s thanks mainly to this product.</li>
            <li>My hair has improved greatly in just the past month of use.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff as a daily hairdressing -</li>
            <li>As usual for Nexxus,&lt;br /&gt;it smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>I have bought this in salons and it is more than double for just one bottle.</li>
            <li>Overall, after dried, my hair feel good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;a little ticker, but works great just the same!</li>
            <li>This really made my hair frizzy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the product was expired and wasn&#x27;t sure if that was to be expected with ordering products on amazon.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow the first time I used this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Once my hair was dried and styled it felt softer and had more volume and bounce.</li>
            <li>It fixes dry damaged over processed hair quickly.</li>
            <li>it was very old or something -?  </li>
            <li>It is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a savior for my hair in particular which has had x,y,z done to it and is quite dry, and brittle.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help to restore my hair, works just like any other conditioner to me.</li>
            <li>My hair is not nearly as dry or fly-away or frizzed.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much stronger and breakage is less than before.</li>

            <li> My hair is so much stronger and breakage is less than before.</li>
            <li> This conditioner and Nexxus Botanoil Shampoo are now my main two hair care products (often rounded out with a few squirts of Liquid Keratin Leave-In Conditioner or drops of Moroccan Oil).  </li>
            <li> It definitely is something you will notice within a few uses of correcting your split ends and will make your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Color treating and constant flat ironing had caused a lot of breakage and my hair was very dry.</li>
            <li> However, when this arrived it had a strange plastic-like odor</li>
            <li> I had been buying it locally but having a harder time finding it...</li>
            <li> this product works better on my hair than all of them and it&#x27;s much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Trust me if my damaged hair becomes normal and tame, it will work wonders for you!</li>
            <li> I tried several other products, but none worked at all like the Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is colored and tends to be very dry.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with hair that is not chemically processed, coiled, and tends to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> men, it also helps to keep their hair in place and eliminates the need for other products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to put it in my hair, but it&#x27;s not worth returning.</li>
            <li> No more shampoo, rinse, conditioner, rinse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair gets snarled so badly but this stuff takes care of it and leaves my hair soft and shiny with less fallout!</li>
            <li> I found the product was a bit runny and thin and the nexus keraphix I had purchased in the past was quite a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with weak or breaking hair.</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair - dried it out terribly- coloring.  </li>

            <li> This really made my hair frizzy and unmanageable. It also smelled good in the bottle, but when I started using it, it smelled like roach spray. I will pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Very nice! My hair gets snarled so badly but this stuff takes care of it and leaves my hair soft and shiny with less fallout! Yay!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have used on my hair.  It fixes dry damaged over processed hair quickly.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but when I used it on my hair it was like magic!!! Kabrummm!!!! My hair started to fall even more. I know that the conditioner is not supposed to do that and I remember that it happened to me once when I used a cheap conditioner. Overall, after dried, my hair feel good!</li>
            <li> Before Keratin products became popular, Nexxus had this product out...I only wish I tried it sooner and used it all these years. I&#x27;ve use all the various Keratin products, (most very pricey) - Coppola, Liquid Keratin, Matrix, and more....this product works better on my hair than all of them and it&#x27;s much less expensive. I had been buying it locally but having a harder time finding it...so glad to find it on Amazon and at multi-pack prices.

            <li> I thought I was ordering the Humectress in a double tube pack, but this is a welcome mistake - I can carry this on the road with me.  I love this stuff as a daily hairdressing - I just squeeze a dime sized amount into the palm of my hand and mix it with a dime sized amount of Carol&#x27;s Daughter Hair Balm, run this potion in my  hair and viola!! The frizzies are tamed and my curls POP!!  I am a black woman with hair that is not chemically processed, coiled, and tends to be on the dry side. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a conditioner to help mend my damaged hair. Color treating and constant flat ironing had caused a lot of breakage and my hair was very dry. All I can say is wow the first time I used this I noticed an immediate difference in my hair. Once my hair was dried and styled it felt softer and had more volume and bounce. This stuff is a life saver. luv it..kudos to Nexxus</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels after using any Nexus product.  My hair is so much stronger and breakage is less than before.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. As usual for Nexxus,&lt;br /&gt;it smells great and works really well. I with it were&lt;br /&gt;a little ticker, but works great just the same!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have been using Nexus Keraphix conditioner for years.  My hair is colored and tends to be very dry.</li>
            <li> There has been a remarkable improvement in the slowing of hair loss.  Probably attributed to this product and several others blended.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. If you feel that your hear is damaged in anyway get it. Makes my hair feel soft and smooth after use. If you are looking for a volumizer this would not be it, but I like to give my hair a rest once in awhile and use this as a deep conditioner. The price was great here on Amazon. I have bought this in salons and it is more than double for just one bottle.</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair - dried it out terribly- coloring.  I tried several other products, but none worked at all like the Nexxus Keraphix Restorative Strengthening Conditioner.  Really glad I ordered two.  My hair has improved greatly in just the past month of use.  I will definitely order this product again.  My hair is not nearly as dry or fly-away or frizzed.  It is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really help to restore my hair, works just like any other conditioner to me.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner!  It is good after your shampoo, I rub a pea-sized amount into my hair and it helps to make it more manageable.  No more shampoo, rinse, conditioner, rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For men, it also helps to keep their hair in place and eliminates the need for other products.</li>
            <li> I found the product was a bit runny and thin and the nexus keraphix I had purchased in the past was quite a bit thicker. The scent was  milder too. But it seemed to do work pretty good. I noticed that the product was expired and wasn&#x27;t sure if that was to be expected with ordering products on amazon. Product was shipped and delivered as promised...I was very happy with that!</li>
