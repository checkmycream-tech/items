            <li>It does a great job sharpening cosmetic pencils and there&#x27;s a no fuss shavings compartment that&#x27;s easy to dump out.</li>
            <li>nothing amazing here</li>
            <li>Makes nice points.</li>
            <li>but then I ended up loving this.</li>
            <li>This is so far the best sharpener I have found anywhere.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ll be able to get full use of my lovely eyeliner with this handy sharpener.</li>
            <li>I thought that there must be a better one out there.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found this one.  </li>
            <li>It makes a better point when sharpening than any others that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Love the case</li>
            <li>The size of the sharpener case affords a much more stable grip while sharpening.  </li>
            <li>I use estee lauder and was terrified it would ruin my pencils but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Well worth the $!!</li>
            <li>Works great so far.  </li>
            <li>Original shape makes it easy to find in the clutter of a cosmetic bag or purse.</li>
            <li>Wood is shaved smooth.</li>
            <li>the built in cleaning tool is such a great help.</li>
            <li>Happy to spend $10 on one that actually works.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but I do love good design!</li>
            <li>Easy to find in my purse if the makeup pouch is full.</li>
            <li>This is the first sharpener I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t grab &amp; rip the product although I admit I mostly gave up on cosmetic pencils for that reason.</li>
            <li>Nice little sharpener (and cleaner) compactly contained in a gorgeous, sleek case.</li>
            <li>Ever hopeful, I recently bought one because I loved the color</li>
            <li>otherwise it a great little product.</li>
            <li>Will make a great stocking stuffer as well as a just a little gift you want to give a friend.</li>
            <li>COOL LOOKING AND WORKED PRETTY WELL UNTIL IT BROKE IN</li>
            <li>Worth getting.</li>
            <li>well so it was worth trying.</li>
            <li>Love that is has 3 different size holes (the large hole has a removable seal for the extra-large pencils), captures the shavings, and has a great little scraping tool attached to help clean sharpener.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this over the cheap ones at the drug store.</li>
            <li>I was nervous at first</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this sharpener it takes care of different sizes of cosmetic pencils and</li>
            <li>First time I have ever seen that</li>
            <li>Works smoothly and doesn&#x27;t ruin soft eye / brow / lip pencils.</li>
            <li>Be sure to empty the container and clear the blade after each use, otherwise you won&#x27;t get a nice point on the next pencil you sharpen.</li>
            <li>and it still doesn&#x27;t fit some of my larger pencils.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, love how it is closed so that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess in your make-up bag!</li>
            <li>Worked better than any other sharpener I have used!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Slice Sharpener only a few times, but it sharpened cosmetic pencils so much better than the tiny sharpeners that are included with purchase of many pencils.  </li>
            <li>It is well made, has a tight fitting top that keeps any little pieces inside the bottom piece instead of on the bottom of your make-up case.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sharpener, perfect little size for my make-up kit, the only issue I have with it, is that it is a little hard to open to remove the shavings when it is full, it would have been nice if it had a grip type top or even a little gap to maybe use a nail to pop it open.</li>
            <li>I also needed one with a large enough opening that it would accommodate the really large eye or lip pencils.  </li>
            <li>A little more expensive than the others, but it is built week, nice and portable and works very well.</li>
            <li>The smaller one works ok but not worth what I paid, in fact, it mis-shapened some of my pencils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very small and cute idea, but does not sharpen lip liner pencils.</li>
            <li>AND RARELY USE SHARPENER, BUT ALL BLACK INNER PORTIONS SNAPPED AND BROKE.</li>
            <li>It sharpens to a nice sharp point and has two common sizes, small and large, for all size pencils.  </li>
            <li>A little hard at first to open top of case, have to wiggle it slightly and pull, I had no problems after getting the gist of it.</li>

            <li> Works great so far.  I&#x27;ll update if that changes.</li>
            <li> We basically tried all of the sharpeners out there, many were returned, but this one has stayed, as it is the best of the bunch. A little more expensive than the others, but it is built week, nice and portable and works very well. This is the one to get.</li>
            <li> I was getting very tired of the sharpeners I have bought in the past.  I thought that there must be a better one out there.  I am glad I found this one.  When sharpening you have something to hold onto, and it sharpens well.  It makes a better point when sharpening than any others that I have tried.  I would recommend this to anyone that is tired of pencils points breaking off.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I really like this sharpener, perfect little size for my make-up kit, the only issue I have with it, is that it is a little hard to open to remove the shavings when it is full, it would have been nice if it had a grip type top or even a little gap to maybe use a nail to pop it open. It takes a little time to open b/c it slips off your hands, and gets a bit aggravating.,But otherwise it a great little product., I did want to add that it has a small little lip on one side to try to pop it open, but i don&#x27;t like to use it b/c when u pop it open it almost causes the cleaning stick inside to break., this is just MY experience.</li>
            <li> Leaves the  point of my manacles really nice! plus is so cute and fancy :D</li>
            <li> COOL LOOKING AND WORKED PRETTY WELL UNTIL IT BROKE IN ABOUT A MONTH OF USE. I DON&#x27;T WEAR MAKE UP DAILY AND RARELY USE SHARPENER, BUT ALL BLACK INNER PORTIONS SNAPPED AND BROKE.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t eat the pencil at all. Love the case</li>
            <li> i love this one! Easy to find in my purse if the makeup pouch is full. I was afraid that when I tried to open it that bits would jump out. Nope. Makes nice points. Wood is shaved smooth. I like the design and ease of opening and closing and cleaning! Will make a great stocking stuffer as well as a just a little gift you want to give a friend.</li>

            <li> I was nervous at first but then I ended up loving this. I use estee lauder and was terrified it would ruin my pencils but so far so good!</li>
            <li> What can I say?  The best sharpener over.  Miles above the rest of them.  I would order again in an instant, but I don&#x27;t think I will ever need to!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sharpener it takes care of different sizes of cosmetic pencils and the built in cleaning tool is such a great help. First time I have ever seen that and it works. This is so far the best sharpener I have found anywhere. Worth getting.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Slice Sharpener only a few times, but it sharpened cosmetic pencils so much better than the tiny sharpeners that are included with purchase of many pencils.  It did not break off the point of any of my pencils.  The size of the sharpener case affords a much more stable grip while sharpening.  I like it a lot.  July 2015 Update:  I&#x27;ve used the sharpener for 3 years.  Continues to sharpen my pencils perfectly.  Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, love how it is closed so that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess in your make-up bag!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst sharpeners I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It is very small and cute idea, but does not sharpen lip liner pencils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard the Nars sharpener was the best but was at Marshall&#x27;s before I made it to Sephora (although I still don&#x27;t know if they carry Nars) &amp; figured I&#x27;d see what they had. I&#x27;d never heard of Slice but Germans do knives well so it was worth trying. This is the first sharpener I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t grab &amp; rip the product although I admit I mostly gave up on cosmetic pencils for that reason. Ever hopeful, I recently bought one because I loved the color so I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ll be able to get full use of my lovely eyeliner with this handy sharpener.</li>
            <li> Nice little sharpener (and cleaner) compactly contained in a gorgeous, sleek case. Won&#x27;t split or spill. Original shape makes it easy to find in the clutter of a cosmetic bag or purse. Beautiful to look at. Wish it came in more colors!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a Sharpener that will actually sharpen my make-up pencils instead of shredding them.  I also needed one with a large enough opening that it would accommodate the really large eye or lip pencils.  This one fits the bill.  It is well made, has a tight fitting top that keeps any little pieces inside the bottom piece instead of on the bottom of your make-up case.  It sharpens to a nice sharp point and has two common sizes, small and large, for all size pencils.  This is one sharper I can whole-heartedly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works smoothly and doesn&#x27;t ruin soft eye / brow / lip pencils. Only sorry it took me so long to find. Wonder how much I spent on crappy $2 sharpeners over the years? Happy to spend $10 on one that actually works.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I think of getting this sooner? I would have saved my makeup pencils a lot longer because this makes them last longer. The tips don&#x27;t break off. Be sure to empty the container and clear the blade after each use, otherwise you won&#x27;t get a nice point on the next pencil you sharpen.</li>
            <li> Best sharpener I have ever purchased!!  Highly recommend!</li>
