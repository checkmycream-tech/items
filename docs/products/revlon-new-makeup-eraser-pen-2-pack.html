            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>This is the best makeup eraser pen I&#x27;ve used--and I&#x27;ve tried several.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I saw this and decided to try it as there&#x27;s nothing more irratating than being almost done with the makeup ritual and then splotch the eyelid with mascara.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It so easy to work with.</li>
            <li>&quot; those little mascara mistakes I always make, what a great idea!</li>
            <li>It also works when you apply mascara and the eyelashes stick all together, all you need to do is some light touches to the sticking part.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and removes anything I want with ease.  </li>
            <li>This product will perfectly clear up any makeup mistakes and leave you good to go to reapply correctly.</li>
            <li>just a quick light touch and</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to carry around, more so than regular makeup remover.</li>
            <li>This pen really works like magic.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S VERY OILY!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who wears makeup!!!</li>
            <li>But for little touch ups its great.</li>
            <li>My only warning is to make sure that you clean off the tip each time you use it.</li>
            <li>Its superior to the other item that their sister co. has.</li>

            <li>Wipes it right away.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the low price and the brand name seemed trustworthy enough.  </li>

            <li>This product is exactly what is says, it really does \\&quot;erase\\</li>
            <li>I bought a one pack which lasted me a long time, but a two-pack would be even better.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I don&#x27;t see these pens sold in drugstores very often.</li>
            <li>so you really have to mop up after it with a Q-Tip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, its a must have if you mess up with liquid eye liner or something!</li>
            <li>This product works 100% as advertised and better than any of the other \\&quot;eraser\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>It leaves no residue, is precise, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Being that the price was so reasonable, and because I&#x27;m always making mistakes with my eye makeup, I decided to take a chance on Revlon&#x27;s New Makeup Eraser.</li>

            <li> BECAUSE SOMETIMES MY EYEBROWS MESS UP WHEN I DRAW THEM ON EITHER TO CROOKED OR TO BIG</li>
            <li> And my friend told me that when some spot of your skin is too dry to apply foundation, you can also use this to prevent the dry skin peeling off.     </li>

            <li> i do makeup for my friends weddings and last week for my neice for homecomeing and its hard when your doing others makeup because they tend to move</li>

            <li> I guess harsh chemicals is the trade-off for immediate makeup removal</li>

            <li> I had bought this at a drugstore in the past, but could not find them when I went to buy again.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on eyeliner, lipliner and lipstick and even on various colors because I was so shocked at how this not only did not work but made things look even worse.</li>
            <li> I drew a thick line on my hand with my eyeliner, it just made it disappear like it didn&#x27;t happen.      </li>

            <li> I hate that it was discontinued.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife uses this product but some times has problems finding it in the store so she has me buy it on line.</li>
            <li> This product works 100% as advertised and better than any of the other \\&quot;eraser\\&quot; products. No oily residue, just a swipe takes off errant mascara in a hurry. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I Love these!!  I used to use a Q-tip to rub off makeup mistakes, until I found this.  No rubbing, no pulling etc. just a quick light touch and the makeup comes right off, even waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find this product on-line.  It is not carried in the stores any longer in our city.  Cannot do without it.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what is says, it really does \\&quot;erase\\&quot; those little mascara mistakes I always make, what a great idea!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, its a must have if you mess up with liquid eye liner or something! Its perfect it doesnt mess up everything you have on, just the one spot you apply it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful. I tried it on eyeliner, lipliner and lipstick and even on various colors because I was so shocked at how this not only did not work but made things look even worse. The only thing this pen removed was money from my wallet.</li>
            <li> This pen really works like magic. It is especially convenient to clear up eye makeup mistakes such as when mascara smudges or I accidently put on too much eyeliner. I like because I can remove just the mistakes and not the rest of the makeup. It is also very easy to carry around, more so than regular makeup remover. It lasts a long time, and works even when the pen seems empty.For some reason, I don&#x27;t see these pens sold in drugstores very often. I would definitely take advantage of the two-pack offer. I bought a one pack which lasted me a long time, but a two-pack would be even better. My only warning is to make sure that you clean off the tip each time you use it. If you don&#x27;t do this, then it will draw a black line where you&#x27;re trying to erase (the reminance of whatever you removed the last time you used it.) This line can really make things messy. Therefore, I recommend taking a tissue and dabbing the pen after you use it. This will insure better results.</li>
            <li> well i got this a cupple weeks ago and now i wonder how i lived without it. i do makeup for my friends weddings and last week for my neice for homecomeing and its hard when your doing others makeup because they tend to move but this product allowed me to fix all mistakes without haveing to start over it saved my bacon LOL buy it you&#x27;ll love it too</li>
            <li> Buy lots of these.  Anything that works this great should be stocked up on in case it&#x27;s discontinued by some executive who has never used it.  This product will perfectly clear up any makeup mistakes and leave you good to go to reapply correctly. I now have half a dozen. I would no longer wear makeup without owning this.</li>
            <li> Being that the price was so reasonable, and because I&#x27;m always making mistakes with my eye makeup, I decided to take a chance on Revlon&#x27;s New Makeup Eraser. Am I glad I did! It works perfectly, deleting any smudges or mistakes I make due to my poor eyesight. And how fabulous to have one for my vanity and one for my purse! This product is definitely a keeper and one I&#x27;ll be buying for quite a while. [[ASIN:B000P9CHEI Revlon New Makeup Eraser Pen (2 Pack)]]</li>
            <li> I use to be able to buy these locally but that is not the case anymore. These work like a charm, I love them!</li>
            <li> I HAD THIS PRODUCT FOR ALMOST A YEAR AND I ONLY USED IT TWO OR THREE TIMES. I HAD BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE SOMETIMES MY EYEBROWS MESS UP WHEN I DRAW THEM ON EITHER TO CROOKED OR TO BIG. AND ALSO FOR MY EYESHADOW MISTAKES AS WELL. I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PRODUCT SINCE I LOVE THE REVLON EYESHADOW. BUT THIS WAS NOT HOW I THOUGHT IT WAS FIRST PROBLEM WAS IT JUST MAKES YOUR EYESHADOW MORE MESSY(WHEN YOUR TRYING TO ERASE A LITTLE OR ALL),ALSO IT&#x27;S VERY OILY!! I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT THEY PUT IN THERE PRODUCT BUT I KNOW IT HAS OIL BECAUSE IT&#x27;S WAY TO OILY NOT TO HAVE NONE AT ALL,AND THAT&#x27;S A BIG PROBLEM FOR ME BECAUSE MY FACE GET&#x27;S OILY(MEANING I HAVE OILY SKIN),AND THIS CAN MAKE IT EVEN WORSTER. THAT&#x27;S THE LAST THING YOU NEED ON YOUR FACE ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A MAT FACE THAT YOU WANT TO STAY MAT. LAST WHEN I PUT SOME NEAR MY EYES TRYING TO REMOVE SOME OF MY MESSED UP EYESHADOW BECAUSE MY LINER DID NOT DRY ALL THE WAY AND IT CAME UP ON MY EYESHADOW,IT BURNED BAD. AFTER THAT HAPPENED I SAID THAT&#x27;S IT NO MORE,SO FROM NOW ON IM JUST STICKING WITH A COTTON BALL OR MY MAYBELLINE MAKEUP REMOVER&#x27;S. SO KEEP LOOKING LADIES!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product and it works great for me --it&#x27;s a touch up pen -- if you&#x27;ve made a big mistake with your makeup -- wsh your face and start over.  :)  But for little touch ups its great.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup eraser pen I&#x27;ve used--and I&#x27;ve tried several.  It leaves no residue, is precise, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used this pen before and now cannot find it in stores.  I was very happy to be able to get it thru Amazon. I usually make some mess with my mascara and this product removes any imperfection that I caused.  Wipes it right away.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this eraser to me.  It is awesome. I wear eyeliner. It works great to clean up the smudges and mistakes with just a touch.  And I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it after I got it. I drew a thick line on my hand with my eyeliner, it just made it disappear like it didn&#x27;t happen.      Moreover.  It also works when you apply mascara and the eyelashes stick all together, all you need to do is some light touches to the sticking part.  And my friend told me that when some spot of your skin is too dry to apply foundation, you can also use this to prevent the dry skin peeling off.     My tips: If you use it after foundation or loose power, don&#x27;t daub it back and forth. Just touch it on the spot of your skin, apply a little loose power afterwards.</li>
            <li> I usually mess up my eye makeup so when I saw this I figured it was the answer to my prayers.  I was happy with the low price and the brand name seemed trustworthy enough.  As soon as I used it a little below my eyelid, I felt a hot burning sensation.  Not just \\&quot;Ouch, that stings a little\\&quot; but a \\&quot;HOLY !@#$%^ MY SKIN IS ON FIRE!\\&quot;  I got the feeling if I didn&#x27;t immediately wipe the area with water, it was going to do something terrible.  Granted, I do have sensitive skin.  I guess harsh chemicals is the trade-off for immediate makeup removal but if I have to experience pain and wipe it with water anyway, doesn&#x27;t that defeat the purpose?    If you have sensitive skin, stay away from this product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a product I used to buy from Sephora for $12, called the &amp;#34;eye makeup eraser.&amp;#34;  When Sephora discontinued it, I began a search to find something comparable.  This one from Revlon wasn&#x27;t as good.  The tip was too rounded and it was hard to be precise about removing smudges of mascara from my lower lashes/lids.  Now I&#x27;ve found that E.L.F. sells this type of product at Target for $1, and I love it!  It&#x27;s got a nice point, and works just as well as the Sephora ones.</li>
            <li> Would like to get more but not available</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it first came out, or I first discovered it. I love it. It so easy to work with. I hate that it was discontinued. Its superior to the other item that their sister co. has.</li>
            <li> I saw this and decided to try it as there&#x27;s nothing more irratating than being almost done with the makeup ritual and then splotch the eyelid with mascara. This works so well. I love it. Very easy to get the splotch off.</li>
            <li> I had bought this at a drugstore in the past, but could not find them when I went to buy again.  I bought a two pack and the a good price.  I kept one and gave one to my sister-in-law. I wanted to get one for my daughter and when I went to buy again the price was terrible and I was the company that I bought from was not there anymore.  But great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!!  I use it to help with smudges when I am applying makeup and  I also use it to help take off my eye makeup when I am too tired to do the entire eye.  It glides on smoothly and removes anything I want with ease.  LOVE IT!!!  Highly recommend to anyone who wears makeup!!!</li>
            <li> This really removes makeup mistakes precisely and quickly, but it leaves behind a residue so you really have to mop up after it with a Q-Tip.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tools in my makeup collection.  Use this product to correct any stray makeup (especially mascara)with a swipe.No need to take it all off and start again.  Swirl up the mistake and swipe the eraser pen on a towel and you are ready for the next mistake. Gave one to my daughter. I have been using this product for over 12 years.</li>
