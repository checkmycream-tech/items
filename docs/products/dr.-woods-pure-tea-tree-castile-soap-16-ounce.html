            <li>good soap and can be diluted.</li>
            <li>This brand is not as good as another I used before.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>No streaks and it leaves the windows smelling good.</li>
            <li>Not as good as i was hoping, nothing like Paul Mitchell Tea Tree products</li>
            <li>but whatever the TTO products are doing it feels good and seems to help so</li>
            <li>A noice scent and a good value when compared to Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li>This soap smells so good.</li>
            <li>Good smell.  </li>
            <li>But I like this because I feel good using this for cleaning.</li>
            <li>but husband think it&#x27;s just as good.</li>
            <li>This is not as good as the Desert Essence I purchased before this.</li>

            <li>It is great rinses better than any thing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Dr. Wood&#x27;s soap is just as good and has a nice tea tree oil scent.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>When I am washing my hair, I&#x27;ll wash it first, rinse, then lather this onto my scalp real good and bun my hair while I do the rest of the shower.</li>
            <li>Safe to use with my solar shower and just let run on the ground, no worry of killing my plants!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>but now I love this soap!</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Woods products; amazing quality, environmentally friendly, and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not soap but leaves your skin clean and in beautiful condition.</li>
            <li>great product I use it to make a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I made my own hand soap by mixing this concentrate with water and lavender oil.</li>
            <li>pet toys with it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Makes him smell nice and helps keep ticks and fleas away.</li>
            <li>I find this just as effective and versatile with a nice range of scents.</li>
            <li>This works fine and the price, speed of delivery and all is a very nice deal.</li>
            <li>:) Very Satisfied</li>
            <li>This soap smells delicious, is all natural, and heals and nourishes skin while being an antiseptic (via tea tree).  </li>
            <li>Great product and also economical.</li>
            <li>My face clears up easily from the pimples i had from dr bronners!</li>
            <li>Good lather and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Good, clean tea tree scent.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING else I found had too many moisturizers in it or too many perfumes, etc.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff, although I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products that i&#x27;ve used as a facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Woods Castile Tea Tree soap has a slightly more pleasing scent and feels milder on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I just find it more enjoyable to use, if that means anything to anyone.  </li>
            <li>This is an ok product</li>
            <li>Castile is my favorite product to use.</li>
            <li>kids have allergies to many of the soaps and their perfumes/chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s too</li>
            <li>I continue to order it until the cows come home.  :-)</li>
            <li>love the smell.</li>
            <li>I am using this for sooo many things.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Woods Castile Soap.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I love that one too.</li>
            <li>great product and fast service</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>it also has many cleaning applications.</li>
            <li>and i love it...</li>
            <li>and I feel so smooth and refreshed!</li>
            <li>You can use this as a shampoo, body wash and more.</li>
            <li>I love all these soaps.</li>
            <li>This wash keeps me nice and smooth all over without provoking breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if it lathers (it doesn&#x27;t btw); I just want something healthy on my skin that cleans my hair.    </li>
            <li>I ended up buying more.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t my favorite product</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>I now love it.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t cause the problems I have with most OTC body washes.</li>
            <li>Combine it with peppermint castile soap for an even better scent and cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li>Nothing better than this stuff</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this company.</li>
            <li>for better quality</li>
            <li>Some ingredient settled to the top when I received this.</li>
            <li>I wish there was more of a tea tree smell.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a nice clean packaging.</li>
            <li>Smells good, squeaky clean feel, keeps everything clean while camping</li>
            <li>This stuff rinses off very clean with no residue build up at all.  </li>
            <li>and it soaps up pretty good</li>
            <li>There are so many ways you can use Castile Soap and the best part is, it isn&#x27;t loaded down with chemicals. :)</li>
            <li>Leaves u feeling clean an refreshed!</li>
            <li>I feel so clean after using this product!</li>
            <li>The Dr. Woods brand is an excellent value and much more economical than buying locally.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for all types of skin and is a natural anti-fungal.</li>
            <li>This soap works great and helped clear up skin issues.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rinse easily and feels like it leaves my skin oily.</li>
            <li>but some may find it a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>Its either because its too strong or something in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like perfume or something which would make some people detect you immediately, the smell of tea tree oil is fine for me anyway, for a man</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree scent is quite strong - I use this primarily for housecleaning; I prefer the Lavender for shampoo/soap.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super affordable!</li>
            <li>Also cheaper, which is a huge plus for me.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and the soap lasted as for a while.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this to make our own handsoap, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>great cleaner by itself or mixed w/ baking soda or borax.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a cheap copy.</li>
            <li>Have used it once so far to wash a load of clothes, and found it to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my face, body and environment friendly cleaning.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this intending to use it on my hair and body, however the smell is way to &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; for that, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Take camping as an eco friendly wash all (dishes/ hands/ hair/ body/ clothes).</li>
            <li>Having used this brand as well as the more famous Dr. Bronner, I don&#x27;t get why anyone would necessarily pay more.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, will buy again!</li>
            <li>Everything it touches comes out clean and fresh!  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel clean.  </li>
            <li>I use the shampoo to clean my dog.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>Excellent price &amp; hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to good effect as a handwash, bodywash, shampoo and as a spot cleaner for shirts and such.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild</li>
            <li>Luckily the fragrance is mild</li>
            <li>but I think I like Dr. Bonner&#x27;s better because that one seems to be a bit milder than this particular product.</li>
            <li>Much nicer and more economical than shower gels</li>
            <li>It is mildly soapy, but not bubbly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been weaning myself off highly scented bath stuff over the years and eventually you find those to be overwhelmingly perfumed</li>
            <li>even though i have to use more of what i would use with other liquid soaps, i have to say that i am very satisfied with the feel, right amount of soapiness,,, and how quickly i can wash it off and get out of the shower</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just the right amount of smell, makes you feel clean</li>
            <li>They do have a distinct smell but its not bad in any way.</li>
            <li>No more buying products you can easily make and are more effective.</li>
            <li>I must also note that I have VERY sensitive skin, and I was able to wash any and every crevice without irritation.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened it, whew!</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering this particular soap, and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall its worth it as a body soap or to refill soap dispensers.</li>
            <li>I love that the tea tree oil is naturally anti-microbial.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is not animal based and natural.</li>
            <li>I did not know what to expect as my only experience with castille soap was bronner&#x27;s which i found nice</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a shot, if I had them maybe this would help?</li>
            <li>Then I needed to hand wash some underwear and it made itself useful once again.</li>
            <li>Yes its worth it for how it makes your skin smell and feel</li>
            <li>I may try other &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; maybe those are more appealing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not as good as other liquid castile soaps.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>If between this and Desert Essence and the price is right, then I recommend Desert Essence.</li>
            <li>So since dr woods is mild, and also have multiple uses i like this better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the almond variety before and prefer it a little more to this tea tree scent, but I also feel this has better cleaning power and</li>
            <li>Works into the dogs coat easily and rinses out better than any other shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Wow, there&#x27;s no doubt that this has tea tree oil in it, because it smells strongly of it.</li>
            <li>I found this soap to smell good but is a little sticky after using it in a bath.</li>
            <li>Great product and value, fantastic for making your own shampoos and dispensary liquid soaps without using a chemical laced base.</li>
            <li>so I can use a pretty skin lotion when needed to cover it a bit.  </li>
            <li>Normal handsoaps make her fingers and knuckles split and crack, but using this with water and vegetable glycerin keeps them soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got the lavender one and same experience, i am pretty glad i found this.</li>
            <li>an will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>This soap is great and it&#x27;s a giant bottle that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a well done product and exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>What higher praise can you give--exactly what I was needing.</li>
            <li>Please be aware for clarity sake,</li>
            <li>At first it was just in a hand pump by the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist is treating my cystic rosacea, and she recommended this soap (exact brand and scent).</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It works just as well as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but much cheaper!  </li>
            <li>my son has pretty severe psoriasis and sees some improvement when using as a bodywash.</li>
            <li>Tried mixing it back together... Seems ok.</li>
            <li>A little note, if you don&#x27;t like the scent of tea tree you might want to find another castile soap, because this one has a pretty strong tea tree scent (which I love).</li>
            <li>This was the first time I bought any kind of castile soap, since I just recently became interested in natural products.</li>
            <li>It tends to be a little drying on normal to dry skin, but I find it is really, really great on the oilier or more moist skin.</li>
            <li>Use it to clean around my asthmatic/chemically sensitive children with no problems.</li>
            <li>that I had 3 positive votes out of 6 before posting this update.</li>
            <li>I love to smell it all day long.</li>
            <li>As a result I rarely get it because it is just soap and its almost 3x the cost of normal soap.</li>
            <li>but it does not have the strong tea tree smell that my last order had.  </li>
            <li>I washed two large loads of clothes with it</li>
            <li>I use this pure natural soap for everything from laundry to dishes, all around useful.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even make economic sense by being cheaper.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Peppermint version by Dr. Woods is much preferred.</li>
            <li>, i really like how it feels,</li>
            <li>Woods Castile Tea Tree soap so fast.</li>
            <li>So, I have very problematic skin, always have.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I ever really had the demodex mites or anything</li>
            <li>so I try to use soap that  is gentle on his skin and preferably anti-septic.  </li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li>Lathers very well and leaves my skin without sensation of residue.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly!</li>
            <li>Bronners, its very close in quality, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything....</li>
            <li>I rinse off and then once or twice a week I feel the tub with hot water, two cups of epsom salts, about 10 drops of pure tea tree oil and two capfulls of this for a nice soothing tea tree soak and submerse myself for at least 20 mins.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair always retain a lot more moist than using other shampoos or conditioners.</li>
            <li>Unlike many tea tree products, this one does not dry your skin, and it is gentle enough to use on your face as well.  </li>
            <li>I use it to clean windows mixed with&lt;br /&gt;Vinegar.  </li>
            <li>I am a long time dr bonners user, which is fine but breaks me out.  </li>
            <li>This product is key to keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li>I had previously been purchasing Dr. Bronner&#x27;s which I only mention for those who know good tea tree castile soaps.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what my sensitive skin needed.</li>
            <li>Not bad if used for hand soap or cleaning only, wouldn&#x27;t recommend for body/shampoo.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth after use, but because I do indeed have exceptionally dry skin, I must seal in and add moisture immediately to keep that</li>
            <li>Works better than any of the more expensive soaps I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Dr woods is my main body wash and for face.  </li>
            <li>After the main desoiling wash I rinse off and put some of this in my bath puff and let it sit on my skin.</li>
            <li>I like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps and bought this once because Dr. Bronner is quite expensive, but given price and reach Dr. Bronner compares much better, plus Bronner&#x27;s soaps have a much more balanced scent.</li>
            <li>Works fine for everyday use if you do not work outside for a living and need strong cleansing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>I immediately used it in my bath and on my face and was so thrilled that it soothe my dry skin on contact and left me soft without the need for additional moisturizing.</li>
            <li>it left my skin really soft with a clean smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it will last me awhile since I will only be using a few tablespoons a week.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that although I&#x27;m &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34;, my hair is thick and it takes waaaaaayyyyyyy more soap than I&#x27;m comfortable pouring out just to wash my hair one time, so I think I will try the bar soaps on my hair to conserve the product.  </li>
            <li>Does not lather well at all, tried using more product to make lather, but it didn&#x27;t work and it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>When I first wake, I wash my face with a Clearisil foaming face wash to remove oils and such and then lather some of this onto my face and gently shampoo my eyebrows and lashes</li>
            <li>I like Dr. Woods Tea Tree Castile Soap with its herbal scent, sudsy formula, economical 32 ounces bottle and the label that has directions to use the soap for various applications.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon has a good price on a very versatile, very gentle soap that can be hard to find in conventional grocery stores.</li>
            <li>The stain came right out as if I stained it one moment prior and then reached for this soap and some water to get it out.  </li>
            <li>Tea Tree is more mild than one may expect, but I have a family where at least half of us have sensitive skin, so we need it to be mild.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap because I have very sensitive skin that breaks out in rashes a lot.</li>
            <li>The smell is fairly medicinal and woodsy and musky, especially woodsy and a little reminiscent of pine cleaner or something</li>
            <li>first tried this in peppermint, and I bought that for a second time along with trying this one</li>
            <li>At first the choice to change brands was solely financial.  </li>
            <li>This is fine soap and half the price of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree oil liquid soap.  </li>
            <li>The smell, lather, and viscosity is exactly the same, even the ingredients (just not organic).</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li>It makes the hands soft, too!</li>
            <li>It left me clean though I prefer my regular soap.</li>
            <li>I use approximately a 5 to 1 ratio of water and Tea Tree Pure Castile Soap in my squirt soap dispenser in the kitchen and bathrooms and though it is a bit thin I feel that it does a great job and is so very economical.</li>
            <li>I am a black woman with relaxed hair, BUT I stretch my relaxers and purposefully waited until there was a noticeable amount of new growth before using this just to see if it would really clean my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has a stronger scent but Dr. Wood&#x27;s has enough scent to be satisfying for half the price.  </li>
            <li>My skin has a nice glow to it lately since starting my new regime.</li>
            <li>This has kept my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>What sold me on this completely is a shirt that had a stain in it that set in</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t foam up with soft water....  </li>
            <li>, it works, the ingredients are all natural, it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A.,  </li>
            <li>I put 1 part soap, 5 parts water into a old foaming soup dispenser and it work fantastically.</li>
            <li>This is the beat by far.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft compares to dr bonners.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was all natural.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand it is cheap and you get what you pay for, except I paid the same for the Desert Essence but</li>
            <li>After using one full bottle I became aware of another subtle difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thick soapy, sudsy, cleans well, smells great, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty pleased with the results (the tea tree made it a little slick).    </li>
            <li>I also had to use a normal conditioner though with Bronner&#x27;s for hair (American Crew, fyi).</li>
            <li>I have changed the rating from a one star to a three star as this is versatile and requires small amounts thus a very economical cleaner without harmful chemicals.    </li>
            <li>I was here ready to order my next replacement bottle of Bronners, and saw this different brand.</li>
            <li>Can be used to clean hard and soft surfaces, dishes, etc.  </li>
            <li>In comparison with store-bought traditional liquid soaps for washing dishes, I&#x27;m appreciating this natural soap as a healthier alternative.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worse as a soap, and it ends up being more</li>
            <li>Went back to using this stuff and my face is back to clear and toned!</li>
            <li>Only needed a few drops per quart of water for use as disinfectant and kept our pup&#x27;s paws clean and sanitized after a walk outside.  </li>
            <li>it much cheaper than other brands</li>
            <li>Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li>No nasty residue left behind.</li>
            <li>: Does not sud as much (therefor does not last as long and might not be cheaper in the long run) as bronners.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Diluting the soup with water make the tea tree smell less intense.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> good soap and can be diluted.</li>
            <li> This brand is not as good as another I used before.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> No streaks and it leaves the windows smelling good.</li>
            <li> Not as good as i was hoping, nothing like Paul Mitchell Tea Tree products</li>
            <li> but whatever the TTO products are doing it feels good and seems to help so</li>
            <li> A noice scent and a good value when compared to Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good.</li>
            <li> Good smell.  </li>
            <li> But I like this because I feel good using this for cleaning.</li>
            <li> but husband think it&#x27;s just as good.</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> When I am washing my hair, I&#x27;ll wash it first, rinse, then lather this onto my scalp real good and bun my hair while I do the rest of the shower.</li>
            <li> Safe to use with my solar shower and just let run on the ground, no worry of killing my plants!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> but now I love this soap!</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Woods products; amazing quality, environmentally friendly, and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not soap but leaves your skin clean and in beautiful condition.</li>
            <li> great product I use it to make a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I made my own hand soap by mixing this concentrate with water and lavender oil.</li>
            <li> pet toys with it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Makes him smell nice and helps keep ticks and fleas away.</li>
            <li> I find this just as effective and versatile with a nice range of scents.</li>
            <li> This works fine and the price, speed of delivery and all is a very nice deal.</li>
            <li> :) Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> This soap smells delicious, is all natural, and heals and nourishes skin while being an antiseptic (via tea tree).  </li>
            <li> Great product and also economical.</li>
            <li> My face clears up easily from the pimples i had from dr bronners!</li>
            <li> Good lather and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Good, clean tea tree scent.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING else I found had too many moisturizers in it or too many perfumes, etc.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff, although I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best products that i&#x27;ve used as a facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Woods Castile Tea Tree soap has a slightly more pleasing scent and feels milder on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I just find it more enjoyable to use, if that means anything to anyone.  </li>
            <li> This is an ok product</li>
            <li> Castile is my favorite product to use.</li>
            <li> kids have allergies to many of the soaps and their perfumes/chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s too</li>
            <li> I continue to order it until the cows come home.  :-)</li>
            <li> love the smell.</li>
            <li> I am using this for sooo many things.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Woods Castile Soap.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I love that one too.</li>
            <li> great product and fast service</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> it also has many cleaning applications.</li>
            <li> and i love it...</li>
            <li> and I feel so smooth and refreshed!</li>
            <li> You can use this as a shampoo, body wash and more.</li>
            <li> I love all these soaps.</li>
            <li> This wash keeps me nice and smooth all over without provoking breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if it lathers (it doesn&#x27;t btw); I just want something healthy on my skin that cleans my hair.    </li>
            <li> I ended up buying more.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t my favorite product</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> I now love it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t cause the problems I have with most OTC body washes.</li>
            <li> Combine it with peppermint castile soap for an even better scent and cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li> Nothing better than this stuff</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love this company.</li>
            <li> for better quality</li>
            <li> Some ingredient settled to the top when I received this.</li>
            <li> I wish there was more of a tea tree smell.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a nice clean packaging.</li>
            <li> Smells good, squeaky clean feel, keeps everything clean while camping</li>
            <li> This stuff rinses off very clean with no residue build up at all.  </li>
            <li> and it soaps up pretty good</li>
            <li> There are so many ways you can use Castile Soap and the best part is, it isn&#x27;t loaded down with chemicals. :)</li>
            <li> Leaves u feeling clean an refreshed!</li>
            <li> I feel so clean after using this product!</li>
            <li> The Dr. Woods brand is an excellent value and much more economical than buying locally.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for all types of skin and is a natural anti-fungal.</li>
            <li> This soap works great and helped clear up skin issues.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rinse easily and feels like it leaves my skin oily.</li>
            <li> but some may find it a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> Its either because its too strong or something in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like perfume or something which would make some people detect you immediately, the smell of tea tree oil is fine for me anyway, for a man</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree scent is quite strong - I use this primarily for housecleaning; I prefer the Lavender for shampoo/soap.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super affordable!</li>
            <li> Also cheaper, which is a huge plus for me.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and the soap lasted as for a while.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this to make our own handsoap, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> great cleaner by itself or mixed w/ baking soda or borax.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a cheap copy.</li>
            <li> Have used it once so far to wash a load of clothes, and found it to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my face, body and environment friendly cleaning.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this intending to use it on my hair and body, however the smell is way to &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; for that, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Take camping as an eco friendly wash all (dishes/ hands/ hair/ body/ clothes).</li>
            <li> Having used this brand as well as the more famous Dr. Bronner, I don&#x27;t get why anyone would necessarily pay more.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Everything it touches comes out clean and fresh!  </li>
            <li> Makes me feel clean.  </li>
            <li> I use the shampoo to clean my dog.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent price &amp; hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to good effect as a handwash, bodywash, shampoo and as a spot cleaner for shirts and such.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild</li>
            <li> Luckily the fragrance is mild</li>
            <li> but I think I like Dr. Bonner&#x27;s better because that one seems to be a bit milder than this particular product.</li>
            <li> Much nicer and more economical than shower gels</li>
            <li> It is mildly soapy, but not bubbly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been weaning myself off highly scented bath stuff over the years and eventually you find those to be overwhelmingly perfumed</li>
            <li> even though i have to use more of what i would use with other liquid soaps, i have to say that i am very satisfied with the feel, right amount of soapiness,,, and how quickly i can wash it off and get out of the shower</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the right amount of smell, makes you feel clean</li>
            <li> They do have a distinct smell but its not bad in any way.</li>
            <li> No more buying products you can easily make and are more effective.</li>
            <li> I must also note that I have VERY sensitive skin, and I was able to wash any and every crevice without irritation.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened it, whew!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering this particular soap, and I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall its worth it as a body soap or to refill soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> I love that the tea tree oil is naturally anti-microbial.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is not animal based and natural.</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect as my only experience with castille soap was bronner&#x27;s which i found nice</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a shot, if I had them maybe this would help?</li>
            <li> Then I needed to hand wash some underwear and it made itself useful once again.</li>
            <li> Yes its worth it for how it makes your skin smell and feel</li>
            <li> I may try other &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; maybe those are more appealing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not as good as other liquid castile soaps.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li> If between this and Desert Essence and the price is right, then I recommend Desert Essence.</li>
            <li> So since dr woods is mild, and also have multiple uses i like this better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the almond variety before and prefer it a little more to this tea tree scent, but I also feel this has better cleaning power and</li>
            <li> Works into the dogs coat easily and rinses out better than any other shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Wow, there&#x27;s no doubt that this has tea tree oil in it, because it smells strongly of it.</li>
            <li> I found this soap to smell good but is a little sticky after using it in a bath.</li>
            <li> Great product and value, fantastic for making your own shampoos and dispensary liquid soaps without using a chemical laced base.</li>
            <li> so I can use a pretty skin lotion when needed to cover it a bit.  </li>
            <li> Normal handsoaps make her fingers and knuckles split and crack, but using this with water and vegetable glycerin keeps them soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got the lavender one and same experience, i am pretty glad i found this.</li>
            <li> an will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> This soap is great and it&#x27;s a giant bottle that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a well done product and exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> What higher praise can you give--exactly what I was needing.</li>
            <li> Please be aware for clarity sake,</li>
            <li> At first it was just in a hand pump by the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist is treating my cystic rosacea, and she recommended this soap (exact brand and scent).</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It works just as well as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but much cheaper!  </li>
            <li> my son has pretty severe psoriasis and sees some improvement when using as a bodywash.</li>
            <li> Tried mixing it back together... Seems ok.</li>
            <li> A little note, if you don&#x27;t like the scent of tea tree you might want to find another castile soap, because this one has a pretty strong tea tree scent (which I love).</li>
            <li> This was the first time I bought any kind of castile soap, since I just recently became interested in natural products.</li>
            <li> It tends to be a little drying on normal to dry skin, but I find it is really, really great on the oilier or more moist skin.</li>
            <li> Use it to clean around my asthmatic/chemically sensitive children with no problems.</li>
            <li> that I had 3 positive votes out of 6 before posting this update.</li>
            <li> I love to smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> As a result I rarely get it because it is just soap and its almost 3x the cost of normal soap.</li>
            <li> but it does not have the strong tea tree smell that my last order had.  </li>
            <li> I washed two large loads of clothes with it</li>
            <li> I use this pure natural soap for everything from laundry to dishes, all around useful.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even make economic sense by being cheaper.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Peppermint version by Dr. Woods is much preferred.</li>
            <li> , i really like how it feels,</li>
            <li> Woods Castile Tea Tree soap so fast.</li>
            <li> So, I have very problematic skin, always have.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I ever really had the demodex mites or anything</li>
            <li> so I try to use soap that  is gentle on his skin and preferably anti-septic.  </li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well and leaves my skin without sensation of residue.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Bronners, its very close in quality, but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything....</li>
            <li> I rinse off and then once or twice a week I feel the tub with hot water, two cups of epsom salts, about 10 drops of pure tea tree oil and two capfulls of this for a nice soothing tea tree soak and submerse myself for at least 20 mins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair always retain a lot more moist than using other shampoos or conditioners.</li>
            <li> Unlike many tea tree products, this one does not dry your skin, and it is gentle enough to use on your face as well.  </li>
            <li> I use it to clean windows mixed with&lt;br /&gt;Vinegar.  </li>
            <li> I am a long time dr bonners user, which is fine but breaks me out.  </li>
            <li> This product is key to keeping my face clean.</li>
            <li> I had previously been purchasing Dr. Bronner&#x27;s which I only mention for those who know good tea tree castile soaps.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what my sensitive skin needed.</li>
            <li> Not bad if used for hand soap or cleaning only, wouldn&#x27;t recommend for body/shampoo.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth after use, but because I do indeed have exceptionally dry skin, I must seal in and add moisture immediately to keep that</li>
            <li> Works better than any of the more expensive soaps I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Dr woods is my main body wash and for face.  </li>
            <li> After the main desoiling wash I rinse off and put some of this in my bath puff and let it sit on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps and bought this once because Dr. Bronner is quite expensive, but given price and reach Dr. Bronner compares much better, plus Bronner&#x27;s soaps have a much more balanced scent.</li>
            <li> Works fine for everyday use if you do not work outside for a living and need strong cleansing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> I immediately used it in my bath and on my face and was so thrilled that it soothe my dry skin on contact and left me soft without the need for additional moisturizing.</li>
            <li> it left my skin really soft with a clean smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it will last me awhile since I will only be using a few tablespoons a week.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that although I&#x27;m &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34;, my hair is thick and it takes waaaaaayyyyyyy more soap than I&#x27;m comfortable pouring out just to wash my hair one time, so I think I will try the bar soaps on my hair to conserve the product.  </li>
            <li> Does not lather well at all, tried using more product to make lather, but it didn&#x27;t work and it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> When I first wake, I wash my face with a Clearisil foaming face wash to remove oils and such and then lather some of this onto my face and gently shampoo my eyebrows and lashes</li>
            <li> I like Dr. Woods Tea Tree Castile Soap with its herbal scent, sudsy formula, economical 32 ounces bottle and the label that has directions to use the soap for various applications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon has a good price on a very versatile, very gentle soap that can be hard to find in conventional grocery stores.</li>
            <li> The stain came right out as if I stained it one moment prior and then reached for this soap and some water to get it out.  </li>
            <li> Tea Tree is more mild than one may expect, but I have a family where at least half of us have sensitive skin, so we need it to be mild.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I have very sensitive skin that breaks out in rashes a lot.</li>
            <li> The smell is fairly medicinal and woodsy and musky, especially woodsy and a little reminiscent of pine cleaner or something</li>
            <li> first tried this in peppermint, and I bought that for a second time along with trying this one</li>
            <li> At first the choice to change brands was solely financial.  </li>
            <li> This is fine soap and half the price of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree oil liquid soap.  </li>
            <li> The smell, lather, and viscosity is exactly the same, even the ingredients (just not organic).</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li> It makes the hands soft, too!</li>
            <li> It left me clean though I prefer my regular soap.</li>
            <li> I use approximately a 5 to 1 ratio of water and Tea Tree Pure Castile Soap in my squirt soap dispenser in the kitchen and bathrooms and though it is a bit thin I feel that it does a great job and is so very economical.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with relaxed hair, BUT I stretch my relaxers and purposefully waited until there was a noticeable amount of new growth before using this just to see if it would really clean my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has a stronger scent but Dr. Wood&#x27;s has enough scent to be satisfying for half the price.  </li>
            <li> My skin has a nice glow to it lately since starting my new regime.</li>
            <li> This has kept my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> What sold me on this completely is a shirt that had a stain in it that set in</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam up with soft water....  </li>
            <li> , it works, the ingredients are all natural, it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A.,  </li>
            <li> I put 1 part soap, 5 parts water into a old foaming soup dispenser and it work fantastically.</li>
            <li> This is the beat by far.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft compares to dr bonners.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was all natural.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand it is cheap and you get what you pay for, except I paid the same for the Desert Essence but</li>
            <li> After using one full bottle I became aware of another subtle difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thick soapy, sudsy, cleans well, smells great, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty pleased with the results (the tea tree made it a little slick).    </li>
            <li> I also had to use a normal conditioner though with Bronner&#x27;s for hair (American Crew, fyi).</li>
            <li> I have changed the rating from a one star to a three star as this is versatile and requires small amounts thus a very economical cleaner without harmful chemicals.    </li>
            <li> I was here ready to order my next replacement bottle of Bronners, and saw this different brand.</li>
            <li> Can be used to clean hard and soft surfaces, dishes, etc.  </li>
            <li> In comparison with store-bought traditional liquid soaps for washing dishes, I&#x27;m appreciating this natural soap as a healthier alternative.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse as a soap, and it ends up being more</li>
            <li> Went back to using this stuff and my face is back to clear and toned!</li>
            <li> Only needed a few drops per quart of water for use as disinfectant and kept our pup&#x27;s paws clean and sanitized after a walk outside.  </li>
            <li> it much cheaper than other brands</li>
            <li> Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> No nasty residue left behind.</li>
            <li> : Does not sud as much (therefor does not last as long and might not be cheaper in the long run) as bronners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Diluting the soup with water make the tea tree smell less intense.</li>
            <li> I was feeling very itchy and breaking out and not sure what was going on.</li>
            <li> I use an antibacterial body wash first lately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even heard that you can brush your teeth with it, though I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m ready to try</li>
            <li> I wear my hair short and it is not oily nor dry.  </li>
            <li> , i hate saying this because it sounds like a commercial, but I really feel clean and my skin is not dry after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too much so smell is hardly there.</li>
            <li> this stuff smell like pine sol or some kind of bad smell that I can describe.</li>
            <li> Does not strip your skin of its natural oils or leave your skin dried out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fantastic product, on my second bottle (roughly 2 months)&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy dr. Wood.</li>
            <li> it lasted long time for me.</li>
            <li> - I waited to long to get a refund; so I used it was a cleaning agent for my ceramic flooring.  </li>
            <li> but I get lots of use from it so far and the bottle is just now about half empty.</li>
            <li> I even use it in a &amp;#34;waterpik&amp;#34; water flosser (extremely diluted) for deep cleaning between teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I looked at other scents, and noticed they seem to be listed at different prices.  </li>
            <li> While you have that squeak skin feel after washing with it, my skin has not been dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems to last a lot longer than my other cleaners!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking at this soap to replace other more expensive ones, beware!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other TEA TREE PRODUCT due to my Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (Sensitivity to smells/fragrance)</li>
            <li> but I find that when I use less (especially, when washing my hair, I get acceptable results).  </li>
            <li> a little definitely goes a long way with this bottle!</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this a 4 is because when I use this as a face wash, it makes my skin feel really tight afterward.</li>
            <li> All my other body washes would dry out my feet and hands during the winter because of the ingredients needed to control my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also gone a bit tea tree crazy lately, so I enjoy the earthy aromatic quality.</li>
            <li> amazon no longer offers it with prime or at least as of now they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had tried Mill Creek Botanicals which also left my hair feeling less than clean but nothing as bad as this.  </li>
            <li> I might try one of the other scents.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t miss the other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I am keeping it and plan on using it for cleaning my floors, baseboards and other household uses.</li>
            <li> I have read the other reviews</li>
            <li> In other words, if it&#x27;s between this and Dr.</li>
            <li> I like to use it when he has an active wound.  </li>
            <li> After my first and only use my hair looked dirty, once it dried.  </li>
            <li> I can still water it down for other uses in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I used less for one bath than I do of the other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Not great for a 9 year old.</li>
            <li> This can be used as a base for many home made household cleaners and beauty products.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying any other soap!</li>
            <li> other for a few days.</li>
            <li> it costs less than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; leading brand.</li>
            <li> cause I was breaking out in pimples in odd places and read that this could be caused by staph on the skin.</li>
            <li> frankly it was a little pricey, $8.99 at the health food store</li>
            <li> I use very little and rinse my hair at least twice as long as I would with a marketed hair shampoo.    </li>
            <li> My one problem is that the tea tree oil smell is not really there, or at least to me, doesn&#x27;t remind me of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Has a heavy chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li> few words of note: Keep this stuff out of your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Heavily diluted&lt;br /&gt;Go</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the tea tree smell, but it will do for now.</li>
            <li> Prefer it over the major brand laundry detergent because it is unscented, except for a faint aroma from the tea tree oil, and doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> My breakout has been improved a lot using this product just as a plain face wash.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever because it takes very little to lather up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical about cleaning anything outside of my skin with it, but I tried it out.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Dr. Bronners castile soaps, but I&#x27;ve heard this is a cheaper, non-organic product that works just as well.  </li>
            <li> What else can you say its soap with a small amout of tea tree.</li>
            <li> The tea tree smell was almost overpowering (certainly not my favorite scent!), but the germicidal properties of the tea tree get me past the scent.</li>
            <li> It felt gross (greasy) and my scalp felt dirty.  </li>
            <li> It is not as thick and lathers poorly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this &#x27;batch&#x27;</li>
            <li> and I mean everything!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past how bad it smells.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter for her psoriasis but her skin got worst, it seems when she used this soap her skin has flare up and broken out more, it has made it worst, I ended up taking her to a dermatologist to get the psoriasis under control.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronners is just getting to expensive.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really over-the-top expensive.  </li>
            <li> The smell makes me ill.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a three-in-one sort of deal.</li>
            <li> nothing bad about it, too soapy for me, felt it took forever to wash off, silly things but my experience</li>
            <li> It lather&#x27;s like crazy.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing and stinks horribly.</li>
            <li> but the cost can get annoying.</li>
            <li> And when I try others I am always disappointed!</li>
            <li> It smells like turpentine (yes, the stuff that painters use as solvent) and the reach is miserable.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Diluted it with some water in a spray bottle.  Sprayed it on some plants that had bugs.  The bugs are gone.  Great for use in cleaning the shower.  Love that it is natural.  I have a granddaughter and do not want chemicals around her.</li>
            <li> I use this for shower and dish washing. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My husband and I just loved it. We always buy it back whenever we need.</li>
            <li> Use this stuff daily, face and body! And when I try others I am always disappointed! Stopped using it for a while and bought fancy face wash but my face broke out! Went back to using this stuff and my face is back to clear and toned! Love it</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product during my pregnancy because of pregnancy acne. EVERYTHING else I found had too many moisturizers in it or too many perfumes, etc. This is the ONLY product I found that was for all skin types so I didn&#x27;t have to keep using multiple body washes. It&#x27;s mild so it doesn&#x27;t over-dry.  This has kept my skin clear and soft. I LOVE this stuff, although I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell.  Luckily the fragrance is mild so I can use a pretty skin lotion when needed to cover it a bit.  I found this stuff in Harris Teeter grocery stores and I wont go back to anything else. I may try other &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; maybe those are more appealing.</li>
            <li> Works fine for everyday use if you do not work outside for a living and need strong cleansing. Does not strip your skin of its natural oils or leave your skin dried out.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products that i&#x27;ve used as a facial cleanser.  It makes my face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!!!</li>
            <li> I love it.  This is my first time ordering this particular soap, and I am pleased with the results.  I&#x27;ve been skeptical about cleaning anything outside of my skin with it, but I tried it out.  I washed two large loads of clothes with it and they came out great.  What sold me on this completely is a shirt that had a stain in it that set in and I didn&#x27;t wash until weeks after the fact.  The stain came right out as if I stained it one moment prior and then reached for this soap and some water to get it out.  I also washed dishes and washed my hair once with it.  I am a black woman with relaxed hair, BUT I stretch my relaxers and purposefully waited until there was a noticeable amount of new growth before using this just to see if it would really clean my scalp and hair.  It did.  The only problem is that although I&#x27;m &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34;, my hair is thick and it takes waaaaaayyyyyyy more soap than I&#x27;m comfortable pouring out just to wash my hair one time, so I think I will try the bar soaps on my hair to conserve the product.  I must also note that I have VERY sensitive skin, and I was able to wash any and every crevice without irritation.  My skin is smooth after use, but because I do indeed have exceptionally dry skin, I must seal in and add moisture immediately to keep that feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this in peppermint, and I bought that for a second time along with trying this one and I am very happy with these purchases.  I will be ordering them again, and I might need to consider the gallon jugs because I can go though this sized bottle in almost no time.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well and love the tea tree scent!  Second bottle I have bought.  The almond scent is great too!  Price excellent.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam up with soft water....  Feels sticky</li>
            <li> I am very happy with Dr. Woods Castile Tea Tree Soap.  I had previously been purchasing Dr. Bronner&#x27;s which I only mention for those who know good tea tree castile soaps.  I am comparing to one of the best.  At first the choice to change brands was solely financial.  Dr. Bronners is just getting to expensive. After using one full bottle I became aware of another subtle difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Woods Castile Tea Tree soap has a slightly more pleasing scent and feels milder on my skin.  I just find it more enjoyable to use, if that means anything to anyone.  It&#x27;s all natural.&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients are as follows:  Purified Water, Saponified Coconut, Hemp, &amp; Olive oils (with retained Glycerin), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Tear Tree Oil, Sea Salt, Citric Acid, Rosemary (Rosemarinus Officinalis) Extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line....I really like it, it works, the ingredients are all natural, it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A.,  it costs less than the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; leading brand.</li>
            <li> My breakout has been improved a lot using this product just as a plain face wash. I also use it as shampoo with tea trea conditioner. My hair always retain a lot more moist than using other shampoos or conditioners.</li>
            <li> I put 1 part soap, 5 parts water into a old foaming soup dispenser and it work fantastically. I like the smell of tea tree oil but some may find it a bit strong.  Diluting the soup with water make the tea tree smell less intense.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product but I think I like Dr. Bonner&#x27;s better because that one seems to be a bit milder than this particular product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this out for several days now. It&#x27;s just not as good as other liquid castile soaps. It doesn&#x27;t foam up very well. To be a passable hand soap, it has to be used undiluted. It irritates my face. It doesn&#x27;t rinse easily and feels like it leaves my skin oily. If you&#x27;re looking at this soap to replace other more expensive ones, beware! This one can&#x27;t be used in 4:1 and 6:1 dilutions like others can. It doesn&#x27;t even make economic sense by being cheaper. It&#x27;s worse as a soap, and it ends up being more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is going to go into a hand pump and be hand soap. Then I&#x27;m never going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Castile is my favorite product to use. Laundry soap, cleaning solutions, baths, showers, everything. No more buying products you can easily make and are more effective. Tea Tree, or Mellaleuca has such healing properties.</li>
            <li> Great soap and a great price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Herbal fragrance, almost citrusy.  I found its a bit thicker than Dr Bronners.  Excellent price.</li>
            <li> For some reason this bottle of soap has a different feel to it..it seems like it was made different then the last couple of bottles that I had</li>
            <li> PRO: Doesn&#x27;t have the funky after smell of bronners&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper than bronners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Does not sud as much (therefor does not last as long and might not be cheaper in the long run) as bronners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its worth it as a body soap or to refill soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter for her psoriasis but her skin got worst, it seems when she used this soap her skin has flare up and broken out more, it has made it worst, I ended up taking her to a dermatologist to get the psoriasis under control. Not great for a 9 year old.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair too oily. Peppermint version by Dr. Woods is much preferred.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil smells like pine sol to me, and smelling like it after a shower is the reason for the 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product, on my second bottle (roughly 2 months)&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy dr. Wood. You da man!</li>
            <li> kids have allergies to many of the soaps and their perfumes/chemicals. we&#x27;ve been using woods/bronners for years now. wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for handsoap....</li>
            <li> This is fine soap and half the price of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree oil liquid soap.  I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s too but it&#x27;s really over-the-top expensive.  Dr. Wood&#x27;s soap is just as good and has a nice tea tree oil scent.  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has a stronger scent but Dr. Wood&#x27;s has enough scent to be satisfying for half the price.  And we&#x27;ve never had a problem with any type skin irritation so we&#x27;re really happy with this product. I continue to order it until the cows come home.  :-)</li>
            <li> My wife uses this to make our own handsoap, and it works very well. I love that the tea tree oil is naturally anti-microbial.  Normal handsoaps make her fingers and knuckles split and crack, but using this with water and vegetable glycerin keeps them soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Good lather and clean feeling. While you have that squeak skin feel after washing with it, my skin has not been dry.  My one problem is that the tea tree oil smell is not really there, or at least to me, doesn&#x27;t remind me of tea tree oil. I might try one of the other scents.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and is as described.  Have used it once so far to wash a load of clothes, and found it to do a good job.  Prefer it over the major brand laundry detergent because it is unscented, except for a faint aroma from the tea tree oil, and doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> love the smell. works great</li>
            <li> I am using this for sooo many things. I love that it is not animal based and natural. Good price too.</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expect as my only experience with castille soap was bronner&#x27;s which i found nice but for me missed something (personal taste here nothing bad about it, too soapy for me, felt it took forever to wash off, silly things but my experience anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also looking for Castille with tea tree oil, and this one did not disappoint me, smells like tea tree oil, i really like how it feels, even though i have to use more of what i would use with other liquid soaps, i have to say that i am very satisfied with the feel, right amount of soapiness,,, and how quickly i can wash it off and get out of the shower, i hate saying this because it sounds like a commercial, but I really feel clean and my skin is not dry after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like perfume or something which would make some people detect you immediately, the smell of tea tree oil is fine for me anyway, for a man it&#x27;s just the right amount of smell, makes you feel clean quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got the lavender one and same experience, i am pretty glad i found this.</li>
            <li> This is the beat by far.  Met all my expectations!! Leaves u feeling clean an refreshed! I love this stuff an will be ordering more in the future. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to make some DIY soaps. Thank you for the extra packaging in case of spillage.</li>
            <li> this stuff smell like pine sol or some kind of bad smell that I can describe. I will not be buying this product again because of that smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Dr. Bronners for the last year or so when I started using it as an all purpose soap for hair, body, and face. I also had to use a normal conditioner though with Bronner&#x27;s for hair (American Crew, fyi). I was here ready to order my next replacement bottle of Bronners, and saw this different brand. Decided to give it a shot because it was 75% the price. I have just used Dr. Woods in the shower, and I am happy to say it&#x27;s indistingishable from Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree. The smell, lather, and viscosity is exactly the same, even the ingredients (just not organic). For those who say there&#x27;s not enough lather, use a loofah. It lather&#x27;s like crazy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past how bad it smells. Threw it out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; things or I would have given 5 stars. It&#x27;s a shame Amazon presumes to define the buyers language.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s not soap but leaves your skin clean and in beautiful condition. Lasts forever because it takes very little to lather up. Exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel clean.  I don&#x27;t worry about athlete&#x27;s foot or jock itch when using this tea tree oil soap.</li>
            <li> Great hand wash. I put it in my hand dispensers. Does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> I use approximately a 5 to 1 ratio of water and Tea Tree Pure Castile Soap in my squirt soap dispenser in the kitchen and bathrooms and though it is a bit thin I feel that it does a great job and is so very economical.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Woods products; amazing quality, environmentally friendly, and the price is perfect. You can use it on your entire body, laundry and as a household cleaner. Now I just shower in my clothes while cleaning my bathtub, great time saver! HA!</li>
            <li> Great soap!  Made shampoo with and for our entire family.  Great product,great price!  Will be a regular customer! Thank you</li>
            <li> I was very happy to receive Dr.Woods Castile Tea Tree soap so fast. I immediately used it in my bath and on my face and was so thrilled that it soothe my dry skin on contact and left me soft without the need for additional moisturizing.</li>
            <li> great product I use it to make a sulfate free shampoo. The it take essential oils well and I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Works better than any of the more expensive soaps I have tried.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Has a wonderful smell and a million uses!  I use it to make cleaning products, as well as just use it as soap for the bath. There are so many ways you can use Castile Soap and the best part is, it isn&#x27;t loaded down with chemicals. :)</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Woods Castile Soap. I use it for my face, body and environment friendly cleaning. I wish it was sold by the gallon.</li>
            <li> good soap and can be diluted. it lasted long time for me. it much cheaper than other brands and i love it.</li>
            <li> Castile soap is so versatile - shampoo, body wash, face soap, cleaning agent ... and my housekeeper used it two days ago as furniture cleaner/polish (as we&#x27;d run out of Pledge).  The Tea Tree scent is quite strong - I use this primarily for housecleaning; I prefer the Lavender for shampoo/soap.  The Dr. Woods brand is an excellent value and much more economical than buying locally.  Will definitely be purchasing again in future.</li>
            <li> This can be used as a base for many home made household cleaners and beauty products. I made my own hand soap by mixing this concentrate with water and lavender oil.</li>
            <li> This soap is just too perfect. It makes my skin feel great.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Body wash&lt;br /&gt;Bathroom cleaner&lt;br /&gt;Laundry detergent&lt;br /&gt;Wash dishes with it&lt;br /&gt;Wash pet toys with it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice fragrance. I won&#x27;t be buying any other soap! I also tried the Almond one by the same brand! I love that one too.</li>
            <li> This brand is not as good as another I used before.  A bit too diluted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use as a body soap. I occasionally break out on my back and this has helped minimize that. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this a 4 is because when I use this as a face wash, it makes my skin feel really tight afterward. Other than that it&#x27;s a good product and it&#x27;s super affordable!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  This soap smells delicious, is all natural, and heals and nourishes skin while being an antiseptic (via tea tree).  Unlike many tea tree products, this one does not dry your skin, and it is gentle enough to use on your face as well.  A little note, if you don&#x27;t like the scent of tea tree you might want to find another castile soap, because this one has a pretty strong tea tree scent (which I love).</li>
            <li> great product and fast service</li>
            <li> Heard so get things you can do with Castile Soap.  All I say is YUCK. The smell makes me ill.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell at all.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Timely delivered and packaged well.  Love this product it has a great smell.  I use it to clean windows mixed with&lt;br /&gt;Vinegar.  No streaks and it leaves the windows smelling good.</li>
            <li> Its a great castile soap for pimple prone skin.  I research about pimples and it says t tree oil is the best for it.  I am a long time dr bonners user, which is fine but breaks me out.  Its either because its too strong or something in the ingredients.  So since dr woods is mild, and also have multiple uses i like this better.  My face clears up easily from the pimples i had from dr bronners! I can still water it down for other uses in my opinion.  As i use it for hand soap also.  My skin is so soft compares to dr bonners.  And i am not as ashy.  Also, try desert essence too for acne skin, its great too if you dont like this.  Dr woods is my main body wash and for face.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I use it on my hair and body and use it when I steam my face. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I have very sensitive skin that breaks out in rashes a lot. This soap is great and it&#x27;s a giant bottle that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Does not lather well at all, tried using more product to make lather, but it didn&#x27;t work and it didn&#x27;t last long. Also the smell wasn&#x27;t pleasant at all for tea tree soap. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I made bubble bath for my grandkids with this.  It works great!</li>
            <li> Not as good as i was hoping, nothing like Paul Mitchell Tea Tree products</li>
            <li> I use this for EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> I usually use Dr. Bronners castile soaps, but I&#x27;ve heard this is a cheaper, non-organic product that works just as well.  I use this soap on my dog and as a laundry detergent, so I go through a lot of it.  This stuff works great for a great price!</li>
            <li> leaves your hair feeling conditioned. and it soaps up pretty good so I don&#x27;t miss the other shampoos. it also has many cleaning applications.</li>
            <li> Got my package in no time and i love it... :) Very Satisfied</li>
            <li> So, I have very problematic skin, always have. I was feeling very itchy and breaking out and not sure what was going on. I do suffer from eczema. I read an article that spooked me about something called Demodex and read that tea tree oil will kill the mites. I figured it was worth a shot, if I had them maybe this would help? Anyway, my skin felt relieved immediately. I use an antibacterial body wash first lately cause I was breaking out in pimples in odd places and read that this could be caused by staph on the skin. After the main desoiling wash I rinse off and put some of this in my bath puff and let it sit on my skin. When I am washing my hair, I&#x27;ll wash it first, rinse, then lather this onto my scalp real good and bun my hair while I do the rest of the shower. I rinse off and then once or twice a week I feel the tub with hot water, two cups of epsom salts, about 10 drops of pure tea tree oil and two capfulls of this for a nice soothing tea tree soak and submerse myself for at least 20 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After, I moisturize with a body oil that has TTO in it. When I first wake, I wash my face with a Clearisil foaming face wash to remove oils and such and then lather some of this onto my face and gently shampoo my eyebrows and lashes and I feel so smooth and refreshed! My skin has a nice glow to it lately since starting my new regime. I don&#x27;t know if I ever really had the demodex mites or anything but whatever the TTO products are doing it feels good and seems to help so I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not used it for laundry cause frankly it was a little pricey, $8.99 at the health food store but I get lots of use from it so far and the bottle is just now about half empty. I bought it a week ago and was sharing it with my sig. other for a few days. Intending on buying it again when it runs out. Can&#x27;t go wrong with a three-in-one sort of deal. The smell is fairly medicinal and woodsy and musky, especially woodsy and a little reminiscent of pine cleaner or something but you get used to it. I&#x27;ve been weaning myself off highly scented bath stuff over the years and eventually you find those to be overwhelmingly perfumed so it&#x27;s a matter of tolerance.</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning in the shower. It&#x27;s great for all types of skin and is a natural anti-fungal. You can use this as a shampoo, body wash and more. Will definitely repurchase this product. Great value!</li>
            <li> I use this for my son who has MS.  I like to use it when he has an active wound.  My son is bed ridden so I try to use soap that  is gentle on his skin and preferably anti-septic.  This fits the bill!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this &#x27;batch&#x27; but it does not have the strong tea tree smell that my last order had.  It&#x27;s disappointing and stinks horribly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than Dr. Bronners.  Also cheaper, which is a huge plus for me.  I use it as a sink/tub/shower cleaner, so I mix it with water in a spray bottle.  For this application, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. I use it to fill my hand soap dispenser, bathe my dogs and scrub my floors.</li>
            <li> Great soap to use and you can use it for you face and/or body.</li>
            <li> I love all these soaps. They do have a distinct smell but its not bad in any way. I love to smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful soap.</li>
            <li> We LIKE this stuff. Much nicer and more economical than shower gels and we also fill hand soap dispensers with it for keeping at the sink. A noice scent and a good value when compared to Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li> Smells good, squeaky clean feel, keeps everything clean while camping and I mean everything! Safe to use with my solar shower and just let run on the ground, no worry of killing my plants!</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and the soap lasted as for a while. Used it to make homemade paw wipes for our pup. Only needed a few drops per quart of water for use as disinfectant and kept our pup&#x27;s paws clean and sanitized after a walk outside.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent price &amp; hard to find in stores. I can&#x27;t use any other TEA TREE PRODUCT due to my Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (Sensitivity to smells/fragrance) I love this product! I bathe the dogs with it, wash the counters, baseboards, &amp; floors with it! is it with water for hand sanitizer too! DR. WOODS IS THE BEST!</li>
            <li> I like it for my uses which include home made spray foam soap.  What else can you say its soap with a small amout of tea tree. Not too much so smell is hardly there.</li>
            <li> Has a heavy chemical smell to it. Not bad if used for hand soap or cleaning only, wouldn&#x27;t recommend for body/shampoo.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this intending to use it on my hair and body, however the smell is way to &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; for that, in my opinion. I am keeping it and plan on using it for cleaning my floors, baseboards and other household uses.</li>
            <li> This is a well done product and exactly as advertised.  What higher praise can you give--exactly what I was needing.</li>
            <li> All my other body washes would dry out my feet and hands during the winter because of the ingredients needed to control my acne. This wash keeps me nice and smooth all over without provoking breakouts.</li>
            <li> The added tea tree oil makes it great. I added essential oils to it and made hand soap, dish soap, and shampoo. This was the first time I bought any kind of castile soap, since I just recently became interested in natural products. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> it left my skin really soft with a clean smell. I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I have to say I love it. I hid it so only I can use it. It doesn&#x27;t clash with perfumes or powders, its great. I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I use this pure natural soap for everything from laundry to dishes, all around useful. Excellent.</li>
            <li> Had to get used to the smell but now I love this soap! I use it all over my body, including my face &amp; hair. My hair has never felt so soft! I feel so clean after using this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was all natural.  I don&#x27;t care if it lathers (it doesn&#x27;t btw); I just want something healthy on my skin that cleans my hair.    YUCK!  I wear my hair short and it is not oily nor dry.  After my first and only use my hair looked dirty, once it dried.  It felt gross (greasy) and my scalp felt dirty.  Later that day, I ended up washing my hair again with a different shampoo.    I use tea tree oil for all sorts of things - I am an oiler and it is a great multi-purpose product.    I have read the other reviews and I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch?  I bought this 2/13.  Anybody find a similar experience?    I am returning this soap for a refund. I had tried Mill Creek Botanicals which also left my hair feeling less than clean but nothing as bad as this.  I&#x27;ll try Kirk&#x27;s next.    UPDATE: 5/20/14 - I waited to long to get a refund; so I used it was a cleaning agent for my ceramic flooring.  I was pretty pleased with the results (the tea tree made it a little slick).    I ended up buying more.  One day when I ran out of soap in the shower, I tried it again as a body cleaner.  It left me clean though I prefer my regular soap. It isn&#x27;t my favorite product but I find that when I use less (especially, when washing my hair, I get acceptable results).  I use very little and rinse my hair at least twice as long as I would with a marketed hair shampoo.    I have changed the rating from a one star to a three star as this is versatile and requires small amounts thus a very economical cleaner without harmful chemicals.    Please be aware for clarity sake, that I had 3 positive votes out of 6 before posting this update.</li>
            <li> In comparison with store-bought traditional liquid soaps for washing dishes, I&#x27;m appreciating this natural soap as a healthier alternative.  It makes the hands soft, too!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in making homemade baby wipes.  The smell is great and it will last me awhile since I will only be using a few tablespoons a week.</li>
            <li> We use this for a lot of different things at our house. At first it was just in a hand pump by the bathroom sink. Then I got a bottle for the shower as its just about the only soap that doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to get red blotches. Then I needed to hand wash some underwear and it made itself useful once again. I&#x27;ve washed dishes with it once or twice. I&#x27;ve even heard that you can brush your teeth with it, though I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m ready to try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a good price on a very versatile, very gentle soap that can be hard to find in conventional grocery stores. For me, it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it in the shower, in hand soap pumps, and even as laundry detergent in combination with baking soda. I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to purchase this again.  I like using this to soak sore muscles and joints.  If you like the aromatic compounds of Tea Tree Oil, then this stuff is great.  It is mildly soapy, but not bubbly.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good. It tends to be a little drying on normal to dry skin, but I find it is really, really great on the oilier or more moist skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. Face/body wash, shampoo when hair is oily, great cleaner by itself or mixed w/ baking soda or borax. Take camping as an eco friendly wash all (dishes/ hands/ hair/ body/ clothes).</li>
            <li> Smells like Ammonia dont buy</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo to clean my dog. Makes him smell nice and helps keep ticks and fleas away. highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff to wash your hair with and also your pets hair.  I added some orange essential oil to it and washed my hair with it and i love it i will never go back to anything else ever again and its all i use on my dog too when i bathe him.  This stuff rinses off very clean with no residue build up at all.  And for those who did not know tea tree helps to get rid of and prevent lice.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist is treating my cystic rosacea, and she recommended this soap (exact brand and scent). This product is key to keeping my face clean. When I first opened it, whew! The tea tree smell was almost overpowering (certainly not my favorite scent!), but the germicidal properties of the tea tree get me past the scent. I now love it. I keep some by the kitchen sink for hands, some in the shower for face and hair. You can even wash the countertops with it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I use it for my laundry and floors. While also using it for my hairand body. It is great rinses better than any thing I&#x27;ve ever used. Shipping was also great. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Great product and value, fantastic for making your own shampoos and dispensary liquid soaps without using a chemical laced base.</li>
            <li> I like Dr. Woods Tea Tree Castile Soap with its herbal scent, sudsy formula, economical 32 ounces bottle and the label that has directions to use the soap for various applications.</li>
            <li> This soap works great and helped clear up skin issues.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Good smell.  Not for the wife.  She doesn&#x27;t like it.  Makes skin feel clean.</li>
            <li> Wow, there&#x27;s no doubt that this has tea tree oil in it, because it smells strongly of it. But I like this because I feel good using this for cleaning. I also use it in a foaming hand soap dispenser and it works well.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my sensitive skin needed. I&#x27;ve also gone a bit tea tree crazy lately, so I enjoy the earthy aromatic quality. Lathers very well and leaves my skin without sensation of residue. No rashes or break outs so it doesn&#x27;t cause the problems I have with most OTC body washes. Going to use it in the bath soon &amp; I expect lots of bubbles based on how well it lathers! :D</li>
            <li> Tea tree soap gets out allot of stubborn dirt and this product cleaned me well as a body wash with no odor left afterwards....</li>
            <li> Great product and also economical.</li>
            <li> Good, clean tea tree scent.  Zaps dirt and odors wherever you use it, and is not overly drying.  I&#x27;ve used it to good effect as a handwash, bodywash, shampoo and as a spot cleaner for shirts and such.  Can be used to clean hard and soft surfaces, dishes, etc.  I even use it in a &amp;#34;waterpik&amp;#34; water flosser (extremely diluted) for deep cleaning between teeth and gums.  Everything it touches comes out clean and fresh!  Combine it with peppermint castile soap for an even better scent and cooling sensation.  Nothing better than this stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few words of note: Keep this stuff out of your eyes.  Nuff said! ;)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Eco-friendly, smells great, and it can multi-task around the house. I have a bottle in the shower, a bottle in the kitchen, and a bottle in the laundry room.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I love this company. Tea Tree is more mild than one may expect, but I have a family where at least half of us have sensitive skin, so we need it to be mild. No lingering smell. Lathers beautifully. No nasty residue left behind. Use it to clean around my asthmatic/chemically sensitive children with no problems. This product also allows them to help with the cleaning.Will buy again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great price. Great scent. Arrived in a nice clean packaging. Great for laundry, dishes, cleaning. It&#x27;s seems to last a lot longer than my other cleaners! Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> I used this to add to my homemade laundry soap.  It works just as well as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but much cheaper!  I started using it for my dishes as well.  Very good product!  I looked at other scents, and noticed they seem to be listed at different prices.  I&#x27;m trying peppermint next!  I will also be trying this (diluted) as hand soap when I get through what I have on hand.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell right. Heavily diluted&lt;br /&gt;Go for better quality</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Best product ever can use it for everthing</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo on a Vet&#x27;s advice to help my dogs skin condition.  (yeast infection)  It has worked well.  Works into the dogs coat easily and rinses out better than any other shampoo I have ever used.  Because of those two facts, it is relatively inexpensive. I I used less for one bath than I do of the other shampoos.  It has become a staple in my house.</li>
            <li> I found this soap to smell good but is a little sticky after using it in a bath. It also leaves a residue in the tub</li>
            <li> This was a re-order , need I say more?!?!. . . my son has pretty severe psoriasis and sees some improvement when using as a bodywash.</li>
            <li> I consider this my luxory soap item. As a result I rarely get it because it is just soap and its almost 3x the cost of normal soap. Yes its worth it for how it makes your skin smell and feel but the cost can get annoying.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree is a wonderful cleansing soap.</li>
            <li> Would not use this as a shampoo. This is great as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Not as great as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s...but husband think it&#x27;s just as good. I like that its way cheaper!</li>
            <li> This is not as good as the Desert Essence I purchased before this. It is not as thick and lathers poorly. On the other hand it is cheap and you get what you pay for, except I paid the same for the Desert Essence but amazon no longer offers it with prime or at least as of now they don&#x27;t. Compared to Dr.Bronners, its very close in quality, but much cheaper. In other words, if it&#x27;s between this and Dr.Bronners, than I would go with Dr.Woods brand. If between this and Desert Essence and the price is right, then I recommend Desert Essence.</li>
            <li> I have to use this to prevent allergy problems with my scalp and eyes. This works fine and the price, speed of delivery and all is a very nice deal.</li>
            <li> Having used this brand as well as the more famous Dr. Bronner, I don&#x27;t get why anyone would necessarily pay more. I find this just as effective and versatile with a nice range of scents. I&#x27;ve used the almond variety before and prefer it a little more to this tea tree scent, but I also feel this has better cleaning power and a little definitely goes a long way with this bottle! Great source to have around the house.</li>
            <li> It smells like turpentine (yes, the stuff that painters use as solvent) and the reach is miserable. I like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps and bought this once because Dr. Bronner is quite expensive, but given price and reach Dr. Bronner compares much better, plus Bronner&#x27;s soaps have a much more balanced scent. This seems to be a cheap copy.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the tea tree smell, but it will do for now.</li>
            <li> Thick soapy, sudsy, cleans well, smells great, not overwhelming.  Worth the money, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Some ingredient settled to the top when I received this. Tried mixing it back together... Seems ok. I wish there was more of a tea tree smell. Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything....</li>
