            <li>I love Zum, my family loves Zum.  </li>
            <li>This soap does not lather up a lot, which is ok with me</li>
            <li>Love the smell and will purchase again.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap...</li>
            <li>I would have given it a five stars because I do love the smell of it</li>
            <li>It is so potently scented that when I put a bar in the bathroom, we can smell it in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>The more than $7 price for a 3 oz.</li>
            <li>But I am enjoying the scent and how creamy the soap is.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>In fact, our entire bathroom smells wonderful just by having the bar sitting in our shower.</li>
            <li>Me and my wife love it.</li>
            <li>The smell is heavenly without being overwhelming</li>
            <li>Love these soaps.  </li>
            <li>Great fragrance and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrant soap.</li>
            <li>Gentle, great lather, and</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love the fragracenes.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Four stars because I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Also, some of the formulas are more drying than you would expect (citrus for one).  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have to say that this is absolutely the BEST smelling soap I have ever had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for your skin and it leaves such a refreshing and pleasant smell after your bath.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the soap is a very good soap for general purposes.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap, the scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li>This leaves skin glowing and a scent that is mild but lasts for hours!  </li>
            <li>Buy two sets of three bars it does go by rather quickly!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite scent in this brand!</li>
            <li>Appropriate for men and women, it is a deep, warm, woodsy, exotic scent.</li>
            <li>But I just have to splurge once in awhile with this fantastic bar.</li>
            <li>Scent stays and it also stays lightly when you use the soap on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought another two bars because it smelled so great (same scent: frankincense) and DIDN&#x27;T use it.  </li>
            <li>I send these to my college kids with clever notes and they love getting them!</li>
            <li>this soap actually made my skin feel very nice, with no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li>your skin smooth, clean and silky.</li>
            <li>The ancient oils and resins in these natural products make for an unforgettable scent that really stands out--</li>
            <li>From what I could tell, it did clean well.  </li>
            <li>The scent is romantic but gentle, the soap itself is wonderful on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel, so soft and clean .</li>
            <li>Granted, you might not actually have someone stop and tell you that you smell amazing...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it from time to time.</li>
            <li>maybe more masculine.</li>
            <li>It was a nice item but each bar was not individually wrapped therefore they had become stuck together.</li>
            <li>It gives you wonderful, thick lather and the natural scents will take you to nirvana.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s positively addictive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap is all natural ingredients and uses essential oils and natural fragrances and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong, without being over powering, and will last through my day.</li>
            <li>The soap is gentle on my skin and not drying at all.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating four stars because of the size, and how fast it goes.  </li>
            <li>The goat&#x27;s milk formula is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I like buying products made in the USA, and I really like the charities</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>But the real draw is the use of frankincense and myrrh.  </li>
            <li>It also gives me a clean feeling, even several hours after showering.</li>
            <li>The bar is kind of small</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a female and I was cool using the soap)</li>
            <li>but I get this at my local super market for $10</li>
            <li>bar makes Zum Bars a luxury item, but they are high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans tough jobs well, but still very mild and easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>NATURAL THAT WORKS!!</li>
            <li>I really like how soft my skin feels when using this soap.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would smell a bit more like frankincense, but that&#x27;s not a huge deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>as one beautiful young woman said when she stopped me, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t mean to sound creepy, but you smell amazing!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>No joke, I think I like this a little better as an air freshener than an actual soap product.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t get enough of it</li>
            <li>Indigo Wild supports.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s one of those types of soaps that don&#x27;t last super long.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Zum products, but this Frankincense and Myrrh scent is UNBELIEVABLE!  </li>
            <li>One of the bars came smashed at the top making the design not attractive.  </li>
            <li>I take off one star because I don&#x27;t really like the squares; the sharp edges hurt my arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very well and leaves behind a squeaky- clean feeling and didn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and as long as Indigo Wild makes it, I&#x27;ll use it.</li>

            <li> I love all of the Zum products, but this Frankincense and Myrrh scent is UNBELIEVABLE!  </li>
            <li> One of the bars came smashed at the top making the design not attractive.  </li>
            <li> I take off one star because I don&#x27;t really like the squares; the sharp edges hurt my arthritic hands.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very well and leaves behind a squeaky- clean feeling and didn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and as long as Indigo Wild makes it, I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li> live in a dry climate and my skin very dry.</li>

            <li> It lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anyway, this bar soap does NOT become soft, it is firm every time I reach for it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong trying this bar of soap! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lathers on well, and unlike store bought soap, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> Typically I&#x27;ll use Irish Spring or Dove</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say this Zum Bar soap only lasted about 25% of the length of time I typically get from soap.  </li>
            <li> They have a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would strip my skin of moisture because I had that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling in the shower but, once I dried off, my skin felt super soft, not at all tight.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re purchasing this you already know that it is a luxury soap and not really for everyday use.</li>
            <li> But the price is a little expensive and how it goes so fast.</li>
            <li> It is rather expensive since the bar doesn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap a few months ago and used it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they stain our white washcloths.</li>
            <li> ;  It&#x27;s hard to beat that review.  </li>
            <li> Bar lasts approximately 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I always hated the slimy, sloppy mess the bar turned into.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with patchouli or eucalyptus; wish they had peppermint instead of spearmint.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the soap I just wish it was thicker. I&#x27;m almost finish using 3 bars and I just received this order.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It has sustainably produced ingredients, which is very important to me, plus it smells WONDERFUL!  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it from time to time.</li>
            <li> After some time of debating, I finally ordered this product. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. Although it&#x27;s not the same spicy scent of frankincense and myrrh I&#x27;m used to, it&#x27;s still a very pleasant one- maybe more masculine. It lathers very well and leaves behind a squeaky- clean feeling and didn&#x27;t dry my skin out. My son loves it, too. I plan to order more.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing. Can&#x27;t recommend frankincense &amp; myrrh soap by ZUM BAR enough! Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous soap! Rich lather, great scent and great for skin!!! NATURAL THAT WORKS!! This leaves skin glowing and a scent that is mild but lasts for hours!  Buy two sets of three bars it does go by rather quickly!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Zum products, but this Frankincense and Myrrh scent is UNBELIEVABLE!  Appropriate for men and women, it is a deep, warm, woodsy, exotic scent. It&#x27;s positively addictive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself is excellent quality, of great, natural ingredients. It lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a dry climate and my skin very dry. Using this soap is almost like putting cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love! Love! Love!</li>
            <li> The soap smells divine. The hubby is happy with the earthy yet masculine fragrance and I&#x27;m happy he smells so good! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap. Very gentle on skin, wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> One of the best soaps I&#x27;ve ever used!  Terrific lather, wonderful smell.  Bar lasts approximately 2-3 weeks.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I love Zum, my family loves Zum.  I send these to my college kids with clever notes and they love getting them!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite scent in this brand! It has a warm and spicy fragrance. The soap is gentle on my skin and not drying at all. This soap does not lather up a lot, which is ok with me and I find it to be fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li> Got as a gift for my aunt, smells great! Didn&#x27;t expect one end to be sticky but I&#x27;m no soap expert!</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Love the smell and will purchase again.  3 bars come packaged together.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and love the way it lathers!  It is not overpowering at all, just outstanding soap! Do yourself a favor, buy it!</li>
            <li> I love this soap...I really can&#x27;t get enough of it</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for a friend and me. She just loves the smell. When you take a shower with it you can smell it in the next room. Leaves your skin clean and you will smell so good.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating four stars because of the size, and how fast it goes.  I used it three times in the shower and it is almost gone.  I would have given it a five stars because I do love the smell of it and I love the way it makes my skin feel, so soft and clean . But the price is a little expensive and how it goes so fast.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever found. It is so potently scented that when I put a bar in the bathroom, we can smell it in the bedroom. The goat&#x27;s milk formula is gentle on my skin. The colors are beautiful, too. Unfortunately, they stain our white washcloths. The more than $7 price for a 3 oz. bar makes Zum Bars a luxury item, but they are high quality. They make wonderful gifts.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used bar soap in YEARS. I always hated the slimy, sloppy mess the bar turned into. And heaven forbid you would have to share it with someone else! Eeeww! Anyway, this bar soap does NOT become soft, it is firm every time I reach for it. Yay!! I was afraid it would strip my skin of moisture because I had that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling in the shower but, once I dried off, my skin felt super soft, not at all tight. The fragrance is strong, without being over powering, and will last through my day. I like buying products made in the USA, and I really like the charities Indigo Wild supports. They have a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> This is a pleasant smelling soap, with a noticeable fragrance that is not too overpowering.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong chemical odor, which is nice.  I was hoping it would smell a bit more like frankincense, but that&#x27;s not a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers on well, and unlike store bought soap, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.  It also gives me a clean feeling, even several hours after showering.</li>
            <li> I really like how soft my skin feels when using this soap.  My husband, who never comments on our soap, made a point of how wonderful this smell is, on both him, me and the room.  It is rather expensive since the bar doesn&#x27;t last a long time. But I just have to splurge once in awhile with this fantastic bar.</li>
            <li> It was a nice item but each bar was not individually wrapped therefore they had become stuck together.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars but the bars were not wrapped in tissue so they hit together so I could not give a gifts. But I am enjoying the scent and how creamy the soap is.</li>
            <li> One of the bars came smashed at the top making the design not attractive.  Not well packed.</li>
            <li> smells great. doesn&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li> zum bar soap- the best there is- I especially love the scent of this one of my all time favorites, always makes me think of baby Jesus.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest soap I&#x27;ve ever used. The scent is romantic but gentle, the soap itself is wonderful on sensitive skin. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this product but I get this at my local super market for $10</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say that this is absolutely the BEST smelling soap I have ever had. The soap is all natural ingredients and uses essential oils and natural fragrances and it smells so good. In fact, our entire bathroom smells wonderful just by having the bar sitting in our shower. The bar is kind of small and it&#x27;s one of those types of soaps that don&#x27;t last super long. However, if you&#x27;re purchasing this you already know that it is a luxury soap and not really for everyday use. Soap leaves you smelling great and  your skin smooth, clean and silky. Me and my wife love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I really love the myrrh scent and a popular line had discontinued its product that used myrrh scent.  I love the scent and my husband does too, because he keeps stealing my soap!</li>
            <li> My guy just loves this soap!  I thought that was funny since he is a manly man, but I thinks it is Great!</li>
            <li> Very nice soap with beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> In a nutshell, this soap smells incredible.  I get complements all the time because of it.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the soap is a very good soap for general purposes.  It cleans tough jobs well, but still very mild and easy on the skin.  But the real draw is the use of frankincense and myrrh.  The ancient oils and resins in these natural products make for an unforgettable scent that really stands out--as one beautiful young woman said when she stopped me, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t mean to sound creepy, but you smell amazing!&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s hard to beat that review.  Granted, you might not actually have someone stop and tell you that you smell amazing...but they&#x27;ll be thinking it!</li>
            <li> This is THE best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever had! It&#x27;s good for your skin and it leaves such a refreshing and pleasant smell after your bath. Ahhhhh....!! You won&#x27;t go wrong trying this bar of soap! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent. I use it as a cleansing enema prior to my detox coffee enema. Last a very long time. Just purchased second set &amp; will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly without being overwhelming</li>
            <li> Love these soaps.  Bought some as a gift for friends.  Scent stays and it also stays lightly when you use the soap on your skin.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrant soap. Gentle, great lather, and oh, so aromatic! The scent stays on your skin! I always use this soap!</li>
            <li> The product was alright smelled good but it irritated my skin a bit. I&#x27;m guessing it was the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I can offer two reviews here:&lt;br /&gt;1) I purchased this soap a few months ago and used it.  It smells great - it&#x27;s strong but it&#x27;s almost a nice, manly hippie scent (I&#x27;m a female and I was cool using the soap) but the soap itself didn&#x27;t last very long.  Typically I&#x27;ll use Irish Spring or Dove and I&#x27;d say this Zum Bar soap only lasted about 25% of the length of time I typically get from soap.  From what I could tell, it did clean well.  I also am a person who (gasp!) uses soap to wash my face and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I bought another two bars because it smelled so great (same scent: frankincense) and DIDN&#x27;T use it.  Instead, I gave one to my father and kept one.  It&#x27;s sitting in my closet now.  My closet smells amazing.  No joke, I think I like this a little better as an air freshener than an actual soap product.  My dad is doing the same thing: keeping it in his room and not using it as soap.  It&#x27;s now been 3 months and it still smells great.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. I WILL RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE. GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Great Zum Bar soaps. Love the fragracenes.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years and as long as Indigo Wild makes it, I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.  They should be called yum bars they smell so good.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Smells great - lathers easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this fragrance</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap, the scent is fabulous. I have very sensitive skin and this soap actually made my skin feel very nice, with no adverse reaction. I am only giving it 4 stars because I wish that it came in a bigger size so it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Four stars because I love this soap.  It gives you wonderful, thick lather and the natural scents will take you to nirvana.  I look forward to bathing/washing my hands constantly just to smell the soap.  I take off one star because I don&#x27;t really like the squares; the sharp edges hurt my arthritic hands.  Also, some of the formulas are more drying than you would expect (citrus for one).  You just can&#x27;t go wrong with patchouli or eucalyptus; wish they had peppermint instead of spearmint.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
