    <ol>
            <li>I added to my hair color and it worked perfectly</li>
            <li>found it and it works great!!</li>
            <li>Good additive to help my hair coloring do its job!</li>
            <li>Works great for me.</li>
            <li>Honestly?</li>
            <li>I noticed my dye lasted more.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I just figured it was doing its magic and applied it to my hair as instructed.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of Gray Magic.</li>
            <li>Best stuff to make your color last longer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Gray Magic for YEARS.</li>
            <li>A stylist at Sally&#x27;s recommended Gray Magic.</li>
            <li>Gray Magic to that, and mix.</li>
            <li>I know it says to use so many drops, blah, blah,</li>
            <li>but in my experience, it works better with MORE.</li>
            <li>And the price, for what it does, is cheap!</li>
            <li>I use maybe 1/4 as many drops of the UnRed.</li>
            <li>but I love that look.</li>
            <li>I use a mix of dark browns and burgundies and it makes it darker, which is OK by me since I love the color.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a brunette or a dark redhead, I can&#x27;t think of any product that keeps gray at bay better than Gray Magic.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use this product.</li>
            <li>I found that color &#x27;grabs&#x27; hair more intensely with it and made hair darker than I wanted, so I would lighten up a shade next time.</li>
            <li>color will fade much slower, and the grays, as they fade, will show up as pretty highlights in your hair.</li>
            <li>My haircolor always seemed to &#x27;slip&#x27; after a week, so after some research I decided to try grey magic.  </li>
            <li>I heard people say that &amp;#34;Gray Magic&amp;#34; really works .</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing to my gray hair</li>
            <li>Mine are a deep burgundy, and it look fantastic against the rest of my brunette</li>
            <li>those having issues or who are reluctant to try this, here are my recommendations: first, it probably works better on dark hair.</li>
            <li>I usually pick this up at Sally&#x27;s, but I needed it more quickly than a Sally&#x27;s trek takes.</li>
            <li>They helped me pick a blond color which would be less brassy and then suggested I add a packet of Gray Magic to help with my stubborn grays.</li>
            <li>My father has sparkly silver hair, not a dull gray, and I take after him.</li>
            <li>I added some to my last ESalon order and it does really work.  </li>
            <li>Works okay so long as I use it with maybe a few drops of UnRed.  </li>

            <li> However, I really did not notice my coolr lasting longer than usual.</li>
            <li> A professional hair colorist wrote in a fashion magazine that adding a few drops of this into my hair dye would help it last longer (at keeping grays at bay).  </li>
            <li> As soon as I mixed it in with my dye, it turned from white to dark terra cotta.</li>
            <li> It seems to help the color stick longer to my stubborn grey hairs.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I have been unable to get it at Sallys (in England, Great Britain) who have now stopped stocking it which is very disappointing but am pleased I can buy it on line.</li>
            <li> it not only didn&#x27;t help cover the gray, I think it also caused my hair to turn orange when it had NEVER happened in the past.</li>
            <li> The other thing is I mix a bunch of colors together in a 12 oz.</li>
            <li> I started getting gray hairs in my dark brunette locks when I was in college.</li>
            <li> The drops are also dark, so maybe that&#x27;s why people are complaining it makes your color darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown</li>
            <li> Still need to add some other additives, but this product helps!</li>
            <li> It would show up as a weird red, and then fade to pink.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times and it works well in covering gray and keeping it covered longer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it turned my hair a funky orange.</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Insanely over priced...  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Notice the size--- now look at the price!  Insanely over priced...  Pass on this in favor of larger size</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years while in the States but unfortunately I have been unable to get it at Sallys (in England, Great Britain) who have now stopped stocking it which is very disappointing but am pleased I can buy it on line.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use this product. I noticed my dye lasted more. I have lots of gray hair, this time, using this product,  my gray hair stayed covered longer.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I went to Sally&#x27;s for help with my brassy color and stubborn grays. They helped me pick a blond color which would be less brassy and then suggested I add a packet of Gray Magic to help with my stubborn grays. As soon as I mixed it in with my dye, it turned from white to dark terra cotta. I just figured it was doing its magic and applied it to my hair as instructed. Unfortunately it turned my hair a funky orange. Not happy! I washed my hair with some blue shampoo I have to fix brassiness but it&#x27;s still orange... Not a fan of Gray Magic.</li>
            <li> Added this to my hair color as directed and it not only didn&#x27;t help cover the gray, I think it also caused my hair to turn orange when it had NEVER happened in the past. I cannot recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I heard people say that &amp;#34;Gray Magic&amp;#34; really works . Maybe it do but DEFINITELY NOT THIS BRAND . It did absolutely nothing to my gray hair not did my color last one day longer .</li>
            <li> Honestly? For all of the hype I read about this product, I had to try it. However, I really did not notice my coolr lasting longer than usual. Sorry. I guess I have truly persistent gray and saw no personal benefit to using this product.</li>
            <li> Best stuff to make your color last longer!</li>
            <li> It was suggested to me by the people at ESalon to buy this product to add to their hair coloring to help cover the stubborn gray hair that was not taking coloring as well as it should  I added some to my last ESalon order and it does really work.  I will buy it again when I need to replenish my stock!</li>
            <li> A professional hair colorist wrote in a fashion magazine that adding a few drops of this into my hair dye would help it last longer (at keeping grays at bay).  I do not notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I added to my hair color and it worked perfectly</li>
            <li> I usually pick this up at Sally&#x27;s, but I needed it more quickly than a Sally&#x27;s trek takes. I found it on Amazon (of course!) and I&#x27;m amazed at the people who have issues with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Gray Magic for YEARS. My father has sparkly silver hair, not a dull gray, and I take after him. I started getting gray hairs in my dark brunette locks when I was in college. I was dying my hair then, and the color was a wash out type (which I like, since there are no obvious lines of demarkation with roots.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even then, I couldn&#x27;t get the color to grab onto the silver. It would show up as a weird red, and then fade to pink. A stylist at Sally&#x27;s recommended Gray Magic. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since, with nary a gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those having issues or who are reluctant to try this, here are my recommendations: first, it probably works better on dark hair. I use a mix of dark browns and burgundies and it makes it darker, which is OK by me since I love the color. The other thing is I mix a bunch of colors together in a 12 oz. bottle. I add about a third of the 1 oz. Gray Magic to that, and mix. I know it says to use so many drops, blah, blah, but in my experience, it works better with MORE. The drops are also dark, so maybe that&#x27;s why people are complaining it makes your color darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your color will fade much slower, and the grays, as they fade, will show up as pretty highlights in your hair. Mine are a deep burgundy, and it look fantastic against the rest of my brunette hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a brunette or a dark redhead, I can&#x27;t think of any product that keeps gray at bay better than Gray Magic. And the price, for what it does, is cheap!</li>
            <li> Good additive to help my hair coloring do its job! Still need to add some other additives, but this product helps!</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times and it works well in covering gray and keeping it covered longer. I found that color &#x27;grabs&#x27; hair more intensely with it and made hair darker than I wanted, so I would lighten up a shade next time.</li>
            <li> Works okay so long as I use it with maybe a few drops of UnRed.  I use maybe 1/4 as many drops of the UnRed.</li>
            <li> My haircolor always seemed to &#x27;slip&#x27; after a week, so after some research I decided to try grey magic.  It seems to help the color stick longer to my stubborn grey hairs.  I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference or noticed any benefit to adding this product to my hair dye</li>
            <li> Works great for me. My hair is dark brown and I use red caircolor. My whites look brighter than the rest but I love that look. Depends on what you are after.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it locally.....found it and it works great!!</li>
