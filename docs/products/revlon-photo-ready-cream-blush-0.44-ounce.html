            <li>and it goes on very smoothly!!!</li>
            <li>great blush!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this item.</li>
            <li>This blush is not the color pictured online, but it doen&#x27;t go on very bright.  </li>
            <li>Good color!</li>
            <li>Great product&lt;br</li>
            <li>Revlon&#x27;s provided a great range of color&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Color is ok but not the best.</li>
            <li>Thought I would look like a clown since the color looks SO bright but it blends nicely and gives a nice flushed look.</li>
            <li>Love the way it glides in!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Its better than smacking yourself in the face to get rosy</li>
            <li>A creme is preferable to a powder on my aging skin, and I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different blushes and Revlon cream blush has worked best for me.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite of all rouges.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if your skin is very fair this would maybe be a good color for you, but I am olive complexioned and the choices available are limited.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li>very natural look and colors are great.</li>
            <li>It blends right into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and blends away easily.  </li>
            <li>So smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>The shades available do not blend well on olive skin.</li>
            <li>as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the pigment was just as bright as Too</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and am always looking for the right blush color that looks natural.</li>
            <li>I passed over this blush in the store because it looks bright pink.  </li>
            <li>This blush is very creamy and goes on smoothly without looking overly done.</li>
            <li>I needed to return this right away without even opening the package.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, very natural looking on the face.  </li>
            <li>the fact that there is no applicator may be kind of odd, but I have no problem using my fingers to smooth it on.  </li>
            <li>This particular shade is bright; I like it, but would like to get a more mauve shade and even a subtle coral shade.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to this from using a powder blush and feel that it is much better.</li>
            <li>at first i was dissapointed because it came in the shade peachy</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and, at the end of the day, there is still some color left.</li>
            <li>People have been saying that I look younger - pretty amazing for this one tiny change in my routine!</li>
            <li>Found to be very creamy, blended smoothly with no extra moisture needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply lighty as it is very pigmented.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found some at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>Decent cream blush for a fraction of the price of name brand makeup at the department</li>
            <li>It is actually a light pink color.  </li>
            <li>Whats new?</li>
            <li>I was surprised at its texture, color, &amp; staying power.</li>
            <li>Revolon discontinued the cream blush that I have been using for years, so before stocking up I decided to try the new product that apparently suppose to replace it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more expensive, non-drug store, brand&#x27;s of cream blush &amp; just recently tried Revlon&#x27;s Photo Ready Cream Blush.</li>
            <li>In fact, I also swipe it across my lips for a very natural pink.</li>

            <li> This is a very lovely, natural &amp;#34;flush&amp;#34; color once applied, but like other reviewers indicated, the color in the case is SHOCKING PINK!  </li>
            <li> I prefer a cream blush which recently has been quite hard to find.</li>
            <li> Pink cheeks for years!!</li>
            <li> little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> &amp; I ordered it in the pink normal color, but anyways it wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I gave my blush to my sister and was sorry I did when I couldn&#x27;t find another to replace it with.</li>
            <li> It can be blended for a very subtle effect so that it&#x27;s impossible to see where it&#x27;s been added.</li>
            <li> Was afraid my color would be discontinued, so purchased 3 boxes.  </li>

            <li> So smooth. Love the way it glides in! Good color!</li>
            <li> Its blush. Whats new? Its better than smacking yourself in the face to get rosy eh?&lt;br /&gt;A little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> This is a very lovely, natural &amp;#34;flush&amp;#34; color once applied, but like other reviewers indicated, the color in the case is SHOCKING PINK!  the fact that there is no applicator may be kind of odd, but I have no problem using my fingers to smooth it on.

            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Apply lighty as it is very pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;Great colour for the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different blushes and Revlon cream blush has worked best for me.  It&#x27;s light but you can build color and it goes on very smoothly!!!</li>
            <li> I needed to return this right away without even opening the package. I&#x27;d say if your skin is very fair this would maybe be a good color for you, but I am olive complexioned and the choices available are limited.</li>
            <li> great blush!  i found out it was being discontinued so i bought one in every color.  very natural look and colors are great.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all rouges.  Easy to apply, very natural looking on the face.  Was afraid my color would be discontinued, so purchased 3 boxes.  Pink cheeks for years!!</li>
            <li> I passed over this blush in the store because it looks bright pink.  This blush is not the color pictured online, but it doen&#x27;t go on very bright.  It is actually a light pink color.  I bought cream blush because I heard it stays on longer; however, I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement.  I am still getting used to this product ... I may keep buying it.  TBD</li>
            <li> Revolon discontinued the cream blush that I have been using for years, so before stocking up I decided to try the new product that apparently suppose to replace it. The shades available do not blend well on olive skin. Why oh why did Revolon ever decide to discontinue what was working. I  have stock4ed up on Revolon rosy glow cream blush per Amazon. Cannot believe the price some sellers are charging for this! I found some at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Decent cream blush for a fraction of the price of name brand makeup at the department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color is ok but not the best.</li>
            <li> I prefer a cream blush which recently has been quite hard to find. Thus, Amazon! This particular shade is bright; I like it, but would like to get a more mauve shade and even a subtle coral shade.</li>
            <li> Thought I would look like a clown since the color looks SO bright but it blends nicely and gives a nice flushed look. Love it!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and blends away easily.  It can be blended for a very subtle effect so that it&#x27;s impossible to see where it&#x27;s been added.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive, non-drug store, brand&#x27;s of cream blush &amp; just recently tried Revlon&#x27;s Photo Ready Cream Blush. I was surprised at its texture, color, &amp; staying power. Revlon&#x27;s provided a great range of color&#x27;s &amp; as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the pigment was just as bright as Too Faced, Benefit &amp; the Tarte blushes I&#x27;m used to. It stayed on all day &amp; is something I&#x27;ll use again.</li>
            <li> This blush is very creamy and goes on smoothly without looking overly done. It blends right into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations!</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  It takes such a small amount that it will last a very long time.  It is easy to apply and feels very smooth.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Found to be very creamy, blended smoothly with no extra moisture needed. Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; like makeup on. Gives you that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; look</li>
            <li> I gave my blush to my sister and was sorry I did when I couldn&#x27;t find another to replace it with. Packaging came intact and the product was not damaged nor tampered with. I love this product. I wish Revlon would bring it back. Easy to put on and, at the end of the day, there is still some color left.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and am always looking for the right blush color that looks natural. This is it! I recently switched to this from using a powder blush and feel that it is much better. People have been saying that I look younger - pretty amazing for this one tiny change in my routine!</li>
            <li> at first i was dissapointed because it came in the shade peachy &amp; I ordered it in the pink normal color, but anyways it wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
