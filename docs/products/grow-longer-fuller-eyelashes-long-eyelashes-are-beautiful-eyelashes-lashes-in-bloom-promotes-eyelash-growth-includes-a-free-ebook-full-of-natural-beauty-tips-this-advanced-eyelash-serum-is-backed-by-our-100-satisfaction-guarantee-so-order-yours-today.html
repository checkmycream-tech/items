            <li>This product was given to me for free with the understanding of myself giving a true response.</li>
            <li>You apply to clean lashes /face cleansing.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m  positive they will be buying this product as well!</li>

            <li>This is a great product and I can&#x27;t wait to see my results in another few weeks!</li>
            <li>There are a few key things to remember when using this product: -You must use it every night in the beginning to see the best results.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how much they continue to grow!</li>
            <li>Start from bottom to top as you would with regular mascara.</li>
            <li>With this, I feel it has actually conditioned my lashes and helped them stay healthy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait just a bit to put in my review to be able to test this product out properly.</li>
            <li>I havent had any issues so far, but wanted to offer a disclaimer on my own personal experience.</li>

            <li>-The tube lasts much longer than it says.</li>
            <li>didnt really notice a difference...</li>
            <li>However, I have seen a difference in how much fuller my lashes now look.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very gently, no pricking, I love it, will buy it again</li>
            <li>I am an Asian girl with very short eyelashes on the top and bottom eyelid.</li>
            <li>It was super simple to apply.</li>
            <li>This is super easy to apply; just use it consistantly at bedtime for at least 4 weeks and you will be amazed.</li>
            <li>and my eyelashes are super blonde and nearly invisible without mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second now, and the first lasted 4 months using it every day.</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to see any difference but so far this product is smooth and dose not burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>

            <li>Its not messy or sticky .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the slightest bit of growth in my eyelashes so far.</li>
            <li>I always had a decent size lash but always wanted bigger  and bolder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other eyelash growth serums before and I must say this is right up there with them.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I have used the serum as directed for the last several weeks now and haven&#x27;t actually seen much of a difference in eyelash growth.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still hoping for a more dramatic change.</li>
            <li>they are not super thick but much much better then they were.  </li>

            <li> &#x27;Lashes in Bloom&#x27; eyelash Enhancer Serum by CHEEVA BEAUTY is super easy to use and appears to be making my lashes look fuller at the base after just a few weeks of use.</li>

            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I have used other products but didn&#x27;t get the results I&#x27;m getting with this product.</li>
            <li> it is not even half way used...and</li>
            <li> it may cause slight</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little growth in my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it for a little longer to see if I get that change.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few days now and already see a difference.</li>
            <li> did it everyday for 2 weeks..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even work, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now(I wanted to give it a chance to show results before I reviewed the product) and my lashes appear to be getting thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is really only a glorified conditioner, with no drugs in it like the prescription Latisse or even the expensive Lashes To Die For.</li>
            <li> I just use this one few days, i can&#x27;t said its work or not, but at least I apply this to my lash</li>
            <li> Simply apply once a day at bedtime to the base of your upper and lower lashline,just like you would apply eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past, but found it too expensive and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> give it at least 4 weeks to see the results!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was quite skeptical.</li>
            <li> Dishonest!!!</li>
            <li> unable to cancel auto ship!  </li>
            <li> It irritated the crap out of my eyes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife been looking for products that help her eyelashes grow and her friend recommended this product and she totally love it and continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy the product but just look at the reviews dates</li>
            <li> love, love, love, love this product!!!</li>
            <li> The product came nicely packaged.  The instructions were easy to follow and I found it very easy to apply.  Looking forward to great results!</li>
            <li> I have used Latisse in the past, but found it too expensive and hard to apply. This serum applies just like eyeliner. It is so much easier since it has a thin brush (the Latisse brush seemed to cover my whole eyelid). I have sensitive eyes and this doesn&#x27;t bother them at all. Latisse used to make my eyes red and itchy. This serum goes on cool and then dries quickly so you forget it is even there. I have been using it for about 3 weeks not and I am already starting to see results. Especially when I have mascara on! I can&#x27;t wait to see how much they continue to grow!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on this, I decided to give it a try as a cheaper alternative to Latisse. I have to admit, I was quite skeptical. It is really only a glorified conditioner, with no drugs in it like the prescription Latisse or even the expensive Lashes To Die For. My lashes had gotten so sparse and short over the years, even having minor bald spots in some areas. I would use the most revved-up mascaras I could find, only to have my lashes barely noticible, even after many coats! This is super easy to apply; just use it consistantly at bedtime for at least 4 weeks and you will be amazed. I now have people comment on my lashes- most say they thought I was wearing false eyelashes! (I do still wear mascara,as my lashes are on the lighter side, but it is only 1 coat.) There are a few key things to remember when using this product: -You must use it every night in the beginning to see the best results. It takes only seconds to do. -The results are much more apparent if you use an eyelash curler and/or mascara. -The tube lasts much longer than it says. I&#x27;m on my second now, and the first lasted 4 months using it every day. (Long enough to see if it works on you). -Most importantly- give it at least 4 weeks to see the results! Be patient! Give this one a try- you will be amazed!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item I thought for some reason I was purchasing a mascara. I was really surprised to see an eye liner in the box so I have not ever used it. So I can&#x27;t honestly give a review because I haven&#x27;t used it because it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was going to be . My apologies. Glannetta Plascensia</li>
            <li> Very nice product, will buy it again</li>
            <li> The eyelash serum is amazing for making your lashes longer. I noticed a difference in mine. Mine grew about an inch since using. I always had a decent size lash but always wanted bigger  and bolder. Its easy to apply. You apply to clean lashes /face cleansing. Start from bottom to top as you would with regular mascara. Its not messy or sticky . this serum is lightweight and you will definitely see results after continuous use. I noticed about a week later. I apply it morning and night. when I do it in the morning I let it dry before I apply my mascara. The package came not damaged and shipping was quick and convienient. I had no issues.</li>
            <li> So it took me a while to put up this review because I needed a while to see results and be honest about what I think. I fully believe this works, after using this for about a month my lashes have grown longer and even thicker. This is a more affordable option to say lash extentions. It is super easy to apply, you just swipe it above your lashes as if you were putting on eyeliner. Just make sure you don&#x27;t let it run into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;** I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review as I set forth above. Give it a try you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product. When I was offered this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review I couldn&#x27;t resist. Who wouldn&#x27;t want longer lashes?? I&#x27;ve been using this every night for the past few weeks. I have noticed a little growth in my lashes. The most noticeable thing that has got me hooked on this is the fact that I don&#x27;t lose as many lashes as I normally used to. Every time I would wash my eye makeup off, no matter how gentle, a few lashes always came out. While putting on mascara a lash or two would come out. With this, I feel it has actually conditioned my lashes and helped them stay healthy. This is a great product and I can&#x27;t wait to see my results in another few weeks! Cheeva Beauty is a great company and I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I have a condition called PCOS...so this meant that  I had almost no eyebrows or lashes.  I used Cheeve on my eyebrows as well as my lashes.  I noticed a difference in about three weeks.  My eyebrows have thickened up and look great...I couldn&#x27;t have asked for thicker eyebrows.  My lashes have thickened up too...they are not super thick but much much better then they were.  They have not lengthened as of yet but I am hopeful as I am pleased with the results.  I was concerned that I would not be able to use the product as I seem to be allergic to everything on the planet.  But I had no issues with this...not even a tingle.  I will continue to use this product...it is not even half way used...and considering I put it on my brows as well as my lashes, I feel its a good buy for the money and how far it will go.  I will purchase this again and I do recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I can only give this product a 3 star rating for the fact I have not used it long enough to see any difference but so far this product is smooth and dose not burn my eyes. It seems to be very good for people who wear contacts too. This product was given to me for free with the understanding of myself giving a true response.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few days now and already see a difference. So happy I can wear make-up again and look nice</li>
            <li> Iltr. This is an awesome product. I have seen longer lashes after only 2 1/2 weeks! My friends have noticed the change, &amp; i never told anyone i was experimenting!  I&#x27;m  positive they will be buying this product as well! Great product to have in your beauty regiment.</li>
            <li> Good product but if you have allergies  this may not be for everybody</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month and see no difference in my lashes. Do not plan on buying again.</li>
            <li> didnt really notice a difference... did it everyday for 2 weeks..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even work, waste of money.</li>
            <li> unable to cancel auto ship!  Dishonest!!!</li>
            <li> IDK...It irritated the crap out of my eyes. It is a watery substance and IDK how much it works or how better it is than Lastisse.</li>
            <li> Got my product ... So excited to see results !!</li>
            <li> After only a couple of weeks I am noticing an increase in the length and fullness of my lashes!! I have used other products but didn&#x27;t get the results I&#x27;m getting with this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and does not irritate my eyes. Love seeing more and thicker lashes when I apply my mascara!</li>
            <li> I am an Asian girl with very short eyelashes on the top and bottom eyelid. After using Grow Longer Eyelashes from Cheeva Beauty products for a short while; I am very impressed with the improvement that I have attained.  My eye lashes have dramatically grown fuller, darker, and thicker. I have also been using the product on my eye brows and the result has been wonderful. Now I can say that I have darker and thicker eye brows too.  It was super simple to apply. You just brush it on your lash line in the same way that you apply liquid eye liner. I love it.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Lashes in Bloom&#x27; eyelash Enhancer Serum by CHEEVA BEAUTY is super easy to use and appears to be making my lashes look fuller at the base after just a few weeks of use.Simply apply once a day at bedtime to the base of your upper and lower lashline,just like you would apply eyeliner.That&#x27;s it!! I agreed to try and to honestly review Cheeva &#x27;Lashes in bloom&#x27;when it was offered to me free of charge.I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now(I wanted to give it a chance to show results before I reviewed the product) and my lashes appear to be getting thicker and fuller.I have Strawberry blonde hair and my eyelashes are super blonde and nearly invisible without mascara.I wasnt sure if I&#x27;d see results with this product considering how light the color of my lashes are.After just 2 weeks I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt; pleased to see my lashes becoming fuller and thicker already!The Lash Enhancer Serum is so easy to use and I&#x27;m thrilled at how quickly I&#x27;ve seen reults on my own lashes!</li>
            <li> I received these free with ILovetoreview. My daughter uses them and I would rebut them for her.</li>
            <li> I just use this one few days, i can&#x27;t said its work or not, but at least I apply this to my lash, it&#x27;s very gently, no pricking, I love it, will buy it again</li>
            <li> Awesome packaging great product</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait just a bit to put in my review to be able to test this product out properly. I&#x27;ve used other eyelash growth serums before and I must say this is right up there with them. I put mine on right before bed for best results. do one coat on each eye, then let it sit for a minute and go over again. Try not to get this on your actual eyelid. Some of these type products have been known to stain eyelid skin. I havent had any issues so far, but wanted to offer a disclaimer on my own personal experience. I&#x27;ve noticed the slightest bit of growth in my eyelashes so far. But I haven&#x27;t been using too long so I still have more time to wait until seeing prime results. But so far so good! I&#x27;d recommend this!</li>
            <li> So it took me a while to put up this review because I needed a while to see results and be honest about what I think. I fully believe this works, after using this for a couple of months my lashes have grown longer and even thicker. This is a more affordable option to other higher end brands. It is super easy to apply, you just swipe it above your lashes as if you were putting on eyeliner. It doesn&#x27;t run into your eye (just make sure you apply correctly or it may cause slight irritation)&lt;br /&gt;** I received this product at discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Works so well to lengthen my lashes</li>
            <li> I was super excited to have been given the opportunity to try out this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review because I had heard such wonderful things about the company and product itself. With that being said, I have used the serum as directed for the last several weeks now and haven&#x27;t actually seen much of a difference in eyelash growth. However, I have seen a difference in how much fuller my lashes now look. I will continue to use it daily in hopes to see a bit of a difference in length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I can tell some difference in them but I&#x27;m still hoping for a more dramatic change. I&#x27;ll keep using it for a little longer to see if I get that change.</li>
