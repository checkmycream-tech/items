            <li>Be sure not to get the waterproof!  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and emphasizes my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>It takes many coats and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>I love how they make us write words even when we are done.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>I love using this mascara, of course when it&#x27;s not raining.</li>
            <li>Perfect for any occasion and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li>Also great for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Regardless or not if it is the product or not Covergirl showing two items instead of one is still misleading and 1/2 of any product most certainly has to do with the item.</li>
            <li>I love to try new mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara, not too heavy, effective brush, not problems.</li>
            <li>Another good thing about this is that it washes away easy enough, not causing you to scrub or apply other makeup removing products to remove.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and used it for years but recently could not find it on the store shelves (went to Target, Walmart, RiteAid, and CVS...</li>
            <li>I have purchased this same exact mascara for years at Target or Walmart etc and love it, so I decided to just buy five of them here on amazon</li>
            <li>Luckily for me I found a new mascara (not CoverGirl though)</li>
            <li>so I am sure it is indeed a new mascara, but I could only use it once</li>
            <li>Really Like This Product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely will never purchase CG mascara ever again.</li>
            <li>and my eye didn&#x27;t burn as much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect too much, but was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Normally it would take me a couple months so to go through a tube.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I was already shopping and needed a new one</li>
            <li>Great mascara that doesn&#x27;t leave behind marks on your upper eyelid, nor does it flake half-way through the day.  </li>
            <li>Purchased a tube here on Amazon and while it appeared new and was in the original packaging, it was somewhat dry and only lasted about a week.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just got an old one.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t look clumpy or too heavy.</li>
            <li>and I could barely spread it through my lashes.</li>
            <li>It barely covers your lashes.  </li>
            <li>I really like the other cover girl mascara.</li>
            <li>It arrived dry and the package was old and brown like it had been on a shelf somehere for years.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Really Like This Product. Thank You For The Wonderful Service.</li>
            <li> I opened this mascara from closed packaging so I am sure it is indeed a new mascara, but I could only use it once and it was horrible. The mascara was extremely dry and I could barely spread it through my lashes. It was almost as if it had been sitting out and went dry, but again, I did open the package. I don&#x27;t know if mascara expires or not, but this was horrible. I&#x27;ve always used Covergirl but have purchased in the past from retail stores. I bought this because I was already shopping and needed a new one so I thought I&#x27;d just order to save myself the time of going to the store. Bad decision..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda a dry mascara.  I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara, not too heavy, effective brush, not problems. It&#x27;s hard to find locally so Amazon is my go-to supplier.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell you are wearing it. It takes many coats and I don&#x27;t like that. I still use it because I have to, but I use it with another brand</li>
            <li> I love to try new mascara. You never know when you will find that elusive perfect for you product. I hate to say I was really disappointed in this one. It was dry and had hardly any mascara in it when it arrived. However I do like the brush. Maybe I just got an old one.</li>
            <li> Was this mascara sitting in a warehouse for years? Need to add water just to get it on the brush. Will not order makeup on Amazon again.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be dry and stayed that way. I couldn&#x27;t use it for long. I love how they make us write words even when we are done.</li>
            <li> Great mascara that doesn&#x27;t leave behind marks on your upper eyelid, nor does it flake half-way through the day.  Another good thing about this is that it washes away easy enough, not causing you to scrub or apply other makeup removing products to remove.  I love this product and used it for years but recently could not find it on the store shelves (went to Target, Walmart, RiteAid, and CVS... couldn&#x27;t find). Purchased a tube here on Amazon and while it appeared new and was in the original packaging, it was somewhat dry and only lasted about a week.  Normally it would take me a couple months so to go through a tube.  Luckily for me I found a new mascara (not CoverGirl though) that I like and can buy in the stores.  UPDATE: Found this at Target the other day... it is now in a pink container under the same name.  So glad I found it.  Be sure not to get the waterproof!  Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.</li>
            <li> Absolutely will never purchase CG mascara ever again. Worst mascara. Flakes and seems to refuse to stay on my lashes.  Smears like no body&#x27;s business.  Weighs down my lashes &amp; makes them look so bad.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I ever bought.  It barely covers your lashes.  The case cracked within one week after I bought it.  I would never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I foolishly assumed from the picture, and as somebody that never buys mascara, that as two of them are shown I would get two.  I hope nobody else is fooled and I do believe this is misleading advertising. Regardless or not if it is the product or not Covergirl showing two items instead of one is still misleading and 1/2 of any product most certainly has to do with the item.</li>
            <li> best mascara i&#x27;ve ever had. Can&#x27;t believe I ever stopped using it. Perfect for any occasion and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I love using this mascara, of course when it&#x27;s not raining. lol  It goes on nicely and emphasizes my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Very great product love it. And does not wash away in the rain or if tears are in my eyes. Also great for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like the other cover girl mascara. It&#x27;s the purple package one, but I think it was irritating my eyes when I wore contacts. I gave these one a try and my eye didn&#x27;t burn as much. I also like that they don&#x27;t clump. It goes on pretty thick and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this same exact mascara for years at Target or Walmart etc and love it, so I decided to just buy five of them here on amazon so I wouldn&#x27;t keep running out and not having one.  EVERY ONE of the 5 was as dry as a bone.  I had to throw them away as soon as I opened them.  Very disappointed that I bought 5 and wasted $30!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying to find a good mascara that&#x27;s not clumpy. I didn&#x27;t expect too much, but was pleasantly surprised! It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t look clumpy or too heavy. This is one that I would probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I should have read reviews before purchasing, as I see somebody else also thought they were getting qty 2 of these (as I did) based on the photo.  Now that I carefully read the description, I see that it doesn&#x27;t state a qty of 2.  Photo is misleading still.  I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet so can&#x27;t review it&#x27;s quality yet.</li>
            <li> It arrived dry and the package was old and brown like it had been on a shelf somehere for years. I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back because it was only a few bucks. But I really was unhappy with the purchase, the product was flaky and dry and I could not even use it.</li>
