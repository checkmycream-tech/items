            <li>Joy Essential Oil is great!  </li>
            <li>Joy was my first oil</li>
            <li>the smell is a bit strong, but still nice</li>
            <li>It too overwhelming and smells like floral diaper cream-meaning a bit medicinal.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So many sold..</li>
            <li>so we could afford to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Just my opinion:)</li>
            <li>Really opens up your heart and feel Joy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a difference when using this product which is why I am happy that I decided to try one oil before placing a membership order and spending $160.</li>
            <li>I love it!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this blend.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It has a very comforting and happy smell.</li>
            <li>This oil was wonderful as a perfume, brushed against my pulse points in neck and over heart.  </li>
            <li>Roman Chamomile, an ingredient in blend, &amp;#34;combats restlessness, tension, and insomnia.&amp;#34; I am most grateful.</li>
            <li>My favorite oil.</li>
            <li>wear to as a perfume â€¦I get many compliments</li>
            <li>love the smell dab on your heart and wrists</li>
            <li>A bit strong, but a lovely invigorating blend.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy!</li>
            <li>This is what true perfume should smell like!</li>
            <li>but I use it everyday because it works - much better than any prescription (chemicals) from a Dr.  Wonderful oil!</li>
            <li>strong in Ylang Ylang.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the smell of this at first, but I will tell you, once it&#x27;s in the air, I really love it.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely enjoy it too.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of Joy.  </li>
            <li>Happy to find a source for essential oils</li>
            <li>and it made them feel calm!</li>
            <li>It will keep you happy all day long.</li>
            <li>Not the original scent.</li>
            <li>I really love this blend, and will definitely buy more blends!</li>
            <li>Young living has the best of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Young Living has the best essential oils!</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite blend.</li>
            <li>It presents a &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; full smell.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see that my YL Joy Blend arrived yesterday--a couple days BEFORE expected!!</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>my favorite scent by the oil is high quality</li>
            <li>Fast ship!!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as promised and on time!</li>
            <li>I am new to using essential oils but feel Young Living oils are the best.  </li>
            <li>Especially if using for a nice smell in my diffuser..</li>
            <li>The scent of Joy is very calming, very unique and can substitute for any much more expensive perfume!</li>
            <li>I love using this scent, but I do not recommend using it with other scents as it is a fairly strong and floral scent.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast and as promised.</li>
            <li>can be challeging.&lt;br /&gt;A drop of Joy Essential Oil into the palm of my hand swirled around and applied to the bottom of my feet seems too simple.  </li>
            <li>The Joy Essential Oil Blend was recommended to me and I wish to second the endorsement.  </li>
            <li>This was one of the first scents I ever used</li>
            <li>Love the scent and especially seemed to make me &#x27;Joy-ful&#x27;</li>
            <li>So pure and uplifting.</li>
            <li>It helped me a little; however, someone close to me told me they liked the scent</li>
            <li>So far the best use for it has been clearing out stale air in our home while the air conditioning is running non-stop.</li>
            <li>It smells like ylang-ylang too much for me</li>
            <li>Really like the scent of this oil.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really did not like the scent.</li>
            <li>Very uplifting.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very &#x27;feminine&#x27;.</li>
            <li>so no chance of skin irritation from using is straight.</li>
            <li>My husband, who has depression, really likes it too, and I find when I diffuse it, it just sort of cheers everyone up, including my kids.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was very prompt and well-packaged.  </li>
            <li>The real thing.</li>
            <li>I have bought several young living essential oils and have been quite happy, however, this &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; essential  oil was not pleasing to my senses.  </li>
            <li>I definitely can feel the true essence of this product.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying 2 more bottles in less then a week..</li>
            <li>This particular oil is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>I love to open the bottle and take a deep inhale.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Young Living Oils are high quality oils and certified pure.  </li>
            <li>My friend fell in love in this scent and I bought it for her as a little gift.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the quality is outstanding, but it STINKS.  </li>
            <li>Then again, all of Young Living&#x27;s oils are wayyyyy overpriced.</li>
            <li>it is very uplifting and works well with the EFT affirmations when I feel emotionally low.</li>
            <li>My husband also couldn&#x27;t stand this scent as he has a sensitive nose</li>
            <li>Came exactly as my YL direct would.</li>
            <li>A little to sweet for my liking</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than expected and was exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>I am a young living essential oil user.</li>
            <li>This oil is not the same quality as the ones directly.</li>
            <li>nice but expensive..</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m addicted :)</li>

            <li> I think I&#x27;m addicted :)</li>
            <li> I love Young Living EO&#x27;s but this blend smells terrible - like synthetic rose mixed with a few other notes that make me feel nauseous when I smell it.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last very long, can&#x27;t justify the price.</li>
            <li> I am always pleased by the slow subtle difference in the lifting of my mood so that i can respond to my families needs.</li>
            <li> Just a drop or two and before long I find myself humming and</li>
            <li> and I hate most perfumes they set off my allergies but Young Living Essential Oils</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, carefully wrapped, thank you.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too..</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone to Spirit Mountain and other sites..</li>
            <li> Packaged extremely well.</li>
            <li> So much better for me than perfumes w/chemical base.</li>
            <li> A little overpriced.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I diffused it for a few days hoping I would get used to it, to no avail.</li>

            <li> Not sure, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I like this, it was recommended, pricy and small bottle..</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was diluted or not.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just disgusting.</li>

            <li> Happy with the availability and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Love it! Good price and the seller was prompt and gets five stars too!</li>
            <li> As described. Good purchase!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell and gave to a friend, but she liked it. It smells like ylang-ylang too much for me and I just don&#x27;t like that smell.</li>
            <li> Not a great &#x27;flavor&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My friend fell in love in this scent and I bought it for her as a little gift. I bought one for myself as well and I absolutely enjoy it too. The scent of Joy is very calming, very unique and can substitute for any much more expensive perfume!</li>
            <li> In love with this oil!</li>
            <li> So much better for me than perfumes w/chemical base.</li>
            <li> This product is good quality. Excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> great for relaxing moods</li>
            <li> This oil is so uplifting. It is my absolute favorite blend. It will keep you happy all day long. You will spread your joy to all you encounter.</li>
            <li> Really like the scent of this oil.</li>
            <li> My rating go is for the scent of this oil. I&#x27;m sure the quality is excellent. The scent was sickening to me. Just disgusting.</li>
            <li> Not sure, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> One of our faves for diffusing</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Quick and easy! I&#x27;ll do a lot more shopping with these guys!</li>
            <li> I really did not like the scent. It too overwhelming and smells like floral diaper cream-meaning a bit medicinal. Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> By putting this on my wrists and neck, I will smell horrible.  So then people will stay away from me....and I will be happy!  Product works perfectly!!  :)</li>
            <li> A friend referred this oil to me because it worked for her.  It helped me a little; however, someone close to me told me they liked the scent and it made them feel calm! Go figure!</li>
            <li> This is just about the best aroma ever created, I use it every day and have for years,,,,,,</li>
            <li> nice but expensive.. they don&#x27;t last very long, can&#x27;t justify the price. So many sold.. I feel the company could give the consumer a break.. so we could afford to purchase more. I&#x27;ve gone to Spirit Mountain and other sites.. Especially if using for a nice smell in my diffuser.. Im not looking to cure anything. Just my opinion:)</li>
            <li> Love this scent! So pure and uplifting. Really opens up your heart and feel Joy.</li>
            <li> breath this an put it on your inner wrists and back of neck. a great mood lifter.</li>
            <li> Young Living Oils are high quality oils and certified pure.  This particular oil is one of my favorites.  It presents a &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; full smell.</li>
            <li> I love using this scent, but I do not recommend using it with other scents as it is a fairly strong and floral scent.</li>
            <li> Fast ship!! Item as described!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Uplifting fragrance that supports mood.  Shipped super fast and as promised.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It def has helped with stress and great to use in a diffuser if you have one!</li>
            <li> One of the best scents ever!!! This was one of the first scents I ever used and i would diffuse it every day if I could.</li>
            <li> I am new to using essential oils but feel Young Living oils are the best.  Joy has a nice sent and can be diffused.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected and was exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent at all.  I could describe the scent as akin to the essence of cedar and licorice pored over mothballs..  Very odd.  Also it did not make me joyful.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> the smell is a bit strong, but still nice</li>
            <li> Beautiful aroma! A little overpriced. Then again, all of Young Living&#x27;s oils are wayyyyy overpriced.</li>
            <li> I have bought several young living essential oils and have been quite happy, however, this &amp;#34;joy&amp;#34; essential  oil was not pleasing to my senses.  Would not purchase this product again and wish I could have returned it.</li>
            <li> Young living has the best of essential oils.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Young Living has the best essential oils!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference when using this product which is why I am happy that I decided to try one oil before placing a membership order and spending $160. I will stick with my organic oils from Mountain Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li> Joy was my first oil and I hate most perfumes they set off my allergies but Young Living Essential Oils do not and they help with my physical alignments.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;âœ¨ðŸ˜Šâœ¨</li>
            <li> The smell was unbearable for me.  I threw it away!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this essential oil blend for years.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m addicted :)</li>
            <li> This scent took some getting used to.  Product was delivered on time and with no problems.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as promised and on time!</li>
            <li> This is what true perfume should smell like!</li>
            <li> I am a young living essential oil user. This oil is not the same quality as the ones directly. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell!!! I definitely can feel the true essence of this product. So happy i came across this. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> P. U.  I&#x27;m sure the quality is outstanding, but it STINKS.  I would be EMBARASSED to go in public wearing it.  One of the ingredients is repulsive.</li>
            <li> I like this, it was recommended, pricy and small bottle..</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Very uplifting.</li>
            <li> As expected. Packaged extremely well.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice blend.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this blend.  it is very uplifting and works well with the EFT affirmations when I feel emotionally low.</li>
            <li> A bit strong, but a lovely invigorating blend.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Joy.  It just makes me happy when I smell it.  Happy to find a source for essential oils</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, the smell is divine and makes me happy!</li>
            <li> A little to sweet for my liking</li>
            <li> strong in Ylang Ylang. Love it.</li>
            <li> Not the original scent.</li>
            <li> Life can be hard.&lt;br /&gt;Life can be challeging.&lt;br /&gt;A drop of Joy Essential Oil into the palm of my hand swirled around and applied to the bottom of my feet seems too simple.  I am always pleased by the slow subtle difference in the lifting of my mood so that i can respond to my families needs.</li>
            <li> I love Young Living EO&#x27;s but this blend smells terrible - like synthetic rose mixed with a few other notes that make me feel nauseous when I smell it. I diffused it for a few days hoping I would get used to it, to no avail. My husband also couldn&#x27;t stand this scent as he has a sensitive nose and it&#x27;s very &#x27;feminine&#x27;. I&#x27;d stick with a safer scent like Valor.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, it&#x27;s great for anxiety!</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend for christmas - she always commented that I smelled good. I mixed it with body lotion so no chance of skin irritation from using is straight.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see that my YL Joy Blend arrived yesterday--a couple days BEFORE expected!! Love the scent and especially seemed to make me &#x27;Joy-ful&#x27; this morning when I put it on my wrists.  Very pleased with the seller&#x27;s prompt service and the product as well!!</li>
            <li> The Joy Essential Oil Blend was recommended to me and I wish to second the endorsement.  I love to open the bottle and take a deep inhale.  Instant heaven.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the smell of this at first, but I will tell you, once it&#x27;s in the air, I really love it. It has a very comforting and happy smell. My husband, who has depression, really likes it too, and I find when I diffuse it, it just sort of cheers everyone up, including my kids. So far the best use for it has been clearing out stale air in our home while the air conditioning is running non-stop. I really love this blend, and will definitely buy more blends!</li>
            <li> Joy Essential Oil is great!  Just a drop or two and before long I find myself humming and even singing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very prompt and well-packaged.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, carefully wrapped, thank you. This oil was wonderful as a perfume, brushed against my pulse points in neck and over heart.  Last night, I rubbed it on lower back, spine, where I have excruciating pain. The Essential Oils pocket reference, 5th Ed, which I had purchased Amazon, states &amp;#34;...apply over heart, thymus, temples, wrists. It may be massaged on the lower back...&amp;#34;. I re-read this @ 1am, with painful back. Moments later I fell asleep. Awoke smiling, no pain, &amp; had slept though the entire night. I re-checked the book. Roman Chamomile, an ingredient in blend, &amp;#34;combats restlessness, tension, and insomnia.&amp;#34; I am most grateful.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil not knowing what it would smell like..When I received the oil, I opened it and was instantly in heaven!! This has got to be the BEST smelling oil ever!! I ended up buying 2 more bottles in less then a week..NOT that I needed to, but because I wanted one in my purse, one at home, and just another incase I wanted to give as a gift. Beautiful, Beautiful smelling oil.. A little goes a long way too..</li>
            <li> Does not smell like joy!  Nothing that would raise my spirits.  Smells horrible, sending it back.</li>
            <li> I heard this product smelled amazing and could be used as a perfume. This could not be further from the truth!  People in my family even complained when I wore it!  It arrived quickly and packaged well. The one star is for the product.</li>
            <li> Oil came open.  Not sure if it was diluted or not.</li>
            <li> This keeps the man child quiet and happy/lol</li>
            <li> The real thing. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil from the beginning and hope to never be without it.  Feelings of depression or negative thoughts fade away when I apply it.  I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell but I use it everyday because it works - much better than any prescription (chemicals) from a Dr.  Wonderful oil!</li>
            <li> My favorite oil. Came exactly as my YL direct would. Perfection</li>
            <li> very nice oil,not my favorite scent by the oil is high quality</li>
            <li> this oil is quality oil. a little goes a long way. wake up everyday and put it on and notice your depression lifts&lt;br /&gt;amazing and also fast delivery</li>
            <li> wear to as a perfume â€¦I get many compliments</li>
            <li> It is absolutely wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> love the smell dab on your heart and wrists</li>
