            <li>This is very pretty in person it looks even better.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty, well made hair piece!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look cheap.  </li>

            <li>Love that it shipped so fast and arrived intact and as described!</li>
            <li>but it was definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to wear it first thing tomorrow :)</li>
            <li>This blue comb is very sturdy it is absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li>Even my mom was surprised of how nice the clip looked.</li>
            <li>This arrived quite early and is a nice quality piece for your hair.</li>
            <li>A fair size and appears that it will last.</li>
            <li>I ordered hair clips from Hong Kong before, and I know I have to wait for them, but more than one month is to much.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and pretty this hair comb is strong and is made with love and care.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect match of my blue skirt and many other dresses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are lucky I gave them one star.</li>
            <li>The quality is high and I&#x27;ve ordered many others because of it.  </li>
            <li>This is very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty comb.</li>
            <li>I like this one very much!  </li>
            <li>Very pretty for the price.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t just beautiful, but it is also heavy and well made.</li>
            <li>Very sparkly and pretty, I love it.</li>
            <li>Bought it in blue and purple and love them both!</li>
            <li>Have had compliments on it the first day I wore it!</li>
            <li>So beautiful on the hair, strong,but the metal kind of too sharp so need to be careful when to stick on the hair.</li>
            <li>looks great and is heavy won&#x27;t fall out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the wait</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the wait, though.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It is so beautiful that i want to use it everyday!</li>
            <li>The hair pin is  well-made and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth ordering this piece.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money and wait time from China.</li>
            <li>Red hair and Blue crystals, a beautiful combo.</li>
            <li>and I have the type of hair that slips easily through most hair barrettes, clips, bands, and other accessories.  </li>
            <li>these are as pretty and blingy as they look, but the comb broke off the jeweled part right away.</li>
            <li>And the colors are pure!</li>
            <li>Very, very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>My daughter wore it to middle school and had many friends asking her where she got it.</li>
            <li>Well, unfortunately I never received this hair clip..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of upsweep hairdos and needed pretty hair accessories.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that I bought the entire set!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is pretty though.</li>
            <li>I ordered the purple one first.</li>
            <li>When this one showed I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at they are both so pretty.</li>
            <li>Crystals are bright and sparkly, comb is steady and strong, long enough to keep it in place.</li>
            <li>The color is hot.  </li>
            <li>It was well packaged and the product is exactly as described and pictured.</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Almost too pretty to wear.</li>
            <li>They all look pretty.</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>Worth very cent, dresses the hair up for any ocation..</li>
            <li>I have very fine fairly long hair</li>
            <li>They really are pretty though.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I am very picky about hair clips.</li>
            <li>This lovely hair comb is strong and very heavy duty.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it, but at least the hold feels strong, I haven&#x27;t been able to pull it apart.</li>
            <li>I think that is very unprofessional.</li>
            <li>- it is actually much prettier in real life.  </li>
            <li>Fast arrival.  </li>
            <li>This hair clip is better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>This product really gives your hair a finished look, the teeth are sturdy and doesn&#x27;t hurt your scalp.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made product.</li>
            <li>The finish on the teeth has a chevron pattern that hold very well.</li>
            <li>Made very well</li>
            <li>Very substantial hair clip.</li>
            <li>It is very luminous.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>I knew it was going to be a cheaper item, but it was better than expected.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for the price, but I&#x27;m concerned that it will fall out of my hair because it&#x27;s quite heavy.</li>
            <li>This is just perfect not too big and heavy on my head and it hold good enough with my thick hair..</li>
            <li>My hair is mostly silver, quite a bit white and the blue stones look so pretty.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty much exactly like the picture - shiny, pretty in blue, and it stays in hair well.  </li>
            <li>A little smaller than I expected it to be, but it&#x27;s simply perfect otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Looks stunning in my dark hair.</li>
            <li>This is adorable, it makes my bun and half ups look fancy.</li>
            <li>The price was such a bonus and also of how quickly it came in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I glued it back together and was able to wear about 2-3 times before it finally broke again.</li>
            <li>The color is vibrant.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be big enough, but it was cute.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size: not gaudily large or pointlessly small (~3 1/2 inches wide).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a very pretty comb for long hair updo, and a very sturdy at that.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li>It is very dressy, but such pretty colors, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>(I usually do not have high expectations for cheaper items).</li>
            <li>it took a month to get here from Hong Kong, and the price I paid for it, I will live with the imperfection.</li>
            <li>Very classy ^_^</li>
            <li>It has a very classy look to it.</li>
            <li>It really gives my hair and my day little glamor, sparkle and fun!  </li>
            <li>, avoid dropping them on a hard surface - the stones can easily fall out!</li>
            <li>The pictures do not do it justice, my only regret is that I have not been able to find it in any other color....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided that I am going to be nontraditional and wear my hair long even though I&#x27;m almost 62 and this hair ornament looks just right</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and these are far too heavy to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have 3c 4a natural hair</li>
            <li>I wear my hair in a  ponytail and this slides in very well for extra bling.</li>
            <li>For a Chinese mail, it came fairly fast, so was shipped immediately at their end.</li>
            <li>some may be fixed by using tie-wraps..thru the holes</li>
            <li>and I was so surprised by how sturdy it is.</li>
            <li>Arrived early, and I recommend purchase.</li>
            <li>I had to wait longer than I expected when this item arrived , but it worth .</li>
            <li>it is top heavy you do have to secure it if you don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
            <li>Can not believe that you can buy such a beautiful thing for such price , unbelievable !!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to others, it takes longer than normal orders as comes across the ocean, but it still arrived for me ahead of the amazon anticipated date.</li>
            <li>I am very sad because it is pretty beautiful, but I waited for like 1 and a half months for it and nothing.</li>
            <li>It took less than 3 weeks to arrive in California from Singapore and it is worth the waiting.</li>
            <li>So think about it if you do not want to add extra weight to your already thick hair.:)</li>
            <li>I also thought it was a comb to pull your hair up behind your ears, but it&#x27;s meant more to be worn on the top of your head and only if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>This is really pretty and has a very stiff comb on it (which will be very sturdy).  </li>
            <li>Shipped much faster than expected.  </li>
            <li>sure you have a TON of hair to support this item - thin hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy but pretty though</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is very pretty in person it looks even better.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty, well made hair piece!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look cheap.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m going to wear it first thing tomorrow :)</li>
            <li> This blue comb is very sturdy it is absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> Even my mom was surprised of how nice the clip looked.</li>
            <li> This arrived quite early and is a nice quality piece for your hair.</li>
            <li> A fair size and appears that it will last.</li>
            <li> I ordered hair clips from Hong Kong before, and I know I have to wait for them, but more than one month is to much.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and pretty this hair comb is strong and is made with love and care.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect match of my blue skirt and many other dresses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are lucky I gave them one star.</li>
            <li> The quality is high and I&#x27;ve ordered many others because of it.  </li>
            <li> This is very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty comb.</li>
            <li> I like this one very much!  </li>
            <li> Very pretty for the price.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t just beautiful, but it is also heavy and well made.</li>
            <li> Very sparkly and pretty, I love it.</li>
            <li> Bought it in blue and purple and love them both!</li>
            <li> Have had compliments on it the first day I wore it!</li>
            <li> So beautiful on the hair, strong,but the metal kind of too sharp so need to be careful when to stick on the hair.</li>
            <li> looks great and is heavy won&#x27;t fall out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the wait</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the wait, though.</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It is so beautiful that i want to use it everyday!</li>
            <li> The hair pin is  well-made and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth ordering this piece.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money and wait time from China.</li>
            <li> Red hair and Blue crystals, a beautiful combo.</li>
            <li> and I have the type of hair that slips easily through most hair barrettes, clips, bands, and other accessories.  </li>
            <li> these are as pretty and blingy as they look, but the comb broke off the jeweled part right away.</li>
            <li> And the colors are pure!</li>
            <li> Very, very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> My daughter wore it to middle school and had many friends asking her where she got it.</li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately I never received this hair clip..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of upsweep hairdos and needed pretty hair accessories.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased that I bought the entire set!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It is pretty though.</li>
            <li> I ordered the purple one first.</li>
            <li> When this one showed I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at they are both so pretty.</li>
            <li> Crystals are bright and sparkly, comb is steady and strong, long enough to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> The color is hot.  </li>
            <li> It was well packaged and the product is exactly as described and pictured.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Almost too pretty to wear.</li>
            <li> They all look pretty.</li>
            <li> So pretty.</li>
            <li> Worth very cent, dresses the hair up for any ocation..</li>
            <li> I have very fine fairly long hair</li>
            <li> They really are pretty though.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I am very picky about hair clips.</li>
            <li> This lovely hair comb is strong and very heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it, but at least the hold feels strong, I haven&#x27;t been able to pull it apart.</li>
            <li> I think that is very unprofessional.</li>
            <li> - it is actually much prettier in real life.  </li>
            <li> Fast arrival.  </li>
            <li> This hair clip is better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product really gives your hair a finished look, the teeth are sturdy and doesn&#x27;t hurt your scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made product.</li>
            <li> The finish on the teeth has a chevron pattern that hold very well.</li>
            <li> Made very well</li>
            <li> Very substantial hair clip.</li>
            <li> It is very luminous.  </li>
            <li> thanks so much</li>
            <li> I knew it was going to be a cheaper item, but it was better than expected.</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for the price, but I&#x27;m concerned that it will fall out of my hair because it&#x27;s quite heavy.</li>
            <li> This is just perfect not too big and heavy on my head and it hold good enough with my thick hair..</li>
            <li> My hair is mostly silver, quite a bit white and the blue stones look so pretty.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty much exactly like the picture - shiny, pretty in blue, and it stays in hair well.  </li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected it to be, but it&#x27;s simply perfect otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Looks stunning in my dark hair.</li>
            <li> This is adorable, it makes my bun and half ups look fancy.</li>
            <li> The price was such a bonus and also of how quickly it came in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I glued it back together and was able to wear about 2-3 times before it finally broke again.</li>
            <li> The color is vibrant.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be big enough, but it was cute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size: not gaudily large or pointlessly small (~3 1/2 inches wide).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a very pretty comb for long hair updo, and a very sturdy at that.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li> It is very dressy, but such pretty colors, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> (I usually do not have high expectations for cheaper items).</li>
            <li> it took a month to get here from Hong Kong, and the price I paid for it, I will live with the imperfection.</li>
            <li> Very classy ^_^</li>
            <li> It has a very classy look to it.</li>
            <li> It really gives my hair and my day little glamor, sparkle and fun!  </li>
            <li> , avoid dropping them on a hard surface - the stones can easily fall out!</li>
            <li> The pictures do not do it justice, my only regret is that I have not been able to find it in any other color....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided that I am going to be nontraditional and wear my hair long even though I&#x27;m almost 62 and this hair ornament looks just right</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and these are far too heavy to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3c 4a natural hair</li>
            <li> I wear my hair in a  ponytail and this slides in very well for extra bling.</li>
            <li> For a Chinese mail, it came fairly fast, so was shipped immediately at their end.</li>
            <li> some may be fixed by using tie-wraps..thru the holes</li>
            <li> and I was so surprised by how sturdy it is.</li>
            <li> Arrived early, and I recommend purchase.</li>
            <li> I had to wait longer than I expected when this item arrived , but it worth .</li>
            <li> it is top heavy you do have to secure it if you don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Can not believe that you can buy such a beautiful thing for such price , unbelievable !!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to others, it takes longer than normal orders as comes across the ocean, but it still arrived for me ahead of the amazon anticipated date.</li>
            <li> I am very sad because it is pretty beautiful, but I waited for like 1 and a half months for it and nothing.</li>
            <li> It took less than 3 weeks to arrive in California from Singapore and it is worth the waiting.</li>
            <li> So think about it if you do not want to add extra weight to your already thick hair.:)</li>
            <li> I also thought it was a comb to pull your hair up behind your ears, but it&#x27;s meant more to be worn on the top of your head and only if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is really pretty and has a very stiff comb on it (which will be very sturdy).  </li>
            <li> Shipped much faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> sure you have a TON of hair to support this item - thin hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy but pretty though</li>
            <li> It looks false, cheap and chintzy.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Got this as gift for some one, not only was it affordable, but was heavy duty and looks like a high quality item.</li>
            <li> Colors are exactly as pictured - at least on my monitor.  </li>
            <li> Finally after two long months I received my Hair clip.</li>
            <li> Very heavy, my hair is not thick enough to hold this in my hair.</li>
            <li> it goes down, like sliping down when is on my hair, even if i get so much hair on it.</li>
            <li> A few stones fell off during the shipment but was inside the plastic bag, a drop of superglue fixed it.</li>
            <li> Obviously, don&#x27;t get rough with the item.</li>
            <li> In my experience combs with long plastic tine,while not as durable, stay put better.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these to put together to hold my long hair up.</li>
            <li> Only negative is the weight, it&#x27;s pretty heavy and will slide out if you lean over.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you get one or even two if you have really long thick hair and the price will astound you.</li>
            <li> Pity, nice idea, bad construction.  </li>
            <li> I was worried at first that my clip will come broken</li>
            <li> The comb is long enough to firmly hold think hair (hairpeice) in place.</li>
            <li> Yank it up into a sloppy bun and then adorn with this, and voila, pretty do!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pin is so precios, i love it, the bad thing is that even though my hair is thick and not so soft</li>
            <li> It is rather heavy, so again, your hair must be fairly thick and not thin.  </li>
            <li> and the pennies I spent on it</li>
            <li> Not very durable at all.</li>
            <li> only concern is that the hair clip is heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plastic as expected.</li>
            <li> Also purchased this in pink.  </li>
            <li> and I twisted it up in a French twist and put this comb in and people thought I had been to the hair salon.holds tight and looks sooooo pretty on.</li>
            <li> I got the comb today, and found that one dark blue stone was missing from one of the tips.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy, so it needs to be firmly placed in enough hair to hold it</li>
            <li> Garbage, definitely not worth it</li>
            <li> have dark hair so this stands out.</li>
            <li> Spruces up the average ponytail.</li>
            <li> It felt down all the time.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair tightly</li>
            <li> Its a heavy piece - I like that cause I have heavy and a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> They are not too heavy to wear without anything else.  </li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair  </li>
            <li> The jewels are sparkly and it has enough weight to hold in my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical of quality when ordered but happily surprised.</li>
            <li> me it was a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However they are a bit heavy, so</li>
            <li> I checked the sealed plastic pocket it arrived in, and there was nothing there, which means the stone was missing before packaging.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This product came as pictured on the site.  It holds my hair tightly and I have the type of hair that slips easily through most hair barrettes, clips, bands, and other accessories.  It&#x27;s a great size: not gaudily large or pointlessly small (~3 1/2 inches wide).</li>
            <li> This one is gorgeous looking! I can put up all my hair with only this one hair piece. Very, very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really loved it but it was broken when it arrived. I am going to solder it back together, I hope it works</li>
            <li> these are as pretty and blingy as they look, but the comb broke off the jeweled part right away. Another thing to note-I have fine hair and these are far too heavy to stay in my hair. The weight pulled the comb out. I also thought it was a comb to pull your hair up behind your ears, but it&#x27;s meant more to be worn on the top of your head and only if you have thick hair. They really are pretty though. By the way, I used a glue called E6000 to glue the comb back on and it&#x27;s stayed on. I haven&#x27;t used it, but at least the hold feels strong, I haven&#x27;t been able to pull it apart.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty and i LOVE the comb. I have 3c 4a natural hair and it holds perfects ONLY IF you pin the hair up with a bobby pin then put this over it. Very classy ^_^</li>
            <li> Ohmygawd! This hair clip is even more beautiful in person, i loved it! I was worried at first that my clip will come broken but it didnt. It was packaged real well &amp; arrived flawless.Even my mom was surprised of how nice the clip looked. The price was such a bonus and also of how quickly it came in the mail.  I can not wait to use it!</li>
            <li> So beautiful. Absolutely worth the wait and the pennies I spent on it and then some. Its a heavy piece - I like that cause I have heavy and a lot of hair. It holds it beautifully and is so pretty and sparkly in my hair. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Very pretty comb. I wear it in my pony tail usually because its very heavy. Its very sparkly and had no stones missing and seems solid that none will fall off.</li>
            <li> This arrived quite early and is a nice quality piece for your hair. A fair size and appears that it will last. I would recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> Picture does not do this justice.  Very beautiful piece.  My daughter wore it to middle school and had many friends asking her where she got it.</li>
            <li> Got this as gift for some one, not only was it affordable, but was heavy duty and looks like a high quality item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy but pretty though</li>
            <li> The product as the same as the picture, Very cute, Very charming. I Love it.  It&#x27;s good for a gift.</li>
            <li> Wow...this was simply beautiful!!  You can&#x27;t go wrong w/this as a present or for yourself!  The sparkle is fantastic!!  And the colors are pure!</li>
            <li> looks great and is heavy won&#x27;t fall out of your hair.  They look high end, great for a gift photo graft nice.</li>
            <li> I really loved the colors in this one but as soon as it came out of the package the design fell off the comb part.  I glued it back together and was able to wear about 2-3 times before it finally broke again.</li>
            <li> Very sparkly and pretty, I love it. Great way to add some bling to a hair bun or ponytail. It was packaged in bubble wrap, and I was glad it arrived in perfect condition. A little smaller than I expected it to be, but it&#x27;s simply perfect otherwise.  Definitely recommend, but if you do purchase this item, remember it ships from Asia and takes a while to get here. Definitely worth the wait, though.</li>
            <li> These are so beautiful and very stylish.  I get constant compliments on them.  They are not too heavy to wear without anything else.  I will be ordering more for loved ones.</li>
            <li> Looks stunning in my dark hair. Well made,sturdy. Not overwhelming or too glittery.&lt;br /&gt;Understated elegance. Thank you for making it.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured!!!  Lovely!  It really gives my hair and my day little glamor, sparkle and fun!  Arrived early, and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> I like this. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I wear my hair in a  ponytail and this slides in very well for extra bling.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair  (I have long,thick, coarse, curly locks) and the jewel piece detached from the comb after a couple uses. Not very durable at all.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is very beautiful and shiny.  The jewels are sparkly and it has enough weight to hold in my thin hair.  Took a while to ship here but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately I never received this hair clip.. I am very sad because it is pretty beautiful, but I waited for like 1 and a half months for it and nothing. When I contacted the seller, they just told me that they were going to refund the money because they have problems with the carrier, but even knowing, they never contacted me to let me know the problem. I think that is very unprofessional. They are lucky I gave them one star. I ordered hair clips from Hong Kong before, and I know I have to wait for them, but more than one month is to much. I would never nuy from them... so sad!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!! Finally after two long months I received my Hair clip. It is absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with the product. But I can&#x27;t recommend this people like sellers. They gave me a lot of excuses. Even promise to send me a gift in compensation for my time, but they never did it. Anyways, I have the Hair Clip and it is gorgeous. My best advice is try to get this with other seller.</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty - make sure you have a TON of hair to support this item - thin hair will NOT do it.  Lovely, lovely, lovely - the crystals are sparkly, the silver comb is very heavy and the pictures do not do it justice - it is actually much prettier in real life.  Fast arrival.  Very happy.  I&#x27;m ordering more and more from this line.</li>
            <li> This lovely hair comb is strong and very heavy duty. Every time I wear this one, I get a lot of compliments. Very sturdy and pretty this hair comb is strong and is made with love and care. I&#x27;d recommend this seller to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of upsweep hairdos and needed pretty hair accessories. I was so pleased that I bought the entire set!</li>
            <li> It is so beautiful that i want to use it everyday! A few stones fell off during the shipment but was inside the plastic bag, a drop of superglue fixed it.</li>
            <li> This is really pretty and has a very stiff comb on it (which will be very sturdy).  A crystal had come unglued from the clip and was inside the plastic wrapper (around the clip), so I&#x27;ll just glue that rather than email the sender and wait another month to receive another one.  Overall, a really beautiful clip for a very reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair comb &amp; a fantastic price.  It is very dressy, but such pretty colors, I couldn&#x27;t resist. I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> A beautiful bright blue that is very noticeable. It matches a dress I love perfectly! I always get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for the price, but I&#x27;m concerned that it will fall out of my hair because it&#x27;s quite heavy.</li>
            <li> The picture does not do it justice. It is very pretty and looks great in my hair. Bought it in blue and purple and love them both!</li>
            <li> This is just perfect not too big and heavy on my head and it hold good enough with my thick hair.. Its beautifully made..</li>
            <li> I like this one very much!  Stays put when you put it in your hair.  Have had compliments on it the first day I wore it!</li>
            <li> This hair clip is very beautiful. The colors are stunning. I will be ordering more of these to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Very pretty for the price.  Colors are not spot on to the pic, but matchy matchy is so 1995 anyway ;)</li>
            <li> Took ever to come. Maybe a month or so. It felt down all the time. I used it in my sister in law weeding, and it was a big mistake!</li>
            <li> Looks even prettier if possible once you see it in your hand and hair.I have very fine fairly long hair and I twisted it up in a French twist and put this comb in and people thought I had been to the hair salon.holds tight and looks sooooo pretty on.I highly recommend you get one or even two if you have really long thick hair and the price will astound you.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is better than what I expected. The body is made of real metal, not cheap plastic. And the color is so brilliant! It is a perfect match of my blue skirt and many other dresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern is that the hair clip is heavy. So think about it if you do not want to add extra weight to your already thick hair.:)</li>
            <li> Garbage, definitely not worth it</li>
            <li> Lots of compliment, nice and sturdy.love it! This product really gives your hair a finished look, the teeth are sturdy and doesn&#x27;t hurt your scalp. AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s dance.  Perfect in every way.  Well constructed.  Didn&#x27;t look cheap.  Shipped much faster than expected.  Very happy with purchase.  Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hairpin as described and shown in the picture. The color is vibrant. The hair pin is  well-made and well worth the price. I love the color of purple and it goes well with many of my dress. It took less than 3 weeks to arrive in California from Singapore and it is worth the waiting.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, nice sparkle, perfect for proms, weddings, formal events.  I would recommend it and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Lovely .  Was skeptical of quality when ordered but happily surprised. Nice colors and well made.  Worth ordering this piece.</li>
            <li> Very heavy, my hair is not thick enough to hold this in my hair. It is pretty though.</li>
            <li> This is a great accent piece for a bun, or 1/2 up hairdos. I always get compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful. They came without any damage.</li>
            <li> The hair cip is prettier than it looks in the picture.  I am pleased with the purchase and the price.</li>
            <li> This piece looks like a crown when it is on your head and is most lovely.  The quality is high and I&#x27;ve ordered many others because of it.  The price cannot be beaten anywhere.</li>
            <li> This blue comb is very sturdy it is absolutely beautiful. Do not be afraid to purchase this comb you will get lots of compliments like I do</li>
            <li> Pity, nice idea, bad construction.  It looks false, cheap and chintzy.&lt;br /&gt;For me it was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Do,not recommend it.</li>
            <li> So beautiful on the hair, strong,but the metal kind of too sharp so need to be careful when to stick on the hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the purple one first. It is lovely. When this one showed I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at they are both so pretty. However they are a bit heavy, so if you have thin hair I&#x27;d pass if not you won&#x27;t regret this. I have them for gifts. They will love them.</li>
            <li> I got the comb today, and found that one dark blue stone was missing from one of the tips.  I checked the sealed plastic pocket it arrived in, and there was nothing there, which means the stone was missing before packaging.  Otherwise, a very pretty comb for long hair updo, and a very sturdy at that.&lt;br /&gt;Considering it took a month to get here from Hong Kong, and the price I paid for it, I will live with the imperfection.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, Shiny, Securely fashioned jewels. Holds my hair perfectly with no other items needed.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing for the price. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> beautiful combs, but they are too big for what I wanted them for.  I will give them as a gift to a friend who has very, thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Really awesome hair comb. So gorgeous and well made. The picture does not do the color and transitions thereof justice.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I am very picky about hair clips. I just received this comb in the mail and I am impressed! Immediately I spun my hair into a bun and secured it with the comb. It holds perfectly well, nice and secure. This comb has a nice weight to it, looks well made, and it&#x27;s beautiful. I plan to order another one and more for my friends. Great product!</li>
            <li> too heavy with the metal comb to stay in the hair</li>
            <li> The instance I opened the package I knew I was going to give it a great review. The comb is so very gorgeous I am going to buy other colors. The comb is long enough to firmly hold think hair (hairpeice) in place. I have not worn it as yet but oooh i just can&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> The pin is so precios, i love it, the bad thing is that even though my hair is thick and not so soft it goes down, like sliping down when is on my hair, even if i get so much hair on it.</li>
            <li> Pictures do not do this justice. This is absolutely beautiful. I figured it would be like something from Wal-Mart but it is definitely NOT. This is a very well made product. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> beautiful...but already had to superglue back together. :/ I have very thick hair though! it has stayed together since glued!</li>
            <li> Love it! Beautiful color!</li>
            <li> I can see that you take pride in this product...plan to give this to my precious granddaughter I know she will just love this ..thank you</li>
            <li> I love this piece of jewelry and all my friends love this piece as well. It has a very classy look to it. you can also wear this piece in any season</li>
            <li> Colors are exactly as pictured - at least on my monitor.  It appears to be well-made.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but am sure it will stay put.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it. it is very pretty and strong.  it is made of strong glass and stones .. .</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this everywhere I go! It is WELL MADE! Rich in color and shines catching everyone&#x27;s eye! Best of all! It&#x27;s not super heavy at all! Slides in my hair easily and stays put! I plan on buying more! This is a good size too! Makes me feel royal when I wear it!</li>
            <li> This item is prettier than pictured. It is exceptionally well made for the type of item it is. The finish on the teeth has a chevron pattern that hold very well. Well worth the money and wait time from China. For a Chinese mail, it came fairly fast, so was shipped immediately at their end.</li>
            <li> Every woman loves shiny things and this dazzles beautifully both indoors and in the sunlight.  Truly eye catching!  I&#x27;ve recieved several compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the grip, can&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair accessories! Made very well</li>
            <li> this is the best product i have ever bought to date. i love how well it holds my hair and how comfortable it is. the colored crystals are beautiful and shine nicely. it adds a splash of color and a pop of beauty to my outfit when i wear it. i wear this all the time.</li>
            <li> This is adorable, it makes my bun and half ups look fancy. I got a lot of compliments when I wore it too</li>
            <li> Great price, beautiful colors, fast delivery. Very happy with the purchase. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> My 24 old LOVES this beautiful hair clip. She loves hair adornments and this one is the one that she wears the most. Red hair and Blue crystals, a beautiful combo. Crystals are bright and sparkly, comb is steady and strong, long enough to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I have not had a chance to wear this clip yet but it is absolutely gorgeous!  The pictures do not do it justice, my only regret is that I have not been able to find it in any other color....</li>
            <li> This is very pretty in person it looks even better. I would definitely recommend it to others, it takes longer than normal orders as comes across the ocean, but it still arrived for me ahead of the amazon anticipated date.</li>
            <li> This hair Clip is gorgeous!  I can hardly wait to wear it.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this item.  Very substantial hair clip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plastic as expected. Looks nice in the hair, it&#x27;s a decent size. Obviously, don&#x27;t get rough with the item.</li>
            <li> it came missing some of the jewels. but it hold my hair in place when i wear it in my hair</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  It is very luminous.  The color is hot.  My dauthers loves it.  They look very good.</li>
            <li> Lots of sparkle. Looks great in and the colors are very pretty. Only negative is the weight, it&#x27;s pretty heavy and will slide out if you lean over.</li>
            <li> it is top heavy you do have to secure it if you don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I get compliments everytime I wear it. And people ask me where I got it from.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip love the price that I&#x27;m buying more different styles and colors</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty, well made hair piece! I would recommend it to anybody the only thing is the shipping takes forever so I wouldnt recommend it if you needed it asap.</li>
            <li> I had to wait longer than I expected when this item arrived , but it worth . Can not believe that you can buy such a beautiful thing for such price , unbelievable !!!Great for a gift also</li>
            <li> This arrived 30 days ahead of the allotted shipping period (it ships from Hong Kong). It was well packaged and the product is exactly as described and pictured. It is stunning and really dresses up your hair! *shrugs* What can I say? I&#x27;m a girl, I like sparkles! :) This looks awesome in my hair. Yank it up into a sloppy bun and then adorn with this, and voila, pretty do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark hair so this stands out. I don&#x27;t know how it would look on lighter hair colors, but I&#x27;m sure it would look just as sparkly! Love that it shipped so fast and arrived intact and as described! Not to mention, that&#x27;s a wonderful price for a sturdy, metal &amp; crystal, comb!</li>
            <li> Simply beautiful. Heavy comb. Exactly as shown in the picture. Great product. Great for a gift or for yourself. Sparkly</li>
            <li> this is gorgeous. It is a bit heavy, so it needs to be firmly placed in enough hair to hold it</li>
            <li> I love this hair piece - the colors are vibrant &amp; beautiful! It took a while to get here but it was definitely worth the wait! I&#x27;m going to wear it first thing tomorrow :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. WILL BUY MORE.</li>
            <li> beautiful hair pin, came in good condition and well packaged, I recommend this pin looks very elegant. Thank You</li>
            <li> This clip is very beautiful more so than the picture describes  It is rather heavy, so again, your hair must be fairly thick and not thin.  I&#x27;m sure most will love it.</li>
            <li> well worth the money and more.....thanks so much, it is quality and it is beautiful I would purchase from you again and again</li>
            <li> Beautiful and well constructed. Also purchased this in pink.  Receive many compliments when I wear them.</li>
            <li> The three stars R because they have been breaking apart,while trying to place in the hair...they were made in China...some may be fixed by using tie-wraps..thru the holes it may just work!!!Holding tie-wraps..</li>
            <li> You may as well buy 5 or 10 of these beautiful hair combs because all of your sisters and girlfriends will want to have one or two.</li>
            <li> My hair is mostly silver, quite a bit white and the blue stones look so pretty.  I&#x27;ve decided that I am going to be nontraditional and wear my hair long even though I&#x27;m almost 62 and this hair ornament looks just right</li>
            <li> This is pretty much exactly like the picture - shiny, pretty in blue, and it stays in hair well.  I can toss up my hair ina pony tail and throw this in for my color.  I like that.</li>
            <li> Colors bursting in brilliance!  Almost too pretty to wear. I can&#x27;t wait to match it a gown for the next cruise.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be big enough, but it was cute. It was a present for a friend and she like it</li>
            <li> I wore this on Easter and I was so surprised by how sturdy it is. It isn&#x27;t just beautiful, but it is also heavy and well made. I can&#x27;t believe I received such a good quality item for the price I paid! Will be shopping at this store again!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous hair comb. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it. Arrived early, and I recommend purchase.</li>
            <li> This was stunning and was a fun pop of color on my wedding day!</li>
            <li> There are several accessories in this series. They all look pretty. They are medium sized with metal tines, but they are heavy and the tines are slippery. I have wavy, soft hair of, neither thick, nor thin. The comb does not hold it and even slips out when used as a decoration. It might work better with thicker/coarser or curly hair. I still like wearing it, just wishing for a more secure hold. In my experience combs with long plastic tine,while not as durable, stay put better.&lt;br /&gt;Also, avoid dropping them on a hard surface - the stones can easily fall out!</li>
            <li> So pretty. Spruces up the average ponytail.</li>
            <li> I love these clips as they are all well made, look great and make a great fashion statement.</li>
            <li> I knew it was going to be a cheaper item, but it was better than expected. (I usually do not have high expectations for cheaper items).</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these to put together to hold my long hair up. They work very well. I was very impressed with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price. Colors are similar to those pictured.</li>
            <li> So beautiful, works great in the hair with a twist brades ect. Worth very cent, dresses the hair up for any ocation..</li>
            <li> Very pretty and looks amazing in hair.</li>
