            <li>it has a fruity-berry ish scent to it that makes this scent perfect during the daytime (especially during the spring or summer).</li>
            <li>The item also came very fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly and very securely packaged.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong nor too light!</li>
            <li>This is a great soft scent that&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It smells okay, but it does smell cheap.</li>
            <li>Smells very light and fresh, not overpowering like some perfumes!</li>
            <li>but i think its just right!!</li>
            <li>i love how light but strong it is.</li>
            <li>If I would have know that it was the real thing I would have gladly bought 10 more!  </li>
            <li>I will be watching this Seller for other great deals!</li>
            <li>Sweet, just like I like it!</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my little sister and it smelled great, she loved this perfume</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume came fast and was the real deal for a great price</li>
            <li>Fragrance is nice, floral, fruity, fresh, and clean.  </li>
            <li>its a very feminine smell and its amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fruity but it lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to dish out the $70</li>
            <li>It smells sweat yet fresh, it smells interesting</li>
            <li>It makes a great present</li>
            <li>It is such a great price</li>
            <li>It settles in nicely and keeps it scent very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One day I decided to try them out, and loved the smell of Born Wild.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, I recommend it to every girl who wants to feel girly and pretty, love it!</li>
            <li>Love this perfume, got it right on time also.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, fruity floral that doesn&#x27;t smell too young for more mature women to wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to wear the perfume, but could do without the cheezy artwork on the bottle.</li>
            <li>The first time I got sample, I felt in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;After that I want to try all product.</li>
            <li>My grandmother first bought me Ed Hardy perfume for Christmas a couple of years ago, and I immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Born Wild is the perfect blend of florals that last all day.</li>
            <li>Great price my Fiancee has asked for this same fragrance again after I bought her the first one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This is a sweet smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>But not too sweet.</li>
            <li>it has a sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li>Sweet but not in a flowery way.</li>
            <li>after a while it started to smell sweet.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price, as this same product is more than twice the cost in major department stores!</li>
            <li>I currently own, Love &amp; Luck, Hearts &amp; Daggers, and most recently Born Wild.</li>
            <li>Smells great like all the other scents from this designer .</li>
            <li>To me Born Wild has a sweeter fragrance to it than the original, and I tend to like it much better.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful long lasting scent.with a cant be beat price .you</li>
            <li>Great perfume, I have gotten a few compliments from it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great everyday scent to add to my collection</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and worth it.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it would be worth the risk</li>
            <li>The first note is blackberries-not too sweet though.</li>
            <li>The price was worth it</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it in a store near me so pleased to find it online.</li>
            <li>whatever you apply it quite a bit, this stuff is nice, but doesn&#x27;t make me do a double take.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best smelling perfumes that I have smelled in a long time and it arrived before the due date.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely order again.</li>
            <li>my second favorite ed hardy</li>
            <li>Light sweet smell that linger after u left the room...</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it, I kept calling my husband and saying, \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li>I love the fruity fragrance and the fact that it last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I really like it and you cant pass this up!</li>
            <li>Love this very different fragrance!</li>
            <li>When I got an Amazon Gift Card I knew exactly how I was going to use it.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT smelling product that is not overwhelming (nor is it underwhelming)!</li>
            <li>Overall it did have a nice smell, but I think it comes down to me liking more earthy smells.</li>
            <li>I totally love this perfume a little sweet</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd bottle that I have ordered from the same seller and I am pretty satisfied!</li>
            <li>and wow verrry quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice looking but the lid/cap is large and a little cumbersome.</li>
            <li>Ed Hardy&#x27;s Born Wild is perfectly natural and lightly fruit scented.</li>
            <li>and that makes me question if it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Classy and Fresh-</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to get it for my wife.  </li>
            <li>this is the real deal for a lot cheaper than department stores.</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>, I really can&#x27;t describe the scent,</li>
            <li>Not the real perfume (a</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t very close</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on here than at Kohls.</li>
            <li>It is very flowery and girly.</li>
            <li>I really feel like if you&#x27;re going to wear something, it should make you want to smell your wrist or</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was surprised on how cheep and fast it got here.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of the original pink Ed Hardy perfume, then you might want to try this one as well.</li>
            <li>The smell was a little more sweet than I anticipated but maybe other users will like that!</li>
            <li>It also lasts all day long, I can smell it on me right now. .</li>
            <li>other than not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>Not only did this arrive in a very timely manner, but it also exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Not heavy .</li>
            <li>it and you will like it if you like soft fruity fragrances.</li>
            <li>Some of the others are too young for me, but this one...</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised with Ed Hardy&#x27;s \\&quot;Born Wild.\\</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap either, and a few spritzes of this stuff, like all Ed Hardy perfume, will last you all day.</li>
            <li>we got the smaller ed hardy born wild the 1.7 oz an</li>
            <li>There is a little more than half the bottle left.</li>
            <li>I put this on my wishlist and waited for it to get down to a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> but i think its just right!!</li>
            <li> i love how light but strong it is.</li>
            <li> If I would have know that it was the real thing I would have gladly bought 10 more!  </li>
            <li> I will be watching this Seller for other great deals!</li>
            <li> Sweet, just like I like it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my little sister and it smelled great, she loved this perfume</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume came fast and was the real deal for a great price</li>
            <li> Fragrance is nice, floral, fruity, fresh, and clean.  </li>
            <li> its a very feminine smell and its amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and fruity but it lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to dish out the $70</li>
            <li> It smells sweat yet fresh, it smells interesting</li>
            <li> It makes a great present</li>
            <li> It is such a great price</li>
            <li> It settles in nicely and keeps it scent very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One day I decided to try them out, and loved the smell of Born Wild.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, I recommend it to every girl who wants to feel girly and pretty, love it!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, got it right on time also.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, fruity floral that doesn&#x27;t smell too young for more mature women to wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to wear the perfume, but could do without the cheezy artwork on the bottle.</li>
            <li> The first time I got sample, I felt in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;After that I want to try all product.</li>
            <li> My grandmother first bought me Ed Hardy perfume for Christmas a couple of years ago, and I immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Born Wild is the perfect blend of florals that last all day.</li>
            <li> Great price my Fiancee has asked for this same fragrance again after I bought her the first one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a sweet smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> But not too sweet.</li>
            <li> it has a sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li> Sweet but not in a flowery way.</li>
            <li> after a while it started to smell sweet.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price, as this same product is more than twice the cost in major department stores!</li>
            <li> I currently own, Love &amp; Luck, Hearts &amp; Daggers, and most recently Born Wild.</li>
            <li> Smells great like all the other scents from this designer .</li>
            <li> To me Born Wild has a sweeter fragrance to it than the original, and I tend to like it much better.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful long lasting scent.with a cant be beat price .you</li>
            <li> Great perfume, I have gotten a few compliments from it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a great everyday scent to add to my collection</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and worth it.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it would be worth the risk</li>
            <li> The first note is blackberries-not too sweet though.</li>
            <li> The price was worth it</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it in a store near me so pleased to find it online.</li>
            <li> whatever you apply it quite a bit, this stuff is nice, but doesn&#x27;t make me do a double take.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling perfumes that I have smelled in a long time and it arrived before the due date.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely order again.</li>
            <li> my second favorite ed hardy</li>
            <li> Light sweet smell that linger after u left the room...</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it, I kept calling my husband and saying, \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li> I love the fruity fragrance and the fact that it last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I really like it and you cant pass this up!</li>
            <li> Love this very different fragrance!</li>
            <li> When I got an Amazon Gift Card I knew exactly how I was going to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT smelling product that is not overwhelming (nor is it underwhelming)!</li>
            <li> Overall it did have a nice smell, but I think it comes down to me liking more earthy smells.</li>
            <li> I totally love this perfume a little sweet</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd bottle that I have ordered from the same seller and I am pretty satisfied!</li>
            <li> and wow verrry quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice looking but the lid/cap is large and a little cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Ed Hardy&#x27;s Born Wild is perfectly natural and lightly fruit scented.</li>
            <li> and that makes me question if it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Classy and Fresh-</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to get it for my wife.  </li>
            <li> this is the real deal for a lot cheaper than department stores.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> , I really can&#x27;t describe the scent,</li>
            <li> Not the real perfume (a</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t very close</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on here than at Kohls.</li>
            <li> It is very flowery and girly.</li>
            <li> I really feel like if you&#x27;re going to wear something, it should make you want to smell your wrist or</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how cheep and fast it got here.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of the original pink Ed Hardy perfume, then you might want to try this one as well.</li>
            <li> The smell was a little more sweet than I anticipated but maybe other users will like that!</li>
            <li> It also lasts all day long, I can smell it on me right now. .</li>
            <li> other than not too sweet.  </li>
            <li> Not only did this arrive in a very timely manner, but it also exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Not heavy .</li>
            <li> it and you will like it if you like soft fruity fragrances.</li>
            <li> Some of the others are too young for me, but this one...</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised with Ed Hardy&#x27;s \\&quot;Born Wild.\\</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap either, and a few spritzes of this stuff, like all Ed Hardy perfume, will last you all day.</li>
            <li> we got the smaller ed hardy born wild the 1.7 oz an</li>
            <li> There is a little more than half the bottle left.</li>
            <li> I put this on my wishlist and waited for it to get down to a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long lasting</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think it last that long.</li>
            <li> 3.4oz, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts long as well.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on too long</li>
            <li> I had just bought the same ounces for my daughter at Christmas time and spent over $70.00 for it at Elder Beermans.  </li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected and was packaged the same way I would&#x27;ve gotten it from Belk!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly similar, probably due to the berries and magnolia.</li>
            <li> You pay 35$ for the small container of this at the big stores, but from amazon you get a bottle that&#x27;s twice the size for only 20$!</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding Born Wild in department stores.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Whenever I buy fruity and floral scents I usually don&#x27;t expect them to last very long.</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell much magnolia sadly</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this, but hate the brand.</li>
            <li> it was 75$ at some other store!</li>
            <li> Just a really bland fragrance</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long over even for an hour after spraying it on.</li>
            <li> Weak, last 1/2 hr,  smells like candy</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday, with 3 sprays a day.</li>
            <li> fake)..don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I get compliments from every one whenever I wear this -- in fact, it&#x27;s one of the few perfumes I will wear.</li>
            <li> I get compliments everyday</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too heavy of a perfume and can be worn without fear of offending anyone.</li>
            <li> It was very expensive at the store, but on Amazon it was very affordable.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife since she has had it in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not that fruity fake fruit smell either.</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim, and I&#x27;m not happy or disappointed</li>

            <li> It smells great and is MUCH Cheaper than in stores. It came with a bunch of free samples which was also great. However I noticed the fragrance didn&#x27;t last all day like it does when i buy it from the store and that makes me question if it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I love my Ed Hardy!!!!</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely fashion and was alot more affordable then in the stores. I will most definitely order again. I was completely satisfied.</li>

I would highly recommend this to everyone! Great value for the price, as this same product is more than twice the cost in major department stores!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas.  I was finished shopping for her, but my sister showed me this and I really wanted to get it for my wife.  It was very expensive at the store, but on Amazon it was very affordable.  She uses it all the time, and I still think its great.</li>

            <li> My favorite of the Ed Hardy brand and found it here!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this, but hate the brand. My mom bought me an Ed Hardy perfume sampler once - I rolled my eyes and almost didn&#x27;t even open it to smell it. One day I decided to try them out, and loved the smell of Born Wild. I put this on my wishlist and waited for it to get down to a reasonable price. I&#x27;m excited to wear the perfume, but could do without the cheezy artwork on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love all Ed Hardy Perfume! So glad I order this! Will order again!! Thanks alot for the great pricing</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling perfumes that I have smelled in a long time and it arrived before the due date.</li>

            <li> This is a sweet smelling perfume. But not too sweet. I love it. 3.4oz, lasts a long time. I have had mine for about 5 months now. I wear it everyday, with 3 sprays a day. There is a little more than half the bottle left.</li>
            <li> Great product my wife loves it</li>

            <li> My favorite perfume came fast and was the real deal for a great price</li>
            <li> Weak, last 1/2 hr,  smells like candy</li>
            <li> I think im in love with every ed hardy perfume! Im not a big fan of the brand itself but i got to say they make some awesome perfumes for women! I totally love this perfume a little sweet but i think its just right!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume and I love the price! You pay 35$ for the small container of this at the big stores, but from amazon you get a bottle that&#x27;s twice the size for only 20$! This is awesome :)</li>
            <li> Fragrance is nice, floral, fruity, fresh, and clean.  Lasts long as well. Not heavy .</li>
            <li> Smells great this is the real deal for a lot cheaper than department stores.</li>
            <li> Smells very light and fresh, not overpowering like some perfumes! Inexpensive and worth it.  I used to use more expensive perfume, but why?</li>
            <li> the smell is so sweet!! i love how light but strong it is. its a very feminine smell and its amazing i am very pleased</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. It&#x27;s light and fruity but it lasts and lasts. Not that fruity fake fruit smell either. Nice and naturally light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> For me this does not last at all.  Not sure why.  Smells good, I really can&#x27;t describe the scent, other than not too sweet.  The bottle is nice looking but the lid/cap is large and a little cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Smells good but I have noticed it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on too long but it does smell good and a great size for the price! Total deal!!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for some inexpensive perfume to purchase with my Amazon gift cards.  I saw this for $14.00 and thought it was a fluke.  What the heck?  I had just bought the same ounces for my daughter at Christmas time and spent over $70.00 for it at Elder Beermans.  The total with tax &amp; shipping came to under$19.00 so I thought it would be worth the risk and it was!  If I would have know that it was the real thing I would have gladly bought 10 more!  I will be watching this Seller for other great deals!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife since she has had it in the past.  Smells very nice on her and was true to the scent, no knock off recieved.</li>
            <li> Smells great like all the other scents from this designer . Would recommend to anyone looking for a not too fruity perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice on my daughter.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great!  I bought it without trying it &amp; am very pleased that I decided to made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and it smells GREAT.  It is an excellent price for the size of the bottle as well.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Loved it and great price! About to order again. Saves a lot compared to store prices. Sweet, just like I like it!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, got it right on time also. This has to be one of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve tried! Love it.</li>
            <li> Not the real perfume (a fake)..don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I get compliments from every one whenever I wear this -- in fact, it&#x27;s one of the few perfumes I will wear.</li>
            <li> The first note is blackberries-not too sweet though. It fades into a softer scent as the day goes on. I don&#x27;t smell much magnolia sadly, I was hoping for a closer match to BBW discontinued Magnolia Blossom. This isn&#x27;t very close but it is still a great perfume.</li>
            <li> I was scared I wouldn&#x27;t like this bout I LOVE it... it has a sweet smell to it. I definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Da bomb! ! Light sweet smell that linger after u left the room...</li>
            <li> Loved this perfume!  Much cheaper on here than at Kohls.</li>
            <li> Great perfume, I have gotten a few compliments from it I just wish it can stay on my skin longer. I spray it on my clothes and I love the smell. Great perfume.</li>
            <li> I was surprised on how cheep and fast it got here. I ordered this for my little sister and it smelled great, she loved this perfume so much!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> I gave this 5star rating because I this is one of my favorite perfumes I make sure I have this in my collection ALWAYS!! &amp; I would recommend this to any women that love a wonderful fragrance such as this.</li>
            <li> this perfume smell so good and wonderful thankyou.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEARING THE ED HARDY .IT GOT IT GOING ON.BUY FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT,I&#x27;M GOING TO ORDER MORE FOR GIFTS</li>
            <li> Great deal smells beautiful highly recommended</li>
            <li> I just love all Ed Hardy perfumes is perfect for my collection, am very happy with it smells great too.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great price my Fiancee has asked for this same fragrance again after I bought her the first one.</li>
            <li> Lovet this perfume and ordering it through Amazon, I was able to get it at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. It is very flowery and girly. I get compliments everyday I wear it. The item also came very fast and in good condition. This is the perfect girly smell!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of the original pink Ed Hardy perfume, then you might want to try this one as well. To me Born Wild has a sweeter fragrance to it than the original, and I tend to like it much better. It isn&#x27;t too heavy of a perfume and can be worn without fear of offending anyone. Definitely worth every penny, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to dish out the $70+ it would have cost me at the department store.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got me this perfume and it smells amazing I love it it&#x27;s like a floral smell and it&#x27;s long lasting</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and smells wonderful. Sweet but not in a flowery way.</li>
            <li> I Got this for my gf for her b-day and i was amazed when i saw it for how low the price is! we got the smaller ed hardy born wild the 1.7 oz an it was 75$ at some other store! It smells amazing to i love when she puts this on! for all the guys and girls about to buy it, its a med. high dollar parfum and for a great price on amazon!</li>
            <li> Born Wild is the perfect blend of florals that last all day. Ed Hardy perfumes last. No like others that fade&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of compliments on this scent. Perfect price too.</li>
            <li> I love this parfum!!! From the moment I smelled it, I was hooked. The first day I wore it, I kept calling my husband and saying, \\&quot;Oh my God, I smell soooo good!!!!\\&quot; LOL. It also lasts all day long, I can smell it on me right now. . yummm!! I have never fallen instantly in love with a parfum before. I recommend this to anyone. . although, Im almost too greedy and don&#x27;t want anyone else to smell as good as I do! LOL</li>
            <li> It smells okay, but it does smell cheap. It smells sweat yet fresh, it smells interesting I would say. It is perfectly for young girls like teenagers.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for what you pay for i&#x27;m so happy with my purches!!!very cute i would recommend this</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this purchase. Definately recommended</li>
            <li> What can I say, all of the fragrances in this line are just pleasing to my nose.  I love the fruity fragrance and the fact that it last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and you will like it if you like soft fruity fragrances.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so,so good without being overpowering. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long over even for an hour after spraying it on.</li>
            <li> I love all Ed Hardy perfume. The first time I got sample, I felt in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;After that I want to try all product. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I love a bargain.  And to get it and its &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; is fabulous!!  Thank you :)</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, fruity floral that doesn&#x27;t smell too young for more mature women to wear. I love the blackberry notes. The price on Amazon was great, too, and Fragrancenet always sends samples and mirrors with their orders. I&#x27;m really happy I found this here. Edit May 2016: if you like Marc Jacobs Oh! Lola, but don&#x27;t like the price, try this one. It&#x27;s fairly similar, probably due to the berries and magnolia.</li>
            <li> I would buy this product over an over. It&#x27;s very good smelling. And so much bigger that I would have got at Perfumania for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Just a really bland fragrance</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Bought for daughter in law and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Waiting on my Bamboo back scratcher, will be here between Friday Feb. 21- Feb.26th. I trust it will be here on one of those dates.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a very good scent. It is not too strong nor too light! The bottle design is awesome, received many compliments!</li>
            <li> My grandmother first bought me Ed Hardy perfume for Christmas a couple of years ago, and I immediately fell in love with it. I currently own, Love &amp; Luck, Hearts &amp; Daggers, and most recently Born Wild. Since, I don&#x27;t like overpowering perfume Ed Hardy&#x27;s Born Wild is perfectly natural and lightly fruit scented. However, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap either, and a few spritzes of this stuff, like all Ed Hardy perfume, will last you all day.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites. I have been using it for quite awhile now. Always get lots of compliments. I am a big fan of the Ed Hardy perfumes all together.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase, not only saving a lot but perfume smells as gorgeous as I thought it would and wow verrry quick delivery. Would definitely order from again, thank you:D</li>
            <li> I just started wearing this perfume the moment I recieved it in the mail and every time I go out, I get people asking me what am I wearing. I love it! The price was worth it and I am very happy I purchased this scent. I will be shopping for this again.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. It came quickly and was a great price.</li>
            <li> Man, I LOVE this perfume!  Smells incredible and I get so many complements wearing this. The bottle is big and lasts forever. This is definitely one of my HG perfumes. I&#x27;ll buy this over and over.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, I recommend it to every girl who wants to feel girly and pretty, love it! It makes a great present</li>
            <li> This scent is my favorite. Some of the others are too young for me, but this one...I get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; at a great value last all day</li>
            <li> after a while it started to smell sweet. i don&#x27;t think it last that long.</li>
            <li> Love the Ed Hardy line!!</li>
            <li> Love it will buy it again</li>
            <li> this is a excellent product for my wife.. low price.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this. Thanks for the great deal. Couldn&#x27;t find it in a store near me so pleased to find it online.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful long lasting scent.with a cant be beat price .you wont be disappointed.the scent i  feminine but sassy.</li>
            <li> I love Ed hardy. Another good perfume to buy as well</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd bottle that I have ordered from the same seller and I am pretty satisfied! It is such a great price and I really love the smell of it. And i want to try another kind of Ed Hardy but I dont think it will smell just as nice as this one. Other than that. I really like it and you cant pass this up!</li>
            <li> Love it. Mahalo Nui Loa</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim, and I&#x27;m not happy or disappointed just left somewhere between. The smell was a little more sweet than I anticipated but maybe other users will like that! Overall it did have a nice smell, but I think it comes down to me liking more earthy smells.</li>
            <li> Love this very different fragrance! However, it doesn&#x27;t last longer than 10 minutes! They keep making it weaker and weaker!! I will now spend my $45 to $65 on something else!</li>
            <li> Great price and wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I am a perfume collector, and have always loved the stuff. I really feel like if you&#x27;re going to wear something, it should make you want to smell your wrist or whatever you apply it quite a bit, this stuff is nice, but doesn&#x27;t make me do a double take. By nature, I am someone who feels like a perfume should make you feel wonderful, smell wonderful, and it should make you gasp with joy. This didn&#x27;t, but I would wear it.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter-in-laws favorite perfume and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Last all day</li>
            <li> She loves the scent and it love it on her. This is the cheapest place I could find it.  It came very quickly and very securely packaged. I would order again when she&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding Born Wild in department stores. When I got an Amazon Gift Card I knew exactly how I was going to use it. I love it! It came sooner than expected and was packaged the same way I would&#x27;ve gotten it from Belk! Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I always get so many compliments when I wear this. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any smell. Only last about 2 minutes and you cant get a refund. I feel like I just threw my Money away.</li>
            <li> Whenever I buy fruity and floral scents I usually don&#x27;t expect them to last very long. However, I was pleasantly surprised with Ed Hardy&#x27;s \\&quot;Born Wild.\\&quot; I thought \\&quot;The way this smells, it&#x27;s probably only going to last about 30 minutes then die down.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the smell is amazing..it has a fruity-berry ish scent to it that makes this scent perfect during the daytime (especially during the spring or summer). It settles in nicely and keeps it scent very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would say it lasts about 2 or 4 hours and afterwards the smell just lingers. I don&#x27;t have to reapply often maybe only once or twice a day depending on where I am going and what I will be doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great everyday scent to add to my collection and I will definitely keep one in stock at ALL times.</li>
