    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works GREAT..  </li>
            <li>Great value for the great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered with  Williams Mug Shaving Soap - 1.75 oz , what the great combination.</li>
            <li>Good size and easy to use</li>
            <li>they work great as well as being very well made.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for me as I use shave cream and don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I got smart and  bought a small porcilin bowl that works perfectly for shaving.</li>
            <li>Nice looking bowl but smaller than anticipated.</li>
            <li>I bought these to use for hot O&#x27;Sake cups...</li>
            <li>Very small great for a travel brush</li>
            <li>The bottom of the bowl is tapered and the shaving soap does not set very well causing the lather to overflow, since the soap sits too close to the rim.</li>
            <li>much rather us the new cup</li>
            <li>Too small to hold soap and not enough room to stir brush in the soap producing a good amount of lather.</li>
            <li>this said I must say that the bowl is very well made and I thus far have not had an issue with using the bowl to fluff regular soap for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Product is not even close to being big enough to be the right size.</li>
            <li>Athens cup is a little small for the soap that I have, it stands about a 1/4 inch above the top.  </li>
            <li>I gave this LITTLE stainless steel bowl to my wife for her nails.</li>

            <li> Just wish it was a little bit deeper and wider.  </li>
            <li> Way too small don&#x27;t buy waste of money</li>

            <li> Works GREAT..  Just wish it was a little bit deeper and wider.  But it does work and for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong !!!</li>
            <li> Very small but I guess you get you pay for.                                         This is an update on the shaving mug. I got smart and  bought a small porcilin bowl that works perfectly for shaving. I gave this LITTLE stainless steel bowl to my wife for her nails.</li>
            <li> Great value for the great product. I&#x27;ve ordered with  Williams Mug Shaving Soap - 1.75 oz , what the great combination.</li>
            <li> THIS is a TINY/CUTE ITEM! I GUESS it&#x27;s INTENDED AS a SHAVING BRUSH DRIP BOWL. I LIKE it.  ijcorona</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for hot O&#x27;Sake cups...they work great as well as being very well made.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for me as I use shave cream and don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> Athens cup is a little small for the soap that I have, it stands about a 1/4 inch above the top.  This is not a big problem for me.  I ordered this because my other cup slipped out of my hand and broke.  I much rather us the new cup so I do not worry about any breakage.</li>
            <li> The item is of very poor quality.  The &amp;#34;stainless&amp;#34; steel was tarnished when I got it.  It looks like it was not plated properly and will eventually rust.  It&#x27;s cheap but I was hoping it would still last.</li>
            <li> Product is not even close to being big enough to be the right size. Too small to hold soap and not enough room to stir brush in the soap producing a good amount of lather. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> to small.  no wonder it is so inexpensive</li>
            <li> Way too small don&#x27;t buy waste of money</li>
            <li> Nice looking bowl but smaller than anticipated. The bottom of the bowl is tapered and the shaving soap does not set very well causing the lather to overflow, since the soap sits too close to the rim.</li>
            <li> As with the other review.  This bowl is small. when viewing the items picture i believe it was a five year&#x27;s hand holding the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;With this said I must say that the bowl is very well made and I thus far have not had an issue with using the bowl to fluff regular soap for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Works for me... Good size and easy to use</li>
            <li> Very small great for a travel brush</li>
            <li> Looks like it will last for a while.</li>
