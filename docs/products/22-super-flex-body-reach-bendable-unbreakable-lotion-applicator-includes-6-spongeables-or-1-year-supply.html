            <li>I straitghened it as best I could and attempted to use it that way.  </li>
            <li>I will try using it again another day, but I am not too impressed with it, and I am concerned that the applicators will not stay on.</li>
            <li>just what I needed and worked very nicely!</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>Happy I stumbled across this item on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good product that could use improvement.  </li>
            <li>the pads seem to be of good quality and are non-absorbent...</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that does exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>When bent for use, the handle seems to be installed almost exactly backwards of the position that would work best.  </li>
            <li>The addition S/H would have been more than the loofa pad itself!</li>
            <li>Having bendable handle was nice,</li>
            <li>Nice reach &amp; flexibility; improves independence</li>
            <li>The Super-Flex applicator is quite handy.  </li>
            <li>The pads attach and detach with Velcro VERY SECURELY and can be washed and re-used.  </li>
            <li>Even happier how many times I can use and re use one pad and not have to replace it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I heated it with a hair dryer and was able to shape it to my liking.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea but the handle is too slippery to hold onto very well</li>
            <li>but still better than others i tried.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>you will love it.</li>
            <li>When the Super-Flex arrived, I was so glad I sprang for the additional expense.</li>
            <li>The 18&amp;#34; is a much more manageable item.</li>

            <li>it just means stopping and wiping your hands free of lotion.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to order the loofa pad shown as an available option</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used three times, but it is very handy.</li>
            <li>After application, the pad rinses off easily without residue and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>If you care morw about her than her degenerate Grand Son and her own daughter which abandoned her, but cringe at rubbing her legs, this is a present for you!!!!</li>
            <li>I swear my husband and I were trying to figure out how we could make something for my 82 year old mother to be able to apply her heat rub gel when no one is around to help her, so, I get on Amazon and look what I find!  </li>
            <li>The pads are just the &#x27;Right&#x27; size!  </li>
            <li>Easy to bend and very comfortable to use for washing and/or applying medicated skin creams to your back.</li>
            <li>great for those who live alone and can no longer reach their back.</li>
            <li>This applicator reached the places I couldn&#x27;t, like right between the shoulder blades.</li>
            <li>With some applicators, you waste a good deal of lotion because it gets absorbed into the sponge.  </li>
            <li>Great for reaching lower and upper back areas.</li>
            <li>You could probably put it under running hot water for a minute.</li>
            <li>By the way, I considered the shorter-length applicator, but I did some testing beforehand and found that the 22&amp;#34; length would likely be better.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to be able to apply Rx cream to my back.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>The pads are very easy to rinse out and dry in minutes.  </li>
            <li>The sponges wash very well, I wash mine by hand, and they are reusable.</li>
            <li>and the curve is way too much.  </li>
            <li>It needs a real fat handle like a rubber ended screw driver</li>
            <li>Not a problem really ...</li>
            <li>I am kind of messy</li>
            <li>I am sure there will be other times I will use it.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it...as we get older, things begin to snap, crackle, and pop.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great product for those who need help reaching difficult areas.</li>
            <li>It will allow you to apply lotions to your back but, there are more affordable models that will get the job done at less cost.</li>
            <li>It wants to spin when putting lotion on your back.</li>
            <li>WOW it was on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It really only bends just so much.  </li>
            <li>That was tricky as the first time the icy-hot fell off, the second time I rubbed it in a bit and then applied it to my sore back.</li>
            <li>I really love this because I can get to the EXACT spot that&#x27;s making me crazy...</li>
            <li>22&amp;#34; is just slightly not long enough for anyone over 5&#x27; 7&amp;#34; or so.  </li>

            <li> Recommend not buying additional pads until one establishes the average pad lifespan based on their individual use patterns.</li>

            <li> so I can hold the wand without it slipping.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not impressed. Awkward to use. Pads surface will start to roll and peels off.</li>
            <li> Having bendable handle was nice,</li>
            <li> Great Product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This wand allows me to apply lotions, creams, oils and medication to areas on my back and lower shoulders that I could otherwise not reach. After application, the pad rinses off easily without residue and dries quickly. Happy I stumbled across this item on Amazon. Even happier how many times I can use and re use one pad and not have to replace it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised but a  bit overpriced. Seems frail.</li>
            <li> Have only used for several days but I&#x27;m satisfied. Some complaints were &amp;#34;difficult to bend&amp;#34;. I heated it with a hair dryer and was able to shape it to my liking. You could probably put it under running hot water for a minute.</li>
            <li> Good product that could use improvement.  Small handle is a pain, as noted elsewhere.  When bent for use, the handle seems to be installed almost exactly backwards of the position that would work best.  22&amp;#34; is just slightly not long enough for anyone over 5&#x27; 7&amp;#34; or so.  Anyone in 5&#x27; 7&amp;#34; to 6&#x27; 1&amp;#34; range would probably be happier with a 25&amp;#34; length.  If rinsed after each use, the pads last a very long time.  Recommend not buying additional pads until one establishes the average pad lifespan based on their individual use patterns.</li>
            <li> just what I needed and worked very nicely!</li>
            <li> THE HANDLE IS SLIPPERY WHEN WET</li>
            <li> This product allows me to wash and lotion and oil my entire body! Even under my feet! If I get oil on my hands I just wipe them off so I can hold the wand without it slipping.  The sponges wash very well, I wash mine by hand, and they are reusable.</li>
            <li> Great product for those who need help reaching difficult areas.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea but the handle is too slippery to hold onto very well and the curve is way too much.  If the handle had a grip and was a little straighter, it would be perfect.  I still use it every other day to apply oil to my back to keep it from getting dry.</li>
            <li> Nice reach &amp; flexibility; improves independence</li>
            <li> I like this product the 22&amp;#34; wand was flexible and long enough to reach those hard to get to spots with out much effort.  I&#x27;m a 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; frame and this size wand was chosen solely  to apply lotion to my back area, I don&#x27;t the smaller sized wand would have meet my expectations. I agree with the other reviewers abt the need for a non-slip handle...the pads seem to be of good quality and are non-absorbent... I suspect that they&#x27;ll last for quite a while</li>
            <li> great for those who live alone and can no longer reach their back. this is my second one. redesigning the base where the sponge goes to a larger area would improve this product greatly. but still better than others i tried.</li>
            <li> My applicator arrived bent in the opposite direction to which it should go, and I was not able to get it to stay bent the way that it needed to go.  I straitghened it as best I could and attempted to use it that way.  When I touched the pad to my back, it immediately fell off.  I then bent the applicator the correct way and put the velcro band back around it to keep it in that position.  I will try using it again another day, but I am not too impressed with it, and I am concerned that the applicators will not stay on.</li>
            <li> Got this for my elderly father.  He says it works well and he can scrub his back or put lotion on his dry skin with ease.</li>
            <li> For what I used it for it okay.  I would have given it four stars but the only drawback is when you unbend the handle it curves to one side and you cannot straighten it out all the way.</li>
            <li> I swear my husband and I were trying to figure out how we could make something for my 82 year old mother to be able to apply her heat rub gel when no one is around to help her, so, I get on Amazon and look what I find!  Mom loves it!</li>
            <li> Handle grip doesn&#x27;t stay on well. It slides back off the handle. I wouldn&#x27;t by it again</li>
            <li> I have a difficulty grasping the handle. It keeps twisting in my hand making it very difficult to use! It needs a real fat handle like a rubber ended screw driver</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time controlling it.  It wants to spin when putting lotion on your back.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it...as we get older, things begin to snap, crackle, and pop. I have a herniated disc in my neck, and as anyone with neck issues knows, the pain is not happy to be stuck in just one spot....it loves to travel! This applicator reached the places I couldn&#x27;t, like right between the shoulder blades. I really love this because I can get to the EXACT spot that&#x27;s making me crazy...I&#x27;m not acting like a &amp;#34;back-seat&amp;#34; driver; &amp;#34;No, over to the left...now down, no, that&#x27;s too far....&amp;#34;.  Get this applicator...you will love it.</li>
            <li> The Super-Flex applicator is quite handy.  Because of the curve in the handle, you can reach those spots on your back that were hard to get at with a straight-handled applicator.  The sponges work well, too -- since they don&#x27;t absorb the lotion.  With some applicators, you waste a good deal of lotion because it gets absorbed into the sponge.  The only design improvement I would suggest is to fabricate the blue hand-grip area out of a non-slip rubber or silicone ... I find that if I have any lotion on my hand, the applicator flips around, and the bend is going AWAY from my body rather than TOWARD it.  Not a problem really ... it just means stopping and wiping your hands free of lotion.  By the way, I considered the shorter-length applicator, but I did some testing beforehand and found that the 22&amp;#34; length would likely be better. When the Super-Flex arrived, I was so glad I sprang for the additional expense. There&#x27;s no strain or struggle -- and that&#x27;s what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to be able to apply Rx cream to my back. I wanted to order the loofa pad shown as an available option but, the loofa pad was NOT eligible for Amazon Prime. The addition S/H would have been more than the loofa pad itself! This model also uses disposable pads which requires the purchase of pad refills. It will allow you to apply lotions to your back but, there are more affordable models that will get the job done at less cost.</li>
            <li> works as stated. wish I had it years ago</li>
            <li> Im a buyer if it means no old lady leg rubbing. Buy this for your diabetic GrandMother (In-Law.) If you care morw about her than her degenerate Grand Son and her own daughter which abandoned her, but cringe at rubbing her legs, this is a present for you!!!!</li>
            <li> I have looked in every pharmacy for something like this.  WOW it was on Amazon.  I am disabled with shoulder and neck problems and I cannot put lotion on my dry skin back.  I saw this and it WORKS !!!!  The pads are very easy to rinse out and dry in minutes.  You may need to wipe off the handle after use.....I am kind of messy so of course it goes onto the handle.  If you had a problem getting lotion on your back....this is for you.</li>
            <li> Very useful for hard to reach places  like the center of your back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used three times, but it is very handy. Twice I used rubbing alcohol on the pad and wiped it the itchy rash on my back and then hand washed the pad and let it air dry for reuse. The third time I used it to put icy-hot on my sore back. That was tricky as the first time the icy-hot fell off, the second time I rubbed it in a bit and then applied it to my sore back. Again I hand washed the pad and let i air dry for reuse. I am sure there will be other times I will use it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that does exactly what I needed!  It consists of a bendable wand with Velcro&#x27;d pads that help spread lotions or medical creams on hard to reach places.  The pads attach and detach with Velcro VERY SECURELY and can be washed and re-used.  The pads are just the &#x27;Right&#x27; size!  The wand is so flexible that it can reach all the places on your back with precision.  Problem of applying lotions, medicines SOLVED!!  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The 22&amp;#34; model is very difficult to manage for use on your back.  It really only bends just so much.  The 18&amp;#34; model is much more effective for applying lotion or body wash to your back, even if you&#x27;re fairly tall (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10.5&amp;#34;).  The 18&amp;#34; is a much more manageable item.</li>
            <li> A bit cumbersome but workable. Not used to working backwards with a mirror. It does the job.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Easy to bend and very comfortable to use for washing and/or applying medicated skin creams to your back. I&#x27;ve been using the shorter version for years but now that I&#x27;m not quite as flexable as I use to be, the 22&amp;#34; Super-Flex Body-Reach does the trick.</li>
            <li> Great for reaching lower and upper back areas.</li>
    </ol>
