            <li>The smell is great, it&#x27;s so light and feminine.  </li>
            <li>Smells great- lasts all day and the bottle is so much bigger than you can get in the stores for a great price!!</li>
            <li>Very nice light spring smell.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.my sister love it when I give it to her as a gift.</li>
            <li>The bottle idea is good but the production can be improved so it would not look like a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>Vera Wang Love Struck</li>
            <li>Floral Rush is a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>But my two favorite perfumes are Chanel &amp;#34;Chance&amp;#34; and my Dolce&amp;G &amp;#34;Light Blue&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Floral Rush is my number three favorite</li>
            <li>What I like to do is spray my vanilla perfume mostly, then do like one spritz of the floral rush</li>
            <li>It is such a great perfume!</li>
            <li>other best advice:  </li>
            <li>The bottle is very artistic too.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love, love,love Floral Rush and how well Floral Rush goes fabulously and fantastic with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>I love the original Lovestruck fragrance; it&#x27;s so light and feminine.  </li>
            <li>Everything was fine .shipping</li>
            <li>I love it very much!</li>
            <li>Nice fragance not overpowering, The bottle is very artistic altough somewhat big , my wife loved it very much  .</li>
            <li>Buy the orange colored Marc Jacobs Daisy fresh instead!  </li>
            <li>I decided to order it, and it got here when it said it would and quickly.</li>
            <li>VERY strong at first but dies down after a bit.. lovely fragrance, more for spring though</li>
            <li>The plastic flowers may need to be toned down and color of the bottle maybe can be more elegant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very intense.</li>
            <li>first sprays what you get.</li>
            <li>For some reason, though, when you spray it out of the big bottle it smells waaaaay more floral.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>very fast.good place</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, then it&#x27;s a little more balanced out.</li>
            <li>The floral elements are not light - more orchid or chrysanthemum tones.  </li>
            <li>I got a small sample of this perfume a while back and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to spray very much and the scent lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s got less stay power than lovestruck the original.</li>
            <li>I originally found this perfume at Bergner&#x27;s a few years ago and decided to pick it up for my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>Watered down version of the real thing.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Watered down version of the real thing.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not the same, and does not nearly last as long as others I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> Does last long thats why i gave it a star.</li>
            <li> a floral blend of champagne, pink pepper, pink passion flower, marigold, white freesia, cashmere woods, sheer mush, and white amber.</li>
            <li> No other scents to splice it maybe a little musk sandlewood something no begining middle end.</li>
            <li> I have never sampled the original &amp;#34;Lovestruck&amp;#34; and have never liked heavy floral perfumes.</li>
            <li> Arrived sealed just as expected with 2 day shipping.  </li>
            <li> (note:  get the orange spray and not the pink spray!)</li>
            <li> The sad thing is that I purchased two bottles at the same time.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just thrown off because I usually get spicy, creamy perfumes.</li>
            <li> I had visions of a floral version in this fragrance, but was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed and can&#x27;t return item.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Terrible experience.</li>
            <li> So I am doubly disappointed !!</li>

            <li> VERY strong at first but dies down after a bit.. lovely fragrance, more for spring though</li>
            <li> Ordered the 3.4oz &amp; received the 1.7oz. All I got in return was a $10 credit. Terrible experience. Honeywell Fragrences made out like bandits.</li>
            <li> Hmmmm... Smells so good .  Arrived sealed just as expected with 2 day shipping.  Perfect transaction.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, it&#x27;s so light and feminine.  I love it very much! The bottle is very artistic too.</li>
            <li> Very nice light spring smell.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  Smells good and I get compliments everytime I wear it.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine .shipping very fast.good place</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad spicy, but not as spicy as people suggest. I like it, it&#x27;s got less stay power than lovestruck the original.</li>
            <li> Vera Wang Love Struck Floral Rush is a lovely scent.  You don&#x27;t have to spray very much and the scent lasts a long time.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I originally found this perfume at Bergner&#x27;s a few years ago and decided to pick it up for my girlfriend.  After she used it all, we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Well we finally found it here and it smells just like the one I got at the store.  Very happy with the purchase.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice fragance not overpowering, The bottle is very artistic altough somewhat big , my wife loved it very much  .</li>
            <li> smell like nothing but a flower! No other scents to splice it maybe a little musk sandlewood something no begining middle end. first sprays what you get. Does last long thats why i gave it a star.</li>
            <li> I love the original Lovestruck fragrance; it&#x27;s so light and feminine.  I had visions of a floral version in this fragrance, but was so disappointed.  The floral elements are not light - more orchid or chrysanthemum tones.  I&#x27;ll probably use this bottle because it&#x27;s open, but may give it to one of my nieces...&lt;br /&gt;My advice:  try this at Sephora before you buy a big bottle like I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other best advice:  Buy the orange colored Marc Jacobs Daisy fresh instead!  It&#x27;s delightful and summer-y!  (note:  get the orange spray and not the pink spray!)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love, love,love Floral Rush and how well Floral Rush goes fabulously and fantastic with my body chemistry.  I have never sampled the original &amp;#34;Lovestruck&amp;#34; and have never liked heavy floral perfumes. But my two favorite perfumes are Chanel &amp;#34;Chance&amp;#34; and my Dolce&amp;G &amp;#34;Light Blue&amp;#34;.  Floral Rush is my number three favorite and I receive complements everytime I wear it!! P.S. FLORAL FEATURES:  a floral blend of champagne, pink pepper, pink passion flower, marigold, white freesia, cashmere woods, sheer mush, and white amber.</li>
            <li> Watered down version of the real thing.  Very disappointed and can&#x27;t return item.</li>
            <li> Product came as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  I have been wearing Vera Wang Floral Rush for a couple years now and LOVE it !  That being said, I have to wonder if what I just ordered was some sort of knock off perfume.  The scent is not the same, and does not nearly last as long as others I have purchased.  The sad thing is that I purchased two bottles at the same time. So I am doubly disappointed !!</li>
            <li> Nice scent.my sister love it when I give it to her as a gift. The bottle idea is good but the production can be improved so it would not look like a cheap perfume. The plastic flowers may need to be toned down and color of the bottle maybe can be more elegant.</li>
            <li> I got a small sample of this perfume a while back and absolutely loved it. I decided to order it, and it got here when it said it would and quickly. For some reason, though, when you spray it out of the big bottle it smells waaaaay more floral. It&#x27;s very very intense. Maybe I was just thrown off because I usually get spicy, creamy perfumes. I love the floral, but it almost has a weird smell that comes along with it, like rubbing alcohol. What I like to do is spray my vanilla perfume mostly, then do like one spritz of the floral rush, then it&#x27;s a little more balanced out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for my mother.  She was very pleased with this.  She likes floral scents and this was perfect.</li>
            <li> It is such a great perfume! Smells great- lasts all day and the bottle is so much bigger than you can get in the stores for a great price!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful presentation and fantastic fragrance</li>
