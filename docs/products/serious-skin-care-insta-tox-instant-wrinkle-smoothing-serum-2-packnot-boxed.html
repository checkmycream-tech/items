    <ol>
            <li>Very happy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a good band aid!  </li>
            <li>Works great for the wrinkles on my forehead and for under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>So in my opinion this works great for the parts of your face that dont move alot like your forehead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is great</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>It works good in the beginning</li>
            <li>The Good: in 2 minutes you can erase years off your face.  </li>
            <li>The smoothing effect is excellent and your skin will stay smooth until you rinse it off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankly, I will buy it again, because it does a good job of tightening the pores and it does give&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for special events.     </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>The positive comments are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Instatox for many years.  </li>
            <li>It has no perfume which is another thing I love about this.</li>
            <li>I love A-Tox cream.  </li>
            <li>It works so well that people say I look more rested.  </li>
            <li>It cheaper and safer then a face lift, thats for sure.</li>
            <li>AND THEIR PRICE WAS BETTER THAN HSN....</li>
            <li>Love that it makes the puffiness go away</li>
            <li>I have used this Insta-tox for more years than I can remember.&lt;br</li>
            <li>personally find it the best for me even though it does not cover wrinkles around the mouth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff,  </li>
            <li>For 20 somethings with really really fine lines it may be helpful, but expect nothing if lines are more noticeable.</li>
            <li>It was delivered promptly and packaged securely since ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li>WHEN APPLIED,  MY FACE (CROWSFEET &amp; AROUND MOUTH) LOOK SO SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>Shook it and dabbed it on lightly.</li>
            <li>THANKS !!!</li>
            <li>THIS SITE DELIVERED SO QUICKLY</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how I first came across it!</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Price not as good as I expected</li>
            <li>SO WELL WORTH THE MONEY.  </li>
            <li>I will say that when I smile my wrinkles do show on my face.</li>
            <li>Just work with this product till you figure out the right amount to use.  </li>
            <li>But after trying this from HSN on a whim I instantly looked younger and felt more confident.</li>
            <li>I put it on first thing and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of make up so not being able to use foundation wasn&#x27;t a issue.</li>
            <li>However you can use Bare Essentials or powder makeup and then lightly spray a &#x27;mist&#x27; over your whole face with some kind of moisturing spray, like one contain Hylacloric Acid or Rose Water and then gently pull back your skin, stand in front of a fan and when dry</li>
            <li>It does take some time to get use to how much you will need.</li>
            <li>It really works to hide the bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>If you do put on too much it will cake.  </li>
            <li>AND IT ABSOLUTELY WORKS.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>When you use it, less is more.  </li>
            <li>NORMALLY BUY FROM HSN</li>
            <li>Prep-H does almost the same for less and it&#x27;s more convenient to purchase.</li>
            <li>It does leave a white  residue if you use too much.</li>
            <li>Just started using a week ago and so far I have seen an improvement with the lines between my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Then gentle pull the area back</li>
            <li>I used this product when it first came out, but I strayed when other product came out,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After lossing weight the bags under my eyes as well as the dark circles made me look 10 years older!</li>
            <li>Let dry completely before applying makeup.</li>

            <li> This product goes on chalky and gives your skin a stiff feeling, but really shows no noticeable difference in the appearance of lines.</li>

            <li> I want to tell you I usually spend over 30 dollars through HSN and almost wet myself when I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Is a little drying to the face though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will order again, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>

            <li> and it is my little secret</li>
            <li> I do not want ever to be without it, so I always have at least two stashed away.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works good in the beginning but, it only last one hour.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I would like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Instatox for many years.  It does help decrease the wrinkles when it is applied. Use it sparingly. It does leave a white  residue if you use too much. It was delivered promptly and packaged securely since ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using instaA-tox for over a year now. After lossing weight the bags under my eyes as well as the dark circles made me look 10 years older! But after trying this from HSN on a whim I instantly looked younger and felt more confident. I never not use it..it&#x27;s amazing! I put it on first thing and it lasts all day. I&#x27;m not a big fan of make up so not being able to use foundation wasn&#x27;t a issue. It does take some time to get use to how much you will need. By day 3 I had it down to a science. It has no perfume which is another thing I love about this. My friends were blown away when they saw the difference. I had to bring the tube in because a co-worker was convinced I had botox injections! I went in with no cream on...walked into the bathroom with her and 10 minutes later she was on her computer ordering from HSN. I want to tell you I usually spend over 30 dollars through HSN and almost wet myself when I found it on amazon. I would... and have recomend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love A-Tox cream.  It really works to hide the bags under my eyes.  It works so well that people say I look more rested.  The positive comments are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will order again, not worth the price. Prep-H does almost the same for less and it&#x27;s more convenient to purchase.</li>
            <li> Just started using a week ago and so far I have seen an improvement with the lines between my eyes.  I am 33 and have noticed them forming.  Didn&#x27;t want to get botox.  This has helped.  I look forward to seeing the results as I use it daily and get used to putting it on.  It was worth the money.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> This product does plump up your skin to make wrinkles less visible, however, this product like Freeze and Sudden Change leaves a dry, white residue. Also, moisturizer does not work with this product nor does any make-up that has oil in it.</li>
            <li> Product is excelllent.  Did not understand the size thought it was larger.\&lt;br /&gt;Excellent Product.  Price not as good as I expected will check size closer next time&lt;br /&gt;Good service from seller.</li>
            <li> The Good: in 2 minutes you can erase years off your face.  Apply a &#x27;thin&#x27; layer on a clean, dry face. Then gentle pull the area back (stand infront of a fan) and let the solution dry. Then viola no more sag or wrinkles around the gowl, cheeks, or eyes.      The bad:  You cannot put moisturizer under or over the area you applied this product.  You cannot use oil based foundation.  However you can use Bare Essentials or powder makeup and then lightly spray a &#x27;mist&#x27; over your whole face with some kind of moisturing spray, like one contain Hylacloric Acid or Rose Water and then gently pull back your skin, stand in front of a fan and when dry, you are all set to go out and get tons of complements.    I have been using this for years and it is my little secret my friends are still trying to figure out.  Maybe someday I will tell them.      Just work with this product till you figure out the right amount to use.  If you do put on too much it will cake.  Well then wipe it off and reduce the amount.  it will keep the wrinkles away for the evening..even up close.  No one will know.    It cheaper and safer then a face lift, thats for sure.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0015N6DBQ Serious Skin Care InstA-tox Instant Wrinkle Smoothing Serum (2 Pack) NOT BOXED]] This product goes on chalky and gives your skin a stiff feeling, but really shows no noticeable difference in the appearance of lines. For 20 somethings with really really fine lines it may be helpful, but expect nothing if lines are more noticeable. Waste of money</li>
            <li> smoothes away crows feet wrinkles. apply sparingly otherwise it will leave a white residue. Let dry completely before applying makeup. Love this!</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED INSTA-TOX FOR 4 YEARS AND IT ABSOLUTELY WORKS.  I AM 62 AND WHEN APPLIED,  MY FACE (CROWSFEET &amp; AROUND MOUTH) LOOK SO SMOOTH.  JUST USE A LITTLE AND RUB IT UPWARD IN TINY STROKES WHILE IT DRIES.  IT STAYS ON TILL YOU WASH IT OFF.  NORMALLY BUY FROM HSN AND THEY SOLD OUT....SO I FOUND IT ON THIS WEBSITE !!!!  YEAH !!&lt;br /&gt;ONE TUBE LASTS ME OVER A MONTH SO WELL WORTH THE MONEY.  THIS SITE DELIVERED SO QUICKLY AND THEIR PRICE WAS BETTER THAN HSN....THANKS !!!</li>
            <li> Just got my tube of insta tox. Shook it and dabbed it on lightly. Works great for the wrinkles on my forehead and for under eye puffiness. Is a little drying to the face though so I used a bit of moisurizer along with it. I will say that when I smile my wrinkles do show on my face. So in my opinion this works great for the parts of your face that dont move alot like your forehead. Love that it makes the puffiness go away but it didnt work for the crows eye wrinkles.Will keep experimenting with it and if I find solutions to the face wrinkling I will let you know!!</li>
            <li> You will get temporary Bo-Tox result with this. The smoothing effect is excellent and your skin will stay smooth until you rinse it off. This is wonderful for special events.     I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> Its&#x27;s not the cure but it&#x27;s a good band aid!  I highly recommend it!  Buy one and give one to a friend....that&#x27;s how I first came across it!</li>
            <li> I have used this Insta-tox for more years than I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;It is great and I would tell anyone...go for it..</li>
            <li> I used this product when it first came out, but I strayed when other product came out,&lt;br /&gt;I personally find it the best for me even though it does not cover wrinkles around the mouth!&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I will buy it again, because it does a good job of tightening the pores and it does give&lt;br /&gt;me a younger look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  MBS</li>
            <li> I have been using Instatox for about 7 years.  I do not want ever to be without it, so I always have at least two stashed away.  Instatox is a miracle product that takes away puffs and dark circles under eyes.  It takes at least 10 years off my face.  When you use it, less is more.  Do not put it over makeup and do not put makeup over it--you won&#x27;t need to.  Only works under eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,  it works my heck it works.  It is not one of those products that &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; works, it does trust me.</li>
