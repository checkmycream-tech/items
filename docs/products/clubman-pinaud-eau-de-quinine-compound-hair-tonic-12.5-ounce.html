            <li>/&gt;It feels pleasant on the scalp, and it does not have a noticeable menthol cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li>The price is very good too, although I do then to use more of the product than with Vitalis.</li>
            <li>This is a good hair tonic.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job just to even it out if my hair gets too greasy or shiny.</li>

            <li>It smells really good, too.</li>
            <li>Makes you head smell good all day.</li>
            <li>Really good deal for the $$$&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>it keeps those two jewels smelling good good.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the scalp, but smells like cough syrup.</li>
            <li>and it got mostly good reviews.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pleasant and light.</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion and light, graying hair.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma of this hair tonic, which is great to use when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is OK!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love this at triple the price, so this is a steal!  </li>
            <li>Pleasant scented hair tonic makes hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Very good product and worth the price</li>
            <li>Another nice product from Clubman Pinaud.</li>
            <li>No hold, no moisturizing component of any kind, nothing.</li>
            <li>Nice to find something with a nice scent, and a change of pace from today&#x27;s hair products.</li>
            <li>outstanding service great product and love the easyness of use and smell</li>
            <li>A nice touch when you want to feel &amp;#34;well dressed&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Just used makes your hair look nice , smells really good will be buying more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>and it is one of those products that is a pleasure to wear because it elicits compliments wherever you go... as others have stated there is something about the aroma that gives you a feeling that you are an old-world gentleman that knows how to look his best and really takes care of himself</li>
            <li>I really liked the way this product smells.</li>
            <li>It also soothed quite effectively when splashed on as an aftershave, so bonus points for a product that does double-duty, and prevents dueling fragrances.</li>
            <li>but then it does a good job and the oder is really refreshing.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li>The smell of this tonic is spicy rose, grapefruit-ish.</li>
            <li>The medicinal smell is nice, but not overpowering once the tonic is worked into the hair.</li>
            <li>and it has nice aroma.  </li>
            <li>The great news is that my grandfather died with a full head of hair while dad and I are almost bald.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has a very strong scent to it.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the smell and the price was really good though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite a replacement, but it is a suitable substitute for now.</li>
            <li>Good luck and enjoy it, while it is still around.</li>
            <li>Just a nice refreshing smell which is not overpowering</li>
            <li>Probably best for older clients or people who like strong scents.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, mild scent.  </li>
            <li>I hear this is going to be good during the winter months, but for now I&#x27;m gonna stick with my Groom N Clean.</li>
            <li>The result is that my very fine hair stays in place a noticeably better than if I didn&#x27;t use a tonic.</li>
            <li>Very light manly fragrance that won&#x27;t embarrass you at the gym.</li>
            <li>If this was good enough for great great grandpa, it certainly works for me!  </li>
            <li>In fact, I like it even better than the Eau de Portugal.  </li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t my favorite sent.</li>
            <li>I love these retro Pinaud products.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>the bottle is top shelf class, too.</li>
            <li>Design Intent here was not to make your hair look better....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an initially bizarre scent, but I would have to say I liked it.</li>
            <li>Like most Clubman products, it&#x27;s refreshing wherever it lands.</li>
            <li>Great product that works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li>Need I say More.</li>
            <li>The Woman Love it.</li>
            <li>Love you longgggggggg Time</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way too potent.</li>
            <li>Plus you can&#x27;t find it in most stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok does its job.</li>
            <li>At 59 I just started with these products in an effort to improve appearance mostly during the just cut and need a cut phases (better control needed).</li>
            <li>Vitalis seems to have a bit more control (and unnatural effect) too and it costs more.</li>
            <li>Save a ton of water in the winter, because washing in a basin is suddenly more feasible.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, even received comments on it during a night out.</li>
            <li>Someone else may love it.</li>
            <li>I love most of my clubman products.</li>
            <li>If I were Herbert West, the Reanimator, I would take a greater interest.  </li>
            <li>reminds me of the years as a child in the town barber shop, my three boys love it also after their hair cuts</li>
            <li>Outstanding feel and scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>want to note that I use the Pinaud powder and LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>If I did not know better, I would use a dash of this in my cocktails.</li>
            <li>My son uses this more than I do.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and makes my hair look almost movie star quality.</li>
            <li>Many people ask what this smells like, my wife immediately said it smelled like baby powder (What?).  </li>
            <li>that is great, but what really hooked me on this tonic was the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Bought this because I like a refreshing scalp tonic</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be touching your hair a lot - because every bug within a 5 mile radius will be visiting Club Eau de Quinine...</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite hair tonic of the Clubman line.</li>
            <li>Love it to finish off a shower.  </li>
            <li>There are better Clubman products for me to choose.</li>
            <li>Interesting scent.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job controlling dandruff as well as giving it a great smell and a little hold.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for from a great old time product?</li>
            <li>I love the bottle, they are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it helps keep my hair strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Another plus is that it&#x27;s easy to comb through, no matter how many times a day you need to comb your hair.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it made my hair feel and look fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Very classy and smells great.</li>
            <li>Brought back many good memories!</li>
            <li>very much smooth mellow classic scent add some to your shampoo Great Results</li>
            <li>Old fashioned hair tonic with a great smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and feels great on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Another one of my sons favorite products, and he and his lady friend both enjoy the scent and the results.</li>
            <li>This product does work great for making your hair soft but not for styling.  </li>
            <li>Wow this stuff is great, it makes my hair feel clean and invigorates my scalp and love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I took one star off because I didn&#x27;t notice any benefits from the tonic, other than my hair smelling awesome.</li>
            <li>Awesome smell and leaves my hair feeling a little bit more silky.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong barbershop smell, but it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, but not the kind of sweet that turns your stomach.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for knocking off old dandruff and keeping your scalp healthy.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift to my husband (who has short hair) and I think the best review of it is he wants more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using similar products since I was a child in Europe (most have been much more sophisticated and effective....</li>
            <li>The color disappears once used and keeps your hair in place just fine.</li>
            <li>It did that fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with the scent.</li>
            <li>But after putting it on and waiting about half an hour, the smell had faded a bit, and what remained was just marvelous.</li>
            <li>The scent fades to a pleasant masculine, indescribable aroma that lingers.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, I can only describe it as a smokey cherry vanilla scent that isn&#x27;t too strong but stays for hours.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the results I got with this, even if the smell is a bit overbearing.  </li>
            <li>I am a fan of Pinaud products, but I didn&#x27;t enjoy my experience with hair tonic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much to keep hair in place, but it also isn&#x27;t greasy and will give your coif a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it was barbershopish with a syrupy and light smoky tone to it.</li>
            <li>I use and enjoy both.</li>
            <li>Really fantastic stuff; will keep buying again and again.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of cheap tiki bar cocktails.</li>
            <li>It has a light control.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff and Clubman products are amazing.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for non-greasy hair control.</li>
            <li>It will work great on darker hair colors, If you are blonde, you will want to use de portugal.</li>
            <li>It is lightly scented and won&#x27;t clash with any fragrances you decide to wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell that goes away fast, but after using this product for 2 weeks, i feel absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I saw</li>
            <li>Its well worth the five stars I gave it!</li>
            <li>First off, this stuff is potent smelling.  </li>
            <li>Its dirt cheap too, so to be flake free was worth the light risk.</li>
            <li>despite the flyaway, ungroomed hair///it would be worth it for the smell!</li>
            <li>All in all, another fine and worthy produce by Pinaud.</li>
            <li>The biggest issue I have is that first you have to love the smell because it will haunt you all day.  </li>
            <li>I think it has a somewhat flowery smell, but in a unique kinda flower way.  </li>
            <li>Feels clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves your scalp clean and tingly.</li>
            <li>It has a really pleasant scent similar to Choward&#x27;s Violet mints and gum (remember those?).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a very strong and distinct scent, if you aren&#x27;t already familiar with this product be warned that you may very well not take to</li>
            <li>Usage tip: get a spray bottle; you can find them at most large chain stores &amp; dollar stores.</li>
            <li>I want it to look natural with better control, carry a nice light scent, feel good to my hands/scalp and improve the color tone a little too.</li>
            <li>It has minimal hold, but makes my hair look really great</li>
            <li>Great for a retro wet look.</li>
            <li>and you will get better styling then water alone, but it will not impart much hold.</li>
            <li>full moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks clubman for making an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>It also made me realize how much I touch the top of my head throughout the day since it would make my hand smell like it too.</li>
            <li>Nice old guy smell</li>
            <li>Smell is too pungent and sweet for me.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li>I encourage every man who wants to add a touch of class to his wardrobe to pick up a bottle of this hair tonic, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Even better really, looks almost like a dream</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered this item, but I have used many other Pinaud Products and I am glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li>I bought this bottle more than a month ago, and I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>The brand is usually good stuff with minor issues.</li>
            <li>Great product if your looking for that classic smooth thick hair you notice a difference right away specially the scent wife loves it the first time she noticed liked it</li>
            <li>This product seems to make them a bit more gingery in the New Orleans sunlight.</li>
            <li>Was interested in that old-time barbershop smell and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Too fine, too curly, just never could stand up to the modern routine.</li>
            <li>Incredibly fantastic smell, hard to describe, makes your hair look great, not greasy at all, nothing else on the market like this, at all.  </li>
            <li>just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Kind of strange smell.....too sweet</li>
            <li>When I use it, it gives my hair a healthy sheen, and makes it incredibly soft...</li>
            <li>On the other hand if you love to splash on the Old Spice like a porpoise at Sea World this just might be the best thing since sliced white bread.</li>
            <li>Per usual Amazons service was quick and great.</li>
            <li>I spilled some on the counter top, and it left a stain on the towel I used to clean it up.</li>
            <li>But my first problem is that intense red food coloring just cannot be a good idea in a cosmetic product.  </li>
            <li>need to establish one thing right off the bat:  </li>
            <li>I use it before going to bed, not before going to work, even though it smells right at any time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply the EdQ right out of the shower, I like the smell</li>
            <li>The price and shipping if this product is right on.</li>
            <li>Lasts the right amount of time.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it feels nice after a shower or after I&#x27;ve been outside and my head is hot and itchy.  </li>
            <li>At least this ingredient (quinine), has worked beautifully in my case and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got a great smell, manily, not boy bandish.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t impart any of its color to my hair, thankfully, but it will readily do so to your counter-top, towel, that nice white undershirt you just put on...</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get a more gentle smell with a little more effect on how it made my hair look.</li>
            <li>The first time I opened the bottle</li>
            <li>This has a funny scent, I can&#x27;t describe it, and don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>At first shot, I&#x27;d have to say the scent took me off guard.</li>
            <li>One of my first memories was my Sicilian grandfather who always used this stuff.  </li>
            <li>What exactly am i suppose to feel with this product because my head just feels moist for one minute and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I tried it on a Saturday with a lot more since the first attempt didn&#x27;t make my hair look different.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the old time barber shop scent.  </li>
            <li>If you massage an oil-based product in first, this will help distribute it evenly.  </li>
            <li>Nice cent, I&#x27;d try a splash of water probably not much difference.</li>
            <li>If what you want is something to make your hair look natural, but lightly stay in place, this is the stuff.</li>
            <li>in all it&#x27;s pretty darn great to say the least.</li>
            <li>The smell is delightful, sort of like raspberries and cognac, and it lingers faintly throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I got a bottle of this, even after having read that the Portugal is a better choice for lighter hair colors (I&#x27;m blonde).</li>
            <li>Cherries is what you&#x27;ll think at first.</li>
            <li>A scent you could put on your hair after first washing it.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I was a bit baffled by the looks but decided to give it a try</li>
            <li>will buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good get the green heirs hair tonic that&#x27;s the one.</li>
            <li>Ok here is another product for those who have some, if you like a real smell that is pleasant, nostalgic and distinct</li>
            <li>That being said, the fragrance on this is considerably less assertive, in that &#x27;flies-falling-from-the-air-within-a-three-foot-radius&#x27; (right after applying) kind of way than Clubman.</li>
            <li>Basically this is an unique old school product.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things and finally this one works plus it does give your hair some control but not too much.</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old and love the old school smells in hair and shaving products.  </li>
            <li>product has a mild herbal scent - while some reviews mention a cherry odor, I haven&#x27;t been able to pin the scent down.  </li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of all of Pinaud Clubman products, and bought this for the first time last week.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a musky fruit punch, it makes my hair feel soft and it has a mild hold to it.</li>
            <li>At points it was strong enough to make my eyes water.</li>
            <li>Really wanted to love this product but the fragrance is too strong, long lasting and medicine like for me.  </li>
            <li>I am on the lookout for reliable old school products because some stick around for ages because they got the formula right in the first place.  </li>
            <li>It was a little strange at first; it hit me like a chemical kind of smell when I splashed it on, but then it dissipated very quickly.</li>
            <li>In a four words: Subtle, but damn effective!</li>
            <li>overall a fine and affordable product</li>
            <li>* Apply on very clean, dry hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, it goes beyond an old-lady smell to something a little more exotic and inhuman, like embalming fluid.  </li>
            <li>like a real barber shop.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely different and for that reason I do enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Light hold, but gives a low product look.</li>
            <li>Well that made the smell unbearable and still didn&#x27;t seem to do much for the hair.</li>
            <li>This has an unusual scent but really does keep the hair manageable without a trace of stickiness or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I think it smells very cologne like.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s intense scent.</li>
            <li>Real musky scent, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>However, this is way too much.  </li>
            <li>I still use it daily and enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair tonic.</li>
            <li>It makes the fade stand up straight so you can blend the comb-over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>than the scent, it works very well.</li>
            <li>( something all real gentlemen should strive to do ).  </li>
            <li>Whatever soap you use is probably imparting as much fragrance.</li>
            <li>My wife asked if we really had to keep the bottle on the dresser</li>
            <li>soon began to really like it</li>
            <li>Very flowery, perfume-y type aroma.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have much hold</li>
            <li>hair is light brown with a tendency towards red highlights from my grandmother&#x27;s side.</li>
            <li>Both very manly barbershop smells.  </li>
            <li>have used it several days in a row and during my morning shower and noticed my hair is silky smooth; more so than I have noticed with any other product including conditioners.  </li>
            <li>this stuff smells sharp and feels even better.</li>
            <li>Step right in to the barber shop without actually going anywhere, this smells exactly like the stuff my barber uses.  </li>
            <li>Others have described it as addictive and I would have to say they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li>Although quite dilute, there may be chance that this solution could mildly tint very light-coloured or white hair.</li>
            <li>He recently purchased a bottle and after I massaged it into his white hair (like his barber used to) it has colored his hair and scalp a light rose pink!  </li>
            <li>There are many other ingredients that could have been present, (for promoting healthy hair), but if you want to stay away from the $50 bottle, and still avoid looking like Kojak in your older age, use it.&lt;br /&gt;Please quit expecting such a bottom price product will solve all your problems.  </li>
            <li>It is a different scent from their normal aftershave, their special reserve, or their bay rum.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have the healthiest hair, I could live without it.</li>
            <li>(but less so than the Eau de Portugal)...much more of a barber note in the smell.</li>
            <li>As a hair tonic this was less than OK.  </li>
            <li>And the scent faded quickly, but not quickly enough for me.</li>
            <li>The Clubman Pinaud Eau de Quinine Compound Hair Tonic is a decent product.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of quinine, especially in G&amp;T&#x27;s and such.  </li>
            <li>Wears off fairly quickly, but comes back as a hint every now and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This tonic has an unusual aroma, and I think it is refreshing, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend anything pinaud clubman.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It does NOT tame your hair like some reviewers state--at least for my fine hair, so I use it in conjunction with Brylcreem original (my newest discovery); and, the aromas complement.</li>
            <li>This one is nice, but some people may not like the smell, but it tones down a short time after applying it.</li>
            <li>Oh well, other than that I feel it does just fine by me.</li>
            <li>have used it and enjoyed it very much, knowing that it will subtly go to work again, on my hair.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long, so it is pretty easy to tough out.</li>
            <li>but this one was new to me...</li>
            <li>I use this to kind of dry out and redistribute any other product I use made with mineral oil or petroleum.</li>
            <li>Let me make it clear, its just not hip or kool anymore to be a dept store junkie !</li>
            <li>It is OK but is not exactly the same as a</li>
            <li>I find It to be different but somewhat recognizable.</li>
            <li>It really does give your hair a luster and the smell takes you back to the old days when barber shops were all about the guys getting ready for their Saturday night dates.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Long story short, I enjoy this prospect.</li>
            <li>The smell might not be attractive to men in the 30 to 40 range, it is very heavy on a alcohol and heavy oriental spice smell.</li>
            <li>Extremely light on the fragrance, barely noticeable and doesn&#x27;t have that invigorating feel like other tonics.</li>
            <li>The two minor draw backs are it&#x27;s a red wine color which can stain fabric (and walls) if not careful, and it is a plastic bottle, which works perfectly fine, I just prefer glass.</li>
            <li>my hair, what little I have left, has a better texture and appearance on the days I use this hair tonic as opposed to the days I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Oh, my God, what damage I could have done in my 20&#x27;s if I had only been blessed with decent hair!</li>
            <li>If the hard tonic smelled like the powder, I would love the hair tonic...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t much hair left, I purchased it for its scalp treatment properties.  </li>
            <li>Put this stuff in your hair and it stays, and gives you a natural sheen and volume.</li>
            <li>It has an old timey barbershop smell.</li>
            <li>These 5 star reviews have to be fixed.  </li>
            <li>They said they would look into it, but so far have not contacted me, offered me a refund or even an apology.  </li>
            <li>I am trying out the Clubman and Eau de Portugal varieties too, which don&#x27;t seem nearly as offensive.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>color has me worried but so far no staining</li>
            <li>Just like the old fashioned tonics</li>
            <li>It does have an old fashioned powdery smell, which we like.</li>
            <li>It has a red dye, but I haven&#x27;t noticed staining while using reasonable amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells just like the barber shops of old days.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot more common there</li>
            <li>After trying the Eau de Quinine, though, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going back because the fragrance is so much</li>
            <li>like old school barber shop smells and products, and this without a doubt fits my</li>
            <li>This is serious old school barber shop stuff; it&#x27;s refreshing and comes in a neat (albeit plastic) bottle.</li>
            <li>It is far more subtle than cologne.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have really light hair, this stuf may not be for you--it is dark red!  </li>
            <li>have, so far, been a major fan of the Pinaud product line, and look forward to trying out the rest.</li>
            <li>The hold is somewhat looser than I had expected, but this is actually very convenient if one wears a hat, as it avoids the stiff pulling you can get with a stronger hold and is easily adjuste with a comb.</li>
            <li>The red dyed tonic is messy when it spills in the sink or on the countertop (which is often), but it cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>Exactly what expected..</li>
            <li>To coat my hair, I have found a small amount is not only necessary, but required as to not smell like a combination between cherry-cough syrup and old man (not a terrible combination.)</li>
            <li>The other thing I like is that the scent does not vanish quickly, like Eau de Portugal; it stays with you all day, which is key.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, as it&#x27;s strong and a little unusual, and I don&#x27;t like the color, as I&#x27;m a little weirded out by the dark color when the excess goes through my fingers into the sink.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little off, but it is okay, however, the smell does not last long.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because it had such high reviews on Amazon, and Clubman is usually held in pretty high regard.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used any other hair tonics, so I can&#x27;t judge the efficacy of the product, but the smell is a little bit sweet for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say Vitalis might smell a bit better to me, although it is a very common scent.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived, though, the smell out of the bottle was really nauseating -- I seriously considered just throwing it away right there, without even trying it on.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m the big bad hunk to save the day with beautiful manly smelling hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old enough to remember using Vitalis and all those sticky gooey hair products from the 1950s and &#x27;60s.</li>
            <li>Pinaud goes back to the 1800&#x27;s- and the brand is still alive and well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;what bothers me most is behind the label there is a warning sign that says flammable</li>
            <li>It has a nice nostalgic barbershop smell as well.</li>
            <li>A little bit of hold, just right as I&#x27;m not after a mousse, oiled, greased or gelled up effect.</li>
            <li>A little bit rubbed through the hair is just right for me.</li>
            <li>I can say that I have no little white flakes on my shoulders today!</li>
            <li>It certainly does not smell like cherry cough syrup or other medicine.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair other than add the smell.  </li>
            <li>I really hope Clubman Pinaud products stay around for a long, long time.</li>
            <li>old school (not old fashioned) nose....</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you have reasons to believe that you are losing your hair, you need to use this, and other lotions on the same line, and then more products (only the ones that have worked for others in the past).  </li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t use that much, way less than the amount of after shave I use.</li>
            <li>It has a scent, which is neither good nor bad, so you may or may not like this.</li>
            <li>It soon took on a more organic fragrance, subtle and delicious--almost like the flavor of black</li>

            <li> This is a good hair tonic.</li>

            <li> Makes you head smell good all day.</li>

            <li> it keeps those two jewels smelling good good.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the scalp, but smells like cough syrup.</li>
            <li> and it got mostly good reviews.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pleasant and light.</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion and light, graying hair.</li>
            <li> I love the aroma of this hair tonic, which is great to use when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is OK!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love this at triple the price, so this is a steal!  </li>
            <li> Pleasant scented hair tonic makes hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Very good product and worth the price</li>
            <li> Another nice product from Clubman Pinaud.</li>
            <li> No hold, no moisturizing component of any kind, nothing.</li>
            <li> Nice to find something with a nice scent, and a change of pace from today&#x27;s hair products.</li>
            <li> outstanding service great product and love the easyness of use and smell</li>
            <li> A nice touch when you want to feel &amp;#34;well dressed&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Just used makes your hair look nice , smells really good will be buying more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> and it is one of those products that is a pleasure to wear because it elicits compliments wherever you go... as others have stated there is something about the aroma that gives you a feeling that you are an old-world gentleman that knows how to look his best and really takes care of himself</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this product smells.</li>
            <li> It also soothed quite effectively when splashed on as an aftershave, so bonus points for a product that does double-duty, and prevents dueling fragrances.</li>
            <li> but then it does a good job and the oder is really refreshing.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li> The smell of this tonic is spicy rose, grapefruit-ish.</li>
            <li> The medicinal smell is nice, but not overpowering once the tonic is worked into the hair.</li>
            <li> and it has nice aroma.  </li>
            <li> The great news is that my grandfather died with a full head of hair while dad and I are almost bald.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has a very strong scent to it.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the smell and the price was really good though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite a replacement, but it is a suitable substitute for now.</li>
            <li> Good luck and enjoy it, while it is still around.</li>
            <li> Just a nice refreshing smell which is not overpowering</li>
            <li> Probably best for older clients or people who like strong scents.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, mild scent.  </li>
            <li> I hear this is going to be good during the winter months, but for now I&#x27;m gonna stick with my Groom N Clean.</li>
            <li> The result is that my very fine hair stays in place a noticeably better than if I didn&#x27;t use a tonic.</li>
            <li> Very light manly fragrance that won&#x27;t embarrass you at the gym.</li>
            <li> If this was good enough for great great grandpa, it certainly works for me!  </li>
            <li> In fact, I like it even better than the Eau de Portugal.  </li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t my favorite sent.</li>
            <li> I love these retro Pinaud products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> the bottle is top shelf class, too.</li>
            <li> Design Intent here was not to make your hair look better....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an initially bizarre scent, but I would have to say I liked it.</li>
            <li> Like most Clubman products, it&#x27;s refreshing wherever it lands.</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li> Need I say More.</li>
            <li> The Woman Love it.</li>
            <li> Love you longgggggggg Time</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way too potent.</li>
            <li> Plus you can&#x27;t find it in most stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok does its job.</li>
            <li> At 59 I just started with these products in an effort to improve appearance mostly during the just cut and need a cut phases (better control needed).</li>
            <li> Vitalis seems to have a bit more control (and unnatural effect) too and it costs more.</li>
            <li> Save a ton of water in the winter, because washing in a basin is suddenly more feasible.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, even received comments on it during a night out.</li>
            <li> Someone else may love it.</li>
            <li> I love most of my clubman products.</li>
            <li> If I were Herbert West, the Reanimator, I would take a greater interest.  </li>
            <li> reminds me of the years as a child in the town barber shop, my three boys love it also after their hair cuts</li>
            <li> Outstanding feel and scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> want to note that I use the Pinaud powder and LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> If I did not know better, I would use a dash of this in my cocktails.</li>
            <li> My son uses this more than I do.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and makes my hair look almost movie star quality.</li>
            <li> Many people ask what this smells like, my wife immediately said it smelled like baby powder (What?).  </li>
            <li> that is great, but what really hooked me on this tonic was the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I like a refreshing scalp tonic</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be touching your hair a lot - because every bug within a 5 mile radius will be visiting Club Eau de Quinine...</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite hair tonic of the Clubman line.</li>
            <li> Love it to finish off a shower.  </li>
            <li> There are better Clubman products for me to choose.</li>
            <li> Interesting scent.</li>
            <li> and it does a great job controlling dandruff as well as giving it a great smell and a little hold.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for from a great old time product?</li>
            <li> I love the bottle, they are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it helps keep my hair strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Another plus is that it&#x27;s easy to comb through, no matter how many times a day you need to comb your hair.</li>
            <li> More importantly, it made my hair feel and look fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Very classy and smells great.</li>
            <li> Brought back many good memories!</li>
            <li> very much smooth mellow classic scent add some to your shampoo Great Results</li>
            <li> Old fashioned hair tonic with a great smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and feels great on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Another one of my sons favorite products, and he and his lady friend both enjoy the scent and the results.</li>
            <li> This product does work great for making your hair soft but not for styling.  </li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is great, it makes my hair feel clean and invigorates my scalp and love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I took one star off because I didn&#x27;t notice any benefits from the tonic, other than my hair smelling awesome.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell and leaves my hair feeling a little bit more silky.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong barbershop smell, but it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, but not the kind of sweet that turns your stomach.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for knocking off old dandruff and keeping your scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my husband (who has short hair) and I think the best review of it is he wants more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using similar products since I was a child in Europe (most have been much more sophisticated and effective....</li>
            <li> The color disappears once used and keeps your hair in place just fine.</li>
            <li> It did that fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with the scent.</li>
            <li> But after putting it on and waiting about half an hour, the smell had faded a bit, and what remained was just marvelous.</li>
            <li> The scent fades to a pleasant masculine, indescribable aroma that lingers.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, I can only describe it as a smokey cherry vanilla scent that isn&#x27;t too strong but stays for hours.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the results I got with this, even if the smell is a bit overbearing.  </li>
            <li> I am a fan of Pinaud products, but I didn&#x27;t enjoy my experience with hair tonic.</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much to keep hair in place, but it also isn&#x27;t greasy and will give your coif a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it was barbershopish with a syrupy and light smoky tone to it.</li>
            <li> I use and enjoy both.</li>
            <li> Really fantastic stuff; will keep buying again and again.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of cheap tiki bar cocktails.</li>
            <li> It has a light control.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and Clubman products are amazing.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for non-greasy hair control.</li>
            <li> It will work great on darker hair colors, If you are blonde, you will want to use de portugal.</li>
            <li> It is lightly scented and won&#x27;t clash with any fragrances you decide to wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell that goes away fast, but after using this product for 2 weeks, i feel absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I saw</li>
            <li> Its well worth the five stars I gave it!</li>
            <li> First off, this stuff is potent smelling.  </li>
            <li> Its dirt cheap too, so to be flake free was worth the light risk.</li>
            <li> despite the flyaway, ungroomed hair///it would be worth it for the smell!</li>
            <li> All in all, another fine and worthy produce by Pinaud.</li>
            <li> The biggest issue I have is that first you have to love the smell because it will haunt you all day.  </li>
            <li> I think it has a somewhat flowery smell, but in a unique kinda flower way.  </li>
            <li> Feels clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves your scalp clean and tingly.</li>
            <li> It has a really pleasant scent similar to Choward&#x27;s Violet mints and gum (remember those?).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a very strong and distinct scent, if you aren&#x27;t already familiar with this product be warned that you may very well not take to</li>
            <li> Usage tip: get a spray bottle; you can find them at most large chain stores &amp; dollar stores.</li>
            <li> I want it to look natural with better control, carry a nice light scent, feel good to my hands/scalp and improve the color tone a little too.</li>
            <li> It has minimal hold, but makes my hair look really great</li>
            <li> Great for a retro wet look.</li>
            <li> and you will get better styling then water alone, but it will not impart much hold.</li>
            <li> full moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks clubman for making an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> It also made me realize how much I touch the top of my head throughout the day since it would make my hand smell like it too.</li>
            <li> Nice old guy smell</li>
            <li> Smell is too pungent and sweet for me.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li> I encourage every man who wants to add a touch of class to his wardrobe to pick up a bottle of this hair tonic, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Even better really, looks almost like a dream</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered this item, but I have used many other Pinaud Products and I am glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle more than a month ago, and I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> The brand is usually good stuff with minor issues.</li>
            <li> Great product if your looking for that classic smooth thick hair you notice a difference right away specially the scent wife loves it the first time she noticed liked it</li>
            <li> This product seems to make them a bit more gingery in the New Orleans sunlight.</li>
            <li> Was interested in that old-time barbershop smell and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too fine, too curly, just never could stand up to the modern routine.</li>
            <li> Incredibly fantastic smell, hard to describe, makes your hair look great, not greasy at all, nothing else on the market like this, at all.  </li>
            <li> just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Kind of strange smell.....too sweet</li>
            <li> When I use it, it gives my hair a healthy sheen, and makes it incredibly soft...</li>
            <li> On the other hand if you love to splash on the Old Spice like a porpoise at Sea World this just might be the best thing since sliced white bread.</li>
            <li> Per usual Amazons service was quick and great.</li>
            <li> I spilled some on the counter top, and it left a stain on the towel I used to clean it up.</li>
            <li> But my first problem is that intense red food coloring just cannot be a good idea in a cosmetic product.  </li>
            <li> need to establish one thing right off the bat:  </li>
            <li> I use it before going to bed, not before going to work, even though it smells right at any time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply the EdQ right out of the shower, I like the smell</li>
            <li> The price and shipping if this product is right on.</li>
            <li> Lasts the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it feels nice after a shower or after I&#x27;ve been outside and my head is hot and itchy.  </li>
            <li> At least this ingredient (quinine), has worked beautifully in my case and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got a great smell, manily, not boy bandish.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t impart any of its color to my hair, thankfully, but it will readily do so to your counter-top, towel, that nice white undershirt you just put on...</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a more gentle smell with a little more effect on how it made my hair look.</li>
            <li> The first time I opened the bottle</li>
            <li> This has a funny scent, I can&#x27;t describe it, and don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> At first shot, I&#x27;d have to say the scent took me off guard.</li>
            <li> One of my first memories was my Sicilian grandfather who always used this stuff.  </li>
            <li> What exactly am i suppose to feel with this product because my head just feels moist for one minute and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I tried it on a Saturday with a lot more since the first attempt didn&#x27;t make my hair look different.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the old time barber shop scent.  </li>
            <li> If you massage an oil-based product in first, this will help distribute it evenly.  </li>
            <li> Nice cent, I&#x27;d try a splash of water probably not much difference.</li>
            <li> If what you want is something to make your hair look natural, but lightly stay in place, this is the stuff.</li>
            <li> in all it&#x27;s pretty darn great to say the least.</li>
            <li> The smell is delightful, sort of like raspberries and cognac, and it lingers faintly throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this, even after having read that the Portugal is a better choice for lighter hair colors (I&#x27;m blonde).</li>
            <li> Cherries is what you&#x27;ll think at first.</li>
            <li> A scent you could put on your hair after first washing it.</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I was a bit baffled by the looks but decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> will buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good get the green heirs hair tonic that&#x27;s the one.</li>
            <li> Ok here is another product for those who have some, if you like a real smell that is pleasant, nostalgic and distinct</li>
            <li> That being said, the fragrance on this is considerably less assertive, in that &#x27;flies-falling-from-the-air-within-a-three-foot-radius&#x27; (right after applying) kind of way than Clubman.</li>
            <li> Basically this is an unique old school product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things and finally this one works plus it does give your hair some control but not too much.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and love the old school smells in hair and shaving products.  </li>
            <li> product has a mild herbal scent - while some reviews mention a cherry odor, I haven&#x27;t been able to pin the scent down.  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of all of Pinaud Clubman products, and bought this for the first time last week.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a musky fruit punch, it makes my hair feel soft and it has a mild hold to it.</li>
            <li> At points it was strong enough to make my eyes water.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to love this product but the fragrance is too strong, long lasting and medicine like for me.  </li>
            <li> I am on the lookout for reliable old school products because some stick around for ages because they got the formula right in the first place.  </li>
            <li> It was a little strange at first; it hit me like a chemical kind of smell when I splashed it on, but then it dissipated very quickly.</li>
            <li> In a four words: Subtle, but damn effective!</li>
            <li> overall a fine and affordable product</li>
            <li> * Apply on very clean, dry hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me, it goes beyond an old-lady smell to something a little more exotic and inhuman, like embalming fluid.  </li>
            <li> like a real barber shop.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely different and for that reason I do enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Light hold, but gives a low product look.</li>
            <li> Well that made the smell unbearable and still didn&#x27;t seem to do much for the hair.</li>
            <li> This has an unusual scent but really does keep the hair manageable without a trace of stickiness or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I think it smells very cologne like.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s intense scent.</li>
            <li> Real musky scent, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> However, this is way too much.  </li>
            <li> I still use it daily and enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair tonic.</li>
            <li> It makes the fade stand up straight so you can blend the comb-over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> than the scent, it works very well.</li>
            <li> ( something all real gentlemen should strive to do ).  </li>
            <li> Whatever soap you use is probably imparting as much fragrance.</li>
            <li> My wife asked if we really had to keep the bottle on the dresser</li>
            <li> soon began to really like it</li>
            <li> Very flowery, perfume-y type aroma.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have much hold</li>
            <li> hair is light brown with a tendency towards red highlights from my grandmother&#x27;s side.</li>
            <li> Both very manly barbershop smells.  </li>
            <li> have used it several days in a row and during my morning shower and noticed my hair is silky smooth; more so than I have noticed with any other product including conditioners.  </li>
            <li> this stuff smells sharp and feels even better.</li>
            <li> Step right in to the barber shop without actually going anywhere, this smells exactly like the stuff my barber uses.  </li>
            <li> Others have described it as addictive and I would have to say they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li> Although quite dilute, there may be chance that this solution could mildly tint very light-coloured or white hair.</li>
            <li> He recently purchased a bottle and after I massaged it into his white hair (like his barber used to) it has colored his hair and scalp a light rose pink!  </li>
            <li> There are many other ingredients that could have been present, (for promoting healthy hair), but if you want to stay away from the $50 bottle, and still avoid looking like Kojak in your older age, use it.&lt;br /&gt;Please quit expecting such a bottom price product will solve all your problems.  </li>
            <li> It is a different scent from their normal aftershave, their special reserve, or their bay rum.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have the healthiest hair, I could live without it.</li>
            <li> (but less so than the Eau de Portugal)...much more of a barber note in the smell.</li>
            <li> As a hair tonic this was less than OK.  </li>
            <li> And the scent faded quickly, but not quickly enough for me.</li>
            <li> The Clubman Pinaud Eau de Quinine Compound Hair Tonic is a decent product.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of quinine, especially in G&amp;T&#x27;s and such.  </li>
            <li> Wears off fairly quickly, but comes back as a hint every now and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This tonic has an unusual aroma, and I think it is refreshing, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend anything pinaud clubman.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does NOT tame your hair like some reviewers state--at least for my fine hair, so I use it in conjunction with Brylcreem original (my newest discovery); and, the aromas complement.</li>
            <li> This one is nice, but some people may not like the smell, but it tones down a short time after applying it.</li>
            <li> Oh well, other than that I feel it does just fine by me.</li>
            <li> have used it and enjoyed it very much, knowing that it will subtly go to work again, on my hair.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long, so it is pretty easy to tough out.</li>
            <li> but this one was new to me...</li>
            <li> I use this to kind of dry out and redistribute any other product I use made with mineral oil or petroleum.</li>
            <li> Let me make it clear, its just not hip or kool anymore to be a dept store junkie !</li>
            <li> It is OK but is not exactly the same as a</li>
            <li> I find It to be different but somewhat recognizable.</li>
            <li> It really does give your hair a luster and the smell takes you back to the old days when barber shops were all about the guys getting ready for their Saturday night dates.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Long story short, I enjoy this prospect.</li>
            <li> The smell might not be attractive to men in the 30 to 40 range, it is very heavy on a alcohol and heavy oriental spice smell.</li>
            <li> Extremely light on the fragrance, barely noticeable and doesn&#x27;t have that invigorating feel like other tonics.</li>
            <li> The two minor draw backs are it&#x27;s a red wine color which can stain fabric (and walls) if not careful, and it is a plastic bottle, which works perfectly fine, I just prefer glass.</li>
            <li> my hair, what little I have left, has a better texture and appearance on the days I use this hair tonic as opposed to the days I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Oh, my God, what damage I could have done in my 20&#x27;s if I had only been blessed with decent hair!</li>
            <li> If the hard tonic smelled like the powder, I would love the hair tonic...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t much hair left, I purchased it for its scalp treatment properties.  </li>
            <li> Put this stuff in your hair and it stays, and gives you a natural sheen and volume.</li>
            <li> It has an old timey barbershop smell.</li>
            <li> These 5 star reviews have to be fixed.  </li>
            <li> They said they would look into it, but so far have not contacted me, offered me a refund or even an apology.  </li>
            <li> I am trying out the Clubman and Eau de Portugal varieties too, which don&#x27;t seem nearly as offensive.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> color has me worried but so far no staining</li>
            <li> Just like the old fashioned tonics</li>
            <li> It does have an old fashioned powdery smell, which we like.</li>
            <li> It has a red dye, but I haven&#x27;t noticed staining while using reasonable amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells just like the barber shops of old days.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot more common there</li>
            <li> After trying the Eau de Quinine, though, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going back because the fragrance is so much</li>
            <li> like old school barber shop smells and products, and this without a doubt fits my</li>
            <li> This is serious old school barber shop stuff; it&#x27;s refreshing and comes in a neat (albeit plastic) bottle.</li>
            <li> It is far more subtle than cologne.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you have really light hair, this stuf may not be for you--it is dark red!  </li>
            <li> have, so far, been a major fan of the Pinaud product line, and look forward to trying out the rest.</li>
            <li> The hold is somewhat looser than I had expected, but this is actually very convenient if one wears a hat, as it avoids the stiff pulling you can get with a stronger hold and is easily adjuste with a comb.</li>
            <li> The red dyed tonic is messy when it spills in the sink or on the countertop (which is often), but it cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> Exactly what expected..</li>
            <li> To coat my hair, I have found a small amount is not only necessary, but required as to not smell like a combination between cherry-cough syrup and old man (not a terrible combination.)</li>
            <li> The other thing I like is that the scent does not vanish quickly, like Eau de Portugal; it stays with you all day, which is key.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, as it&#x27;s strong and a little unusual, and I don&#x27;t like the color, as I&#x27;m a little weirded out by the dark color when the excess goes through my fingers into the sink.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little off, but it is okay, however, the smell does not last long.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because it had such high reviews on Amazon, and Clubman is usually held in pretty high regard.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used any other hair tonics, so I can&#x27;t judge the efficacy of the product, but the smell is a little bit sweet for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say Vitalis might smell a bit better to me, although it is a very common scent.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived, though, the smell out of the bottle was really nauseating -- I seriously considered just throwing it away right there, without even trying it on.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m the big bad hunk to save the day with beautiful manly smelling hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old enough to remember using Vitalis and all those sticky gooey hair products from the 1950s and &#x27;60s.</li>
            <li> Pinaud goes back to the 1800&#x27;s- and the brand is still alive and well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;what bothers me most is behind the label there is a warning sign that says flammable</li>
            <li> It has a nice nostalgic barbershop smell as well.</li>
            <li> A little bit of hold, just right as I&#x27;m not after a mousse, oiled, greased or gelled up effect.</li>
            <li> A little bit rubbed through the hair is just right for me.</li>
            <li> I can say that I have no little white flakes on my shoulders today!</li>
            <li> It certainly does not smell like cherry cough syrup or other medicine.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair other than add the smell.  </li>
            <li> I really hope Clubman Pinaud products stay around for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> old school (not old fashioned) nose....</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you have reasons to believe that you are losing your hair, you need to use this, and other lotions on the same line, and then more products (only the ones that have worked for others in the past).  </li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t use that much, way less than the amount of after shave I use.</li>
            <li> It has a scent, which is neither good nor bad, so you may or may not like this.</li>
            <li> It soon took on a more organic fragrance, subtle and delicious--almost like the flavor of black</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li> Use it for the ritual (very habit forming) the subtle  fragrance( red wine with cinnamon?  </li>
            <li> It is dark red (think red wine) and might make light blonde or white hair take on a very faint red color.  </li>
            <li> Its aroma is unlike anyone in your circles is wearing, so you&#x27;ll be distinguished subtly and positively.</li>
            <li> I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the smell is really strong, weird, and long-lasting, even if you only use a little on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Once your hair is dry the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> I use it before i dry my hair</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t dry out your hair like hair spray or gel.</li>
            <li> However, I have been using dandruff shampoo with limited luck.  </li>
            <li> This product has a red dye in it, and comes out a dark fuchsia color.</li>
            <li> This product has essentially no &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; or styling properties beyond wetting down hair.  </li>
            <li> and then my brush, leave it dry and voila!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little new to grooming and if you didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s concept is to apply in morning and loosen up gel and refresh head for a few days up to a week for those out in the wildness or just conservative .</li>
            <li> - I will post a picture of me pouring this stuff down the toilet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily, greasy, or sticky in the least, and my hair is every bit as soft as if I didn&#x27;t use the tonic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like you have nothing in your hair, but looks like you spent an hour prepping it.</li>
            <li> Not an expected result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can bear the thought of purple iodine for antiseptic purposes, but this stuff stains my countertop, so I am not going to wait and see if my hair does turn pink as others report.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it turns my hair pink.</li>
            <li> but it is getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> Not much of a punch here like other hair tonics.</li>
            <li> They make application a lot easier, with less waste, and you only get it where you want it to go.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of any itching, probably due to the Quinine.  </li>
            <li> and it does help with styling when used with other product like gel or non aerosol hairspray..</li>
            <li> Tried to wash it off with a wet cloth to no success.  </li>
            <li> It has some effect on my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t replace other hair products for me.  </li>
            <li> He plans on trying other scents.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is - as has been described in other reviews here - somewhat fleeting, though.</li>
            <li> I also dilute with a little water just so it doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp.</li>
            <li> I put it on while hair is wet after showering and then add a little clubman styling gel and my hair</li>
            <li> and my hair is dark</li>
            <li> The dark purple color of the tonic looks like it ought to stain my skin or hair, but it doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> Dries to a faint smell fairly fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big &#x27;Clubman fan, but I would say I like this product from them the least.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt weigh your hair down with greasy stuff either.</li>
            <li> a slightly powdery/talc note is how this finishes.</li>
            <li> One of Pinauds hidden gems</li>
            <li> Even with conditioner, hair continues to stick up at odd places.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair less oily.</li>
            <li> If you want the look slightly wetter, add a bit of Pinaud gel.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for dandruff, but I would say does control the hair slightly.</li>
            <li> It might have a slight medicinal undertone along with the flower and powdery scent.  </li>
            <li> (Caution: this stuff has alcohol as the first ingredient - it will sting like crazy if it gets in your eyes.)  </li>
            <li> Makes my head really dry and was not effective.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this tonic based on other reviews, but the smell was, in my opinion, horrible, and it didn&#x27;t do anything positive for my hair.</li>
            <li> but if I go out for the day I will add a little hairspray</li>
            <li> * Have a little drink.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Treat yourself to a little luxury in life.  </li>
            <li> Rub a little under your nuts</li>
            <li> After showering, I splash a little in my palm and spread it in my hands, then rub it into my hair.</li>
            <li> anyway so opened it and squirted a little into my hand.</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair</li>
            <li> would absolutely NOT recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This does smell heavily of Quinine (I suppose that&#x27;s what it is).  </li>
            <li> I put it on everyday and the wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I use it by itself for everyday</li>
            <li> It is also heavily colored, and I can see where it would stain lighter color hair.</li>
            <li> Please treat it as such, and stop complaining that your hair looks - one way or another, worse than it did five minutes ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have trouble describing the scent.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Might take a few times to get used to the smell.</li>
            <li> That said, the tonic helps to minimize clumps and condition the hair for heavy, wax-based pomade I like.</li>
            <li> Now this stuff is something I had never heard of it takes a few times of use to get used to it</li>
            <li> and I rub this in everyday.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why other reviewers are complaining of greaser levels of shine; as I get very little added shine from this</li>
            <li> Leaves hair stiff and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> It does hold your hair in place but does not make it stiff.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for stiff control, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> Not a strong alcohol scent like Vitalis.</li>
            <li> This stuff made me smell like I had a cold, or getting high with cough syrup one or the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I tend to have dandruff that can get pretty bad</li>
            <li> Equally unrealistic would be to use it four or five times, and then expect it to regenerate all your dead hairs  by the next</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that this has very little if any holding properties.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I usually put some on when I sleep, or for days when I don&#x27;t feel like putting wax into my hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> no more dandruff</li>
            <li> I must&#x27;ve pressed the wrong key in my iPad.</li>
            <li> Reviewers were right about it stopping that annoying scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I have other Clubman products and was expecting the same so as a Clubman product I was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> On first sniff, I thought I was going to hate this.  </li>
            <li> This has been hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to explain.  </li>
            <li> I have to go with the negative reviewers on this one.  </li>
            <li> The negative reviews and comments had me worried</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled by the smell</li>
            <li> I could have one complaint</li>
            <li> I was looking for a substitute  for  Vitalis, which holds thick or gray hair well with out a smell or being greasy</li>
            <li> No more itch!</li>
            <li> when you pour some in your hand it will be reminiscent of that bad nose bleed you had in the fifth grade.</li>
            <li> here it is in a nutshell: If you dress in designer cloths and like expensive colognes this product will not fit in your world at all.  </li>
            <li> Hardly EVER have I smelled anything worse!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced using a hair product quite like this.</li>
            <li> Please note than in no place on the bottle there is any mentioning about the beauty of your hair, or even worse...</li>
            <li> &#x27;addicted to the smell&#x27;....REALLY????  </li>
            <li> Not happy with the fragrance or its ability to hold.  </li>
            <li> james bond couldnt be wrong.</li>
            <li> And - of course - expensive).  </li>
            <li> This stuff stinks so bad you can hardly breath when it is on your head.  </li>
            <li> Smells crazy.</li>
            <li> Just not to my taste, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> and I was a bit afraid it would stain my head purple ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that the smell is bad</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle?</li>
            <li> then this is for you, this is not for bad mojos who just loves polo or designer dept store crap,  </li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> Unimaginably horrible.</li>
            <li> - it is awful to smell!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a fan of Pinaud products, but I didn&#x27;t enjoy my experience with hair tonic. Makes my head really dry and was not effective. I did enjoy the smell and the price was really good though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced using a hair product quite like this. In a four words: Subtle, but damn effective!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of all of Pinaud Clubman products, and bought this for the first time last week.  I was not disappointed.  In fact, I like it even better than the Eau de Portugal.  I keep my hair extremely short, almost shaved off, so I don&#x27;t use this for the hair.  I use it for the scent.  Fantastic scent...like a real barber shop.  The other thing I like is that the scent does not vanish quickly, like Eau de Portugal; it stays with you all day, which is key.  A great value and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t my favorite sent.</li>
            <li> Kind of strange smell.....too sweet</li>
            <li> Massage it into damp hair and you will get better styling then water alone, but it will not impart much hold. Use it for the ritual (very habit forming) the subtle  fragrance( red wine with cinnamon?  Terrific ! )and definite  relief from scalp itch (Quinine?). I love these retro Pinaud products.Also,try Eau De Portugal Hair formula for a gin-and-tonic aroma.</li>
            <li> Unimaginably horrible. A baffling concoction of odors designed to produce an intolerable bouquet of chemicals that Ace Chemical wouldn&#x27;t condone.</li>
            <li> (husband writing this review) I like this stuff, with a caveat, especially when using in the morning before I get a shower.  It gets rid of any itching, probably due to the Quinine.  This does smell heavily of Quinine (I suppose that&#x27;s what it is).  It does NOT hold hair well though, like Vitalis or similar stuff--it just doesn&#x27;t have an oily component that does that.  Also, if you have really light hair, this stuf may not be for you--it is dark red!  I have medium brown hair and it doesn&#x27;t stain me though.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I put it on everyday and the wife loves it. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold very well.  I use it by itself for everyday but if I go out for the day I will add a little hairspray</li>
            <li> james bond couldnt be wrong. this stuff smells sharp and feels even better.</li>
            <li> Works great on the dogs</li>
            <li> This is a good hair tonic. It has a strong barbershop smell, but it&#x27;s not offensive. The red dyed tonic is messy when it spills in the sink or on the countertop (which is often), but it cleans up easily. I bought this to replace the discontinued Hask Hair and Scalp Treatment my Dad and I have used since the 80&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not quite a replacement, but it is a suitable substitute for now.</li>
            <li> Step right in to the barber shop without actually going anywhere, this smells exactly like the stuff my barber uses.  Probably because it is...</li>
            <li> Per usual Amazons service was quick and great. The first time I opened the bottle I&#x27;m pretty sure I saw fairy s escape giggling with glee. This stuff smells great, I can only describe it as a smokey cherry vanilla scent that isn&#x27;t too strong but stays for hours. Be warned though.... when you pour some in your hand it will be reminiscent of that bad nose bleed you had in the fifth grade. This stuff looks like thinned out stage blood. The color disappears once used and keeps your hair in place just fine. Its well worth the five stars I gave it!</li>
            <li> The scalp tonic is supposed to stop scalp itching and IT DOES!</li>
            <li> I am on a bit of tear, trying all the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; barber shop products. I am trying each product for a day or two, independent of any other products just so I can get feel for each one. This has a funny scent, I can&#x27;t describe it, and don&#x27;t like it. It is also heavily colored, and I can see where it would stain lighter color hair. I spilled some on the counter top, and it left a stain on the towel I used to clean it up. It washed out, but still, something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it several days in a row and during my morning shower and noticed my hair is silky smooth; more so than I have noticed with any other product including conditioners.  I will find a way to work this product into my routine until it is gone, but I don&#x27;t expect to buy it again because of the color and smell. If it did not have that smell or color it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> old school (not old fashioned) nose....tingly to the scalp (but less so than the Eau de Portugal)...much more of a barber note in the smell. the bottle is top shelf class, too. hits on all pistons (visual, olfactory, tactile)...a slightly powdery/talc note is how this finishes. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Guys,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need to establish one thing right off the bat:  This Is Not a Beauty Product.  This is simply a Health Product. As in medication for your hair.  Please treat it as such, and stop complaining that your hair looks - one way or another, worse than it did five minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Design Intent here was not to make your hair look better....But healthier.  Please note than in no place on the bottle there is any mentioning about the beauty of your hair, or even worse...Yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it and enjoyed it very much, knowing that it will subtly go to work again, on my hair.  I use it before going to bed, not before going to work, even though it smells right at any time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using similar products since I was a child in Europe (most have been much more sophisticated and effective....And - of course - expensive).  This is a bottom line product that works.  At least this ingredient (quinine), has worked beautifully in my case and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Apply on very clean, dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Massage vigorously into scalp.&lt;br /&gt;* Have a little drink.&lt;br /&gt;* Go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I totally recommend this as an entry product.  There are many other ingredients that could have been present, (for promoting healthy hair), but if you want to stay away from the $50 bottle, and still avoid looking like Kojak in your older age, use it.&lt;br /&gt;Please quit expecting such a bottom price product will solve all your problems.  It was only meant to help with a couple of things, those are listed, and it does it well.  It doesn&#x27;t cure snoring, chickenpox, or warts.  Equally unrealistic would be to use it four or five times, and then expect it to regenerate all your dead hairs  by the next full moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have reasons to believe that you are losing your hair, you need to use this, and other lotions on the same line, and then more products (only the ones that have worked for others in the past).  Good luck and enjoy it, while it is still around.</li>
            <li> It is OK but is not exactly the same as a what I had some years ago - so it was not what I was expecting. It is OK!</li>
            <li> At first shot, I&#x27;d have to say the scent took me off guard. It&#x27;s an initially bizarre scent, but I would have to say I liked it. It&#x27;s definitely different and for that reason I do enjoy it. Like most Clubman products, it&#x27;s refreshing wherever it lands.</li>
            <li> Smells crazy. I use this to kind of dry out and redistribute any other product I use made with mineral oil or petroleum. Seems to do a good job just to even it out if my hair gets too greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li> Another nice product from Clubman Pinaud.</li>
            <li> Great product that works very well for my needs. Thank you for offering a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Pinaud ...Need I say More.Pinaud on your head.Pinaud on your balls. Pinaud on your body , Pinaud on the walls.Yes I sprinkle my Bed Room with Pinaud.The Woman Love it.Makes them Horney.Oh them so Horney......Love you longgggggggg Time....PINAUD # 1... Great Stuff Nice Smell.  [[ASIN:B002BDVRF6 B002BDVRF6]]</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this tonic based on other reviews, but the smell was, in my opinion, horrible, and it didn&#x27;t do anything positive for my hair. No hold, no moisturizing component of any kind, nothing. And the scent faded quickly, but not quickly enough for me. Just not to my taste, I&#x27;m afraid.</li>
            <li> Makes my scalp feel great! And, my hair looks great too. The smell is a little off, but it is okay, however, the smell does not last long. Once your hair is dry the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> One of my first memories was my Sicilian grandfather who always used this stuff.  My father did and I decided to see if they still offered this hair tonic.  The great news is that my grandfather died with a full head of hair while dad and I are almost bald.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> One of Pinauds hidden gems</li>
            <li> I just bought it for a client he has been using it for years and swears by it.</li>
            <li> Light hold, but gives a low product look.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now and it is an awesome product. I helps straighten my wavy hair and the scent is very nice. Thanks clubman for making an outstanding product.! I put it on while hair is wet after showering and then add a little clubman styling gel and my hair stay the entire day. I also holds well with the gel.</li>
            <li> What exactly am i suppose to feel with this product because my head just feels moist for one minute and that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell that goes away fast, but after using this product for 2 weeks, i feel absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Never used hair tonic before.  But I bought this in order to give it a try.  It smells really good, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that the smell is bad but it&#x27;s way too potent. I tried some in the morning and I swear it never faded through out the day. At points it was strong enough to make my eyes water. And I didn&#x27;t use that much, way less than the amount of after shave I use. I tried it on a Saturday with a lot more since the first attempt didn&#x27;t make my hair look different. Well that made the smell unbearable and still didn&#x27;t seem to do much for the hair. It also made me realize how much I touch the top of my head throughout the day since it would make my hand smell like it too. Just not the product for me. I was hoping to get a more gentle smell with a little more effect on how it made my hair look.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Very classy and smells great. It doesnt weigh your hair down with greasy stuff either. Plus you can&#x27;t find it in most stores.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t much hair left, I purchased it for its scalp treatment properties.  I massage some into my scalp and it immediately feels refreshed.  I enjoy the old time barber shop scent.  It is another great Clubman product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old enough to remember using Vitalis and all those sticky gooey hair products from the 1950s and &#x27;60s. This has an unusual scent but really does keep the hair manageable without a trace of stickiness or greasy feeling. If you massage an oil-based product in first, this will help distribute it evenly.  The purple colour is from gentian violet which is a topical antiseptic. Although quite dilute, there may be chance that this solution could mildly tint very light-coloured or white hair.</li>
            <li> As a hair tonic this was less than OK.  Leaves hair stiff and unmanageable. Even with conditioner, hair continues to stick up at odd places.</li>
            <li> Works well ....Nice old guy smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok does its job. Nothing that&#x27;s a must have. I wouldn&#x27;t over pay for it.  I&#x27;m a little new to grooming and if you didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;s concept is to apply in morning and loosen up gel and refresh head for a few days up to a week for those out in the wildness or just conservative . Nice cent, I&#x27;d try a splash of water probably not much difference. I don&#x27;t really have the healthiest hair, I could live without it. The brand is usually good stuff with minor issues.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the chronic for your hair.  I was experiencing some winter time dandruff issues.  I apply the EdQ right out of the shower, I like the smell and so does the lady friend.  It has minimal hold, but makes my hair look really great and it seems to be helping with the dandruff...proving once again the Clubman Pinaud products are reliable.</li>
            <li> If this was good enough for great great grandpa, it certainly works for me!  Plus there&#x27;s quinine in it.  Must be good!</li>
            <li> Clubman&#x27;s Eau de Quinine Hair Tonic is equal parts floral and medicinal in fragrance. This is serious old school barber shop stuff; it&#x27;s refreshing and comes in a neat (albeit plastic) bottle. Doesn&#x27;t do much to keep hair in place, but it also isn&#x27;t greasy and will give your coif a nice shine.</li>
            <li> This stuff made me smell like I had a cold, or getting high with cough syrup one or the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it does the job..</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Introduces just enough oil to your hair after you&#x27;ve washed it. Makes you head smell good all day.</li>
            <li> A great bang for the buck hair tonic. A little bit of hold, just right as I&#x27;m not after a mousse, oiled, greased or gelled up effect. I want it to look natural with better control, carry a nice light scent, feel good to my hands/scalp and improve the color tone a little too. This does all of that for pennies a pop. A little bit rubbed through the hair is just right for me. At 59 I just started with these products in an effort to improve appearance mostly during the just cut and need a cut phases (better control needed). It did that fine and now I like it at any time.  I have trouble describing the scent. I find It to be different but somewhat recognizable. I&#x27;d say it was barbershopish with a syrupy and light smoky tone to it. I&#x27;m fine with the scent. I&#x27;d say Vitalis might smell a bit better to me, although it is a very common scent.  Vitalis seems to have a bit more control (and unnatural effect) too and it costs more. I use and enjoy both.</li>
            <li> Oh, my God, what damage I could have done in my 20&#x27;s if I had only been blessed with decent hair! Too fine, too curly, just never could stand up to the modern routine. Between no-poo and that, there is EdQ. I spray my hair with a water bottle, then comb in a splash of this, and only shampoo when I need it. Save a ton of water in the winter, because washing in a basin is suddenly more feasible.</li>
            <li> I was buying this from my barber, but he quit handling it.  Now I order Clubman Pinaud Eau de Quinine Hair Tonic by mail order all the time.</li>
            <li> The Clubman Pinaud Eau de Quinine Compound Hair Tonic is a decent product. It does hold your hair in place but does not make it stiff. When applied, this product does give a scent as if just coming from the barber shop.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used any other hair tonics, so I can&#x27;t judge the efficacy of the product, but the smell is a little bit sweet for me. It&#x27;s almost fruity.</li>
            <li> Great product if your looking for that classic smooth thick hair you notice a difference right away specially the scent wife loves it the first time she noticed liked it very much smooth mellow classic scent add some to your shampoo Great Results</li>
            <li> Love the smell, even received comments on it during a night out. I took one star off because I didn&#x27;t notice any benefits from the tonic, other than my hair smelling awesome. But I do have very coarse hair, so only one star off.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to love this product but the fragrance is too strong, long lasting and medicine like for me.  Someone else may love it.</li>
            <li> Ok here is another product for those who have some, if you like a real smell that is pleasant, nostalgic and distinct then this is for you, this is not for bad mojos who just loves polo or designer dept store crap,  Let me make it clear, its just not hip or kool anymore to be a dept store junkie !</li>
            <li> i like the smell and it does help with styling when used with other product like gel or non aerosol hairspray..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what bothers me most is behind the label there is a warning sign that says flammable</li>
            <li> Bought this as an add on item and figured I&#x27;d use this as something to annoy the wife with. Long story short, I enjoy this prospect. Nice to find something with a nice scent, and a change of pace from today&#x27;s hair products.</li>
            <li> Pinaud has the best barber products on the market. I use several of their after shave and hair tonic formulas.  I love the aroma of this hair tonic, which is great to use when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair.  It really does give your hair a luster and the smell takes you back to the old days when barber shops were all about the guys getting ready for their Saturday night dates.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scented hair tonic makes hair more manageable.  It does not have the holding power of Vitalis, but nor is it as oily.  The price is very good too, although I do then to use more of the product than with Vitalis.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, not sticky, and not runny. Put this stuff in your hair and it stays, and gives you a natural sheen and volume. It feels like you have nothing in your hair, but looks like you spent an hour prepping it. Really fantastic stuff; will keep buying again and again.</li>
            <li> First off, this stuff is potent smelling.  My roomate said it smelled like robitessum to him. I think it smells very cologne like.  However, I have been using dandruff shampoo with limited luck.  I put this on in the morning after my shower, and it has worked wonders on clearing up my dandruff.  I am a huge fan of the results I got with this, even if the smell is a bit overbearing.  The nice thing is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long, so it is pretty easy to tough out. Its dirt cheap too, so to be flake free was worth the light risk.</li>
            <li> Smell is too pungent and sweet for me. It reminds me of cheap tiki bar cocktails. No bueno.</li>
            <li> Works great as advertised.</li>
            <li> Basically this is an unique old school product. It&#x27;s got a very strong and distinct scent, if you aren&#x27;t already familiar with this product be warned that you may very well not take to it&#x27;s intense scent.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job with my hair. It has helped get rid of my dandruff and itchy scalp. It has a light control. You work in into your damp hair and comb it. it&#x27;s not greasy, oily or sticky. If you are looking for stiff control, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. If what you want is something to make your hair look natural, but lightly stay in place, this is the stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It has an old timey barbershop smell. I love the bottle, they are so easy to use. Reviewers were right about it stopping that annoying scalp itch. I shake some on my head after shampooing and work it into my scalp withmy fingertips and then my brush, leave it dry and voila! No more itch! I have tried so many things and finally this one works plus it does give your hair some control but not too much. I really hope Clubman Pinaud products stay around for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> outstanding service great product and love the easyness of use and smell just a all round great product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Real musky scent, but it gets the job done. Probably best for older clients or people who like strong scents.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered this item, but I have used many other Pinaud Products and I am glad I ordered this.</li>
            <li> This tonic smells wonderful and it does shine up my hair a bit. I mix it in my palm with Brylcream and comb it through. It has a nice nostalgic barbershop smell as well. I love most of my clubman products.</li>
            <li> Treat yourself to a little luxury in life.  I really enjoy the smell of this.  It is far more subtle than cologne.  Just a nice refreshing smell which is not overpowering and yet you catch a sniff several times over the course of the day.  A nice touch when you want to feel &amp;#34;well dressed&amp;#34; whether that be Dockers or Tuxedo.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. I use it before i dry my hair and it gives my hair body and fullness. It smells great too. It lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell and leaves my hair feeling a little bit more silky.  Not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle of this would probably last me 1-2 years! Really good deal for the $$$&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> You guys must be out of your minds!!!  This stuff stinks so bad you can hardly breath when it is on your head.  All day this smell will linger on you as it did for me.  I am 43 years old and love the old school smells in hair and shaving products.  However, this is way too much.  These 5 star reviews have to be fixed.  There is no way I am the only one who feels this way about the smell. One review here states...&#x27;addicted to the smell&#x27;....REALLY????  Hey this may hold your hair and not be too greasy but you must know how pungent this stuff smells.  I even took a shower when I got home in the evening and after the shower my head STILL smelled like this stuff - it is awful to smell!!!  Verified buyer here - I will post a picture of me pouring this stuff down the toilet.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for 40 years.  He recently purchased a bottle and after I massaged it into his white hair (like his barber used to) it has colored his hair and scalp a light rose pink!  Tried to wash it off with a wet cloth to no success.  Will see if shampooing it will take it out.  Not an expected result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has been a month since I contacted the Pinaud-Clubman manufacturers at American International Industries.  They said they would look into it, but so far have not contacted me, offered me a refund or even an apology.  I am changing my rating to a one star, as my husband also suffered a burning sensation on his scalp after using this product.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It has some effect on my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t replace other hair products for me.  I still use it daily and enjoy using it.  Pleasant, mild scent.  Feels clean.</li>
            <li> I have to go with the negative reviewers on this one.  I am on the lookout for reliable old school products because some stick around for ages because they got the formula right in the first place.  I love the idea of quinine, especially in G&amp;T&#x27;s and such.  I don&#x27;t even mind the plastic bottle.  But my first problem is that intense red food coloring just cannot be a good idea in a cosmetic product.  I can bear the thought of purple iodine for antiseptic purposes, but this stuff stains my countertop, so I am not going to wait and see if my hair does turn pink as others report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the smell is really strong, weird, and long-lasting, even if you only use a little on your hair.  To me, it goes beyond an old-lady smell to something a little more exotic and inhuman, like embalming fluid.  If I were Herbert West, the Reanimator, I would take a greater interest.  One use could be as a human repellent at parties filled with people you don&#x27;t like, but don&#x27;t torture the innocent with it.  I am trying out the Clubman and Eau de Portugal varieties too, which don&#x27;t seem nearly as offensive.</li>
            <li> clubman eau de quinine hair tonic.  I really like this hair tonic. however because I have white hair it turns my hair pink.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because it had such high reviews on Amazon, and Clubman is usually held in pretty high regard. When it arrived, though, the smell out of the bottle was really nauseating -- I seriously considered just throwing it away right there, without even trying it on. But after putting it on and waiting about half an hour, the smell had faded a bit, and what remained was just marvelous. For some reason I thought it would help style my hair [in place of a gel or wax, maybe?] but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for. Instead, I usually put some on when I sleep, or for days when I don&#x27;t feel like putting wax into my hair. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my scalp, but I also just started using it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have been using it for years with great results.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT - EXPEDIENT SERVICE</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised. The negative reviews and comments had me worried but I decided to go with it and try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells great: it has a potpourri scent to it with some smoke, leather and sweetness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Softened my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool/unique bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinaud quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color has me worried but so far no staining and my hair is dark so no tinting or dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s pretty darn great to say the least. If you&#x27;re on the fence just hop on over and give it a try since it&#x27;s so affordable. I guess john Wayne used to use this stuff so that&#x27;s cool I guess to get an impression of what the Duke smelled like.</li>
            <li> Very good product and worth the price</li>
            <li> reminds me of the years as a child in the town barber shop, my three boys love it also after their hair cuts</li>
            <li> Outstanding feel and scent. Smells as though you just left the barber. Leaves your scalp clean and tingly. Pinaud is the best of the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not much of a punch here like other hair tonics. Extremely light on the fragrance, barely noticeable and doesn&#x27;t have that invigorating feel like other tonics. When I put a bit on my hands to massage into my scalp it came out almost purple and I was a bit afraid it would stain my head purple ...I have other Clubman products and was expecting the same so as a Clubman product I was a little disappointed.  Maybe I got a bad bottle?</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled by the smell and it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair other than add the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t hold it in place, make it softer, or anything.  It made my hair a bit static-y.&lt;br /&gt;I want to note that I use the Pinaud powder and LOVE IT.  Especially the smell.  If the hard tonic smelled like the powder, I would love the hair tonic...despite the flyaway, ungroomed hair///it would be worth it for the smell!</li>
            <li> If I did not know better, I would use a dash of this in my cocktails. It smells like a musky fruit punch, it makes my hair feel soft and it has a mild hold to it. I really like this stuff and Clubman products are amazing. Cheers!</li>
            <li> Old fashioned hair tonic with a great smell. Leaves hair soft and feels great on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Just used makes your hair look nice , smells really good will be buying more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Great for a retro wet look. Awesome for 1940s Comb-Over Fades Haircuts. It makes the fade stand up straight so you can blend the comb-over.&lt;br /&gt;5-Stars! Very light manly fragrance that won&#x27;t embarrass you at the gym.</li>
            <li> Wow! What a great item! I used to buy Clubman hair spray from my barber before he retired. Now I have to buy it online. While searching for it on Amazon, I came across this Clubman Eau de Quinine hair tonic and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s great! It has made my hair less oily. Plus, I&#x27;ve always had a sort of itchy scalp. It has helped with that too. It also works quite well as an alternative to hair spray.You rub some into your hair before combing it, and it helps to keep things in place. It has a really pleasant scent similar to Choward&#x27;s Violet mints and gum (remember those?). I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Might take a few times to get used to the smell. Fantastic for non-greasy hair control. Rub into scalp after shower. If you want the look slightly wetter, add a bit of Pinaud gel.</li>
            <li> I hear this is going to be good during the winter months, but for now I&#x27;m gonna stick with my Groom N Clean.</li>
            <li> My son uses this more than I do. He likes the hint of cherry scent. I don&#x27;t like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the scent, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Just like the old fashioned tonics</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using a safety razor, hair tonic, Pinaud aftershave, etc. This one is nice, but some people may not like the smell, but it tones down a short time after applying it.</li>
            <li> Great hair tonic, smells like what the barbers used to put on your hair after a haircut! Brought back many good memories!</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle more than a month ago, and I will definitely be buying more. The smell is delightful, sort of like raspberries and cognac, and it lingers faintly throughout the day. The hold is somewhat looser than I had expected, but this is actually very convenient if one wears a hat, as it avoids the stiff pulling you can get with a stronger hold and is easily adjuste with a comb. All in all, another fine and worthy produce by Pinaud.</li>
            <li> This tonic has an unusual aroma, and I think it is refreshing, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. It does NOT tame your hair like some reviewers state--at least for my fine hair, so I use it in conjunction with Brylcreem original (my newest discovery); and, the aromas complement.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on my hair. I have very dark brown hair and it does a great job controlling dandruff as well as giving it a great smell and a little hold. I put this on a couple of minutes before putting some clubman styling gel and they pair excellently. It will work great on darker hair colors, If you are blonde, you will want to use de portugal.</li>
            <li> I bought the product because I needed something to help control dandruff. This product does nothing for dandruff, but I would say does control the hair slightly. It has a scent, which is neither good nor bad, so you may or may not like this. The price is VERY good, therefore this product is certainly excellent for the price. Not sure I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Works great! What more can you ask for from a great old time product? Just like going to a barber.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my husband (who has short hair) and I think the best review of it is he wants more. It does have an old fashioned powdery smell, which we like. He plans on trying other scents. The two minor draw backs are it&#x27;s a red wine color which can stain fabric (and walls) if not careful, and it is a plastic bottle, which works perfectly fine, I just prefer glass.</li>
            <li> I use this hair tonic once a week and it helps keep my hair strong and healthy.  I also dilute with a little water just so it doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp.</li>
            <li> While I am no stranger to Clubman Pinaud grooming products I have to admit I had never used their Eau de Quinine hair tonic... I had used the Jeris hair tonic with oil for years but this one was new to me... however, I am VERY HAPPY with the results and it has helped strengthen, clarify and give shine to my hair, all I do is massage it into my scalp, brush my hair and it the magic starts when it dries and gives off that magnificent cherry-blossom like aroma... and it is one of those products that is a pleasure to wear because it elicits compliments wherever you go... as others have stated there is something about the aroma that gives you a feeling that you are an old-world gentleman that knows how to look his best and really takes care of himself ( something all real gentlemen should strive to do ).  I encourage every man who wants to add a touch of class to his wardrobe to pick up a bottle of this hair tonic, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a very strong scent to it. To coat my hair, I have found a small amount is not only necessary, but required as to not smell like a combination between cherry-cough syrup and old man (not a terrible combination.) That said, the tonic helps to minimize clumps and condition the hair for heavy, wax-based pomade I like.</li>
            <li> Another one of my sons favorite products, and he and his lady friend both enjoy the scent and the results. Thank you</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical. Its aroma is unlike anyone in your circles is wearing, so you&#x27;ll be distinguished subtly and positively.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this, even after having read that the Portugal is a better choice for lighter hair colors (I&#x27;m blonde). This product has a red dye in it, and comes out a dark fuchsia color. It didn&#x27;t impart any of its color to my hair, thankfully, but it will readily do so to your counter-top, towel, that nice white undershirt you just put on...yeah, you don&#x27;t want any of those to cross paths with this stuff. Usage tip: get a spray bottle; you can find them at most large chain stores &amp; dollar stores. They make application a lot easier, with less waste, and you only get it where you want it to go. That being said, the fragrance on this is considerably less assertive, in that &#x27;flies-falling-from-the-air-within-a-three-foot-radius&#x27; (right after applying) kind of way than Clubman. I really liked the way this product smells. It also soothed quite effectively when splashed on as an aftershave, so bonus points for a product that does double-duty, and prevents dueling fragrances. The fragrance is - as has been described in other reviews here - somewhat fleeting, though. By an hour or so before lunch, this has mellowed out to where I only get an occasional whiff when I lean back in my chair. By two o&#x27;clock? Whatever soap you use is probably imparting as much fragrance. As has also been mentioned, this tonic does not bring a lot of control to the party, where your hair is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have, so far, been a major fan of the Pinaud product line, and look forward to trying out the rest. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the fragrance or its ability to hold.  I&#x27;m back to VO5 and this stuff is in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Pinaud goes back to the 1800&#x27;s- and the brand is still alive and well.  I have several of their products</li>
            <li> Love the smell and makes my hair look almost movie star quality. Even better really, looks almost like a dream and I&#x27;m the big bad hunk to save the day with beautiful manly smelling hair. Rub a little under your nuts it keeps those two jewels smelling good good. Hell I&#x27;d bath in this stuff keeps dandruff at bay also. Highly recommend anything pinaud clubman. County clubs carry it so why shouldn&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> Now this stuff is something I had never heard of it takes a few times of use to get used to it but then it does a good job and the oder is really refreshing. I use it often.</li>
            <li> Order this!  Incredibly fantastic smell, hard to describe, makes your hair look great, not greasy at all, nothing else on the market like this, at all.  Was used in Victorian England by King Edward.  Can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff!  If you buy it and use it, you, along with everyone that&#x27;s around you, will thank me for recommending it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a substitute  for  Vitalis, which holds thick or gray hair well with out a smell or being greasy but it is getting harder to find.  This product does work great for making your hair soft but not for styling.  The biggest issue I have is that first you have to love the smell because it will haunt you all day.  I got up the next morning after using it the day before and as soon as I began my workout there it was again that smell.  My wife asked if we really had to keep the bottle on the dresser (Hint Hint.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here it is in a nutshell: If you dress in designer cloths and like expensive colognes this product will not fit in your world at all.  On the other hand if you love to splash on the Old Spice like a porpoise at Sea World this just might be the best thing since sliced white bread.</li>
            <li> This has been hard to find.  I&#x27; happy I was able to find this as an add on item, especially at a great price.  Many people ask what this smells like, my wife immediately said it smelled like baby powder (What?).  I think it has a somewhat flowery smell, but in a unique kinda flower way.  It might have a slight medicinal undertone along with the flower and powdery scent.  Anyway, it feels nice after a shower or after I&#x27;ve been outside and my head is hot and itchy.  I tend to have dandruff that can get pretty bad, im hoping this stuff helps keep it in check when the time comes.</li>
            <li> The price and shipping if this product is right on. The smell might not be attractive to men in the 30 to 40 range, it is very heavy on a alcohol and heavy oriental spice smell.</li>
            <li> This is not a hair pomade or styling gel.  This product has essentially no &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; or styling properties beyond wetting down hair.  The product is essentially an aftershave that you put on your hair / scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a mild herbal scent - while some reviews mention a cherry odor, I haven&#x27;t been able to pin the scent down.  It is a different scent from their normal aftershave, their special reserve, or their bay rum.  It certainly does not smell like cherry cough syrup or other medicine.  It has a red dye, but I haven&#x27;t noticed staining while using reasonable amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels pleasant on the scalp, and it does not have a noticeable menthol cooling sensation.  (Caution: this stuff has alcohol as the first ingredient - it will sting like crazy if it gets in your eyes.)  I like to brush the product into my hair on morning when I didn&#x27;t have time to shower.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the barber shops of old days.  I keep my hair short and I rub this in everyday.  it&#x27;s got a great smell, manily, not boy bandish.</li>
            <li> Cherries is what you&#x27;ll think at first. It&#x27;s sweet, but not the kind of sweet that turns your stomach. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;cheap sweet&amp;#34;. Totally manly. Makes your hair feel amazing! The bottle states it&#x27;s good for knocking off old dandruff and keeping your scalp healthy. I can say that I have no little white flakes on my shoulders today! It&#x27;s not greasy like some tonics feel. Not a strong alcohol scent like Vitalis. It&#x27;s very pleasant and light. A scent you could put on your hair after first washing it. It will be a regular staple in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price or the smell. Was interested in that old-time barbershop smell and was not disappointed. Works great. Smells great. Lasts the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the scalp, but smells like cough syrup.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I used to use hair tonic from Japan - it&#x27;s a lot more common there and they make some very good products. After trying the Eau de Quinine, though, there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going back because the fragrance is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me dispel some myths about this product. I have a very fair complexion and light, graying hair. The dark purple color of the tonic looks like it ought to stain my skin or hair, but it doesn&#x27;t at all. Weird--the color just disappears. After showering, I splash a little in my palm and spread it in my hands, then rub it into my hair. I can then use a hair dryer (or not). The result is that my very fine hair stays in place a noticeably better than if I didn&#x27;t use a tonic. You can&#x27;t tell by looking at me that I put anything in my hair at all. It&#x27;s not oily, greasy, or sticky in the least, and my hair is every bit as soft as if I didn&#x27;t use the tonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that is great, but what really hooked me on this tonic was the fragrance. It was a little strange at first; it hit me like a chemical kind of smell when I splashed it on, but then it dissipated very quickly. It soon took on a more organic fragrance, subtle and delicious--almost like the flavor of black currants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soon began to really like it and now I truly look forward to using it every morning. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect that. Others have described it as addictive and I would have to say they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li> On first sniff, I thought I was going to hate this.  Very flowery, perfume-y type aroma.  But, once I put it in my hair, I was sold.  The scent fades to a pleasant masculine, indescribable aroma that lingers.  More importantly, it made my hair feel and look fantastic!  When I use it, it gives my hair a healthy sheen, and makes it incredibly soft... perhaps the softest I&#x27;ve ever felt.  Not sure why other reviewers are complaining of greaser levels of shine; as I get very little added shine from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could have one complaint, it&#x27;s that this has very little if any holding properties.  I find myself taking a tiny amount of pomade/paste, and thinning it out with this Quinine tonic before rubbing it in.  Works very well for me.  I&#x27;d love this at triple the price, so this is a steal!  Try it, you won&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I like a refreshing scalp tonic and it got mostly good reviews. Boy did I regret it!! When it first arrived, I was a bit baffled by the looks but decided to give it a try anyway so opened it and squirted a little into my hand. Hardly EVER have I smelled anything worse! The smell is totally nauseating; my pillow reeked of the stuff, even though I had only put the tiniest amount on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely NOT recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> The smell of this tonic is spicy rose, grapefruit-ish. Some might call the smell medicine-ish, but i would not characterize it that way. It is dark red (think red wine) and might make light blonde or white hair take on a very faint red color.  Feels good on the scalp. Dries to a faint smell fairly fast.  The tonic has no oil so it dries without residue.The end smell is somewhat similar to the regular clubman pinaud aftershave.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of making your hair do what you want. It also does a great job of attracting bugs. You&#x27;ll be touching your hair a lot - because every bug within a 5 mile radius will be visiting Club Eau de Quinine...</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite hair tonic of the Clubman line. The medicinal smell is nice, but not overpowering once the tonic is worked into the hair. I always feel as though my hair, what little I have left, has a better texture and appearance on the days I use this hair tonic as opposed to the days I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is great, it makes my hair feel clean and invigorates my scalp and love the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have much hold so I use it with Tres Flores for hold and shine. It won&#x27;t dry out your hair like hair spray or gel.</li>
            <li> After seeing a recent auction of John Wayne&#x27;s dopp bag and enclosed grooming products, I noticed a half-empty bottle of Eau De Quinine within it. I decided to give it a try and bought a bottle. I am happy to report that it does an excellent job of taming flyaway stray hairs without being greasy looking/feeling or sticky. It is lightly scented and won&#x27;t clash with any fragrances you decide to wear. If you wear your hair short and want to keep it looking neat and groomed throughout the day, this is for you. Another plus is that it&#x27;s easy to comb through, no matter how many times a day you need to comb your hair.</li>
            <li> Love it to finish off a shower.  Not greasy, feels great on my scalp.  Seems to soften my hair a bit, and She  likes it.</li>
            <li> I like the odor but, my wife finds it repulsive. Oh well, other than that I feel it does just fine by me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what expected..</li>
            <li> no more dandruff and it has nice aroma.  will buy more in the future.  overall a fine and affordable product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this was shipped to me, since I never ordered it. I must&#x27;ve pressed the wrong key in my iPad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big &#x27;Clubman fan, but I would say I like this product from them the least.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, as it&#x27;s strong and a little unusual, and I don&#x27;t like the color, as I&#x27;m a little weirded out by the dark color when the excess goes through my fingers into the sink.  I only use this when I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll see a lot of people in the office, and I don&#x27;t plan on buying this again.  There are better Clubman products for me to choose.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good get the green heirs hair tonic that&#x27;s the one.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in line without feeling all gunned up. Interesting scent. Wears off fairly quickly, but comes back as a hint every now and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like old school barber shop smells and products, and this without a doubt fits my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is light brown with a tendency towards red highlights from my grandmother&#x27;s side. This product seems to make them a bit more gingery in the New Orleans sunlight.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesnt have the hold I want for a hair tonic but I do like the scent. A handful of this stuff with a couple drops of glycerine added works well as an aftershave/cologne.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pinaud Clubman aftershave and Jeris hair tonic for a while now.  Both very manly barbershop smells.  To me, those are 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eau De Quinine is definitely a different scent than those.  It is lighter and almost has a powder-like smell.  It is hard to explain.  I am happy to have bought it and I will use it.  Don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again though.  Just my personal preference.</li>
