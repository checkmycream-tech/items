            <li>It smells super good too!</li>
            <li>The jwoww 50x was amazing and had my skin a nice mocha color</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain it was 2 bottles for 50$ so actually amazing for the price my salon goes 95$ per a bottle</li>
            <li>To be honest, I went tanning yesterday, and i didnt use my lotion and my legs</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>As for the lotion, it doesn&#x27;t smell nice at all.</li>
            <li>This product gave me a beautiful golden glow after one use.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it browns so quickly!!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product feels very silky and the bronzers work great.  </li>
            <li>just make sure</li>
            <li>Beautiful glowing color and soft skin!</li>
            <li>The lotion rubs in easily, and the fragrance is a lovely tropical scent, that leaves your skin smelling fresh after tanning.</li>
            <li>You notice a huge difference after ONE tanning session.</li>
            <li>clean, fresh..girly.</li>
            <li>First time I can remember having a good natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion it makes my skin shimmer and really accelerated my tan.</li>
            <li>But other then that for the price was insanely happy....</li>
            <li>I get super tan in no time and it doesn&#x27;t feel all greasy on your skin like some of the lotions do.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this lotion for sure!</li>
            <li>I look amazing naked and that&#x27;s all that counts.</li>
            <li>I honestly feel like I get the same results with the jwoww</li>
            <li>I have used many tanning lotions in the past year from sinfully black to jwoww products I have always had the best luck with jwoww....</li>
            <li>I may as well go back to good old Coppertone.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me.  </li>
            <li>Cant wait to try this out, these were much cheaper than buying them at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Love how dark I get, and it doesnt turn you Orange!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain did see a little color after the first use but not like a huge difference</li>
            <li>u actually wait 2-3 hrs before showing to get the full results only reason</li>
            <li>The black was ok not as happy with the results this JOWOWW ONE AND DONE wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li>Product works much more slowly than promised.  </li>
            <li>I do make sure to wipe lotion off my hands before i go into the tanning bed though, typically with a dry cloth.  </li>
            <li>My whole body is really dark....</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product! Excellent Seller!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks....My whole body is really dark....EXCEPT MY LEGS! I only use this on my legs and thighs....To be honest, I went tanning yesterday, and i didnt use my lotion and my legs finally look  a shade darker....Does anyone else have this problem....I am not sure how i feel about product...I won&#x27;t be buying again...I am going to order the Designer Skin BLACK 20x .....</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this lotion. It smells great. I like the tanning and bronzing results that I get with using Jwoww. I would definitely recommend this lotion for sure!</li>
            <li> Love the color I get from this lotion!  I was noticably darker within a couple sessions. I didn&#x27;t end up streaky, orange, or have stained hands.  I do make sure to wipe lotion off my hands before i go into the tanning bed though, typically with a dry cloth.  The scent is good, and I don&#x27;t feel that its too incredibly overpowering though I prefer the scent of Kardashian GlowTM \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; Bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls at the salon rave about this product and I could definitely tell why! Beautiful glowing color and soft skin!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BOMB diggity! I have gone through 3 bottles of this miracle tanning lotion. You notice a huge difference after ONE tanning session. It smells super good too! Not like that nasty coconut tanning smell. It smells clean, fresh..girly. I love it. I will be buying another batch of two soon. I don&#x27;t ever want anything different! Love how dark I get, and it doesnt turn you Orange!</li>
            <li> Biggest plus to this product is that It doesn&#x27;t  leave that &amp;#34;tanning bed smell&amp;#34;.  This product feels very silky and the bronzers work great.  No orange color or streaks.  I will definately be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used many tanning lotions in the past year from sinfully black to jwoww products I have always had the best luck with jwoww.... I have used the jwoww 50x the bronzer and then jwoww black &amp; now this one.... The jwoww 50x was amazing and had my skin a nice mocha color and I can promise you I am whiter then a piece of paper... The black was ok not as happy with the results this JOWOWW ONE AND DONE wasn&#x27;t bad I can&#x27;t complain did see a little color after the first use but not like a huge difference I honestly feel like I get the same results with the jwoww 50x honesty I can&#x27;t complain it was 2 bottles for 50$ so actually amazing for the price my salon goes 95$ per a bottle so I was happy... Product actually smells fruity and I Cnt complain even tan nice just make sure u actually wait 2-3 hrs before showing to get the full results only reason I have it four stars was because I expected to come out the bed black after the first use as some people said it would.... But other then that for the price was insanely happy....</li>
            <li> As advertised, after 3rd use white skin no more!!!! First time I can remember having a good natural looking tan. After trying a few products I am sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> Great value and price, smells nice works well for an even tan.  No streaking or staining.  Very pleased with the produce would buy again.</li>
            <li> Seller is receiving 5 stars due to the fact that item was on time &amp; as described. As for the lotion, it doesn&#x27;t smell nice at all. I still smell like a tanning bed after tanning &amp; I have not noticed any great differences in my tan. No instant color for me. Depends on what you like.</li>
            <li> My ass is so brown that I was threatened to be hauled off back to Mexico. I look amazing naked and that&#x27;s all that counts.</li>
            <li> I received these 3 days after ordering.. Cant wait to try this out, these were much cheaper than buying them at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> this is the best i have very fair skin and it helps keep me from being burnt and the smell of it is awesome. can still feel the lotion when i shower this is a 5 star plus plus</li>
            <li> This product gave me a beautiful golden glow after one use. The lotion rubs in easily, and the fragrance is a lovely tropical scent, that leaves your skin smelling fresh after tanning. This one is my newest favorite!</li>
