            <li>Hey guys, this is the best smelling perfume in the whole world.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li>Your wife or girlfriend will wear it and you will love it when they do.</li>
            <li>Dune is one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>always my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is not as potent as it used to be.</li>
            <li>Shame on Dior for changing such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Another favorite fragrance</li>
            <li>I have been using Dune for over 20 years and love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I have been using this cologne for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I love dune Love the fragrance for years</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com and ordered it.</li>
            <li>More importantly my husband loves it on me.</li>
            <li>otherwise fine.</li>
            <li>I repurchased a bottle directly through Dior and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s certainly true.</li>
            <li>was told by a passerby that  I smelled good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>Smells like it always has and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>One spray of fragrance lasted six hours and smelled great, so I think I got the real deal not a fake as some other reviews have thought and was not dark colored but light amber as it should be.</li>
            <li>yes, it was exactly the product I had ordered.</li>
            <li>I am most definitely not suggesting that it is deliberate on the part of Amazon;  Perhaps the supplier did not provide the real thing?  </li>
            <li>Although it was packaged perfectly when I opened the box I noticed the color was dark, which I thought was strange because Dune is not real dark in color.</li>
            <li>Wish I would&#x27;ve spent the money on an older, authentic one.</li>
            <li>This is definitely NOT the original formula.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t notice a \\&quot;new newer weaker\\&quot; formula from my Dior purchase that some people are posting on these reviews.</li>
            <li>okay but different than my other bottle and</li>
            <li>love this but is really hard to find .</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much and it last all day.</li>
            <li>With everything being green today, this is not the same formula I wore in the 90&#x27;s, but a water down version of a good perfume in it&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li>I read other reviews about how the newer Dune is not the same as the older one</li>
            <li>not long lasting.</li>
            <li>The top is a little hard to get off,</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU BUY PERFUME--SUPPLIER WILL NOT TAKE BACK ANY.  I was disappointed with this product, it did not have the same fragrance as that in stores.  Like it was watered done--a lot and lost its scent within a short period of time..  i WOULD NEVER BUY IT AGAIN NOR ANY PERFUMES ORDERED ONLINE.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this perfume and thought I would treat myself for Christmas. One spray of fragrance lasted six hours and smelled great, so I think I got the real deal not a fake as some other reviews have thought and was not dark colored but light amber as it should be.</li>
            <li> Hey guys, this is the best smelling perfume in the whole world. Your wife or girlfriend will wear it and you will love it when they do.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume!!</li>
            <li> Dune is one of my favorite fragrances. I discovered iron a cruise just after it came out and have used everyday since then.There are only about five perfumes I can wear and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> always my favorite. perfect</li>
            <li> The smell is not like it used to be</li>
            <li> I have loved Dune fragrance for years and this Eau de Toilette makes me happy. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Smells like it always has and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seems to &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; when I spray it on.  Other posters said similar things.  I decided to try it anyway.  Smells okay but different than my other bottle and not long lasting.</li>
            <li> The top is a little hard to get off, otherwise fine. I did have my credit card # stolen, hopefully not from this transaction.</li>
            <li> .Took a chance when I chose this fragrance however it has a great smell, Would give it as a gift to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about how the newer Dune is not the same as the older one and it&#x27;s certainly true. It is not as potent as it used to be. Dune used to only require one little squirt to last all night. With this one I use 4 or 5 squirts and the scent is gone in an hour. I&#x27;m SO disappointed. Wish I would&#x27;ve spent the money on an older, authentic one. Shame on Dior for changing such a wonderful product! I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love Dune!!!! It&#x27;s no longer in department stores in Maryland and its very hard to find. Then we I do, you need to donate a limb to buy it. It&#x27;s very strong so you don&#x27;t need much and it last all day. More importantly my husband loves it on me.</li>
            <li> Another favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> arrived on time and very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Dune via my husband&#x27;s account.  I have been using Dune for over 20 years and love the scent.  Although it was packaged perfectly when I opened the box I noticed the color was dark, which I thought was strange because Dune is not real dark in color. When I sprayed it on me it didn&#x27;t smell right, not even like a weak version of Dune.  I gave it a couple of days and tried it a few more times, but was not happy with the way it smelled so I returned it.  I repurchased a bottle directly through Dior and I am very pleased. Also, I don&#x27;t notice a \\&quot;new newer weaker\\&quot; formula from my Dior purchase that some people are posting on these reviews.</li>
            <li> The only perfume my wife will wear.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERYBODY ASK E WHAT I AM WEARING WHEN I USE IT&lt;br /&gt;UNFORGETABLE&lt;br /&gt;PRECIOUS&lt;br /&gt;DELIGHT&lt;br /&gt;FINE&lt;br /&gt;EXQUISIT&lt;br /&gt;BEAUTIFUL</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product.  I do wish however that I could afford another bottle, the scent is grand!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for more than 20 years.  The bottle I purchased smells nothing like the Dune I have purchased all of those years.  I think if could be counterfeit.  I am most definitely not suggesting that it is deliberate on the part of Amazon;  Perhaps the supplier did not provide the real thing?  In any event, it is useless to me.</li>
            <li> With everything being green today, this is not the same formula I wore in the 90&#x27;s, but a water down version of a good perfume in it&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> yes, it was exactly the product I had ordered.</li>
            <li> Great perfume. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere for it and found it on Amazon.  Used to wear it years ago.  Love it!</li>
            <li> love this but is really hard to find . was told by a passerby that  I smelled good enough to eat. made me feel good.</li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT the original formula.</li>
            <li> I love dune Love the fragrance for years</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for years and love it !!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Dune cologne for about 15 years, but recently I have had trouble finding it. I was pleased to find it on Amazon.com and ordered it. It is a smaller bottle than I usually buy, but the same cologne.</li>
