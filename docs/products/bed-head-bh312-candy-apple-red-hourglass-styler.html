            <li>Gives perfect curls and helps boost your hair volume.</li>
            <li>Works great and makes wonderful curls.</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this curl rod!</li>
            <li>I love this wand!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this wand for almost 4 years, and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This hourglass curling wand is amazing.</li>
            <li>The hour glass shape gives a nice anchor to stop hair from sliding off the wand.</li>
            <li>curls are very bouncy and the result is beautiful Botticelli curls.</li>
            <li>The included glove just created a bunch of static every time I grabbed a section of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have longer hair (and maybe longer arms), this wand would probably work better for you.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Nothing but compliments :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>This gave me beautiful curls along with a 2nd degree burn, the size of a quarter on my arm.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I love this it works great, heats up pretty fast, the curls hold well until the next day they turn to a more wavy curl.</li>
            <li>This is a nice curling iron that is high quality and priced right.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product as it was my first curling wand.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and gets very hot!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and gets very hot.</li>
            <li>It did get really hot and what curls I could get in lasted over a day.  </li>
            <li>That makes it much easier!</li>
            <li>It gets REALLY hot.</li>
            <li>It does get extremely hot, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend holding your hair on it for any longer than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>you are new to wands, get a wand that has a cool tip on it.  </li>
            <li>I have really think hair</li>
            <li>It only has one heat setting, and takes some practice to get a nice curl, but it&#x27;s much easier to use than a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li>Use the glove until you&#x27;re comfortable enough without one.</li>
            <li>My hair is just past shoulder length, fine, and pretty straight.  </li>
            <li>Makes beautiful curls that are loose on the ends and tight in the middle.</li>
            <li>I did not think I was going to like this curler at first because it did not have the usual clamp, but after a few tries I quickly mastered the art of making a great curl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hair incompetent and this is soo simple and easy to use!</li>
            <li>this is not like a normal curling wand, I was using it on my hair and it did nothing that me roundbrushing my hair and using my flat iron couldnt do.</li>

            <li> Since the barrel is so long, when I would move the iron from arm to arm, I would keep burning my forearm or wrist.  </li>

            <li> All my hair, no matter if it was a large or small section of hair, would slide down the barrel to the center so the taper/hourglass feature was lost.  </li>

            <li> Curls usually fall out of her long heavy hair with in the hour with a regular iron.</li>
            <li> so it was kinda pointless in my opinion but other people may like it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste Ezra money FYI!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use the glove cause its kinda hard to feel what im doing with it on</li>
            <li> However, I am not thrilled with having to use the glove to prevent burns.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and my curls hold all day (and even longer if I don&#x27;t wash them out).</li>

            <li> I was really excited about this product as it was my first curling wand.  My hair is just past shoulder length, fine, and pretty straight.  However, I found that this wand was really hard to use.  All my hair, no matter if it was a large or small section of hair, would slide down the barrel to the center so the taper/hourglass feature was lost.  Since the barrel is so long, when I would move the iron from arm to arm, I would keep burning my forearm or wrist.  The included glove just created a bunch of static every time I grabbed a section of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have longer hair (and maybe longer arms), this wand would probably work better for you.  It did get really hot and what curls I could get in lasted over a day.  I suggest using Kevlar sleeve + heat protective glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to wands, get a wand that has a cool tip on it.  That makes it much easier!</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, every time I tried to wrap my hair around it I was unsuccessful and got burnt.....wish I could return it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 2 years now. It is amazing! I love it! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it has no heat settings. It gets REALLY hot.</li>
            <li> this is not like a normal curling wand, I was using it on my hair and it did nothing that me roundbrushing my hair and using my flat iron couldnt do.</li>
            <li> This is the only curling iron that will work on my hair. I have really think hair so it&#x27;s hard to curl. But not with the curly pop it takes about 10 minutes! I love it</li>
            <li> Walmart has it for 18$  don&#x27;t waste Ezra money FYI!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I love this! It got here before the estimated arrival date. It heats up very quickly. It came with a glove like it stated. Makes beautiful curls that are loose on the ends and tight in the middle. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Works great and makes wonderful curls. The last on my daughter all day. Curls usually fall out of her long heavy hair with in the hour with a regular iron.</li>

            <li> I love this wand! I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair. Heats up fast and gets very hot! Use the glove, they give it to you for a reason (:</li>
            <li> This hourglass curling wand is amazing. It arrived earlier than expected. It heats up fast and gets very hot. Personally I don&#x27;t prefer to use the glove because it tends to make my hair frizzy. I spray my hair with a heat protecting spray then section off my hair. I chose bigger sections of hair to get a fuller look. The hour glass shape gives a nice anchor to stop hair from sliding off the wand. Gives perfect curls and helps boost your hair volume. Be cautious of this getting to close to your fingers or head, it took me a couple sections to get used to the shape.</li>
            <li> mehhhhh - describes this</li>
            <li> I did not think I was going to like this curler at first because it did not have the usual clamp, but after a few tries I quickly mastered the art of making a great curl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls are very bouncy and the result is beautiful Botticelli curls.

            <li> This gave me beautiful curls along with a 2nd degree burn, the size of a quarter on my arm. Please wear a jacket and gloves while using this product.</li>
