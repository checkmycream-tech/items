            <li>It absorbs really nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or looking shiny.  </li>
            <li>but the rose made some peri-oral dermatitis pop up.</li>
            <li>I love Dr H, was thrilled to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>Very smooth and nourishing.</li>

            <li>I use it on top of the moisturizing mask twice a day.</li>

            <li>but I think it makes me look better...  </li>
            <li>and I love it too.  </li>
            <li>Some of them are using Dr. Hauschka and love it the glow of the oil in there skin as I  love it in my too.</li>
            <li>love that  </li>
            <li>Love this item...</li>
            <li>Nice, light and I like the balance it leaves the ph of my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this day cream.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Quince Day Cream calmed my skin and within hours my skin felt so much better.  </li>
            <li>where as my skin was on the healthy but dull/dry side before, it is now nothing but dewy (but not oily) and perky with or without make-up.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I still have most of the tube.</li>
            <li>Dr. Hauschka Quince Day Cream is a wonderful daily cream to wear under foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love to  support a company that is aligned with the environment and health.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, I was expecting it to work wonders</li>
            <li>Love love love the Hauschka line.</li>
            <li>All Dr Hauschka products are fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly potent and smells very sweet and floral.</li>
            <li>Smells good, feels good, and most definitely does the job!  </li>
            <li>Worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li>easily-</li>
            <li>I thought this facial lotion would be more moisturizing based on the descriptions, but I wasn&#x27;t really happy with it.</li>
            <li>For anyone with very mild skin problems, this product probably works well</li>
            <li>I have not had any recent breakouts and everyone has commented on how beautiful and radiant my skin is.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>The cream is light and hydrating.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment as it keeps my skin healthy.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the formula as much as I do the Rose Day Cream</li>
            <li>and my client and friends always wants to know what kind of skin care products I used.  </li>
            <li>It fells light on my skin.</li>
            <li>and the smell is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Most products of this brand smell amazing because they use so many different plants and their aromas.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use products that are free of toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Finally, this is the best cream for us who have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am so excited about this that I had to share with you...  </li>
            <li>It broke me out in my t zone with cystic type acne which I rarely get since I am 40!</li>
            <li>It sets into the skin quickly and is lighter formula, the press and roll technique is quick and easy with this cream.</li>
            <li>, it was much more smooth and didn&#x27;t break out as much.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moistured and clean.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been making the switch to more natural products in my shower and skin care regime and i&#x27;d been hearing internet whispers of this magical cream</li>
            <li>Very light, yet very mosterizing cream.  </li>
            <li>Try this only if you love very strong and lingering floral scents.</li>
            <li>This day cream is really nice for my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>I also love that this cream comes in a tube instead of a bottle or jar, making traveling with it very convenient.</li>
            <li>The quince day cream is super moisturizing but does not leave skin greasy.</li>
            <li>I love that this is all natural and will continue to use the Quince Day cream.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in and there is no greasy or oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I moved to a remote area and wasn&#x27;t able to get Hauschka products easily</li>
            <li>This product is natural, wonderful, and helps me look younger than my actual age.</li>
            <li>I really went out on a limb buying this full sized product before trying it, but I wanted a cream I could use at night (even though it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Day Cream&amp;#34;) because I use the Normalizing Day Oil during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it for the pleasure of it occasionally, and it makes my face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, supple...</li>
            <li>Knowing how natural it is is important to me as well.</li>
            <li>First time on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference in my skin within the first week or two</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m male and love Dr. Hauschka.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this cream is the opposite of most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>the expiration date first.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the smell at first, but got used to it.</li>
            <li>This product has actually healed my face for the first time in 2 years!!!  </li>
            <li>All the Dr. Hauschka products have a similar fresh scent, which I personally enjoy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve shopped around on this a bit and pricewise, Amazon&#x27;s current price of about $30 is about as good as you can get without getting stuff that is expired; if you find a cheaper price on the &#x27;net verify</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product in a long time, but am glad that I am using it again.  </li>
            <li>My skin (and body) was under a great amount of stress due to long illness.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but worth it if you are allergic to many things as I am.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry/sensitive/combination skin in the winter and summer and have breakouts all the time with scaring.</li>
            <li>Price from amazon is reasonable and cheaper than a whole foods, etc.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon really saves me money.</li>
            <li>My face is so much smoother and healtier looking.  </li>
            <li>i was blown away by how much of a noticeable difference it made in just one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over time it&#x27;s helped calm my sensitive skin and even out skin tone.</li>
            <li>and it has an almost earthy smell which didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>the scent is strong (sweet but also a little earthy)</li>
            <li>love the sharp quince smell.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I started to dread putting the cream on my face and finally decided to toss it because it just wasn&#x27;t worth the agony.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t like thicker moisturizers because they sit on your skin like a waxy layer.</li>
            <li>but you live and learn.</li>
            <li>at least my face isn&#x27;t as bright red!</li>
            <li>I like the way this product makes my skin feel very soft and</li>
            <li>This has just the right balance of moisturizer for my moderately dry skin as well.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combo skin that breaks out</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized without having a greasy complexion.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>I have issues with both sensitive skin and being sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li>59 years old...</li>
            <li>and i could see how it might be a turn off, but i don&#x27;t mind it and it doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m 28 and have good skin, on the sensitive side (i&#x27;m a redhead), occasional breakouts, sometimes gets a little dried out, but</li>
            <li>Also for dry winter skin, this day cream works really well</li>
            <li>It is light enough where I don&#x27;t feel greasy and a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal with tendency to be dry if I don&#x27;t take care daily.  </li>
            <li>Instead of smelling rose-like or sweet, it smells slightly pungent, like bitter orange or,</li>
            <li>/&gt;it does cost a pretty penny, but a little goes a long way, and in my experience there is no product that delivers even a modicum of miracle that this cream does.</li>

            <li> This product is natural, wonderful, and helps me look younger than my actual age.</li>
            <li> I really went out on a limb buying this full sized product before trying it, but I wanted a cream I could use at night (even though it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Day Cream&amp;#34;) because I use the Normalizing Day Oil during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it for the pleasure of it occasionally, and it makes my face feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth, supple...</li>
            <li> Knowing how natural it is is important to me as well.</li>
            <li> First time on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference in my skin within the first week or two</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and love Dr. Hauschka.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this cream is the opposite of most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> the expiration date first.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell at first, but got used to it.</li>
            <li> This product has actually healed my face for the first time in 2 years!!!  </li>
            <li> All the Dr. Hauschka products have a similar fresh scent, which I personally enjoy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve shopped around on this a bit and pricewise, Amazon&#x27;s current price of about $30 is about as good as you can get without getting stuff that is expired; if you find a cheaper price on the &#x27;net verify</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product in a long time, but am glad that I am using it again.  </li>
            <li> My skin (and body) was under a great amount of stress due to long illness.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but worth it if you are allergic to many things as I am.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry/sensitive/combination skin in the winter and summer and have breakouts all the time with scaring.</li>
            <li> Price from amazon is reasonable and cheaper than a whole foods, etc.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon really saves me money.</li>
            <li> My face is so much smoother and healtier looking.  </li>
            <li> i was blown away by how much of a noticeable difference it made in just one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over time it&#x27;s helped calm my sensitive skin and even out skin tone.</li>
            <li> and it has an almost earthy smell which didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> the scent is strong (sweet but also a little earthy)</li>
            <li> love the sharp quince smell.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I started to dread putting the cream on my face and finally decided to toss it because it just wasn&#x27;t worth the agony.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t like thicker moisturizers because they sit on your skin like a waxy layer.</li>
            <li> but you live and learn.</li>
            <li> at least my face isn&#x27;t as bright red!</li>
            <li> I like the way this product makes my skin feel very soft and</li>
            <li> This has just the right balance of moisturizer for my moderately dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combo skin that breaks out</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized without having a greasy complexion.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> I have issues with both sensitive skin and being sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li> 59 years old...</li>
            <li> and i could see how it might be a turn off, but i don&#x27;t mind it and it doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 28 and have good skin, on the sensitive side (i&#x27;m a redhead), occasional breakouts, sometimes gets a little dried out, but</li>
            <li> Also for dry winter skin, this day cream works really well</li>
            <li> It is light enough where I don&#x27;t feel greasy and a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal with tendency to be dry if I don&#x27;t take care daily.  </li>
            <li> Instead of smelling rose-like or sweet, it smells slightly pungent, like bitter orange or,</li>
            <li> /&gt;it does cost a pretty penny, but a little goes a long way, and in my experience there is no product that delivers even a modicum of miracle that this cream does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker then I normally like</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is high, but I have discovered a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not sure if expired product is a problem--I have used some Hauschka products (not this one) a year past expiration and they seemed fine.</li>
            <li> it felt a little a little heavy/oily the first couple of days, but once my skin adjusted to it...</li>
            <li> Love Dr Hauschka skin care products, just wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin supple all day long!</li>
            <li> It was way too oily for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> but if you have more severe skin issues due to crazy hormones (as I do), I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if I am less wrinkly, because I don&#x27;t have any big wrinkles yet (denial!!),</li>
            <li> At the present, I use Quince Day Cream for a little change</li>
            <li> Quince Day cream to heavy for me is the only question&lt;br /&gt;(Face</li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> Thick enough for a mature gal&#x27;s skin, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> We are exposed to so much environmental stress through poor diet choices, overwork, and toxic chemical stress in our environment.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> occasionally feels a bit heavy, but absorbs well in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve learned that a very little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a glow i do not see with other products!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with slight dryness around my mouth and this works well.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing away half of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years now.</li>
            <li> if you do decide to go for it and find it to be too heavy or oily, i would encourage you to stick with it for a week or two to give your skin time to adjust and rebalance, and then reassess.</li>
            <li> It feels thick going on, but sinks and doesn&#x27;t leave you skin looking oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;bought one tube as a gift for someone who knows the product and has used it in the past</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and doing an online search for &amp;#34;best organic moisturizers&amp;#34; I was convinced this moisturizer was going to be a miracle worker, but unfortunately I was left underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> This is a thick creme out of the tube, so it works well as a primer for foundation too...</li>
            <li> I had switched to a less expensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle.</li>
            <li> And it is hard to find a product that does that!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon than it is in stores!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted, but can kick it anytime...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference in the softness of her</li>
            <li> Even like the weird scent.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> I was also using products with caustic/dangerous ingredients which exacerbated my skin condition even though some were very expensive remedies.  </li>
            <li> Horrific pain and sleepless nights have become the norm.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Dr. Hauschka products never disappoint</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. Very smooth and nourishing. I had switched to a less expensive moisturizer. Just switched back and I could see the difference in my skin almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon than it is in stores!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have very dry/sensitive/combination skin in the winter and summer and have breakouts all the time with scaring. After using this twice a day for about a month, my skin is glowing!! I have not had any recent breakouts and everyone has commented on how beautiful and radiant my skin is. I love that this is all natural and will continue to use the Quince Day cream. Very happy customer!:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hauschka products for over 6 years and love the Quince Day Cream.  It soaks right in and there is no greasy or oily feeling. I have combination skin with slight dryness around my mouth and this works well.  I moved to a remote area and wasn&#x27;t able to get Hauschka products easily so I am very happy about the subscription service.</li>
            <li> Always come back to this moisturizer- it&#x27;s great in the winter. I have sensitive combo skin that breaks out easily- but never have that problem with this product. Even like the weird scent. Price from amazon is reasonable and cheaper than a whole foods, etc.</li>
            <li> I have not yet received the product, but all Dr Hauschka is excellent&lt;br /&gt;is Quince Day cream to heavy for me is the only question&lt;br /&gt;(Face Cream liquid has always been the choice the choice for my skin type)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought one tube as a gift for someone who knows the product and has used it in the past</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells just lovely,&amp; I love the way my skin feels when I use it. Soft, smooth, supple...</li>
            <li> nice smell and feel good</li>
            <li> I thought this facial lotion would be more moisturizing based on the descriptions, but I wasn&#x27;t really happy with it. I&#x27;ll probably try it again for the summertime, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my face from drying out in the winter.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! It leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized without having a greasy complexion.  I WILL be buying this again!</li>
            <li> The cream is light and hydrating.  It does not feel oily or look shiny.  The SPF works well for several hours.</li>
            <li> Stands up to expectations!</li>
            <li> I thought the product was overpriced for what it delivered. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin but it did not improve my skin&#x27;s texture or complexion whatsoever. After reading reviews and doing an online search for &amp;#34;best organic moisturizers&amp;#34; I was convinced this moisturizer was going to be a miracle worker, but unfortunately I was left underwhelmed. For anyone with very mild skin problems, this product probably works well but if you have more severe skin issues due to crazy hormones (as I do), I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I use it on top of the moisturizing mask twice a day. Worth the investment as it keeps my skin healthy. And it is hard to find a product that does that!</li>
            <li> I tried to like this cream and it was not working. It was way too oily for my dry skin. I ended up throwing away half of it. Such a waste.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very light, yet very mosterizing cream.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s the best cream I ever used and it smells so good. Even though it isn&#x27;t cheap, I&#x27;m addicted to it.</li>
            <li> This feels and smells so good on my skin.  It absorbs really nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or looking shiny.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> This cream may work ok, but the scent is unbearable. It&#x27;s incredibly potent and smells very sweet and floral. I started to dread putting the cream on my face and finally decided to toss it because it just wasn&#x27;t worth the agony. Try this only if you love very strong and lingering floral scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years now. I love it. It makes my skin glow! A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Just adore this day cream.  Smells good, feels good, and most definitely does the job!  I&#x27;m addicted, but can kick it anytime... Ha!</li>
            <li> I really went out on a limb buying this full sized product before trying it, but I wanted a cream I could use at night (even though it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Day Cream&amp;#34;) because I use the Normalizing Day Oil during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have normal-to-oily skin and this moisturizer is WONDERFUL. It is light enough where I don&#x27;t feel greasy and a little bit goes a very long way. Plus, it smells FANTASTIC. I love going to bed smelling like this. It&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer for me.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of this cream.  A little goes a long way.  Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my complexion. Knowing how natural it is is important to me as well. The price on Amazon really saves me money. I&#x27;ve used this product for over 3 years and am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> so light and smells great</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this cream. First time on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! I tried to go back to using something else but the results were dissapointing so I will continue use this. I also use the toner and milk cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Finally, this is the best cream for us who have VERY sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t like the formula as much as I do the Rose Day Cream but the rose made some peri-oral dermatitis pop up. This formula I have no problem with and it smells lite and calming. It sets into the skin quickly and is lighter formula, the press and roll technique is quick and easy with this cream. Great for all seasons!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this cream.  A little pricey, but worth it if you are allergic to many things as I am.  Also, they don&#x27;t test on animals which is a must for me.  I can&#x27;t tell if I am less wrinkly, because I don&#x27;t have any big wrinkles yet (denial!!), but I think it makes me look better...  at least my face isn&#x27;t as bright red!</li>
            <li> Excellent, I have been using Dr. Hauschka Day Cream for seven years after using Lanc√¥me since the age of 17, but when I discover this product I feel in love.  At the present, I use Quince Day Cream for a little change and I love it too.  My skin is normal with tendency to be dry if I don&#x27;t take care daily.  I will be 60 next year and my client and friends always wants to know what kind of skin care products I used.  Some of them are using Dr. Hauschka and love it the glow of the oil in there skin as I  love it in my too.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite face moisturizers! It&#x27;s light and perfect for summer use. All the Dr. Hauschka products have a similar fresh scent, which I personally enjoy. I will continue with this product.</li>
            <li> love the sharp quince smell.  works very nicely on my skin.  occasionally feels a bit heavy, but absorbs well in just a few minutes.  not greasy.  love that  it&#x27;s natural.  The toner is amazing as well!</li>
            <li> Love this item... rec&#x27;d on time</li>
            <li> I have issues with both sensitive skin and being sensitive to scents.  This has just the right balance of moisturizer for my moderately dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> Nice, light and I like the balance it leaves the ph of my skin.</li>
            <li> I do like this product. However it doesn&#x27;t last long. I did notice a difference in my skin within the first week or two, it was much more smooth and didn&#x27;t break out as much.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. I especially like it for day time use.  It&#x27;s tinted and I like that because I don&#x27;t wear make up in the summer.  It fells light on my skin.</li>
            <li> Also for dry winter skin, this day cream works really well and the smell is fantastic.  Most products of this brand smell amazing because they use so many different plants and their aromas.  This tube lasts from 3 to 6 months depending on how often you use it, and I find that a good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> this products is good</li>
            <li> I love this day cream.  It provides moisture to my skin without leaving it feeling or looking oily.  It also has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Have used it for almost two weeks. So far so good. It keeps my skin moistured and clean. The tube seems like will last for a couple months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and love Dr. Hauschka.  I use the cleansing cream, clarifying toner, daily eye cream, quince day cream and recently the rejuvenation serum.  Takes an extra 5 minutes in the morning.  Great products with results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product in a long time, but am glad that I am using it again.  My face is so much smoother and healtier looking.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love Dr H, was thrilled to find it on Amazon, it&#x27;s not the easiest product to find.  Thick enough for a mature gal&#x27;s skin, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy.  Perfect weight, skin feels plump and moist afterwards.</li>
            <li> My skin (and body) was under a great amount of stress due to long illness.  Horrific pain and sleepless nights have become the norm.  I was also using products with caustic/dangerous ingredients which exacerbated my skin condition even though some were very expensive remedies.  Now comes the solution!  Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s Quince Day Cream calmed my skin and within hours my skin felt so much better.  I am now on day 7, and my skin is so different.  My face is healed.  This product has actually healed my face for the first time in 2 years!!!  I have tried many expensive products, none have worked.  I am so excited about this that I had to share with you...  59 years old... combo (aging) skin.</li>
            <li> The scent of this cream is the opposite of most moisturizers. Instead of smelling rose-like or sweet, it smells slightly pungent, like bitter orange or, well, quince!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is high, but I have discovered a little goes a long way. You need just a tiny spurt of it, maybe 1/4 inch per day. I use it for the pleasure of it occasionally, and it makes my face feel very smooth. A 40-something  forme smoker  friend has used it regularly for years and I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic difference in the softness of her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shopped around on this a bit and pricewise, Amazon&#x27;s current price of about $30 is about as good as you can get without getting stuff that is expired; if you find a cheaper price on the &#x27;net verify the expiration date first. I&#x27;m actually not sure if expired product is a problem--I have used some Hauschka products (not this one) a year past expiration and they seemed fine.</li>
            <li> what the whaaaaat?? where has this stuff been all my life?! i&#x27;m 28 and have good skin, on the sensitive side (i&#x27;m a redhead), occasional breakouts, sometimes gets a little dried out, but otherwise no complaints. i&#x27;ve been making the switch to more natural products in my shower and skin care regime and i&#x27;d been hearing internet whispers of this magical cream so i decided to give it a shot.  it felt a little a little heavy/oily the first couple of days, but once my skin adjusted to it...i basically felt like a supermodel from the neck up. i now have a radiant, jennifer aniston glow all the time. where as my skin was on the healthy but dull/dry side before, it is now nothing but dewy (but not oily) and perky with or without make-up. i was blown away by how much of a noticeable difference it made in just one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does cost a pretty penny, but a little goes a long way, and in my experience there is no product that delivers even a modicum of miracle that this cream does. the scent is strong (sweet but also a little earthy) and i could see how it might be a turn off, but i don&#x27;t mind it and it doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions with my sensitive skin. if you do decide to go for it and find it to be too heavy or oily, i would encourage you to stick with it for a week or two to give your skin time to adjust and rebalance, and then reassess. sometimes it takes a while for your skin&#x27;s oil production and other natural processes to adjust so be patient!</li>
            <li> I like the way this product makes my skin feel very soft and a glow i do not see with other products!</li>
            <li> Beautiful moisturizer. I love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all. I still have most of the tube. It broke me out in my t zone with cystic type acne which I rarely get since I am 40! I should have sent it back but you live and learn.</li>
            <li> Dr. Hauschka Quince Day Cream is a wonderful daily cream to wear under foundation. It is light and has a great fragrance.  Amazon made it simple to order and receive regular future shipments at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It feels thick going on, but sinks and doesn&#x27;t leave you skin looking oily. Over time it&#x27;s helped calm my sensitive skin and even out skin tone. The smell is subtle. Worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li> This product is natural, wonderful, and helps me look younger than my actual age. It&#x27;s important to use products that are free of toxic chemicals. We are exposed to so much environmental stress through poor diet choices, overwork, and toxic chemical stress in our environment. If you want to look and feel your best start your day with this beautiful formula that will nourish your skin.  I love to  support a company that is aligned with the environment and health.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Kirsten Sage</li>
            <li> Love Dr Hauschka skin care products, just wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I was expecting it to work wonders but it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a little thicker then I normally like and it has an almost earthy smell which didn&#x27;t bother me too much. I didn&#x27;t feel like it keep my face hydradrted thoroughout the day either!&lt;br /&gt;I guess my hunt continues for the perfect moistizer!</li>
            <li> This is a thick creme out of the tube, so it works well as a primer for foundation too... Normally I don&#x27;t like thicker moisturizers because they sit on your skin like a waxy layer. But this stuff doesn&#x27;t feel overbearing at all --it absorbs and does it&#x27;s job. Didn&#x27;t like the smell at first, but got used to it.</li>
            <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive but I&#x27;ve learned that a very little goes a long way.  Perfect moisturizer for my skin, alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li> This day cream is really nice for my sensitive combination skin. This is my 3rd tube! I also love that this cream comes in a tube instead of a bottle or jar, making traveling with it very convenient.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by Dr Hauschka</li>
            <li> Love love love the Hauschka line. The quince day cream is super moisturizing but does not leave skin greasy. The smell is yummy too.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer!  It keeps my skin supple all day long! One of the best products on the market. Happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> All Dr Hauschka products are fantastic!</li>
