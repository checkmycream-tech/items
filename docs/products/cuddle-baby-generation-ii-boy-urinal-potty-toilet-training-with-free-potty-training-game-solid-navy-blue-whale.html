            <li>The bows are huge and look great on a baby infant.</li>
            <li>I belive I will be removing at lease 2 of the flowers and attaching my own clips so that I may use them.</li>
            <li>Nice variety of color</li>
            <li>I had to go buy my own and fix them.</li>
            <li>A nice product for the price paid</li>
            <li>They truly come in handy.</li>
            <li>Although they are glued kind of crappy</li>
            <li>Packaging kind of smells.</li>
            <li>cute good quality headbands</li>
            <li>so I ever bought the elastic and took the flower off these and made my own and on some I just glued some felt on the Seam</li>
            <li>Cute and good quality.</li>
            <li>The headbands are nice.</li>
            <li>Great value, but a lot of the bows are significantly lighter/darker in color than the coordinating band.</li>
            <li>Beautiful hair peaches, we&#x27;ll worth the money...</li>
            <li>These are great for quick pictures and headbands you wont care if you lose or ruin.  </li>
            <li>They have a lot of lint on them out of the package and a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>I love them and just know they are going to be so precious on the baby when she arrives!</li>
            <li>but honestly the blue/green bow would have been so cute if it was one color...</li>
            <li>The fabric is good and these do not look cheap at all.</li>
            <li>Good quality, and fun!</li>
            <li>great fit and comfortable for baby.</li>
            <li>great deal head bands are great the flower makes alittle red mark on her head</li>
            <li>Cute headbands but have a very strong chemical smell.</li>

            <li>Love the head bands.  </li>
            <li>I always get lots of compliments! :)</li>
            <li>The headbands are so I cute,</li>
            <li>I just wish there were more colors</li>
            <li>We love them.</li>
            <li>cute gift for my grandaughter</li>
            <li>and she doesnt even relize when ones on like most she will rip off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this point I dont think I will need to order any more headbands I got all colors needed.  </li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping &amp; great quality.</li>
            <li>So I am somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li>They would probably work better for 4 months plus because of size (not how stretchy it is but size of flower and headband).</li>
            <li>I love all of the colors, and the lace band doesn&#x27;t rub, or constrict my baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Cute colors.</li>
            <li>They look cute on but they leave marks on her head.</li>

            <li>I think it would have looked better if the &amp;#34;flower&amp;#34; was sewn on vs glued.</li>
            <li>These headbands are adorable.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look or feel cheap and the colors are nice.  </li>
            <li>i love them</li>
            <li>My bundle came with 2 purples and no brown which is not a problem because I love purple</li>
            <li>I would buy more</li>

            <li>cute and fun to put on</li>

            <li>I absolutely love these head bands for my 11month old daughter!</li>
            <li>as said before there are so much pretty in person than online!</li>
            <li>These look great on my little baldy granddaughters.</li>
            <li>worth the miney.</li>
            <li>I tried one out on my 3 month old son :) they are not flimsy and look like they will hold up with wear</li>
            <li>They are not too big and they stay nicely on babys head.</li>
            <li>So cute and soft.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine that these 10 hairbands will be worth waiting a month to receive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really that big a deal though, and the rest of the colors match perfectly.  </li>
            <li>it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I love these headbands for my 2yr old girl.</li>
            <li>But I guess they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Worth what you pay forsure</li>
            <li>worth it</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I just love putting them on our month old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make them more classy.</li>
            <li>I have ordered things like this and always have to spend time reworking the bows because they are so smashed from poor packaging, but though these were smashed into a bag, the flowers perked right up, beautifully!</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>I am so upset right now</li>
            <li>Right now they take the place of hair</li>
            <li>It is right under the flower and is a bet of a bump.</li>
            <li>Ok now there is a major thing about these headbands that you need to know before buying.</li>
            <li>they come in a very cute pink bag that zips close</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for my daughter since she was new born up until 5 months and they still fit ..</li>
            <li>They are great, really soft material and wide</li>
            <li>these are very well made and looked adorable on my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>These are very soft and comfortable</li>
            <li>They fit well and are very soft.  </li>
            <li>And they shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>They are so pretty and comfortable for my 3 month old!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>These fit my almost 2 month old baby.</li>
            <li>As her hair gets longer, I am just going to remove the flowers from the bands that are mismatched and hot glue them to a barrette instead.</li>
            <li>Ended up buying more bows from another seller for yellow.</li>
            <li>Not only are these headbands cute, they are comfy on our baby girl&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more and I will recommend it too.</li>
            <li>She has received many compliments and several mothers have asked where they can buy them.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for any age, it says Baby Headbands, but they fit my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>The flowers are big but they look really adorable on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sad about wasting the money.  </li>
            <li>look like they bunched up a piece of lace and hot glued it to felt</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for some that are well made, durable, elegant and will last you years...</li>
            <li>I am so pleased, and would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Headband are cute, not all the same size</li>
            <li>I love the different colors.</li>
            <li>It took exactly 2 weeks and 3 days to get here.</li>
            <li>Wide waffle headband, really nice colors.</li>
            <li>had to wash because they smelled funny</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really pretty</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>These are pretty but they do leave marks on the babies head where the band comes together</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re hot glued on, rather than having a clip.</li>
            <li>Simple yet cute.</li>
            <li>Will probably buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast too.  </li>
            <li>I see her being able to wear these for a long time.</li>
            <li>They are very cute, not cheap at all.  </li>
            <li>Two of the ten headbands have flowers that clash with the headband covers (orange &amp; coral and teal &amp; seafoam), so I really can&#x27;t use those, but the other 8 are perfect and the low price makes up for it.  </li>
            <li>You can see the glue from certain angles</li>
            <li>Now the ones that are different colors actually look super cute with certain outfits that may have both hues in them.</li>
            <li>It was beautiful just some flowers didnt match color of hair band and the shipping was a little long bur for the price</li>
            <li>Nice fluffy (not flat and cheap looking)</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews more carefully before deciding to buy from this seller - 360 Dealz.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I only give 3 stars because they attatched the flowers on the seem (to hide the seem) but it leaves a bbc.co ig mark on ny baby&#x27;s head which I dont like I cant imagine that being comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Which was a lot better than what the expected delivery date said(June</li>
            <li>Better quality than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Had to redo the whole thing</li>
            <li>It is very noticeable but</li>
            <li>The quality of the product APPEARS to be very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Got them sooner than expected too :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are made very well....</li>
            <li>Very bight colors</li>
            <li>My 2 month old granddaughter looks adorable in them and will wear them for quite some time and there are such a variety of colors.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast and products were very nearly as pictured - except</li>
            <li>Not only are the crochet headbands soft, but the flowers themselves are very soft, and great not only for my newborn but also my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>The flowers are bigger than I had originally thought.</li>
            <li>Yes, some of the colors of the flowers do not exactly match the bands but the colors still look cute together.</li>
            <li>The other bows are ok-</li>
            <li>The orange and the aquamarine are the bow and the ribbon are a little bit different, but I have to say that they&#x27;re beautiful in general!!...</li>
            <li>These headbands are VERY well made, High quality and every color is covered.</li>
            <li>My niece said she really liked them because the band was loose enough</li>
            <li>They do pull easily so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li>Personally I didn&#x27;t like the way that looked and think if it doesn&#x27;t match correctly it would be better paired with a white headband or something.  </li>
            <li>My older girl didn&#x27;t seem to notice, so maybe her hair make it</li>
            <li>The head band part is so stretchy that it actually fit around my head, but shrinks back down to fit a baby head.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend ?</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the purchase of these hair bows.  </li>
            <li>A little more then a month.</li>
            <li>I love them for my little one.</li>
            <li>They stretch so much they can be worn by girls are old as eleven.</li>
            <li>These came as expected, and fit well on my baby.</li>
            <li>Stretchy enough to fit my 7 month old and eight year old granddaughters.</li>
            <li>These headbands are cute but the flowers are enormous, way too big for my 7month old grandchild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let you know how they fit in a few months ;)</li>
            <li>The other 6 are fine.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft and came way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>The quality is nice and they fit on the baby&#x27;s head perfectly without being too tight and leaving horrible red marks.</li>
            <li>As a new mom, headbands were not on my radar.  </li>
            <li>These are nothing what i expected the bows on the band don&#x27;t look the same in person also most of the band and the bows on them don&#x27;t match</li>
            <li>However, the estimated delivery time was stated very clearly beforehand</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to mind the feel, as they&#x27;re very soft and stretchy.</li>
            <li>very Soft</li>
            <li>But they withstand my 6 month old tugging and chewing on them!</li>
            <li>My 4 year old looks ah-mazing!</li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was two of them the color of the flower didn&#x27;t match the color of the headband exactly.  </li>
            <li>The colors i recieved are not the exact same as picture.</li>
            <li>And they did have a strong plastic smell to them from the wrapper they were in which was a little off putting</li>
            <li>They are really cute for a short period of time or when they get a little older.</li>
            <li>the cream colored one, the headband part is more white and the flower part is dark cream.</li>
            <li>The fabric flower is large, but it&#x27;s not too big for her head.</li>
            <li>A little huge for my infants head</li>
            <li>they are perfectly put together, not cheap looking at all like I was sadly kinda expecting..</li>
            <li>It would be a bit much for a 3 month old or younger though.</li>
            <li>my 6yrs old niece uses it too fits her too.</li>
            <li>Soft material doesn&#x27;t leave an indentation on my babies head.</li>
            <li>its soft and elastic to avoid tightening.</li>
            <li>I AM SURROUNDED BY RANGING FROM 3 MONTHS TO 12 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>I had completely forgotten about them by the time they got to me.</li>
            <li>soft elastic and will not squish baby head.  </li>
            <li>My 4 month old&#x27;s head is in the70th percentile</li>
            <li>Bought these for my 6 month old daughter.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 3mth old granddaughter...</li>
            <li>so she didn&#x27;t feel it, or babies skin is just sensitive.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft, she doesn&#x27;t mind them at all.</li>
            <li>Got these for my 6 month old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Has held up well with my 6 month old.</li>
            <li>Wow ...great price.</li>
            <li>6 months old.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised how well they were made....</li>
            <li>not as soft as they appear.</li>
            <li>Out if the ten headbands I received 3/4 of them can&#x27;t really be used.</li>
            <li>I love the colors, except the blue flower is on a greenish blue headband and I would prefer they match each other.</li>
            <li>You can easily use them for a few years!</li>
            <li>Not tight or restrictive in anyway.</li>
            <li>Some bows were a different color than the actual head band and the hot glue</li>
            <li>I was a bit scared that because I paid very little for these that they would be cheap but not at all.</li>
            <li>I really despised the packaging, it was a thin plastic that ripped easily</li>
            <li>Very cute but uncomfortable for Baby because the plCe where the ribbon is connected it push is in the babyes head and leave marks.</li>
            <li>so no good never buy these any more</li>
            <li>Item is exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>The flower is light pink, and the band is a darker pink).</li>
            <li>My baby is not due until sept</li>
            <li>These are so sweet for little girls and props for photography!</li>
            <li>Shipping takes a little while but worth the wait for the deal.</li>
            <li>These little hair ribbons were so worth the money.</li>
            <li>They are soft and extra stretchy</li>
            <li>Once the package shipped today I saw that it was COMPLETELY and DRASTICALLY different.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the same with these but were pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>These are the only ones my 2 year old granddaughter keeps on her head.....</li>
            <li>The bands are snug for baby and stretchy enough for them to be worn by young girls.</li>
            <li>Some are just different shades of the same color, like the tan flower has a dark brown headband and the light blue flower has a medium blue headband.</li>
            <li>Tha light pink is a little off</li>
            <li>Looks ridiculous on my baby since they are so huge</li>
            <li>The light blue with the seafoam does look a little odd and clashes quite a bit but for the price this is well worth it, especially since I can&#x27;t even find a 2 pack of these at any store for less than 5$.</li>
            <li>For instance, the pink headband has a darker pink flower and light pink band...</li>

            <li> but honestly the blue/green bow would have been so cute if it was one color...</li>

            <li> They would probably work better for 4 months plus because of size (not how stretchy it is but size of flower and headband).</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors, and the lace band doesn&#x27;t rub, or constrict my baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Cute colors.</li>
            <li> They look cute on but they leave marks on her head.</li>

            <li> looks good on my 2 year old.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love these head bands for my 11month old daughter!</li>
            <li> as said before there are so much pretty in person than online!</li>
            <li> These look great on my little baldy granddaughters.</li>
            <li> worth the miney.</li>
            <li> I tried one out on my 3 month old son :) they are not flimsy and look like they will hold up with wear</li>
            <li> They are not too big and they stay nicely on babys head.</li>
            <li> So cute and soft.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that these 10 hairbands will be worth waiting a month to receive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really that big a deal though, and the rest of the colors match perfectly.  </li>
            <li> it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands for my 2yr old girl.</li>
            <li> But I guess they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Worth what you pay forsure</li>
            <li> worth it</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I just love putting them on our month old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make them more classy.</li>
            <li> I have ordered things like this and always have to spend time reworking the bows because they are so smashed from poor packaging, but though these were smashed into a bag, the flowers perked right up, beautifully!</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I am so upset right now</li>
            <li> Right now they take the place of hair</li>
            <li> It is right under the flower and is a bet of a bump.</li>
            <li> Ok now there is a major thing about these headbands that you need to know before buying.</li>
            <li> they come in a very cute pink bag that zips close</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for my daughter since she was new born up until 5 months and they still fit ..</li>
            <li> They are great, really soft material and wide</li>
            <li> these are very well made and looked adorable on my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> These are very soft and comfortable</li>
            <li> They fit well and are very soft.  </li>
            <li> And they shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> They are so pretty and comfortable for my 3 month old!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> These fit my almost 2 month old baby.</li>
            <li> As her hair gets longer, I am just going to remove the flowers from the bands that are mismatched and hot glue them to a barrette instead.</li>
            <li> Ended up buying more bows from another seller for yellow.</li>
            <li> Not only are these headbands cute, they are comfy on our baby girl&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more and I will recommend it too.</li>
            <li> She has received many compliments and several mothers have asked where they can buy them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for any age, it says Baby Headbands, but they fit my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> The flowers are big but they look really adorable on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sad about wasting the money.  </li>
            <li> look like they bunched up a piece of lace and hot glued it to felt</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for some that are well made, durable, elegant and will last you years...</li>
            <li> I am so pleased, and would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Headband are cute, not all the same size</li>
            <li> I love the different colors.</li>
            <li> It took exactly 2 weeks and 3 days to get here.</li>
            <li> Wide waffle headband, really nice colors.</li>
            <li> had to wash because they smelled funny</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really pretty</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> These are pretty but they do leave marks on the babies head where the band comes together</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hot glued on, rather than having a clip.</li>
            <li> Simple yet cute.</li>
            <li> Will probably buy more in the future.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast too.  </li>
            <li> I see her being able to wear these for a long time.</li>
            <li> They are very cute, not cheap at all.  </li>
            <li> Two of the ten headbands have flowers that clash with the headband covers (orange &amp; coral and teal &amp; seafoam), so I really can&#x27;t use those, but the other 8 are perfect and the low price makes up for it.  </li>
            <li> You can see the glue from certain angles</li>
            <li> Now the ones that are different colors actually look super cute with certain outfits that may have both hues in them.</li>
            <li> It was beautiful just some flowers didnt match color of hair band and the shipping was a little long bur for the price</li>
            <li> Nice fluffy (not flat and cheap looking)</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews more carefully before deciding to buy from this seller - 360 Dealz.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I only give 3 stars because they attatched the flowers on the seem (to hide the seem) but it leaves a bbc.co ig mark on ny baby&#x27;s head which I dont like I cant imagine that being comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Which was a lot better than what the expected delivery date said(June</li>
            <li> Better quality than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Had to redo the whole thing</li>
            <li> It is very noticeable but</li>
            <li> The quality of the product APPEARS to be very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Got them sooner than expected too :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are made very well....</li>
            <li> Very bight colors</li>
            <li> My 2 month old granddaughter looks adorable in them and will wear them for quite some time and there are such a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast and products were very nearly as pictured - except</li>
            <li> Not only are the crochet headbands soft, but the flowers themselves are very soft, and great not only for my newborn but also my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> The flowers are bigger than I had originally thought.</li>
            <li> Yes, some of the colors of the flowers do not exactly match the bands but the colors still look cute together.</li>
            <li> The other bows are ok-</li>
            <li> The orange and the aquamarine are the bow and the ribbon are a little bit different, but I have to say that they&#x27;re beautiful in general!!...</li>
            <li> These headbands are VERY well made, High quality and every color is covered.</li>
            <li> My niece said she really liked them because the band was loose enough</li>
            <li> They do pull easily so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t like the way that looked and think if it doesn&#x27;t match correctly it would be better paired with a white headband or something.  </li>
            <li> My older girl didn&#x27;t seem to notice, so maybe her hair make it</li>
            <li> The head band part is so stretchy that it actually fit around my head, but shrinks back down to fit a baby head.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend ?</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the purchase of these hair bows.  </li>
            <li> A little more then a month.</li>
            <li> I love them for my little one.</li>
            <li> They stretch so much they can be worn by girls are old as eleven.</li>
            <li> These came as expected, and fit well on my baby.</li>
            <li> Stretchy enough to fit my 7 month old and eight year old granddaughters.</li>
            <li> These headbands are cute but the flowers are enormous, way too big for my 7month old grandchild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you know how they fit in a few months ;)</li>
            <li> The other 6 are fine.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft and came way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> The quality is nice and they fit on the baby&#x27;s head perfectly without being too tight and leaving horrible red marks.</li>
            <li> As a new mom, headbands were not on my radar.  </li>
            <li> These are nothing what i expected the bows on the band don&#x27;t look the same in person also most of the band and the bows on them don&#x27;t match</li>
            <li> However, the estimated delivery time was stated very clearly beforehand</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to mind the feel, as they&#x27;re very soft and stretchy.</li>
            <li> very Soft</li>
            <li> But they withstand my 6 month old tugging and chewing on them!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old looks ah-mazing!</li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was two of them the color of the flower didn&#x27;t match the color of the headband exactly.  </li>
            <li> The colors i recieved are not the exact same as picture.</li>
            <li> And they did have a strong plastic smell to them from the wrapper they were in which was a little off putting</li>
            <li> They are really cute for a short period of time or when they get a little older.</li>
            <li> the cream colored one, the headband part is more white and the flower part is dark cream.</li>
            <li> The fabric flower is large, but it&#x27;s not too big for her head.</li>
            <li> A little huge for my infants head</li>
            <li> they are perfectly put together, not cheap looking at all like I was sadly kinda expecting..</li>
            <li> It would be a bit much for a 3 month old or younger though.</li>
            <li> my 6yrs old niece uses it too fits her too.</li>
            <li> Soft material doesn&#x27;t leave an indentation on my babies head.</li>
            <li> its soft and elastic to avoid tightening.</li>
            <li> I AM SURROUNDED BY RANGING FROM 3 MONTHS TO 12 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li> I had completely forgotten about them by the time they got to me.</li>
            <li> soft elastic and will not squish baby head.  </li>
            <li> My 4 month old&#x27;s head is in the70th percentile</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 6 month old daughter.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 3mth old granddaughter...</li>
            <li> so she didn&#x27;t feel it, or babies skin is just sensitive.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft, she doesn&#x27;t mind them at all.</li>
            <li> Got these for my 6 month old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Has held up well with my 6 month old.</li>
            <li> Wow ...great price.</li>
            <li> 6 months old.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how well they were made....</li>
            <li> not as soft as they appear.</li>
            <li> Out if the ten headbands I received 3/4 of them can&#x27;t really be used.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, except the blue flower is on a greenish blue headband and I would prefer they match each other.</li>
            <li> You can easily use them for a few years!</li>
            <li> Not tight or restrictive in anyway.</li>
            <li> Some bows were a different color than the actual head band and the hot glue</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared that because I paid very little for these that they would be cheap but not at all.</li>
            <li> I really despised the packaging, it was a thin plastic that ripped easily</li>
            <li> Very cute but uncomfortable for Baby because the plCe where the ribbon is connected it push is in the babyes head and leave marks.</li>
            <li> so no good never buy these any more</li>
            <li> Item is exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> The flower is light pink, and the band is a darker pink).</li>
            <li> My baby is not due until sept</li>
            <li> These are so sweet for little girls and props for photography!</li>
            <li> Shipping takes a little while but worth the wait for the deal.</li>
            <li> These little hair ribbons were so worth the money.</li>
            <li> They are soft and extra stretchy</li>
            <li> Once the package shipped today I saw that it was COMPLETELY and DRASTICALLY different.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the same with these but were pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> These are the only ones my 2 year old granddaughter keeps on her head.....</li>
            <li> The bands are snug for baby and stretchy enough for them to be worn by young girls.</li>
            <li> Some are just different shades of the same color, like the tan flower has a dark brown headband and the light blue flower has a medium blue headband.</li>
            <li> Tha light pink is a little off</li>
            <li> Looks ridiculous on my baby since they are so huge</li>
            <li> The light blue with the seafoam does look a little odd and clashes quite a bit but for the price this is well worth it, especially since I can&#x27;t even find a 2 pack of these at any store for less than 5$.</li>
            <li> For instance, the pink headband has a darker pink flower and light pink band...</li>
            <li> They are soft and do not leave marks on baby&#x27;s head like other headbands.....</li>
            <li> They did not leave marks on my 8 month old like other head bands I wish they had these in every color</li>
            <li> Others are completely different colors, like the grey flower has a white headband.</li>
            <li> (Examples: off-white flower on white band, brown flower on black band, hot pink flower on a darker pink</li>
            <li> The only downside is that if you leave it on too long, it will leave a mark on the baby&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I purchased these bands thinking I would get them exactly as pictured with the thick head band.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of baby accessories for dirt cheap on Ebay, and 90% of the time I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the quality of the items I receive</li>
            <li> but the only summery colors were the blue and pink and purple, the rest were just OK&lt;</li>
            <li> but beware of the long wait.</li>
            <li> I was amazed to this item and it has been shipped it earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t let my baby have them on for too long</li>
            <li> a few of the headbands (blue, pink, and brown) were two different shades of the same color (ex:</li>
            <li> I ordered for my daughter who is expecting a girl (obviously), so thought it would be a one of those little extra items.  </li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t dry them).  </li>
            <li> The only issue with these are that the green and orange headbands have a slightly different band color from the flower part.  </li>
            <li> and it is single ply</li>
            <li> So i picked these up on a whim after spending $$$ on single headbands at department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wanting the dark red for a picture dress</li>
            <li> I wish they a bit bigger so they would not be so tight.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I received 2 red instead of one of the pinks...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the teal colored band is a slightly different color than the bow.</li>
            <li> The headband and the fluff on it are not matching colors.</li>
            <li> Came just as expected.</li>
            <li> Packaging was extremely minimal.</li>
            <li> They are really closed to the pics.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected..</li>
            <li> That alone would not really bother me.</li>
            <li> The glue started coming off after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> The blue flower came in with a green band</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and the stretchiness is very loose so as to not hurt baby&#x27;s head.....</li>
            <li> Some bows had a rough spot where attached to the headband.</li>
            <li> all the color choices can definitely match up to any outfit!&lt;br /&gt;There not huge on her head like some</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d need to buy yellow, green, orange ones for the other 25%.</li>
            <li> that I didn&#x27;t perform my due diligence with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Order took a few long weeks to arrive but, still within the ETA.</li>
            <li> either like I seen some other reviews say.</li>
            <li> it did leave a small mark from the flower, but we only had it on for a while.  </li>
            <li> They smelled weird at first.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are not exact matches.</li>
            <li> The only color I&#x27;m missing!</li>
            <li> Other then the noodles&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner then expected!</li>
            <li> These headbands are thick, soft, and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> cheap thing, color not match the pic, too bad</li>
            <li> Is just what I expected !!</li>
            <li> My little girl isn&#x27;t due until July</li>
            <li> Not super fancy as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> so I guess I am stuck with one less headband than I paid for.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re even cuter than the pic shows and they aren&#x27;t tight on my baby&#x27;s head so no indentation when removed</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re not too tight around my daughter&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> They stretch well and don&#x27;t feel tight when wearing yet</li>
            <li> They were a bit to tight even for my newborn,  </li>
            <li> and I couldnt wait to buy little girl accessories for her</li>
            <li> (I have little boys) when they came</li>
            <li> Well made .great for photo props or any little girl</li>
            <li> but if you just want a headband to go with 75% of your little girl&#x27;s wardrobe</li>
            <li> I GAVE THE LITTLE NEICE</li>
            <li> and I feel like it could scratch my little girl.</li>
            <li> Oh and don&#x27;t let your little one play with the band, her little fingers can pull it apart.</li>
            <li> Poorly made, that they did not use the same color material for both.</li>
            <li> and it does not match at all, also the aqua flower is on a mint green band.  </li>
            <li> A few came out of the package already falling apart.</li>
            <li> I just wish they had green.</li>
            <li> Well-made and the don&#x27;t leave uncomfortable marks on my 6 month old&#x27;s forehead.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that one of the pink ones came broken (it is unraveling).  </li>
            <li> I received these in 2 weeks, unlike previous reviews where people sai they waited a month!</li>
            <li> The estimated delivery date is now mid to late JUNE!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for my little girl to be born and wear them!</li>
            <li> and my baby isn&#x27;t small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> is small lil bag</li>
            <li> I am not actually sure if it was the washer or the dryer that ruined the glue.  </li>
            <li> The flower accent was a random color that didn&#x27;t match the actual headband it was attached to.</li>
            <li> The band joins under the bow but the seam presses IN rather than OUT (which would have been the smart way to make it) and leaves horrible red marks in my kid&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Ultimately the product is a little cheesy, made poorly</li>
            <li> I washed them with dreft soap on delicate and they did not get ruined like others do.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have waited for a few weeks to receive items in the past.</li>
            <li> Wish they also has a black one!!!</li>
            <li> no good they stuck</li>
            <li> Gray bows, which really annoyed me.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that one of the bows I got was a green band and a blue bow, making it impossible to wear and match anything.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect match on colors for each of them</li>
            <li> But needless to say, we are still using the ones that didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> SORRY.</li>
            <li> Looks weird.</li>
            <li> They also have a weird smell.</li>
            <li> it looks silly</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong in buying this pkg.</li>
            <li> I will be unable to use it.  </li>
            <li> The headbands are also very very thin, something I could have made by cutting out a strip of material... there is no hem</li>
            <li> Other bands leave nasty marks</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s definately not what is pictured here and it was a disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> . :-(</li>
            <li> Now I hate the idea of putting something like that on my baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Omg these product come nasty whit all bunch</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They are great, really soft material and wide so it doesn&#x27;t dig into my daughters head.</li>
            <li> They are super cute and all but but one is holding up, it started to unravel. But they withstand my 6 month old tugging and chewing on them!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! Took awhile, almost 2 months!!! But exactly what I wanted ! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Cute!!! Colors to match most outfits and they will fit for a while! Good deal!</li>
            <li> These bows look sooo adorable on my daughter.</li>
            <li> Great deal, and they&#x27;re super cute.</li>
            <li> I loved these headbands so much! They were perfect for my daughter from about 1-6 months.</li>
            <li> love the headbands&lt;br /&gt;colors are as they show&lt;br /&gt;and best of all i got the item in one week  **WOW**&lt;br /&gt;love the fabric, they don&#x27;t look cheap</li>
            <li> These were so nice and decently priced I&#x27;ve bought them 3 times for different baby shower gifts! Shipping takes a little while but worth the wait for the deal.</li>
            <li> Great quality, fits my newborn perfectly and will for months to come with how stretchy they are</li>
            <li> These baby headbands are super adorable and a huge plus that it comes in a variety of colors.  The only downside is that if you leave it on too long, it will leave a mark on the baby&#x27;s head.  These fit my almost 2 month old baby.</li>
            <li> cheap thing, color not match the pic, too bad</li>
            <li> My 4 year old looks ah-mazing! Love it!</li>
            <li> My aunt said they were super cute on her baby girl.</li>
            <li> gets the job done, great quality!</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Purchased for my baby niece - they look gorgeous and she loves them...</li>
            <li> Great quality i was very pleased!</li>
            <li> Beautiful,  happy little girl!</li>
            <li> Totally fabulous. Looks even better than on pic. Very well made.</li>
            <li> They had a bit of a funky smell to them when they arrive so I let them soak in the sink with some detergent and that did the trick! Great headbands - nice and stretchy so they don&#x27;t cut off circulation like some headbands do!</li>
            <li> so cute and great colors went with everything</li>
            <li> These are great I put them on my baby all the time very good price and lots of colors</li>
            <li> THESE ARE ADORABLE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The flowers are way too big! Looks ridiculous on my baby since they are so huge and my baby isn&#x27;t small. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this was total crap,huge band with crumpled flower</li>
            <li> The flowers are bigger than I had originally thought. Seems very sturdy. I am extremely happy with these, they are so cute!</li>
            <li> The flowers are very cute. But the headbands are a different type of lace - which isn&#x27;t a big deal. However, a big annoyance, the headband colors do not match the color of the flower. (Examples: off-white flower on white band, brown flower on black band, hot pink flower on a darker pink band).&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;They are comfortable for baby and stretchy so they will grow with her. As her hair gets longer, I am just going to remove the flowers from the bands that are mismatched and hot glue them to a barrette instead.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my newest granddaughter.  This colors will be appropriate for any outfit.  Her mother said she wanted to put headbands on her daughter and these will be perfect.</li>
            <li> GREAT product for the price! Very cute too! We receive compliments every time we are out with them. Will re-purchase from the same seller for headbands and hair accessories. Shipping was pretty fast and products were very nearly as pictured - except a few of the headbands (blue, pink, and brown) were two different shades of the same color (ex: The flower is light pink, and the band is a darker pink).</li>
            <li> These are great very easy to match to hust about everything and they have held up great while washing i would buy this again</li>
            <li> Buyer beware. The headband and the fluff on it are not matching colors. For instance, the pink headband has a darker pink flower and light pink band... the cream colored one, the headband part is more white and the flower part is dark cream. Poorly made, that they did not use the same color material for both. It felt like a toddler actually assembled them. The headbands are also very very thin, something I could have made by cutting out a strip of material... there is no hem and it is single ply. :-( Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> They took forever to.  I love the way they look on my baby. The bowes are big but they fit her face nicely. They are soft and extra stretchy so they&#x27;ll grow with her. Some of the flowers are a different color than the bands but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with that. They have a lot of lint on them out of the package and a very strong odor. There is no yellow bow. Ended up buying more bows from another seller for yellow.</li>
            <li> My baby girl looks beautiful love THE quality of it. Love the nice big flower. Simply perfect.. I do recommend the headbands</li>
            <li> Not only are these headbands cute, they are comfy on our baby girl&#x27;s head. Very stylish and lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Love the headbands, very soft and stretchy, lots of colors to match every outfit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hate the lead time on when they actually arrived.</li>
            <li> The bows are so adorable. my child has a little head for 3 months and they fit great! everyone was inpressed when she had them on. worth the miney. We received them sooner than listed.</li>
            <li> is as described. perfect and super cute. seems to be very good quality too, yay we love them.  I would recommend buying these</li>
            <li> I bought this by taking chances and I quickly order more when I received it. My daughter is one month now and she can use it it fits and my 6yrs old niece uses it too fits her too. Love the large flowery embellishment. I will definitely be buying more and I will recommend it too.</li>
            <li> Thers was so many colors for such a great price had one to match every outfit fit wee on babys head and they onl moved when she pulled them but they never hurt her or caused any issues</li>
            <li> Did not come with the colors shown as I was expecting to receive the colors shown to go with my baby different outfits.</li>
            <li> This are very awesomes headbands love them. They are just perfect for my 5 month twin girls nd ofcourse had to buy two set which i dont regret.</li>
            <li> To another one, one day, one sandwich, so cute. I think so well were purchased. I think too low. Haha.</li>
            <li> Love them. Only one thing. The tael or turquoise one does not match well with its flower. Would recommend highly</li>
            <li> Great my little girl loves wearing headbands and bows so these are a wonderful addition to her collection and a great price too</li>
            <li> Darling.  Good selection of colors. They are not showing any wear.</li>
            <li> They are so cute!!! My best friend is having a little girl and I couldnt wait to buy little girl accessories for her (I have little boys) when they came I was so excited to see what they looked like that I tried one out on my 3 month old son :) they are not flimsy and look like they will hold up with wear</li>
            <li> For the price, these are a great value.  Very happy with my purchase!  I would not hesitate to recommend these to others.</li>
            <li> These are so cute! GREAT price, the colors are nice and one for each outfit, I love a huge flower on a tiny baby head so the size was perfect for me. The flowers are about palm sized.</li>
            <li> I recomend they will lokk cute for a baby 3month and older. I love them. They are not too big and they stay nicely on babys head.</li>
            <li> These are some of the most adorable headbands I&#x27;ve ever found, the flower is nice and big. The band fits comfortably around my daughter&#x27;s head. She has received many compliments and several mothers have asked where they can buy them. I would recommend these for any age, it says Baby Headbands, but they fit my 6 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands.  They came just as described and the colors are perfect.  Soft material doesn&#x27;t leave an indentation on my babies head.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a decent price and received it less than 2 weeks after my order.  The headbands and flowers are really cute and include every color shown in the main photo.  Two of the ten headbands have flowers that clash with the headband covers (orange &amp; coral and teal &amp; seafoam), so I really can&#x27;t use those, but the other 8 are perfect and the low price makes up for it.  Would recommend with that caveat in mind.</li>
            <li> These are very cute and I&#x27;m so glad to find somthing in gray.  I would give these 5 stars but 3 of the flowers do not match the bands.  Tha light pink is a little off and I think it will be okay but the coral flower is on an orange band and it does not match at all, also the aqua flower is on a mint green band.  I wish these flowers clipped on so I could move them to a different band to make them work with outfits.  I belive I will be removing at lease 2 of the flowers and attaching my own clips so that I may use them.</li>
            <li> Is just what I expected !! Very nice . Would highly recommend ? Well made .great for photo props or any little girl</li>
            <li> Came just as expected. Great price. Great variety of colors. Good quality item. Stretchy enough to fit my 7 month old and eight year old granddaughters. I&#x27;m very pleased w. this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sisters baby they were PERFECT! So cute and soft. The flowers are big but they look really adorable on.</li>
            <li> I have ordered things like this and always have to spend time reworking the bows because they are so smashed from poor packaging, but though these were smashed into a bag, the flowers perked right up, beautifully! I was very pleased and am ordering again today. Not only are the crochet headbands soft, but the flowers themselves are very soft, and great not only for my newborn but also my 6 year old. If I had one suggestion, its that the aqua flower does not match the seafoam headband that its on. I will be taking it apart and putting that flower on a white band. THank yoU!</li>
            <li> The estimated delivery date was by May 28th when I ordered these headbands on May 14th. Once the package shipped today I saw that it was COMPLETELY and DRASTICALLY different. The estimated delivery date is now mid to late JUNE!! I am so upset right now that I didn&#x27;t perform my due diligence with this purchase. I should have read the reviews more carefully before deciding to buy from this seller - 360 Dealz. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have waited for a few weeks to receive items in the past. However, the estimated delivery time was stated very clearly beforehand so I knew what I was getting myself into. In my opinion this is akin to a bait and switch. Again, I fault myself for not doing my homework before I paid my money. I cannot speak on the quality of the headbands...and won&#x27;t be able to until a MONTH from now. I can&#x27;t imagine that these 10 hairbands will be worth waiting a month to receive. I just purchased the same headbands from a different seller that was prime eligible.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the purchase of these hair bows.  They are absolutely adorable. Great price, and fantastic quality. They had a funky smell to them when I received them but after I washed them they were great!</li>
            <li> I received these in 2 weeks, unlike previous reviews where people sai they waited a month! Great quality, and great price!! Very similar ones sell for $5 each at babies r us.</li>
            <li> These headbands were a great deal for good quality.  I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of baby accessories for dirt cheap on Ebay, and 90% of the time I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the quality of the items I receive but they&#x27;re so cheap I&#x27;m not sad about wasting the money.  I was expecting the same with these but were pleasantly surprised.  These headbands are thick, soft, and fluffy.  They look GREAT on my daughter (provided she doesn&#x27;t immediately pull them off).  The only issue with these are that the green and orange headbands have a slightly different band color from the flower part.  It&#x27;s not really that big a deal though, and the rest of the colors match perfectly.  Packaging was extremely minimal. but what do you expect from $4 with free shipping?  If you&#x27;re on the fence, I urge you to buy these!</li>
            <li> There is a headband to match everything! Not tight or restrictive in anyway. These are the perfect accessory for every little girl. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my granddaughter and i was impressed with the quality and how cute they were for the price.</li>
            <li> So i picked these up on a whim after spending $$$ on single headbands at department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- VALUE - 10 for under $10 bucks!&lt;br /&gt;- Assortment - No duplicates all different colors&lt;br /&gt;- GLUED &amp;#34;flowers&amp;#34; no metal clips to hurt baby&#x27;s head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Assortment - Colors were a bit drab was hoping for bright colors for the summer but the only summery colors were the blue and pink and purple, the rest were just OK&lt;br /&gt;- GLUED &amp;#34;flowers&amp;#34;...look like they bunched up a piece of lace and hot glued it to felt and then hot glued it again to the band, not elegant but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;You much more for what you pay for, its not the greatest quality but if you just want a headband to go with 75% of your little girl&#x27;s wardrobe these is a good value.  You&#x27;d need to buy yellow, green, orange ones for the other 25%. These are great for quick pictures and headbands you wont care if you lose or ruin.  However, if you are looking for some that are well made, durable, elegant and will last you years...these probably wont be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would i buy again? - Heck ya!</li>
            <li> You cannot beat this price for these adorable bows! The quality is nice and they fit on the baby&#x27;s head perfectly without being too tight and leaving horrible red marks.</li>
            <li> I purchased these bands thinking I would get them exactly as pictured with the thick head band. I received a flimsy lace band that slide off my daughter&#x27;s head. I returned them 10 minutes after having received the order.</li>
            <li> I loved these headbands and the colors are so bright and colorful!! I have had so many people ask me where I have gotten them. Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> My friend that I gave them to loves them.</li>
            <li> Slower shipping and one band and flower combo did not match. But for price I am very pleased with these adorable headbands!</li>
            <li> loved the quality and style. looks good on my 2 year old. and they fit and stretch so i will get plenty of use out of them. and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> I loved all the headbands except 2 only because the flower n headband don&#x27;t match exactly but other than that 8 were perfect and can&#x27;t wait to put them on my  baby girl  who will be here in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> As a new mom, headbands were not on my radar.  I quickly realized I wanted them.  I was looking for headbands for a friend of mine who recently had a baby.  These are a grat deal for the money.  I loved the variety of colors and the quantity.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for great headbands for babies or toddlers!</li>
            <li> I ordered these thinking they couldn&#x27;t be that great of quality, but surely out of 10, there would be some that were good.  To my surprise they are all GREAT.  I ordered for my daughter who is expecting a girl (obviously), so thought it would be a one of those little extra items.  I am so pleased, and would definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It was beautiful just some flowers didnt match color of hair band and the shipping was a little long bur for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> These headbands are cute but the flowers are enormous, way too big for my 7month old grandchild. I simply peeled the flowers off, and the headbands are perfect. I&#x27;ll use the flowers for something else.</li>
            <li> Upon ordering this Item (10 pc. Headbands) I was unaware that they are sold and shipped from China.. Order took a few long weeks to arrive but, still within the ETA. Item is exactly as described and expected. And well worth the price and wait! Now, I will not have to worry about finding headbands to match my daughter&#x27;s outfits! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I like it so much for My girls&amp;iexcl; She Loves this when she  have a dress, she is a beautiful girl&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li> I love these headbands for my 2yr old girl. Will definately buy more from Qs. Arrived sooner than promised too. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I loved the colors and the lace and the flowers, I just want everybody to know that these are not just for infants. They stretch so much they can be worn by girls are old as eleven.</li>
            <li> I think these will be very cute on my daughter!  Seem to be well made.  Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was two of them the color of the flower didn&#x27;t match the color of the headband exactly.  The bluish flower is on a bluish/green headband and the coral colored flower was on a regular orange headband.  Personally I didn&#x27;t like the way that looked and think if it doesn&#x27;t match correctly it would be better paired with a white headband or something.  That is just my opinion.  I ended up removing those 2 flowers from their headband and put on a clip on it.  It was a pain to do and tore up the headband but I am going to be able to use the flower which is more what I wanted anyways for some outfits I have purchased for my newborn.  These would be absolutely perfect if they were made as clip on flowers instead of glued to the headband that way you could interchange them.</li>
            <li> Headband are cute, not all the same size but they will work!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter and I absolutely love them.  I washed them with dreft soap on delicate and they did not get ruined like others do. Thank you</li>
            <li> The band joins under the bow but the seam presses IN rather than OUT (which would have been the smart way to make it) and leaves horrible red marks in my kid&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even make them for the price they are being sold for. The head band part is so stretchy that it actually fit around my head, but shrinks back down to fit a baby head. The colors are too cute and the variety will go with any outfit.</li>
            <li> Cutest freaking headbands everrrrrr. Mine came in 3 days I love all the colors.</li>
            <li> Very cute and good quality for price.</li>
            <li> These headbands are so cute. love all the colors, they are well made. Product came in quickly and the  purchase price was fantastic. I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> very good price for all these bands !</li>
            <li> Nice variety of color</li>
            <li> THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL ..LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> These hair bands are just adorable, looks better than in pictures and the colours are just right with lots of options to choose from...its soft and elastic to avoid tightening. ...i will buy them again considering the price has dropped again</li>
            <li> love these headbands!!! They are soft and do not leave marks on baby&#x27;s head like other headbands.....The colors are awesome! :)</li>
            <li> Took over a month to receive these!!!!!! Ridiculous! But I guess they were worth the wait. There Absolutely adorable and perfect for everyday wear and special occasions. I recommend these but beware of the long wait.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my grandbaby and daughter loved them.  The variety of colors was a big hit with both of us.</li>
            <li> No wonder these heads bands where so cheap it took them forever to arrive! A little more then a month. Other then that they are great for the price.</li>
            <li> I love them... They are really closed to the pics. The orange and the aquamarine are the bow and the ribbon are a little bit different, but I have to say that they&#x27;re beautiful in general!!... And I&#x27;m happy!!</li>
            <li> A little huge for my infants head but I guess she will grow into them. Very pleased with this selection.</li>
            <li> These look great on my little baldy granddaughters. They don&#x27;t seem to mind the feel, as they&#x27;re very soft and stretchy. Right now they take the place of hair LOL!</li>
            <li> THESE WERE A GREAT BUY.  I HAVE SO MANY CHILDREN I AM SURROUNDED BY RANGING FROM 3 MONTHS TO 12 YEARS OLD AND THEY ALL HAD THIER HANDS or heads ON ONE OR SEVERAL OF THESE HEADBANDS.....  I GAVE THE LITTLE NEICE THE MAJORITY OF THE LIGHTER COLORS AND THE GOD DAUGHTERS WANTED THE DARKER COLORS TO MATCH THEIR OUTFITS...</li>
            <li> Love them , end of story 👌👌👌 ✌&lt;br /&gt;_👆👆👆👆👆👆👆👆</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than the given date. Beautiful package. Very pretty colors. Lovely on my baby.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite! I love them for my little one.</li>
            <li> Fits Newborn perfect!</li>
            <li> love them and so does my niece</li>
            <li> Really cute, and comfortable. I love the different colors.</li>
            <li> Wish they had more colors and that they all matched the bands to the bows. Some bows were a different color than the actual head band and the hot glue didn&#x27;t last long. I had to go buy my own and fix them. Wish they also has a black one!!!</li>
            <li> Received them today they were as pictured. They fit my 4 yr old daughter perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very cute!!!! Came on time. Everything I expected..</li>
            <li> Very pretty. A nice product for the price paid</li>
            <li> Love the difference in look on the fabric</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re even cuter than the pic shows and they aren&#x27;t tight on my baby&#x27;s head so no indentation when removed</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these headbands and can&#x27;t wait for our daughter to wear them. The colors are vibrant just as pictured and I love how light &amp; stretchy they are!</li>
            <li> I love them the flowers are beautiful. Colors are just like the picture. They did not leave marks on my 8 month old like other head bands I wish they had these in every color I would buy them all.</li>
            <li> Love the head bands.  Shipping was pretty fast too.  I only give 3 stars because they attatched the flowers on the seem (to hide the seem) but it leaves a bbc.co ig mark on ny baby&#x27;s head which I dont like I cant imagine that being comfortable.  They are really cute for a short period of time or when they get a little older.</li>
            <li> Good Product, really pretty! Some colors didnt really match the band, but overall really good headbands! Not bad quality either!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and super cute!! This company has the best bows.  I always get lots of compliments! :)</li>
            <li> Got mine in the mail today. It took exactly 2 weeks and 3 days to get here. Which was a lot better than what the expected delivery date said(June 6th - June 28th) They&#x27;re super cute, soft,and stretchy. My little girl isn&#x27;t due until July so I can&#x27;t review on how they are on baby yet. Yes, some of the colors of the flowers do not exactly match the bands but the colors still look cute together. The light blue with the seafoam does look a little odd and clashes quite a bit but for the price this is well worth it, especially since I can&#x27;t even find a 2 pack of these at any store for less than 5$. The packaging it came in was good. It didn&#x27;t squish none of them up or ruin any of them either like I seen some other reviews say. Worth what you pay forsure (:</li>
            <li> Quality and stuff of these hair-bands is good. It reached on before. time&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to my friend.</li>
            <li> The headbands are so I cute, my friends could.not believe I got them from amazon. They truly come in handy. Now my baby girl has a one for every outfit. And they shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Better quality than I expected.  Nice fluffy (not flat and cheap looking) flowers.  Wide waffle headband, really nice colors.</li>
            <li> Good buy and choices of color</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the material. Look cheap and bunched up.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the headbands. I just wish shipping was quicker. I had completely forgotten about them by the time they got to me.</li>
            <li> Not perfect match on colors for each of them but they are made well enough had to wash because they smelled funny</li>
            <li> Bought this for my lil cousin and it&#x27;s really pretty</li>
            <li> very Soft On Baby&#x27;s Head....Love Them</li>
            <li> These are so cute! I love them and just know they are going to be so precious on the baby when she arrives!</li>
            <li> so bright and cheery.  soft elastic and will not squish baby head.  it did leave a small mark from the flower, but we only had it on for a while.  super nice colors.  and shipped in 10 days.  no rush cause the price was sooo cheap.  worth it</li>
            <li> Great find for the price. Ultimately the product is a little cheesy, made poorly but... Who&#x27;s looking that closely? great fit and comfortable for baby.</li>
            <li> These look great and fit perfect. My 4 month old&#x27;s head is in the70th percentile and these don&#x27;t pinch. They look amazing.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Some of them had a darker shade of a headband and a lighter flower. Which wasn&#x27;t a big deal but I was under the impression from photos that both the flower and headband were the same color. Still super cute and fit my 6 month old perfectly</li>
            <li> I love these! I just wish there were more colors</li>
            <li> Great price, nicely packaged (comes in a pink sack), and adorable. We love them.</li>
            <li> These are perfect and be jazzed up even more very easily if I want to.  But by themselves, they are perfect. The price was great so I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Although they are glued kind of crappy I overall like the product for what I paid.</li>
            <li> This package came with a lot of great colors and the headbands fit my 4 month old well, with room to grow. The only thing is that the blue flower and the blue headband attached to it were different color blues. Still a great package for a great price!</li>
            <li> beautiful style and easy to wear, good quality for the price!</li>
            <li> great for the baby girls</li>
            <li> I was amazed to this item and it has been shipped it earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Some of the bands had snags. They smelled weird at first. Some of the colors are not exact matches. Overall for the price they are fantastic!!</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Ok now there is a major thing about these headbands that you need to know before buying. A lot of them are different color o. The band than on the flower. With that being said-- not all of them are that way. Now the ones that are different colors actually look super cute with certain outfits that may have both hues in them. The light blue is probably the most dramatic but we had a perfect outfit to wear with it and it looked great!</li>
            <li> I like these headbands.  There are multiple colors to go with any outfit.  They did have a smell when I got them, but I threw them in the washer in a laundry bag and have no problem with them.  (I didn&#x27;t dry them).  The only complaint I have is that I received 2 red instead of one of the pinks...but otherwise they are nice and adorable!</li>
            <li> So cute! Gave these out as baby gifts! The parents all loved them and I was able to give a good bundle to each expecting couple!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my 5 year old and they fit her great.</li>
            <li> So adorable! They fit nice, they are gentle for babies head! Colors are perfect they Match all her outfits. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> cute gift for my grandaughter</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair peaches, we&#x27;ll worth the money...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these head bands for my 11month old daughter! There very soft douse not cut into her head like most and she doesnt even relize when ones on like most she will rip off.&lt;br /&gt;Two of these are two colors lile the band is one color and the flower is a different color too adorable.&lt;br /&gt;Plus they come in a very cute pink bag that zips close so I can store them all in there.&lt;br /&gt;Coming from china the delivery was extremely fast compared to most things being shipped from there. I ordered on july 12 and received them today on july 23.&lt;br /&gt;Love all the color choices can definitely match up to any outfit!&lt;br /&gt;There not huge on her head like some are thankfully.&lt;br /&gt;And as said before there are so much pretty in person than online! At this point I dont think I will need to order any more headbands I got all colors needed.  But if i do It will be done threw this company.&lt;br /&gt;And for the price you cant beat this deal they are perfectly put together, not cheap looking at all like I was sadly kinda expecting..</li>
            <li> cute and fun to put on</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping &amp; great quality.</li>
            <li> A few came out of the package already falling apart. But needless to say, we are still using the ones that didn&#x27;t. So I am somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li> Product received to scribed lovely colors perfect fit for infant</li>
            <li> VERY CHEAP. EASILY FREYS APART. SORRY.</li>
            <li> Super cute headbands.  They would probably work better for 4 months plus because of size (not how stretchy it is but size of flower and headband).</li>
            <li> These are great, and so wonderfully priced. The shipping was extremely quick as well. I love all of the colors, and the lace band doesn&#x27;t rub, or constrict my baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Very cute. Well worth the money. Cute colors.</li>
            <li> 4 of the headbands where mismatched with the flower. Band and flower different colors. Looks weird. The other 6 are fine. Packaging kind of smells. I had to hand wash before I used on baby.  It took a loooonnnggg time to get here.</li>
            <li> Good quality, and fun!</li>
            <li> They are so pretty and comfortable for my 3 month old! They were a great buy!</li>
            <li> Very cute and packaged well</li>
            <li> cute good quality headbands</li>
            <li> Love these, so convenient!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 6 month old daughter. They look cute on but they leave marks on her head. They also have a weird smell. They seem to be cheaply made; the flowers appear to be glued on to the band. In some of the colors, the flower does not quite match the color of the band.</li>
            <li> These are nothing what i expected the bows on the band don&#x27;t look the same in person also most of the band and the bows on them don&#x27;t match it looks silly</li>
            <li> I love it. The elastic is perfect. Love all the colors, looks good on my little girl. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 3mth old granddaughter... Love them.. they are very cute and fit her well</li>
            <li> Product description is accurate.</li>
            <li> These bows are lovely and our infant looks adorable.  The multipack of colors go with any outfit she wears.  I recommend and will buy again.  Compliments all the time on her bows.  Delivery time is about two weeks.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> They look pretty on and the fit is nice. Baby is 3 months, but fit perfectly on my 8 year old! My only issue with them is where the seam is. It is right under the flower and is a bet of a bump. I can&#x27;t let my baby have them on for too long or she will get indents and red marks on her head from them. Doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt her, but I would rather the seam be smaller. My older girl didn&#x27;t seem to notice, so maybe her hair make it so she didn&#x27;t feel it, or babies skin is just sensitive.</li>
            <li> These are pretty but they do leave marks on the babies head where the band comes together so I ever bought the elastic and took the flower off these and made my own and on some I just glued some felt on the Seam</li>
            <li> We love these! There are a couple colors that the bands don&#x27;t match the flower but it didn&#x27;t stop me from buying a set as a gift.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Vibrant colors and good quality product.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my great niece, they were shipped on time as specified &amp; were absolutely darling!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful. My daughter love them :)</li>
            <li> Fits great on my newborn. I think it would have looked better if the &amp;#34;flower&amp;#34; was sewn on vs glued. You can see the glue from certain angles and I feel like it could scratch my little girl.</li>
            <li> These headbands are VERY well made, High quality and every color is covered. No outfit will go without accessories.</li>
            <li> Though,  my baby girl isn&#x27;t born yet.  These headbands are adorable. They don&#x27;t look or feel cheap and the colors are nice.  I can&#x27;t wait to put good use into them.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, received almost 2 weeks ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> adorable great value for price, highly recommend</li>
            <li> These are so sweet for little girls and props for photography!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for my daughter since she was new born up until 5 months and they still fit .. i love them</li>
            <li> These headbands are wonderful! Beautiful colors and they&#x27;re not too tight around my daughter&#x27;s head.  I love this product and would order that it again!</li>
            <li> Very cute but uncomfortable for Baby because the plCe where the ribbon is connected it push is in the babyes head and leave marks. Should of done it inside out. Had to redo the whole thing</li>
            <li> These bows are so entirely cute! I just love putting them on our month old. They&#x27;re so soft, she doesn&#x27;t mind them at all. They&#x27;re hot glued on, rather than having a clip. My bundle came with 2 purples and no brown which is not a problem because I love purple but it&#x27;s something to look out for when you order.</li>
            <li> Buy these. My daughter has one to match every outfit. I just wish they had green. The only color I&#x27;m missing!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that one of the bows I got was a green band and a blue bow, making it impossible to wear and match anything.  I contacted the company (with pic) and they said that I would have to pay for shipping to send that one bow to them (in China) and see IF they find it to be their fault.  They refused to take the pics as proof.  They do not work with you at all.  The other bows are ok- but honestly the blue/green bow would have been so cute if it was one color... It&#x27;s kind of the in colors right now so I&#x27;m bummed to not use it.  Will not be buying from this company again.  Oh and don&#x27;t let your little one play with the band, her little fingers can pull it apart.</li>
            <li> Just as described and precious!</li>
            <li> Super cute! &amp; worth the buy! Just make sure you wash it first before putting it on your baby&#x27;s head cause it smells a bit.</li>
            <li> Cute and good quality.</li>
            <li> these are very well made and looked adorable on my 6 year old daughter. I was a bit scared that because I paid very little for these that they would be cheap but not at all. The fabric is good and these do not look cheap at all. They stretch well and don&#x27;t feel tight when wearing yet they fit snuggly and don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> So adorable and stretchy! Beautiful colors! Can&#x27;t wait for my little girl to be born and wear them! I see her being able to wear these for a long time.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and fit from 4 months on. Everywhere we go with one on she gets complimented on them and boutiques always ask where I got them. Lightweight and easy I love them!!</li>
            <li> The bows I ordered were a good price and were nice. They weren&#x27;t perfect but well worth the price. There waS a piece of white felt that showed on each bow that didn&#x27;t quite match all of the bows. Also it took over a month to receive the bows I ordered.</li>
            <li> I bought two different sets for my daughter and they looks just like they show in the picture. I would buy more but my daughter has enough for now.</li>
            <li> I pick that rating because I love the material and colors. But they were to big for my newborn baby so I just gave them away to my friend who is expecting a baby girl</li>
            <li> Great assortment of colors. Well-made and the don&#x27;t leave uncomfortable marks on my 6 month old&#x27;s forehead. The fabric flower is large, but it&#x27;s not too big for her head. It would be a bit much for a 3 month old or younger though.</li>
            <li> great deal head bands are great the flower makes alittle red mark on her head but they look very cute and she likes it so i say good deal for the price you cant beet that anywhere</li>
            <li> I love these headbands, cannot beat the price.  They are very cute, not cheap at all.  Simple yet cute. Will probably buy more in the future.  Shipping was quick.  Overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t keep track of shipping because I knew they were going to come after Christmas. But, I loved the quality! They are soo cute! I love all the colors.</li>
            <li> These are cute, inexpensive, well made, and versatile.  Love that I was able to save so much money by purchasing them online.</li>
            <li> They were ok. Gave them away. Pretty cute. Not super fancy as I had hoped. Wanted them for church. Good for price.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely. Durable and cute!</li>
            <li> Got these for my 6 month old granddaughter. My D-I-L loves the variety of colors and that they fit comfortably around her head without any tightness or irritation. No complaints here. A great deal for the money.</li>
            <li> What was sent to me is not what is in the picture. The headbands in the picture are made with that stretchy material. The ones I received are made of lace. They are still cute but I imagine they won&#x27;t be as durable. That alone would not really bother me. What does bother me (and my reason for giving them 3 stars) is that some of the headbands are different colors than the flower. Some are just different shades of the same color, like the tan flower has a dark brown headband and the light blue flower has a medium blue headband. Others are completely different colors, like the grey flower has a white headband. That&#x27;s definately not what is pictured here and it was a disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> These headbands are very cute and worthy the money. My 2 month old granddaughter looks adorable in them and will wear them for quite some time and there are such a variety of colors. They were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> These little hair ribbons were so worth the money. Wish I would of purchased more when they were a sale item. Thank you</li>
            <li> The headbands were adorable and very reasonably priced. However, when I removed them from their package, all of the headbands smelled like fumes. I washed the headbands with laundry detergent and water by hand, and I still cannot get the strong fume-like smell out of them. Now I hate the idea of putting something like that on my baby&#x27;s head. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very nice headbands. But You get what you pay for. The glue started coming off after only a few uses. But I would buy a gain it was a bargin</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to buy but this really is a great product. Has held up well with my 6 month old. My only complaint is the teal colored band is a slightly different color than the bow. It is very noticeable but at tuis price I can always replace it with av white or neutral band</li>
            <li> They are perfect! Love all the colors . . . wished one was black but really am happy with this purchase . . . baby girl is 12 months and they fit great! May buy more for baby showers!</li>
            <li> These are great! I love the colors, except the blue flower is on a greenish blue headband and I would prefer they match each other.</li>
            <li> Soooo very cute. I like the crocheted headbands for my baby girl so they don&#x27;t hurt her. She&#x27;s ten months now and I don&#x27;t use them on her anymore because they leave marks but we&#x27;re so cute when I did! Lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> The blue flower came in with a green band and I ended up with two reds instead of an orange and a red. Otherwise, great product. Works with all of her outfits!</li>
            <li> Omg these product come nasty whit all bunch a hair glued 😣 and some oft the bands are no glue I trow a way 5 cuz have hairs glue and presentacion no good they stuck is small lil bag and they get smash so no good never buy these any more</li>
            <li> I loved these when they arrived.  But, I washed them before I used them as I do all of my baby items.  I should have looked closer before I did so, because they are glued and so they fell apart.  I am not actually sure if it was the washer or the dryer that ruined the glue.  BUT, there was no care instructions or warnings not to wash these, so I just didn&#x27;t even think about.  So now I have ten headbands that are in 20 pieces.  Not going to hassle with returning them, but might try to get the glue gun out.</li>
            <li> These are very soft and comfortable - you get a lot of colors and perfect for baby birth through the time they take them off -</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Nothing fancy but you get enough colors to ensure all outfits you may have will match one of the ten.</li>
            <li> I was upset that I found ramen noodles in the bow, and then I was sent&lt;br /&gt;2 Gray bows, which really annoyed me. Other then the noodles&lt;br /&gt;And the double bows. They are ok. I plan to decorate them&lt;br /&gt;To make them more classy.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite! You can easily use them for a few years!</li>
            <li> great stuff, i love all the the different colors, they all look nice, i recommend these headbands to everybody and their momma</li>
            <li> The colors i recieved are not the exact same as picture. I was wanting the dark red for a picture dress but my package didnt have that. My packet has more neutral colors which isca bummer</li>
            <li> My baby is not due until sept so I cannot review how they fit or hold up with wear. But I can say they are beautiful. The quality of the product APPEARS to be very satisfactory. I&#x27;m excited to pair them with her cute outfits. For the price they are worth the purchase for sure. I&#x27;ll let you know how they fit in a few months ;)</li>
            <li> Great headbands for a newborn girl. Nice and soft and came way earlier than expected! I&#x27;d recommend them for sure.</li>
            <li> They are all the same design but I love all the colors. I think it would go good with almost any outfit.</li>
            <li> These headbands are adorable! The colors are very diverse and the band fits great around my month old infant!!  I LOVE them!</li>
            <li> Wow ...great price. I bought these for my great niece...6 months old. My niece said she really liked them because the band was loose enough so it didn&#x27;t leave marks on the babies head.  Anyone can afford these cute headbands.</li>
            <li> Super cute! love them</li>
            <li> Adorable!!!!! I love these headbands</li>
            <li> very cute and well made.  a color for every outfit</li>
            <li> Fabulous headbands! So cute &amp; beautiful colors! Quality is pretty impressive as well for the price! Arrived sooner then expected!</li>
            <li> Love these. It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands. The bows are huge and look great on a baby infant. The band is nice and soft for my baby&#x27;s head. Other bands leave nasty marks but she loves these. I want more color combination but these are great for now.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast! The bows are so cute and fit my baby&#x27;s head perfect!</li>
            <li> These were really cute!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I wanted and more. The colors are perfect and the material was great! I can&#x27;t believe how fast it arrived and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Beautiful headbands for a great price. They do pull easily so you have to be careful. And they did have a strong plastic smell to them from the wrapper they were in which was a little off putting but they are adorable!</li>
            <li> Loved them!! And my granddaughter looks adorable in them!! Got them sooner than expected too :)</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my newborn</li>
            <li> They work great for my infant daughter! the flowers do not come off, and the head band stays snug on her head without leaving marks.  The colors are great!</li>
            <li> Look even better in person. Doesn&#x27;t cut into babies scalp.</li>
            <li> These were beautiful headbands and  I love them.  I generally look for things not sold in my area and this were great.</li>
            <li> These are the only ones my 2 year old granddaughter keeps on her head.....I just ordered a second set for another grandchild...easy to put on and take off... and they are washable</li>
            <li> These are wonderful.....I bought these a while back...My daughter had a girl yesterday...A healthy baby girl....These will look beautiful on her with all her black hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are made very well....I was actually surprised how well they were made....They are sturdy and the stretchiness is very loose so as to not hurt baby&#x27;s head.....They are just like the picture...Very bight colors and you get a color to match just about everything....You cannot go wrong in buying this pkg. of headbands....I am very satisfied.....</li>
            <li> Love these headbands and colors! And the delivery was really fast too ! :)</li>
            <li> Love these.  Great price and well made.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good considering the price, though the colors varied quite a bit from the photos. We got 2 purple ones and no brown one and the headband and flowers were not the same shade for several of the headbands. However, they are still very cute and don&#x27;t leave a dent in my 6 month old&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> They go great with everything, I love them! Great price too, thanks!</li>
            <li> nice! Big bows and love the different color choices with a great price</li>
            <li> Love these headbands.  Loved them so much, I told my friend about them and she bought 2 packs for her friends!</li>
            <li> not as soft as they appear. Some bows had a rough spot where attached to the headband.</li>
            <li> Great value, but a lot of the bows are significantly lighter/darker in color than the coordinating band.</li>
            <li> I gave them as an additional baby shower gift. They were a hit and I&#x27;ve seen pictures of the baby wearing them. She looks adorable with them on and a color to match every outfit. I really despised the packaging, it was a thin plastic that ripped easily and I had to repackage to give it to her. ! star off for that problem.</li>
            <li> Good quality, great value! These came as expected, and fit well on my baby. Material is stretchy so she will be able to get a lot of use out of it. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Beautiful headbands in great colors. Will probably be ordering more soon. Perfect for babies and little girls. The bands are snug for baby and stretchy enough for them to be worn by young girls. Great price and quality.</li>
            <li> The headbands are nice. Two of them had mismatched flowers and headbands. Those are unusable.</li>
            <li> Cute headbands but have a very strong chemical smell. It&#x27;s been months since  ppurchased them and that scent is still there.  They were a bit to tight even for my newborn,  the left the mark around her head.  I wish they a bit bigger so they would not be so tight. Used once and have been on my baby&#x27;s dresser ever since.</li>
            <li> Out if the ten headbands I received 3/4 of them can&#x27;t really be used. The flower accent was a random color that didn&#x27;t match the actual headband it was attached to. I had chose that set because my baby had specific outfits that would have matched those Colors.</li>
            <li> Love these! And great price! Fit my 4 month old so good!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with all of the headbands. They strench and stay on a babies head perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are adorable.  They fit well and are very soft.  The only complaint I have is that one of the pink ones came broken (it is unraveling).  I will be unable to use it.  I don&#x27;t want to return all of the headbands, just that one, so I guess I am stuck with one less headband than I paid for.</li>
