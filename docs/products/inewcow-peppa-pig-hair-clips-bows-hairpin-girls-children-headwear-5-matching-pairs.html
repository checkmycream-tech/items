            <li> Cute.  My grandniece loves these.  Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> So cute! It doesn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;ll fall apart at all.</li>
            <li> The shipping was ridiculous it took over 6 weeks to get . also 2 hair clips have already broke the peppa pig feel off . Made cheap not worth the wait ..</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Very nice and sturdy hair clips.  My 3 year old nieces loved them.</li>
            <li> my daughter loved them!</li>
            <li> Super cute hair clips. Well made. Two survived a ride in the washer.</li>
            <li> They are great, beautiful &amp; Fashion!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty and easy to wear</li>
            <li> Received them very fast! I was wondering how well they would be made and was surprisingly satisfied.  They were the perfect size and made very well. My toddler is very hard on hair bows and barrettes because she rips them out and plays with them. These stay in very well and she wants them in! When she does have them out and has them in hand, she has not managed to ruin any of them yet. We have had them for several months now and no sign of them breaking or wearing down or not fastening.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with them as well as my 3 year old!</li>
            <li> Great clips. Peppa size bigger than expected which is great! Received the clip within 1 week of ordering them which was amazing given that in the ordr it said it was going to take 4 weeks! Great seller and great product.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting a variety of clips. No way! All the clips are of the same character😟</li>
            <li> This well made, and the lil kids loved it in when they saw it in their goodie bags :) I see them wearing it often even weeks after the party was done :)</li>
            <li> i totally love them and my daugther love them too she want to wear them everyday. The quality is great</li>
            <li> My 3 year old adires these! They are perfect and very durable! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> My sweet little niece has super fine/thin hair (and not a whole lot of it) but these were actually perfect for her.  She LOVES Peppa and absolutely adored these. And they don&#x27;t pull so she was able to wear them for her birthday party. I would buy them again for her.</li>
            <li> My niece loves them.  They hold her hair in place without coming lose.</li>
            <li> so cute and very affordable!</li>
            <li> These clips are perfect!! Good size. Good quality. My girl loves peppa pig. She loves these clips and so do I! Would recommend anyone to buy them..</li>

            <li> I love these and so does my daughter!&lt;br /&gt;Got these for her birthday and she wears them everyday.  The clips are perfect and are pretty strong as well! :) Also got them a week early which was awesome too.</li>
            <li> Birthday girl loved them, they do appear well made just comes in a plastic zip bag so you may want to have a nicer bag for them if you intend to give them as a gift.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Cute and well-made. A little big for my 15 month-old granddaughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
