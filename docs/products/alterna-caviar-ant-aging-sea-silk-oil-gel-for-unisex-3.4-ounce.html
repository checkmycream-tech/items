            <li>I have had oily hair most of my life and the thought of using any product on my hair with &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in the name turned me off.  </li>
            <li>My hair seems to have more body when I use this, and lies straighter.  </li>

            <li>It was ok.</li>

            <li>My favorite hair product line... will buy it over and over again and never regret it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>dry hair feel like silk - wonderful heat protectant.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I was impressed on how smooth this product left my hair regardless of how damaged it was from over dying it.</li>
            <li>I saw this in Sephora and wanted it right then, but took out my handy phone and my Amazon app and saw that I could get it for a much better price....</li>
            <li>Placing an order right now for this!!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky smooth and easy to comb or brush.  </li>
            <li>Its light, non greasy formula is wonderful, adds texture and control without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li>Product is light weight.</li>
            <li>Also, smells citrus but light not overpowering.</li>
            <li>product gives shine and light hold, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth all the cents!</li>
            <li>Great product, recommend to anyone with colored hair that has a tendency to dry out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many high end quality drugs store products to salon products and none compare to this.</li>
            <li>Also, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>This product lasted me 3-5 months so its really worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it&#x27;s light enough to not make my hair look greasy, and the smell isn&#x27;t obnoxiousl</li>
            <li>My hair is going through it right now</li>
            <li>It is light, does not weigh my very fine hair down.  </li>
            <li>bought my first one at salon.</li>
            <li>Packaging is definitely different than most bottles</li>
            <li>Thanks agin!</li>
            <li>My hair felt so clean, smooth, and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got shoulder length curly hair &amp; a dime size amount is almost too much.  </li>
            <li>Do not notice the smell of it too much, but I purchased it after my hair stylist used it in my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m using too much of the product</li>
            <li>It really smooths your hair!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I use it when I style my hair straight, curly, and for a beachy wave.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because I found the caviar line from alterna very helpful for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love other products from this line but Not this.</li>
            <li>I can comb our my hair very easily with few tangles;</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair super soft and naturally shiny.</li>
            <li>but I do notice that my hair becomes oily faster than normal.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good and helps my dry dry curly hair look somewhat human!</li>
            <li>Since I got a curly perm, I cannot seem to live without it.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing;it tames my wild hair.</li>
            <li>It also makes hair feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Keeps it shiny and soft, not at all greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Better to use on dry hair for a little hold and shine.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or with the wet look (unless you use too much).</li>
            <li>This product protects my hair from getting too dry using a blow hair dryer, and nourishes it after coloring my hair and putting in high lights.  </li>
            <li>Used on dry hair after straightening or curling and it leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>I generally do not blow dry, so I apply either wet &amp; comb in OR dry and brush in allowing me to lightly &amp;#34;style&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair frequently</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I blow dry my hair frequently</li>
            <li> The Caviar brand is new antiaging formula for hair and it&#x27;s less expensive on amazon.com than at your salon, for sure.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of this product so it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> a blessing for long hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with several other Alterna products, including hair oils.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but well worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I use the shampoos and conditioners in the Caviar line, as well as the Bamboo dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> I use it before drying and evrydaay on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I towel dry and then rub some product into my hands and massage it into my hair.  </li>
            <li> It gives dry looking hair life!  </li>
            <li> Since adding highlights to my dark hair, it has been rough, frizzy and dull, but these products fixed that issue.</li>
            <li> I thought that this oil gel would make my hair less dry and make it feel softer.</li>
            <li> Finally found that unbelievable product that can actually tame my coarse wavy hair!</li>
            <li> A little will go a long time.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical seeing the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in the product name</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and smooths and protects.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and use about a quarter amount or less.</li>
            <li> read the other reviews if you&#x27;re still not sure.</li>
            <li> and I was very skeptical at first because of the price in my area</li>
            <li> Bought this to tame my flyaways.  </li>
            <li> You can place a small amount in your hair before blow drying it.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair 2-3 times a wee with shampoo and use conditioner to keep the naturals oils in my hair.</li>
            <li> One day,  after running out of my usual mousse, I had no option but to use the product.  </li>
            <li> It smoothed your hair without making it greasy or heavy!</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel a little weird, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I think this would be well suited for someone with thin hair that needs body.  </li>
            <li> she has crazy curly hair....</li>
            <li> That greasy/wet look is terrible anyway!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great with my hair, I recommend this to others who have problems with frizzy hair.You can place a small amount in your hair before blow drying it.</li>
            <li> Placing an order right now for this!! Bought it for my daughter she has crazy curly hair....bought my first one at salon. This is a much better price!! Great product great price!!</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and frizzy.  It used to be super-curly til I had kids.  But this works wonders.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and smooths and protects.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchase this product and I was very skeptical at first because of the price in my area, however I had found it cheaper on amazon...so I gave it a shot. I was impressed on how smooth this product left my hair regardless of how damaged it was from over dying it. I&#x27;ve tried many high end quality drugs store products to salon products and none compare to this. I usually wash my hair 2-3 times a wee with shampoo and use conditioner to keep the naturals oils in my hair. This product lasted me 3-5 months so its really worth every penny. Packaging is definitely different than most bottles but it&#x27;s not an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;Try it!!</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me a bottle of this gel some time ago.  I have had oily hair most of my life and the thought of using any product on my hair with &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in the name turned me off.  One day,  after running out of my usual mousse, I had no option but to use the product.  WOW!  My hair felt so clean, smooth, and not weighed down.  I can now go an extra day between shampoos.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair super soft and naturally shiny. You do not need to over do it. I have thick long hair and use about a quarter amount or less. This is not sticky gel for lift and hold. I would not slather this on as people did in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s. That greasy/wet look is terrible anyway! If you are looking for something to heat style with that has a natural shine and softness, this is the best choice out there. I use the shampoos and conditioners in the Caviar line, as well as the Bamboo dry oil spray. Excellent combo! Since adding highlights to my dark hair, it has been rough, frizzy and dull, but these products fixed that issue.</li>
            <li> Has no gel no type of hold.This product has only oil. Love other products from this line but Not this.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to have more body when I use this, and lies straighter.  The Caviar brand is new antiaging formula for hair and it&#x27;s less expensive on amazon.com than at your salon, for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product but I didn&#x27;t like it for my hair.  I think this would be well suited for someone with thin hair that needs body.  I gave it to my mom and she likes it.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It smells great and liquefies onto my hair immediately.  It helps detangle my hair and makes it feel silky.  I use it in conjunction with several other Alterna products, including hair oils.  They work well together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whet I would do if I didn&#x27;t use this on my hair! Finally found that unbelievable product that can actually tame my coarse wavy hair! Great product, recommend to anyone with colored hair that has a tendency to dry out. It smoothed your hair without making it greasy or heavy!</li>
            <li> While traveling in Milan, Italy, I needed to get my hair done.  I went to a famous hair stylist who works with models and actresses.  Marco, the stylist in Milan, used this product on my hair, and recommended it for me.  This product protects my hair from getting too dry using a blow hair dryer, and nourishes it after coloring my hair and putting in high lights.  It makes my hair silky smooth and easy to comb or brush.  It keeps the ends from splitting and the hair from breaking.  No product is right for everyone, but this one is great for me.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Its light, non greasy formula is wonderful, adds texture and control without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product!! Used on dry hair after straightening or curling and it leaves my hair so soft! It also de-frizzes my hair. Love the smell too. Would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Expensive but well worth every penny!  You only need to use it sparingly.  A little will go a long time.  I&#x27;ve got shoulder length curly hair &amp; a dime size amount is almost too much.  At first I was skeptical seeing the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in the product name but it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or with the wet look (unless you use too much). It&#x27;s one of the best curl enhancers I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used. My hair is has a beautiful shine. Product is light weight. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of this product so it will last a very long time. Will buy again and from this seller.</li>
            <li> its a good product. i don&#x27;t use it too often but when i do I&#x27;m very satisfied with th results.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look nice and shiny. Do not notice the smell of it too much, but I purchased it after my hair stylist used it in my hair. Maybe I&#x27;m using too much of the product but I do notice that my hair becomes oily faster than normal. I blow dry my hair frequently and I think it does a great job of protecting it.</li>
            <li> I saw this in Sephora and wanted it right then, but took out my handy phone and my Amazon app and saw that I could get it for a much better price.... yay!!!  This stuff is good and helps my dry dry curly hair look somewhat human!</li>
            <li> It was ok. Made my hair feel a little weird, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It is light, does not weigh my very fine hair down.  I generally do not blow dry, so I apply either wet &amp; comb in OR dry and brush in allowing me to lightly &amp;#34;style&amp;#34;.  Also, smells citrus but light not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product -&lt;br /&gt;Makes dry hair feel like silk - wonderful heat protectant.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for this brand.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing;it tames my wild hair. I use it right after applying my straightening serum and it provides great hold and style--plus smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s worth all the cents! It really smooths your hair!&lt;br /&gt;Just read the other reviews if you&#x27;re still not sure.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hair&lt;br /&gt;look! It gives dry looking hair life!  Thanks agin!</li>
            <li> I am a product junky and I love anything Alterna, specifically caviar. My hair is going through it right now and I thought this would be a great addition to the line up and it is! It mixes the oil you need for your hair with the gel. Your hairdresser does this when finishing up your style or pre blowout. They will mix an oil they like with a mouse or a gel. Anyway, great idea Alterna! Love it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/fizzy hair and this product is great! I use it when I style my hair straight, curly, and for a beachy wave. Gives great hold and definition to curls and controls frizz!</li>
            <li> Bought this to tame my flyaways.  It&#x27;s works great!!  My daughters use it for the same purpose!  It also makes hair feel soft and silky.  Also, fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel FABULOUS!!! Plus, it is great for frizz and a light hold</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s light enough to not make my hair look greasy, and the smell isn&#x27;t obnoxiousl</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product line... will buy it over and over again and never regret it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> This is the best.  Great for wavey or curly hair.  It helps straighten the hair and it&#x27;s very light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Since I got a curly perm, I cannot seem to live without it.  I use it before drying and evrydaay on dry hair.  Keeps it shiny and soft, not at all greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> When I use this product my hair is quite managable. It does not flake. It lasts till the next shampooing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Better to use on dry hair for a little hold and shine. Don&#x27;t recommend using before styling.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I found the caviar line from alterna very helpful for my hair. I thought that this oil gel would make my hair less dry and make it feel softer. After I started using it, I noticed that, although it doesn&#x27;t feel oily when you touch it, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel silky and soft.&lt;br /&gt;This product gives shine and light hold, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;Overall 3.5 because the gel has a lightweight, give shine, and doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I wash my hair.  I towel dry and then rub some product into my hands and massage it into my hair.  I can comb our my hair very easily with few tangles; a blessing for long hair.  And it smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> No so great for fine hair with curls and frizz</li>
