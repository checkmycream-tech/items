            <li>I love the quality of this cream.</li>
            <li>I will post an update as I see more changes in my skin after using this cream for an even longer period.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed the EverYoung cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it absorbs so well.  </li>
            <li>I have received my face cream and am very much enjoying it.</li>

            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love this cream It absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy film.</li>

            <li>Im happy so far.</li>
            <li>I will wait until i use the whole jar to give a fair review.</li>
            <li>and I do feel it helps to reduce the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>When you buy this product, you receive an online address to download a little brochure for perfect skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>This cream has a substantial feel, but it&#x27;s light and not greasy-feeling.  </li>
            <li>Knowing that it is a paraben free, cruelty free,&lt;br /&gt;vegetarian</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin texture smooth out a bit both on my face and my neck/chest area.  </li>
            <li>It feels so light</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of the organic ingredients and also being fragrant free.</li>
            <li>I like that it is a cruelty free product.  </li>
            <li>Lets see the results after using it for 30 days but so far so good.</li>
            <li>My skin, which is hypersensitive, loves it and it has proven to be very effective in a very short time.</li>
            <li>itself is rich and creamy, nourishing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>Good stuff, I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and gets absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>This cream is light and smooth and seems to hold in the moisture very well.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I love that this is an all natural, organic skin care product.  </li>
            <li>About a day after I ordered it  I received an email from the company saying it was shipped and what to expect... pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had MANY of my old friends from HS and college</li>
            <li>it smells nice, and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>have been through many creams for the under eye dark circles and this seems like the most promising,</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>and I have seen 0 results as far as diminishing fine lines and wrinkles,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39 yrs old and don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles or fine lines</li>
            <li>It is extracted from the grapeseed using very high heat and chemicals which are then absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>2 jars later, I am sure it has stopped my skin from aging.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this product.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the jar I sniffed (yes, I do that).</li>
            <li>Yes, your skin may break out when first using it, but that goes away.  </li>
            <li>most importantly, it  deeply moisturizes my skin.  </li>
            <li>he noticed it then it really must be working!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>Over all I am pleased with my experience and am looking forward to other new and exciting products to try!!</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and feels soft, I really like the way it feels.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be a pretty decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The smell referee to in other reviews is light and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell whether or not I see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>yet it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t work that fast.</li>
            <li>I really like that it is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>I am 52 and see the effects of sun exposure and aging most noticeably around my mouth, and so far, I haven&#x27;t see a big difference, however I do think some of my lines/wrinkles are starting to smooth out.  </li>
            <li>My choice was based on the botanic ingredients and because I prefer to support smaller, &amp;#34;non-mainstream&amp;#34; product brands that make products with more natural, quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps using it alone helps it to absorb better into the skin, versus using it with other products.  </li>
            <li>I am working on my second jar and can see a real difference in my skin, especially around my mouth where I have fine lines!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t hoping for a lot, but am happily surprised to report that this is really helping my skin!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>Use it in place of my normal moisturizer and serum.</li>
            <li>I was initially using this product after applying an anti-aging serum that made my face feel quite dry, but I almost think it works better by itself.  </li>
            <li>started using this cream the moment I received it and noticed it makes your skin feel nice and tight almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>Excited to try other products of  Earthen Beauty Naturals.</li>
            <li>I usually do not believe anti-aging products</li>
            <li>Makes my face and neck soft!</li>
            <li>moisturizer is a nice consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and it has kept my skin soft through all types of weather.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on how young I look.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural anti aging cream that moisturized my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area without being too greasy.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for around ten days now and think that I am ready to review.</li>
            <li>It has a natural smell to it, sort of earthy, I like it.</li>
            <li>I like it so far, but its too soon to tell..</li>
            <li>This really works and it makes my face feel and look younger.</li>
            <li>The texture is light and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I do look for no animal testing and organic and natural ingredients</li>
            <li>so this fits the bill so far.  </li>
            <li>So far, I would recommend this cream to others, and plan on buying another jar of it when I run out.</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and no breakouts/</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft now and moisturized.</li>
            <li>So far my skin texture looks better and the skin on my chest looks less dry and irritated.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product, the first few days I was a little unsure.  </li>
            <li>it has a very faint botanical scent that disappears on the skin, a lovely light texture, but</li>
            <li>Even though the cream is heavy, the texture is silky and absorbs into the skin quickly and does not leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>I like this cream alot, it&#x27;s softened my lines especially around my mouth considerably.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a couple of weeks, and am not sure how long it usually takes to see a noticeable difference, but I am currently happy with it.  </li>
            <li>it 5 stars because even though it is too early to tell if this actually works as stated, the little online brochure is really informative and shows that this company cares about your skin and not just the buck they received from the sale.  </li>
            <li>my skin is very dry and very sensitive, (not to mention very aging) and i have used this for a few days now with no problems.  </li>

            <li> I was looking for a natural anti aging cream that moisturized my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area without being too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for around ten days now and think that I am ready to review.</li>
            <li> It has a natural smell to it, sort of earthy, I like it.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, but its too soon to tell..</li>

            <li> old</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and no breakouts/</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft now and moisturized.</li>
            <li> So far my skin texture looks better and the skin on my chest looks less dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product, the first few days I was a little unsure.  </li>
            <li> it has a very faint botanical scent that disappears on the skin, a lovely light texture, but</li>
            <li> Even though the cream is heavy, the texture is silky and absorbs into the skin quickly and does not leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> I like this cream alot, it&#x27;s softened my lines especially around my mouth considerably.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a couple of weeks, and am not sure how long it usually takes to see a noticeable difference, but I am currently happy with it.  </li>
            <li> it 5 stars because even though it is too early to tell if this actually works as stated, the little online brochure is really informative and shows that this company cares about your skin and not just the buck they received from the sale.  </li>
            <li> my skin is very dry and very sensitive, (not to mention very aging) and i have used this for a few days now with no problems.  </li>
            <li> my 11 year old grandson made a comment the other night about how my skin is glowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually buy only very high end products .</li>
            <li> However, I have tiny dry wrinkles where I did not notice them before and the overall results were not substantial enough for me to re-order.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this really works for me without irritating my skin at all.</li>
            <li> My face definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as dry.</li>
            <li> I have to say I use a little to rub over my hands and my hands stay moisturized and soft all day.</li>
            <li> A few blemishes developed.  </li>
            <li> It is a terrific cream and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have only used about half of the jar.</li>
            <li> this works just as well, for less than a third the price.  </li>
            <li> My skin went from very dry and lackluster looking to moisturized and radiant in a matter of one week.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look as rough as they did before.</li>
            <li> This item was received BEFORE expected date.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times before breaking out.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I prefer some of the other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> I do not want to use any other cream on my face since I&#x27;ve been introduced to this formula.</li>
            <li> I will update if I see any other changes.</li>
            <li> The reason I will not order this again and I am returning it is that, I was not aware that there was grapeseed oil in it.</li>
            <li> just started using it on eyes, and other areas of face as it says.</li>
            <li> It has only been three days, so I am not sure yet.</li>
            <li> Am looking into their other products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the jar is small, the cream is concentrated so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week and a half and already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> is that it comes off when sweating (i do sweat excessively from my head)&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Thank you Earthen for all of your hard work.</li>
            <li> it is hard to find products without retinol,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> started using this cream the moment I received it and noticed it makes your skin feel nice and tight almost instantly.  Lets see the results after using it for 30 days but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This cream has a substantial feel, but it&#x27;s light and not greasy-feeling.  It makes my skin feel great, and I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell or consistency of this cream.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs well.  I prefer some of the other brands I have used.</li>
            <li> THIS IS REALLY THE BEST CREAM  EVER LOVE IT ! WASN&#x27;T SURE IF I COULD FIND IT AGAIN. YAE I DID</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this cream. It feels very rich and has a great moisturizing quality. Knowing that it is a paraben free, cruelty free,&lt;br /&gt;vegetarian formula gave me an incentive to buy this cream. I have to say I use a little to rub over my hands and my hands stay moisturized and soft all day. My face has been glowing and the skin on my face and hands is smoothing out and you can almost feel the ingredients in the cream working. I put some on before I go to bed and wear it on again before I go to work. I do not want to use any other cream on my face since I&#x27;ve been introduced to this formula. I will post an update as I see more changes in my skin after using this cream for an even longer period. Thank you Earthen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this cream for a year now and never missed a day and it has kept my skin soft through all types of weather. 2 jars later, I am sure it has stopped my skin from aging. I get a lot of compliments on how young I look.</li>
            <li> I have only used about half of the jar. and it seems the lines around my eyes are going away some. I will wait until i use the whole jar to give a fair review. I do like it. it smells nice, and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> EveryYoung is a wonderful product. Use it in place of my normal moisturizer and serum. Found it to do the job of both without being greasy or overly drying. A little goes a long way. Excited to try other products of  Earthen Beauty Naturals.</li>
            <li> The cream is very pleasant on the skin. The effect is almost immediate. Smoother , soothed skin. I usually do not believe anti-aging products but I know as a physician that anti inflammatory and nourishing products definitely can improve the skin. I usually buy only very high end products . I am very impressed with this cream. I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> I love that this is an all natural, organic skin care product.  I have really enjoyed the EverYoung cream.  The fragrance is very light, not over-powering.  Even though the cream is heavy, the texture is silky and absorbs into the skin quickly and does not leave a greasy residue.  I have noticed my skin texture smooth out a bit both on my face and my neck/chest area.  My complexion seems to have a bit of a glow too. (My boyfriend pointed that out.)  Over all I am pleased with my experience and am looking forward to other new and exciting products to try!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural anti aging cream that moisturized my neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area without being too greasy. After trying several different kinds I happened upon this and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s very moisturizing but not overly greasy and has a wonderful, mild cucumber type smell. So far my skin texture looks better and the skin on my chest looks less dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> The smell referee to in other reviews is light and fades quickly. This cream works good with no break puts after 3 weeks</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing. I have been using this product for about 10 days and I am very impressed with the results. My skin went from very dry and lackluster looking to moisturized and radiant in a matter of one week.</li>
            <li> The anti-aging cream made my eyes a lot smoother looking.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this product. About a day after I ordered it  I received an email from the company saying it was shipped and what to expect... pretty cool. There were also instructions on how to use it. I like the personal touch there.&lt;br /&gt; I have been using it for around ten days now and think that I am ready to review. I am used to moisturizing my face several times a day especially in the winter. This cream is light and smooth and seems to hold in the moisture very well. When I first opened the jar I sniffed (yes, I do that). It has a natural smell to it, sort of earthy, I like it. I use it several times each day on my face after washing with water. It feels so light yet it moisturizes really well. I do use it close to my eyes and I have not had any problems with stinging, etc. My skin looks smooth and feels soft, I really like the way it feels. I also have been using it on the back of my hands. They don&#x27;t look as rough as they did before. I will update if I see any other changes.</li>
            <li> My choice was based on the botanic ingredients and because I prefer to support smaller, &amp;#34;non-mainstream&amp;#34; product brands that make products with more natural, quality ingredients.  While the jar is small, the cream is concentrated so a little goes a long way.  I anticipate that this will be my moisturizer from now on.  Thank you Earthen for all of your hard work.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It smells great (earthy, yet a good smell of earthy, if that helps) and my skin feels awesome.  I&#x27;ve had MANY of my old friends from HS and college mention how my skin looks younger.  They are all asking about it.  Good stuff, I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, but its too soon to tell..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months now. I like how it feels on my face and it seems to be a pretty decent moisturizer. My face definitely doesn&#x27;t feel as dry. However...this is supposed to be an anti aging product and I have seen 0 results as far as diminishing fine lines and wrinkles,sun damage or evening out skin tone. I&#x27;m 39 yrs old and don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles or fine lines but, the ones I do have the cream didn&#x27;t do anything for</li>
            <li> This is a great cream.  Yes, your skin may break out when first using it, but that goes away.  I love the way it absorbs so well.  It is a terrific cream and a little bit goes a long way.  I will be ordering from Earthen Beauty again.</li>
            <li> I like this cream alot, it&#x27;s softened my lines especially around my mouth considerably.  thank you very much</li>
            <li> I have received my face cream and am very much enjoying it. It feels wonderful and my skin is smooth when I wake up. And I&#x27;m so happy to hear about the ethical standards used for the production.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the organic ingredients and also being fragrant free. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. My skin feels softer. I&#x27;ll add to this review after I&#x27;ve used it longer.  Im happy so far.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on schedule well packaged and in perfect condition. The cream is truly wonderful. My skin, which is hypersensitive, loves it and it has proven to be very effective in a very short time. I will definitely purchase this again and would not hesitate to recommend it. This is a great cream - I can see a difference immediately in clarity, softness, wrinkles, tautness. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> too soon to see any difference</li>
            <li> I am starting to see some signs of aging under the eyes, the forehead and around my mouth. I have been using it for a week and a half and already notice a difference. This really works and it makes my face feel and look younger. I am very pleased with the results! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Makes my face and neck soft! I woke up the next day younger!! haha. Okay so it didn&#x27;t work that fast. But it is a great moisturizer for sure! You really only need a dab like the jar says. Looking forward to seeing results.</li>
            <li> Great cream.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy and I do feel it helps to reduce the fine lines.  Nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> Have been using this moisturizer for about three weeks. It&#x27;s a rich cream, goes on well under make up, basically lasts all day and of course has no nasties! I gave it 4/5 because I couldn&#x27;t put my hand on heart and say it actually improved my skin- bottom line I don&#x27;t know yet. In time maybe I&#x27;ll see that difference, but it is giving it all the goodness and protecting it which is a great start. Service is excellent!</li>
            <li> Pretty good moisture filler..long term benefits...not sure.</li>
            <li> a very pleasant surprise.  it is hard to find products without retinol, etc.  i had been using a much more expensive brand, and they discontinued it.  this works just as well, for less than a third the price.  it has a very faint botanical scent that disappears on the skin, a lovely light texture, but most importantly, it  deeply moisturizes my skin.  my skin is very dry and very sensitive, (not to mention very aging) and i have used this for a few days now with no problems.  my skin just soaks up the benefits.  update:  7/19/16  why is amazon no longer carrying this product?  so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very good product and conforms to specifications and seller fast handling and confident and very suitable prices</li>
            <li> I like the product - goes on nicely and has a good smell. But can&#x27;t say that I noticed any improvement in my skin. I&#x27;m 47 and looking for some help with aging/fine lines/dryness. It works that day, but again, not seeing overall improvement.</li>
            <li> The reason I will not order this again and I am returning it is that, I was not aware that there was grapeseed oil in it. This oil has zero redeeming qualities. It is extracted from the grapeseed using very high heat and chemicals which are then absorbed into the skin. So if this is something I would never cook with then I don’t want it on my face.</li>
            <li> The texture is light and fluffy.  It feels good on your skin but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  It&#x27;s not bad I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product, the first few days I was a little unsure.  A few blemishes developed.  But know I see such an improvement in my complexion.  This definitely will be my skin cream.  I will be ordering my next jar soon.</li>
            <li> I quite liked this cream, it certainly felt good on my skin. However, I have tiny dry wrinkles where I did not notice them before and the overall results were not substantial enough for me to re-order. My quest continues...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I can see a noticeable improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my 11 year old grandson made a comment the other night about how my skin is glowing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he noticed it then it really must be working!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I received it  and I am very impressed.  I really like that it is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This item was received BEFORE expected date. Nice surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using it on eyes, and other areas of face as it says. resembles vaseline, but without the greasy attributes. Goes on smooth and gets absorbed into the skin. It has only been three days, so I am not sure yet. When you buy this product, you receive an online address to download a little brochure for perfect skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it 5 stars because even though it is too early to tell if this actually works as stated, the little online brochure is really informative and shows that this company cares about your skin and not just the buck they received from the sale.  Also nice to have a product that is &amp;#34;earth friendly&amp;#34;.  Am looking into their other products as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been through many creams for the under eye dark circles and this seems like the most promising,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking this product a lot.  I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m older and I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  Good moisturizer and my skin looks pretty good.  I&#x27;m not into miracle products - they don&#x27;t exist in my experience,  but I do look for no animal testing and organic and natural ingredients so this fits the bill so far.  I&#x27;m thinking of trying their under eye product as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.  I have only been using it for a couple of weeks, and am not sure how long it usually takes to see a noticeable difference, but I am currently happy with it.  I like that it is a cruelty free product.  It&#x27;s a good price.  I like the fragrance and texture of the cream.  I like how my skin feels after applying it.  Only time will tell whether or not I see a huge difference.  I am 52 and see the effects of sun exposure and aging most noticeably around my mouth, and so far, I haven&#x27;t see a big difference, however I do think some of my lines/wrinkles are starting to smooth out.  But again, it has only been a couple of weeks.  I was initially using this product after applying an anti-aging serum that made my face feel quite dry, but I almost think it works better by itself.  Perhaps using it alone helps it to absorb better into the skin, versus using it with other products.  So far, I would recommend this cream to others, and plan on buying another jar of it when I run out.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT! I am working on my second jar and can see a real difference in my skin, especially around my mouth where I have fine lines!  At 67yrs. old I wasn&#x27;t hoping for a lot, but am happily surprised to report that this is really helping my skin!  Cannot count the number of anti-aging creams I&#x27;ve used over the years, and am thrilled to report this one is the BEST for me!  ;-)</li>
            <li> I am using it! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is a nice consistency and a little goes a long way. I wear it under make up too, without having that &amp;#34;too thick&amp;#34; feel. I have sensitive skin and no breakouts/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Was looking forward to getting this.  I only used it a few times before breaking out.  Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this really works for me without irritating my skin at all. My skin feels so soft now and moisturized.</li>
            <li> prompt shipping, excellent customer follow up.&lt;br /&gt;product itself is rich and creamy, nourishing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;one draw back i find is that it comes off when sweating (i do sweat excessively from my head)&lt;br /&gt;but i wear it as a night cream and i like the bright healthy look of my skin after about a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Love this cream It absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy film.</li>
