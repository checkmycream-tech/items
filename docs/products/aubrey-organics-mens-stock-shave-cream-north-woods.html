            <li>Excellent Aubrey quality, organic, no animals tortured or killed in the manufacturing process.</li>
            <li>And I do use products that have that \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint, which I do enjoy.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this and gave it to my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>If you or someone you love has sensitive skin, this is definitely worth a shot, and it smells nice too :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rubbing them now and they feel baby smooth and don&#x27;t hurt a bit.  </li>

            <li>I still enjoy lathering my soaps and creams with a brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and slippery, with plenty of lubrication that lasts until the end of the shave, unlike most that start to dry out towards the end.  </li>
            <li>clean and and fresh.</li>
            <li>My reference comparisons are Spelck creme, Gillette ProFusion, Bold, and AlphaShave...</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shave lotion has changed shaving from a  burdensome chore to another daily routine, like taking a good hot shower.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh after shaving with this product.  </li>
            <li>for the simple fact they don&#x27;t contain chemicals to make them smell nice like non-organic products.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, scent is really a nice place to fall short.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other different kinds of shaving cream, including several organic kinds, and this one gives me the best shave out of all of them.  </li>
            <li>This is the first review for Aubrey Organics products that is not 5-stars.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product during an organic shopping spree, expecting to have to take a cut in performance in exchange for</li>
            <li>the first couple of times i used it, i would get a bunch of minuscule cuts all over my face but didn&#x27;t think too much about it.</li>
            <li>this shave cream allows for a very close shave indeed.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t mind too much knowing i&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my face.</li>
            <li>and all of them are absolutely the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you shouldn&#x27;t really see any product on your face.  </li>
            <li>The scent in this cream, you can really smell the pine, but I also pick up an underlying funk.  </li>
            <li>cold again.s, all with excellent reviews, and</li>
            <li>My husband and I really like the scent...</li>
            <li>Honestly, I never gave it a fair shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried dozens of other products to keep my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin happy during shaving and this is literally the only one that has worked.</li>
            <li>Bad products leave me with blood loss, so only having irritation has been a nice happy medium for me.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s much gentler on my face than the old Mach 3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to re-shave those trouble spots repeatedly, called blade buffing, without the slightest hint of irritation.  </li>

            <li>I needed something that was all natural and after many tries with different shave creams, I found this one here.</li>
            <li>I realize natural healthy products often times end up falling short of the conventional garbage out there in one way or another.  </li>
            <li>For me, I have some trouble spots along my jaw line and under my chin that I can never seem to shave comfortably.  </li>
            <li>yes there is a little stinging as others have commented but nothing to scream about unless your face is super sensitive which might be the case for some</li>

            <li> I get a smooth shave with this product; even using a dull razor.  My skin feels fresh after shaving with this product.  Never say never, but I have no plans to use regular shave cream again.  This shave lotion has changed shaving from a  burdensome chore to another daily routine, like taking a good hot shower.  Nothing negative to say about this product.  I wish I would have found it a long time ago.</li>

We use their shampoo, conditioner, lotion, facial cleanser, deodorant, hair gel, and detangler - and all of them are absolutely the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving gel works well, but it does burn when you apply it to your skin. And I do use products that have that \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint, which I do enjoy. But this shaving gel burns more than it tingles.</li>
            <li> Great Shaving Cream. Smells good, organic, one of the best out there.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this and gave it to my boyfriend. He loved it and wanted me to order more.</li>
            <li> Works great and I like the menthol smell and tingle</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried dozens of other products to keep my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin happy during shaving and this is literally the only one that has worked. He breaks out, gets road rash, and his face burns like the dickens with anything else. If you or someone you love has sensitive skin, this is definitely worth a shot, and it smells nice too :)</li>
            <li> I must have a very sensitive face, because shaving is usually very painful for me.  I wince with almost every swipe of the razor.  I have tried many other different kinds of shaving cream, including several organic kinds, and this one gives me the best shave out of all of them.  It&#x27;s nice and slippery, with plenty of lubrication that lasts until the end of the shave, unlike most that start to dry out towards the end.  I first bought this product during an organic shopping spree, expecting to have to take a cut in performance in exchange for it being &#x27;good for me&#x27;. But  I was surprised instead to have the best shave of my life. I no longer dread my ordeals with a razor.</li>
            <li> Strong scent, protects from nicks and cuts while shaving. Soak the whole tub in hot water before applying for a nice smooth and warm shave.</li>
            <li> My husband has not stopped talking about this shaving cream since he got it!  He said it is absolutely the BEST he&#x27;s ever used!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I reviewed this cream previously, and I&#x27;m rewriting it now.  When I reviewed it before, I hadn&#x27;t taken the time to get to know how to use the cream properly.  Honestly, I never gave it a fair shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I set my mind to giving it an optimistic second chance. Keeping an open mind and using it in good faith, lo and behold, this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used to date.  I&#x27;ve tried Van Der Hagen luxury unscented, Mike&#x27;s Natural, Taconic Shave, and other quality, reputable products, and this one blows them all out of the water in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, you don&#x27;t use it like regular lathering shaving cream.  Wet the shave area thoroughly, dispense a small amount (pea size is what I use for one pass) and work it into the beard thoroughly.  It should appear as though your face is just wet, you shouldn&#x27;t really see any product on your face.  Start shaving.  That&#x27;s all there is to it. Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The menthol in this cream is fairly potent.  If you don&#x27;t like a brisk cooling sensation in your shave, avoid this product.  Try one of the other scents.  The scent in this cream, you can really smell the pine, but I also pick up an underlying funk.  This is the only reason I deducted a star from the rating.  I realize natural healthy products often times end up falling short of the conventional garbage out there in one way or another.  In my opinion, scent is really a nice place to fall short.  If the product outperforms everything else I&#x27;ve tried, I can deal with a little weird smell that washes off after the shave.  If it gave me a horrible shave and smelled awesome, I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efficacy: I use a double edge razor to shave.  It&#x27;s much gentler on my face than the old Mach 3 I was using.  However, DE shaving can be a little quirkier than using a cartridge razor.  For me, I have some trouble spots along my jaw line and under my chin that I can never seem to shave comfortably.  I&#x27;ve used many many products, all with excellent reviews, and some of them work better than others, but I always always end up with razor irritation in those spots.  Bad products leave me with blood loss, so only having irritation has been a nice happy medium for me.  Until I gave this cream a fair shake.  I&#x27;m able to re-shave those trouble spots repeatedly, called blade buffing, without the slightest hint of irritation.  I&#x27;m rubbing them now and they feel baby smooth and don&#x27;t hurt a bit.  That&#x27;s almost miraculous in my opinion.  The protection this cream offers is second to none.  It also gives respectable razor glide.  It cleans up easily.  And like I said, the cooling is awesome if you live in a hot place like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.  I&#x27;d love to give this a 5-star rating, but can&#x27;t in good conscience.  However, this is still hands down my favorite cream to use.  It&#x27;s cheap, it works perfectly, and it&#x27;s easy to use.  What more could I ask for?  I still enjoy lathering my soaps and creams with a brush.  I&#x27;ll keep using those, but this one is my new #1.  I&#x27;m going to pick up some other scents when the weather turns cold again.s, all with excellent reviews, and some of them work better than others, but I always always end up with razor irritation in those spots.
