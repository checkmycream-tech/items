            <li>The problem is they are not going to make it any more because it wasn&#x27;t a great seller.  </li>
            <li>It is a wonderful basic color that goes with everything and is very good for my skin tone.  </li>

            <li>I love this lipstick!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see it on Amazon</li>
            <li>Greatest i ever tried so far!</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition and relatively quick</li>
            <li>Just what I needed , love it..</li>
            <li>I love this product; I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li>My favorite color...</li>
            <li>in my favorite lip product.</li>
            <li>So glad I found these somewhere because they were discontinued.</li>
            <li>I love this color and lipstick.  </li>
            <li>So much better than lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because you apply it once in the morning</li>
            <li>and it lasts through most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Love this lipstick because it STAYS</li>
            <li>This is my favorite color</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried most of them.  </li>
            <li>So glad I can still get this color after it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>I hope they are not discontinuing this particular model number like they do with so many good things.</li>
            <li>and it does last all day which is so great.  </li>
            <li>This shade was hard to find but it is a perfect daytime shade when you aren&#x27;t too made up.</li>
            <li>I put it on in the morning and rarely have to touch it up by the end of the work day.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in two days and the price was better than drugstores and about the same as  Wall Mart.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been wearing this color for several years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about having to carry around two tubes, and, truth be told, I carry about 10 in various shades, but 599 is my absolute favorite shade.</li>
            <li>I recently discovered my favorite color, Adobe sand  was nowhere to be found.  </li>
            <li>I love that i can kiss my husband and it wont smudge to his cheeks or lips or even the white collared shirt!</li>
            <li>I first started using this type of lip color when Max Factor put it out.  </li>
            <li>If you eat something hot and greasy, that tend to remove it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Make sure you let the first (color) coat dry before putting on the gloss.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think that it causes irritation but</li>
            <li>I would advise always completely removing, I use eye makeup remover, before applying a fresh coat.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t stay on as much as I would like</li>
            <li>I usually apply it once but for full rich color all day long, you would need to freshen it more often.</li>
            <li>Color really does stay on all day, and as a high school teacher, I do not have time to re-apply lipstick throughout the day.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s wrong with Cover Girl for discontinuing a very popular color??</li>
            <li>I have wore several of the cover girl colors,switched to Adobe sand when they discontinued the other color I loved ,which is typical !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so dark a color that if it does start wearing a little it is barely noticeable,plan to buy more because I can&#x27;t find this color in stores anymore!</li>
            <li>Not too deep in the warm family, and with tiny little goldish flecks that are indistinguishable on your lips - they just add a little glow.</li>
            <li>Lasts much longer than other products I have tried.</li>

            <li> I love this color of this product and for some reason although the product is still around the specific color I like (#599) is impossible to find in stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> it does seem to dry my lips.  </li>
            <li> I felt it was old , a little dried up.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding my color</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time finding it</li>
            <li> at least no orange tint to it,&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> I was so elated when I found the &amp;#34;Adobe Sand #599&amp;#34;, apparently CoverGirl is not making this shade any longer.  :(</li>
            <li> It arrived late, and then when I got it it was the wrong color.</li>
            <li> Of course, since it&#x27;s getting hard to find in the stores that probably means that Cover Girl is going to discontinue it!!</li>
            <li> It has become difficult to find, so ordering online works well for me.  </li>
            <li> Sad because have discontinued this color, though.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it looks like they&#x27;ve discontinued this shade.</li>
            <li> Poor me!  </li>
            <li> Very sorry that it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>

            <li> I know this has been discontinued from stores I felt it was old , a little dried up.</li>
            <li> I love this product; I&#x27;ve used it for years. It lasts all day, even through meals. I have trouble finding my color so I ordered through Amazon. It arrived in two days and the price was better than drugstores and about the same as  Wall Mart.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade. Just enough color. Very sorry that it&#x27;s being discontinued. Stockpile it now!</li>
            <li> I usually apply it once but for full rich color all day long, you would need to freshen it more often. This product is being discontinued but I like its staying power and I like its color.</li>
            <li> My favorite color...in my favorite lip product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been wearing this color for several years.  It has become difficult to find, so ordering online works well for me.  Of course, since it&#x27;s getting hard to find in the stores that probably means that Cover Girl is going to discontinue it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and I hope they never stop making it. Color really does stay on all day, and as a high school teacher, I do not have time to re-apply lipstick throughout the day. I&#x27;m not crazy about having to carry around two tubes, and, truth be told, I carry about 10 in various shades, but 599 is my absolute favorite shade.

            <li> at least no orange tint to it,&lt;br /&gt;i like the color,&lt;br /&gt;im 62 years old,&lt;br /&gt;tired of ordering these that has orange tint to them,&lt;br /&gt;this was is great !!!</li>
            <li> It arrived late, and then when I got it it was the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I love it! Truly does outlast more expensive ones like from Mac. Sad because have discontinued this color, though.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition and relatively quick</li>
            <li> Excellent product, bout not my color</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Cover Girl Outlast for over ten years.  I recently discovered my favorite color, Adobe sand  was nowhere to be found.  I looked on Amazon and found what seems to be the last three.  What&#x27;s wrong with Cover Girl for discontinuing a very popular color??</li>
            <li> So glad I found these somewhere because they were discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have wore several of the cover girl colors,switched to Adobe sand when they discontinued the other color I loved ,which is typical ! But this color states in me from 5:30 am till 5 or later pm! It&#x27;s not so dark a color that if it does start wearing a little it is barely noticeable,plan to buy more because I can&#x27;t find this color in stores anymore! Great product! Karen</li>
            <li> Greatest i ever tried so far! I love that i can kiss my husband and it wont smudge to his cheeks or lips or even the white collared shirt!</li>
            <li> Color I wanted.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> I love this color and lipstick.  I wish Cover Girl would start making this color again.</li>
            <li> So much better than lipstick.  I first started using this type of lip color when Max Factor put it out.  When they quit shipping it to the US, I emailed them and they suggested Cover Girl.  I put it on in the morning and rarely have to touch it up by the end of the work day.  If you eat something hot and greasy, that tend to remove it.  The best thing is that if I am eating finger food, I don&#x27;t get lipstick smudges all over my fingers.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it looks like they&#x27;ve discontinued this shade.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this color of this product and for some reason although the product is still around the specific color I like (#599) is impossible to find in stores in my area.  I was thrilled to see it on Amazon and I stocked up since I wear it almost every day.  It is a wonderful basic color that goes with everything and is very good for my skin tone.  I don&#x27;t really think that it causes irritation but it does seem to dry my lips.  I love this product because you apply it once in the morning and it lasts through most of the day.  Make sure you let the first (color) coat dry before putting on the gloss.  Then you are set for the day.  If you want you can add some gloss throughout the day but the color stays on and does not get on cups, or silverware and does not wear off.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick because it STAYS ON!!...allll day. This shade was hard to find but it is a perfect daytime shade when you aren&#x27;t too made up.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color and I have a hard time finding it so whenever I see it for sale I buy it.  I hope they are not discontinuing this particular model number like they do with so many good things.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! It is close to indestructible and the color is great!</li>
            <li> I apply once and that is it for the day. I would advise always completely removing, I use eye makeup remover, before applying a fresh coat.</li>
            <li> CoverGirl Outlast is the longest wearing lipstick ever...and I&#x27;ve tried most of them.  It is still on the next morning, sometimes.</li>
            <li> I loved Cover Girl Outlast.  The only color I ever bought was Adobe Sand and it does last all day which is so great.  The problem is they are not going to make it any more because it wasn&#x27;t a great seller.  Poor me!  I bought the last two on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay on as much as I would like</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> So glad I can still get this color after it was discontinued. Thanks Amazon!</li>
