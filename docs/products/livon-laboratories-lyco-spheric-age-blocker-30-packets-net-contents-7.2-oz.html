    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Bought this because liposomal is supposed to be the best form of oral absorption.  </li>
            <li>Best when used with Liv</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for that.</li>
            <li>You can read all the reviews on how great this stuff is.  </li>
            <li>This product is really great.</li>
            <li>This works just as good as any prescription antiviral</li>
            <li>I gave it two weeks to be fair but never once felt it performed as well as the AGE Blocker.</li>
            <li>I have been taking the Vitamin C for 2 months and the others for a month and my skin shows the most difference with folks asking me if I have had laser procedures on my skin!  </li>
            <li>LivOn Labs is top drawer!  </li>
            <li>thanks for the excellent products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have more energy through out the day with it.  </li>
            <li>The results were more than I could have hoped for or imagined.</li>
            <li>I tried a similar product that “claimed” to have “the world’s best vitamins”</li>
            <li>so worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the family of LivOn products and hopeful that I will be happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I&#x27;ve tried the vitiman C version and it was excellent, but this one is completely bitter.</li>
            <li>I am so much clearer, I have more drive and a better attitude.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone, healthy or not!  </li>
            <li>What a miracle that I was able to quickly go from constant pain, weakness and lethargy to being fully energized, see proof of better health, and even a notable difference in my skin complexion!  </li>
            <li>This Lypospheric Vitamin C is more easily absorbed so more efficiently effective than other forms...supposedly even better than intravenous, and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Make sure you put the juice in the glass first or the lipo will stick to the glass.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all true.  </li>
            <li>Good energy overall.</li>
            <li>It’s been a tremendous blessing</li>
            <li>, I threw the product out rather quickly.</li>
            <li>All this hullabaloo over some water, magnesium, manganese and several preservatives and flavorings that have been proven (especially stevia) to wreak all sorts of havoc on the immune systems of anyone with any kind of sensitivity to ANYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;WE HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THIS!</li>
            <li>daily for over two years now and have seen nothing but great results in my overall health.  </li>
            <li>I purchase at the store has higher levels of b</li>
            <li>Completely natural and legal!!!</li>
            <li>It really is.  </li>
            <li>Just put an ounce or 2 of juice in a glass-not too much.  </li>
            <li>Swirl the glass to get the Lipo floating and drink it fast.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for 15 days, I started not feeling well after day three, but didn&#x27;t think much of it.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Important part of my daily regime of slect supplements!</li>
            <li>After not feeling quite right for several days I decided to stop taking this and started feeling like myself within two days.  </li>
            <li>Small packages with huge results !</li>
            <li>I completely believe that these products are ones that I will use forever.  </li>
            <li>Nd whack off a few dollars plus have free shipping</li>
            <li>I really dont feel any different, but i do take it every morning.  </li>
            <li>I take this B-vitamin plus cinnamon extract on an empty stomach first thing every morning with an ounce of fruit juice.  </li>

            <li> I know that the science behind these Lypo-Spheric products is sound, but the price is a bit high and it tastes awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve tried the vitiman C version and it was excellent, but this one is completely bitter. In terms of efficacy, i haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment, but the taste is so terrible I gag a bit when trying to get it down. Maybe it&#x27;s off?</li>
            <li> You can read all the reviews on how great this stuff is.  It really is.  Read Thomas Levy&#x27;s books on Vitamin C.  It&#x27;s all true.  I wanted to tell people how to take this stuff without tasting it.  If you mix it or shake it, it does taste bad.  Just put an ounce or 2 of juice in a glass-not too much.  Squeeze in the C.  (I put 2 Cs and an AGE blocker in at once).  Swirl the glass to get the Lipo floating and drink it fast.  Use just enough juice that you can drink it like a shot.  Don&#x27;t mix it, just swish the glass around with all the contents and drink.  You will taste 90 juice.  Make sure you put the juice in the glass first or the lipo will stick to the glass.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend.  I tried it for 15 days, I started not feeling well after day three, but didn&#x27;t think much of it.  After not feeling quite right for several days I decided to stop taking this and started feeling like myself within two days.  It may be  consequence I don&#x27;t know, will try it again and finish it off in another week or so.  I find that my b complex I purchase at the store has higher levels of b then this product and it is less money and I have more energy through out the day with it.  Won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Really? All this hullabaloo over some water, magnesium, manganese and several preservatives and flavorings that have been proven (especially stevia) to wreak all sorts of havoc on the immune systems of anyone with any kind of sensitivity to ANYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;WE HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THIS! &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; flavoring~ do your research people.&lt;br /&gt;Now I know why I have been reactive and once again learned, do not buy EVER without reading the ingredients no matter what the hype. sigh.</li>
            <li> Bought this because liposomal is supposed to be the best form of oral absorption.  However the next time I go pee after taking this my pee is fluorescent yellow / green, just as it would be when taking a vitamin B Complex or Multi pill.  I feel no difference so I would not purchase again.  Also don&#x27;t like soya by products that are added.</li>
            <li> I take this B-vitamin plus cinnamon extract on an empty stomach first thing every morning with an ounce of fruit juice.  I find it easier to swallow than big capsules or tablets.  It has kept my digestive health healthier - no more bloating or gas.  Good energy overall. I have recommended it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the family of LivOn products and hopeful that I will be happy with the results.  I completely believe that these products are ones that I will use forever.  I have been taking the Vitamin C for 2 months and the others for a month and my skin shows the most difference with folks asking me if I have had laser procedures on my skin!  Not only do I get to answer no, but I wear 1/2 the makeup foundation I was using!  I&#x27;m 53 and believe this has taken years off my looks!  thanks for the excellent products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give this a 5 star is that I need additional time in usage.</li>
            <li> Best when used with Liv On Lypo Spheric C and Liv On Lypo Spheric GSH and Liv on Lypo Spheric R-ALA. Read up on these products on  LivonLabs.com.</li>
            <li> Convient!.and so worth every penny!! I believe in this product and take it everyday,as a preventive!! I have a chronic virus,lives dormant!! just waiting for my immune system to weaken!! I will NOT stop taking this everyday!! It&#x27;s a war,a battle!! This works just as good as any prescription antiviral I have ever been on!!Thank you Liveon!!</li>
            <li> Small packages with huge results !&lt;br /&gt;I always have 1 package in stock Of each !&lt;br /&gt;Blessed be the day I start use it !</li>
            <li> This Lypospheric Vitamin C is more easily absorbed so more efficiently effective than other forms...supposedly even better than intravenous, and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using LivOn&#x27;s Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C and Vitamin B (AGE Blocker) daily for over two years now and have seen nothing but great results in my overall health.  Since trying these products, not only did I see immediate improvements in energy, but shortly after I also noticed that I was more mobile, less sick and felt great overall. Basically, I got my life back.  What a miracle that I was able to quickly go from constant pain, weakness and lethargy to being fully energized, see proof of better health, and even a notable difference in my skin complexion!  I highly recommend this product to anyone, healthy or not!  It’s been a tremendous blessing and I wouldn’t trust any other brand out there; trust me, I’ve tried them and they simply do not work like this product does!!</li>
            <li> I was so burnt out and lethargic that people were noticing, and my work was showing it. My sister turned me onto LIVON Labs AGE Blocker. The results were more than I could have hoped for or imagined. I am so much clearer, I have more drive and a better attitude. Completely natural and legal!!! I truly do not know how I ever managed without it! In fact, one weekend I had a complete meltdown when I discovered I was totally out (It takes about a week to get it by mail) I tried a similar product that “claimed” to have “the world’s best vitamins” it was Liposomal Vitamin B12 from MAXHEALTH Labs. I gave it two weeks to be fair but never once felt it performed as well as the AGE Blocker. Lesson learned…. . I am back to the AGE Blocker and I could not recommend it highly enough to those of you</li>
            <li> Keep the price down Nd whack off a few dollars plus have free shipping n it&#x27;s a winner no doubt</li>
            <li> Important part of my daily regime of slect supplements! Great Product!</li>
            <li> I really dont feel any different, but i do take it every morning.  It is asolutely the worst tasting thing ever.  Orange Juice is about the only thing that can cut it enough to drink.</li>
            <li> This product is really great. It tastes nasty though. Really bitter. I mix it with banana and then it&#x27;s palatable. It does work well with msm though. It increases the effects of msm by detoxing as the msm opens up cells to allow toxins out. This is perfect for that.</li>
            <li> LivOn Labs is top drawer!  The lypo speheric transport assures that the assimilation is thorough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will continue to support my system with this AGE Blocker, a product  that will enhance just about anyone&#x27;s program!</li>
            <li> Taste terrible...beyond terrible. I hate to throw money out the door and usually find a way to make something work, but this was so bad, I threw the product out rather quickly. It might have worked , if I could get myself to drink it.</li>
