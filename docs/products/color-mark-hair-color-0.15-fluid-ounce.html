    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hair crayons, mascara and eye shadow to cover gray and this product is the best (albeit a bit pricy).</li>
            <li>This is a great product and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, cover up grays!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it and with the price!</li>
            <li>This is the best gray root cover I have found yet.</li>
            <li>Excellent item with a good color and</li>
            <li>Great for in between colorings.  </li>
            <li>The applicator is what is so great.  </li>
            <li>The accompanying comb is great for blending afterwards, or holding in place the area you want to cover.  </li>
            <li>It works good though covering gray when I part my hair.</li>
            <li>So I buy GreyFree Light Brown, which is the perfect color, and use the applicator from the ColorMark bottle.</li>
            <li>When I see alittle gray I just brush this on and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Seems to stay on well and good color match.</li>
            <li>It looks good.</li>
            <li>good stuff -- does the trick in week 3 after my dye job</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very, very much for  this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I rather liked the gray coming in</li>
            <li>Loving the color of my gray skunk stripe and can&#x27;t wait until it gets longer</li>
            <li>This handy item is easy to use and works well!  </li>
            <li>So this was very easy for me to obtain</li>
            <li>It was easy not sticky and after 5 minutes or so, touchable without coming off on my hands!</li>
            <li>(maybe a tactic so that I will need more?)</li>
            <li>However, I love the applicator.  </li>
            <li>for touching up grays.</li>
            <li>Probably lasts about 3 days at the most.</li>
            <li>It does really work and great price</li>
            <li>I have tried so many, too.</li>
            <li>The product worked well and was easy to use...</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product when you can&#x27;t get to your next appointment in time!  </li>
            <li>Definitely good to have on hand for those times when you realize you have a grey hanging out.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and the wand is very maneuverable.</li>
            <li>First of all the name, as I sneered riiiiiiggght!  </li>
            <li>It washes right out when you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came in more colors, as it is really impossible to get a perfect color match.</li>
            <li>My latest dye job ended up with a LOT of red.  </li>
            <li>I used the mascara wand on most areas, and the comb for those places next to skin/face.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t look like a skunk;-)</li>
            <li>I used my short-tail comb and it seemed to blend right in with the overly red dyed hair, looking just fine.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps because my hair is dark brown almost black the color was perfect for me .</li>
            <li>my reddish roots looked a bit strange, but it was better than gray.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was thicker and not so liquid, because when I need to use it on the fine hair next to my face, it always stains my scalp.</li>
            <li>In all fairness maybe I have too much gray.</li>
            <li>and I really like this</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I am ready to let my gray come in now.  </li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>I decided to dye my hair until he was older.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY want one in MY color, but I dare not waste another $20.  Boooo!</li>
            <li>Now if I could make the gray come in a little faster  :)</li>
            <li>This is the only temporary cover up that works for me, its easy to apply, dries really quickly and most importantly isn&#x27;t sticky or dries into hard flakes which was the problem with the other similar products I have tried.</li>
            <li>it just buys me  a few more weeks before I have to go to the salon.</li>
            <li>good for covering up a few grey roots.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Have to say I was pleasantly surprised on all counts!  </li>
            <li>I conspicuously stood there bending down to look in the mirror to touch up my streak , which runs down the center of my head,dabbing at my roots , then using my own rattail comb to smooth and distribute the product through my hair.</li>
            <li>I never dyed my hair until I was 42 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>A soft pad, for dotting the color on.  </li>
            <li>The liquid stays on until I shampoo my hair, and it rinses out completely, which I also like.</li>
            <li>I am one of those people that has had gray hair since my mid 20&#x27;s ,so when I went in for my monthly foray to BEAUTY FIRST to look for a different hair mascara</li>
            <li>the little comb was useful, it was what I excepted and came in time.</li>
            <li>This covers my grays completely until your next shampoo.  </li>
            <li>, and when it finally arrived, it was the Auburn, NOT Dark Brown.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read to reviews on this poduct before purchasing it. It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. In all fairness maybe I have too much gray. The little comb is difficult to use, and if you&#x27;re not careful you&#x27;ll end up with spots of obvious color on your scalp. I would not reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wish it was thicker and not so liquid, because when I need to use it on the fine hair next to my face, it always stains my scalp. Even when I use the comb, the hair color gets on and thru the comb and my scalp gets stained. It works good though covering gray when I part my hair.</li>
            <li> This actually works and has no smell like other products do, have bought it over and over again</li>
            <li> This covers my grays completely until your next shampoo.  It&#x27;s a great product when you can&#x27;t get to your next appointment in time!  My grays grow in after a week and a half and this extends my next visit to once a month...otherwise I&#x27;d be broke financially.</li>
            <li> This is the only temporary cover up that works for me, its easy to apply, dries really quickly and most importantly isn&#x27;t sticky or dries into hard flakes which was the problem with the other similar products I have tried. It takes a few minutes to dry and you comb or brush through it (or not) and you cant even tell its on. With other products, my hair always got flaky and stiff where I applied it.  I&#x27;ve had gray hair since my late teens and first I used this as a cover up for the few grays and now use it in between hair color sessions.</li>
            <li> I ordered the ColorMark product at the suggestion of my hair stylist, to touch up a few *ahem* silver roots.  It took FOREVER to get it (maybe a tactic so that I will need more?), and when it finally arrived, it was the Auburn, NOT Dark Brown.  The reciept stated their ridiculous return policy (something like it must be returned within 14 days, unopened, etc), but their was NO information ANYWHERE about how or where to return it.  There was no phone number, website, address, nada!!  So in a moment of sheer desperation just days before my upcoming dye job, I used it anyway.  The product worked well and was easy to use...my reddish roots looked a bit strange, but it was better than gray.  I REALLY want one in MY color, but I dare not waste another $20.  Boooo!</li>
            <li> O.K. I am one of those people that has had gray hair since my mid 20&#x27;s ,so when I went in for my monthly foray to BEAUTY FIRST to look for a different hair mascara I was told about \\&quot;GRAY HAIR GONE INSTANTLY\\&quot;! First of all the name, as I sneered riiiiiiggght!  Then they offered me a tester. I conspicuously stood there bending down to look in the mirror to touch up my streak , which runs down the center of my head,dabbing at my roots , then using my own rattail comb to smooth and distribute the product through my hair. I was stunned. It was easy not sticky and after 5 minutes or so, touchable without coming off on my hands! Perhaps because my hair is dark brown almost black the color was perfect for me . It didn&#x27;t find it sticky or hard to use and i will keep a constant supply at hand. Thank you very, very much for  this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have tried the medium and dark brown, and apparently my hair is in the middle.  However, I love the applicator.  So I buy GreyFree Light Brown, which is the perfect color, and use the applicator from the ColorMark bottle.</li>
            <li> When I see alittle gray I just brush this on and I&#x27;m good to go. It washes right out when you wash your hair. I like it. It&#x27;s not meant to be permanant. it just buys me  a few more weeks before I have to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> This handy item is easy to use and works well!  It dries a bit lighter than the color shows so keep that in mind when you make your color selection.</li>
            <li> I was told by the salon that I had purchased this product from before that they could no longer get it.&lt;br /&gt;I went on Amazon and voila, there it was. So this was very easy for me to obtain and I really like this&lt;br /&gt;product for touching up grays. It works very well. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now.  Great for in between colorings.  Two problems though - smells a little odd and if you work out and start sweating - don&#x27;t touch that area because it will bleed thru.  Don&#x27;t touch any towels either because it will stain.</li>
            <li> Excellent item with a good color and the little comb was useful, it was what I excepted and came in time. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now. When I&#x27;ve tried other products, I still come back to this one as my &amp;#34;temporary&amp;#34; daily solution to cover grays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the mascara type sticks and brushes, and found this application easier and cleaner.  Seems to stay on well and good color match.</li>
            <li> The marker is easier to use, but for the price, I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the liquid. If you are careful in just getting a little bit on the sponge, there&#x27;s no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hair crayons, mascara and eye shadow to cover gray and this product is the best (albeit a bit pricy).</li>
            <li> This product does what is says it will do.  It temporarily covers individual gray hairs.  The color was correct for my hair color.  I would recommend, and re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I never dyed my hair until I was 42 yrs old.  I rather liked the gray coming in but my son&#x27;s classmates wondered if I was the &#x27;grandma&#x27; or the &#x27;mom&#x27; when my stepmother and I went to his school.  I decided to dye my hair until he was older.  I am ready to let my gray come in now.  Loving the color of my gray skunk stripe and can&#x27;t wait until it gets longer but for now, sometimes I need to do something to assist the grow out process.  I used to have dark brown hair.  My latest dye job ended up with a LOT of red.  I was not only unsure about the product in concept but working with my hair color.. hmmmmm.  Have to say I was pleasantly surprised on all counts!  Easy to apply.  I used the mascara wand on most areas, and the comb for those places next to skin/face.  I combed it through and after a very short time it dried.  I used my short-tail comb and it seemed to blend right in with the overly red dyed hair, looking just fine.  Very satisfied.  Now if I could make the gray come in a little faster  :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, cover up grays! I&#x27;m happy with it and with the price!</li>
            <li> The applicator is what is so great.  Not like a mascara brush, which only tangles and clumps your hair.  A soft pad, for dotting the color on.  The accompanying comb is great for blending afterwards, or holding in place the area you want to cover.  Just be careful to dab on very softly or you will have big black spots showing on your scalp!</li>
            <li> It looks good. A little heavy but doesnt flake off.. Probably lasts about 3 days at the most. good for covering up a few grey roots.  Definitely good to have on hand for those times when you realize you have a grey hanging out.</li>
            <li> good stuff -- does the trick in week 3 after my dye job so I don&#x27;t look like a skunk;-)</li>
            <li> This works well and adheres well to the hair.  It is like mascara for your hair.  Just be careful not to tip the bottle because the liquid will definitely spill.</li>
            <li> It does really work and great price</li>
            <li> This is the best gray root cover I have found yet. I have tried so many, too. This works very well. It is easy to apply and the wand is very maneuverable. I did have to learn not to stain my scalp, so it takes some practice. The liquid stays on until I shampoo my hair, and it rinses out completely, which I also like. It does not permanently stain my hair or scalp. I do wish it came in more colors, as it is really impossible to get a perfect color match. However, this helps me get by between colorings, especially in the front by my part. It is expensive, but it works!</li>
