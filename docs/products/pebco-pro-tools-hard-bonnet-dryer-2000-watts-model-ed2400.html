            <li>This dryer Is fantastic!!  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice hair dryer.</li>
            <li>the temperature is good, not using it anymore got a standing dryer that I love</li>
            <li>Amazon, through no fault of their own, returned my s/h costs I paid to eStores.</li>
            <li>In terms of Amazon, I love the website, and this review does not reflect the services which I have received from them.</li>
            <li>Things I Don&#x27;t Love:  </li>
            <li>then the top air vents  </li>
            <li>I always felt it really wasn&#x27;t that great anyway.</li>
            <li>the more watts</li>
            <li>the more heat the better</li>
            <li>I purchased a Thermal Ionic hair dryer by BaByliss Pro and love it.</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>other then that its a great product and a great price.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I have been on a quest looking for a good hair dryer, but also one that was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The set up is easy and it&#x27;s not as noisy as some dryers I have used.</li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>Its comfortable, large, spacious hood and fast drying capabilities were welcome features.</li>
            <li>the cheap setting knob broke.  </li>
            <li>-  The bonnet fits my 2 inch gray rollers comfortably.  </li>
            <li>I bought a second one because for the price, its still a great investment.</li>
            <li>The first week was working fine.</li>
            <li>I used it only once and was very pleased until.....</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s round, light and nice and compact and seems like a great lasting product.</li>
            <li>(because I have very long and think curly hair not because my head is large lol)</li>
            <li>and it is important that I get the tracks dry as well as my own hair.  </li>
            <li>So make sure you order directly from Amazon...</li>
            <li>it is worth the time and effort.</li>
            <li>There is no cold.   </li>
            <li>its worth every cent.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>After searching for over a year for a decent hair dryer, I purchased this one based on the great reviews and the average of 4 out of 5 stars on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment, easy payment and product was new and as described.</li>
            <li>Warning: Blue Beez charges 49.99, $10 more than the Amazon price of 39.99.</li>
            <li>It has an air vent on top that you can open and close.    </li>
            <li>It gets hot</li>
            <li>-  I was worried about the air vents only being on top of the dryer</li>
            <li>Cons: the back air vents which most dryer don&#x27;t have seem to throw out the most air,because the holes are bigger</li>
            <li>overall its a ok product</li>
            <li>fit in the dryer completely with space.</li>
            <li>First of all, I purchased it from eStores-LLC.</li>
            <li>pros: Large(can fit large rollers underneath), not extremely noisy, 3 settings: low,med,high.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to put it back on.</li>
            <li>My wife liked the first one I bought her a few months ago.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer has a large hood so it can be used with large rollers.</li>
            <li>Finally a decent dryer with no fuss!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this dryer, finally found a dryer thay will dry the back of my head as well as the top.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like about this dryer is that the high setting is not overly hot.</li>
            <li>for such a cheap price i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>-  It&#x27;s really lightweight.      </li>
            <li>drys hair fast    </li>
            <li>Maybe that was too much.  </li>
            <li>I could barely fit my entire head, with curlers on, in it.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product because the bonnet is to high!</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Needed a new hood dryer after my Conair stopped blowing hot air.</li>
            <li>and after i flat iron my hair comes out soft and with volume (which i love).    </li>
            <li>I bought this because it has more watts than the other dryers at Amazon</li>
            <li>its a pretty solid powerful dryer that will get the job done.</li>
            <li>Maybe running it on high for an hour is too much.  </li>
            <li>Thus far the knob has not come off but the heat is no longer hot at the highest level.  </li>
            <li>, why should I complain since I received my money back, however that wasn&#x27;t completely true since they didn&#x27;t return my s/h costs from a defective product they sold me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I purchased the Pebco Pro-tools 2000 Watt Dryer directly from Blue Beez who had the product available.  </li>
            <li>I ran it on high.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on a frequent basis or really over the time of about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>This fits 2\\&quot; and 3\\&quot; rollers comfortably and takes only 30-40 minutes to dry our hair vs the 1hr PLUS time with the Conair and the hot air is not unbearable.</li>
            <li>I will try the dryer again but not run it on high for the entire session, just the first 30 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>No problem if it had been shipped and returned to the manufacturer new...</li>
            <li>but, after more than 20 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;The difference here is that it&#x27;s not square heavy and clunky like the old school ones</li>
            <li>I can actually sit under this dryer for one hour without complaining that its too hot.     </li>
            <li>The settings are hot enough but, it dries as well as any industrial drier.</li>
            <li>Now you need to go to salon for those and get ok brands at home, but whatever it does what it says it suppose to, what can you do make one yourself??? :-/</li>
            <li>The holes are only on the top half of the machine, so heat is not evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good dryer especially those who are looking for a dryer with vent holes in the back to dry the back of your head.</li>
            <li>tested on my boyfriend hair it came out so soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li>n don&#x27;t have water near it</li>
            <li>the plug is pretty long...</li>
            <li>A bit loud</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like about this dryer is that you can&#x27;t adjust the hight of the bonnet, I have a 10 year old and a 8 year old that I use  it on also and the bonnet is too high, so I had to go out and get a shorter table to sit it on and with the help of pillow</li>
            <li>I chosed the dryer because it said that it was quiet and can dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The high heat is medium and the medium heat is low.</li>
            <li>- The \\&quot;variable\\&quot; temp control is actually just low, medium and high.  </li>
            <li>Gift for my 91 yr old grandmother who only uses a &amp;#34;bonnet&amp;#34; dryer.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of drying my hair which is thick and past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>industrial).&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of the hair dryers that my mom used on my hair when I was a little girl Lady Dazey which was very large and square and eventually fell apart</li>
            <li>The following week, the high temperature doesn&#x27;t work only medium or low.</li>
            <li>it dried my hair and with very large curlers on my head</li>
            <li>I bought this because I thought this would cut my drying time in half since my other dryers could notdtry the back of my hair, but know it was the same amount of time except it was able to heat the back of my hair.</li>
            <li>Hi...just wanted to warn any of you about a recent purchase I made directly from Blue Beez.  </li>
            <li>Most dryer that I&#x27;ve tried only dried the top of my head which made it frustrated.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer dries my hair much faster than the previous dryer.  </li>
            <li>I bought one from hot tools two years ago and barely used it because the hood was so small</li>
            <li>The high setting is too hot, the medium setting is too hot and the low setting is cold o_0 and 3</li>

            <li> but the knob on the top of the dryer had been broken off and was missing - not even in the box.  </li>
            <li> it has 3settings built all 3feels exactly the same ,and if u move just a little bit the hood falls right on your face ,so you might need to get up n fix it all over again.that is very frustrating,</li>
            <li> I was surprised because the hood looks so little in pictures.  </li>
            <li> so when you use it from long time the plastic starts to feels soft and very hot.kinda scarey because you can shock your head fortunately,so don&#x27;t over use it</li>
            <li> This dryer got my hair dry and the tracks dry.  </li>
            <li> so it takes about two hours to dry</li>
            <li> If you like watching TV while you dry your hair FORGET ABOUT IT.</li>
            <li> Also, the machine is so loud, it sounds like a small twin propeller plane in your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is built well, however the last one i had just stopped working one day.(I had been using it for less than a year)</li>
            <li> The dryer had a crack in it and the product brochure was written on it from a possible previous owner.</li>
            <li> And to dry all my hair was an extreme task.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> So unlike a lot of other hard bonnets, it actually gets the back and the bottom rollers dry.  </li>
            <li> It lighter than I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be curious to see if this one lasts longer.</li>
            <li> i brought the dryer because i usually flat iron my hair and my hair comes out stiff with the dryer it cuts down on flat ironing time</li>
            <li> It usually takes my hair about two hours to dry, but it only takes about 45 minutes with this dryer!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair any quicker the a cheaper priced dryer, not worth the price save your money.</li>
            <li> I do not have thick hair and the dryer took double the amount of time that it takes to normally dry my hair.</li>

            <li> I used it only once and was very pleased until.....the cheap setting knob broke.  The plastic is basically too weak to change the settings.  So if you don&#x27;t mind resulting to using a pliers to power on and off...its a pretty solid powerful dryer that will get the job done.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer dries my hair much faster than the previous dryer.  It has several settings but I only use \\&quot;High.\\&quot;  It does the work it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> The first week was working fine. The following week, the high temperature doesn&#x27;t work only medium or low. A waste of money</li>
            <li> Hi...just wanted to warn any of you about a recent purchase I made directly from Blue Beez.  Amazon&#x27;s supply was \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; so I purchased the Pebco Pro-tools 2000 Watt Dryer directly from Blue Beez who had the product available.  Warning: Blue Beez charges 49.99, $10 more than the Amazon price of 39.99. When I asked Blue Beez to honor the Amazon price, they declined.  So make sure you order directly from Amazon...it is worth the time and effort.I have not received my dryer...I just wanted to put the warning out there....so my review is based on the lack of customer service with Blue Beez. In terms of Amazon, I love the website, and this review does not reflect the services which I have received from them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this online after my Ion Hard Bonnet from Sally&#x27;s broke (It has the same design as the Belson dryers and it was ridiculously tricky to close. I always thought I was gonna break it and one day I did.) So far I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.  I&#x27;m black with relaxed hair that I deep condition and rollerset every week, so I use bonnet dryers a lot.    What I Like:  -  It&#x27;s simple to close.  -  The bonnet fits my 2 inch gray rollers comfortably.  I was surprised because the hood looks so little in pictures.  -  It has an air vent on top that you can open and close.    -  It gets hot but it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re vacationing in the Devil&#x27;s playland, (like the Ion did.)  -  I was worried about the air vents only being on top of the dryer BUT there are actually additional vents in the back (where the bonnet meets the neck).  So unlike a lot of other hard bonnets, it actually gets the back and the bottom rollers dry.  -  It&#x27;s really lightweight.      Things I Don&#x27;t Love:  - The \\&quot;variable\\&quot; temp control is actually just low, medium and high.  There is no cold.   -  Also the temp control button came off during my second time using it.  It&#x27;s not that big of a deal b/c it&#x27;s easy to put it back on.</li>
            <li> I had this product for less than 6 months.  The hair dryer has a large hood so it can be used with large rollers.The set up is easy and it&#x27;s not as noisy as some dryers I have used. It lighter than I expected but the heat is very good. I did have concerns about the knob due to past reviews.  Thus far the knob has not come off but the heat is no longer hot at the highest level.  The high heat is medium and the medium heat is low. And no, it did not drop on the floor or anywhere. Very disappointed after less than a year use.  Review revised 3/06/10.</li>
            <li> This has been a great dryer. It dries my hair pretty quickly. It is built well, however the last one i had just stopped working one day.(I had been using it for less than a year) Nothing on the outside seemed broken, i just turned the knob and it would not turn on. I bought a second one because for the price, its still a great investment. I&#x27;ll be curious to see if this one lasts longer.</li>
            <li> purchase dryer on February 1st got it the 6th. tested on my boyfriend hair it came out so soft and shinny. next day tested out on my hair it dyed my hair in under 20 minutes and i hair longer than shoulder length so i thought that was great. i brought the dryer because i usually flat iron my hair and my hair comes out stiff with the dryer it cuts down on flat ironing time and after i flat iron my hair comes out soft and with volume (which i love).    Pro: drys hair fast    Cons: the back air vents which most dryer don&#x27;t have seem to throw out the most air,because the holes are bigger then the top air vents  all the air escapes from the back.     other then that its a great product and a great price. its worth every cent.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice hair dryer. I have been on a quest looking for a good hair dryer, but also one that was reasonably priced. I am definitely happy with my purchase.    pros: Large(can fit large rollers underneath), not extremely noisy, 3 settings: low,med,high. Another thing I like about this dryer is that the high setting is not overly hot. I can actually sit under this dryer for one hour without complaining that its too hot.     cons: None    I am definitely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this dryer in February 2010.  In December 2010, the dryer stopped working.  Part of the base of the dryer melted and a hold about the circumference of a pencil developed on the base of the dyer.  I used the dryer about once a week for a 45 to 60 minute session.  I ran it on high.  Maybe that was too much.  I have a hair weave and it is important that I get the tracks dry as well as my own hair.  This dryer got my hair dry and the tracks dry.  Maybe running it on high for an hour is too much.  I emailed the Amazon seller for warranty information today.  Will see what happens.  I will try the dryer again but not run it on high for the entire session, just the first 30 minutes or so.  Maybe that will help.</li>
            <li> the bonnet doesn&#x27;t adjust and then the spring pops out the temperature is good, not using it anymore got a standing dryer that I love</li>
            <li> Needed a new hood dryer after my Conair stopped blowing hot air. I always felt it really wasn&#x27;t that great anyway. Well was trying to decide between this one and the 125 dollar Pebco on wheels. Decided to take a chance on this one especially with the price. This works absolutely great.    My daughter and I have relaxed hair- mine shoulder length, hers longer. This fits 2\\&quot; and 3\\&quot; rollers comfortably and takes only 30-40 minutes to dry our hair vs the 1hr PLUS time with the Conair and the hot air is not unbearable. Especially since my DD and I both dislike sitting under a dryer.    It has helped me save money which is why I rated it a 5. It&#x27;s only the cost of 1 wash and roller set. I could not beat that at all.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this Bonnet Dryer.  The hood would not latch and stay in place!!!! It then fell apart and I have contacted the company to get a return authorization and they have not replied.  It has been a week since my request.  Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has more watts than the other dryers at Amazon my hair curly so it takes about two hours to dry .so the more watts the more heat the better that&#x27;s what I think....it has 3settings built all 3feels exactly the same ,and if u move just a little bit the hood falls right on your face ,so you might need to get up n fix it all over again.that is very frustrating,o yess it&#x27;s all plastic so when you use it from long time the plastic starts to feels soft and very hot.kinda scarey because you can shock your head fortunately,so don&#x27;t over use it n don&#x27;t have water near it the plug is pretty long...overall its a ok product not very safe I feel..</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer awhile back.  It does a good job of drying my hair which is thick and past my shoulders.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is that it&#x27;s so noisy.&lt;br /&gt;So, purchase because it&#x27;s a good dryer.  If you like watching TV while you dry your hair FORGET ABOUT IT.</li>
            <li> Its been almost 2 years since i bought this dryer and it is still perfect. for such a cheap price i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I chosed the dryer because it said that it was quiet and can dry my hair quickly. it dry my hair but quiet its not.</li>
            <li> The Pro-tools Pebco hair dryer is awesome!! I bought one from hot tools two years ago and barely used it because the hood was so small I could barely fit my entire head, with curlers on, in it. And to dry all my hair was an extreme task.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is awesome it dried my hair and with very large curlers on my head (because I have very long and think curly hair not because my head is large lol) fit in the dryer completely with space. The settings are hot enough but, it dries as well as any industrial drier. I will also say it is noisy but, not as noisy as all the drier run of the mill driers you can buy (not industrial).&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of the hair dryers that my mom used on my hair when I was a little girl Lady Dazey which was very large and square and eventually fell apart but, after more than 20 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;The difference here is that it&#x27;s not square heavy and clunky like the old school ones, it&#x27;s round, light and nice and compact and seems like a great lasting product. I will probably buy another one before they take it off the market.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product because the bonnet is to high! You need to sit on pillows when under it. The neck isn&#x27;t adjustable. 2. The high setting is too hot, the medium setting is too hot and the low setting is cold o_0 and 3 it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair any quicker the a cheaper priced dryer, not worth the price save your money.</li>
            <li> Covers the entire head with different levels of heat as preferred. Gets the job done in a timely and even manner.</li>
            <li> This dryer Is fantastic!!  It usually takes my hair about two hours to dry, but it only takes about 45 minutes with this dryer!</li>
            <li> My wife liked the first one I bought her a few months ago. Its comfortable, large, spacious hood and fast drying capabilities were welcome features. I bought her a spare second one, as finding another similar one would have been a time-consuming exercise in the future. This would eliminate this chore for a very long time, if they each last at least 10 years from past experience.&lt;br /&gt;Great service from the seller as well. I would recommend both this product and seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist who works in a small private studio... I needed a hood dryer for occasional color processing and drying curly hair without the use of a blow dryer. This dryer is compact and has three settings for client comfort. I don&#x27;t use it on a frequent basis or really over the time of about 30 minutes but I have had no problems after a few months of use. My studio partner also has one and she likes hers too. Great product. I like that we can fold them up and keep them off the floor out of the way. Recommended over other dryers I&#x27;ve bought at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Gift for my 91 yr old grandmother who only uses a &amp;#34;bonnet&amp;#34; dryer. Came in time for christmas, she says it works wonderfully.  Fast shipment, easy payment and product was new and as described.</li>
            <li> After searching for over a year for a decent hair dryer, I purchased this one based on the great reviews and the average of 4 out of 5 stars on Amazon. First of all, I purchased it from eStores-LLC. The product came in a WELL USED box. When I took it out of the plastic bag, you could tell it was used. The dryer had a crack in it and the product brochure was written on it from a possible previous owner. Although I got my money back, eStores would not refund my shipping and handling costs. Amazon, through no fault of their own, returned my s/h costs I paid to eStores. Something else was fishy, when I gave eStores a low score, they wrote under my review that how would I know that the product was used and came across like, why should I complain since I received my money back, however that wasn&#x27;t completely true since they didn&#x27;t return my s/h costs from a defective product they sold me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now concerning the dryer. I did try it out once hoping it was good and I would ignore that I purchased a second hand machine. I do not have thick hair and the dryer took double the amount of time that it takes to normally dry my hair. The holes are only on the top half of the machine, so heat is not evenly distributed. Also, the machine is so loud, it sounds like a small twin propeller plane in your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to end this review on a good note. I purchased a Thermal Ionic hair dryer by BaByliss Pro and love it. Finally a decent dryer with no fuss!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought this would cut my drying time in half since my other dryers could notdtry the back of my hair, but know it was the same amount of time except it was able to heat the back of my hair. I think the air flow is still not all together, some spots heat up faster than the other, just weird. Anyway what ever happened to those really good dryers that had perfect air flow, and when you took your rollers out you had really nice curly hair at HOME. Now you need to go to salon for those and get ok brands at home, but whatever it does what it says it suppose to, what can you do make one yourself??? :-/</li>
            <li> This was a good buy! Works very well. A bit loud but hey, it&#x27;s a hair dryer! I just sit under it and read my book or my iPod. Good Buy!</li>
            <li> The box had obviously been opened by someone else.  No problem if it had been shipped and returned to the manufacturer new...but the knob on the top of the dryer had been broken off and was missing - not even in the box.  It was obvious that the dryer had been used and returned.  The dryer works okay...but I was very disappointed that I received a used dryer given that it was one of the most expensive dryers offered.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t have time to re-wrap it up and return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this dryer, finally found a dryer thay will dry the back of my head as well as the top. Most dryer that I&#x27;ve tried only dried the top of my head which made it frustrated. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about this dryer is that you can&#x27;t adjust the hight of the bonnet, I have a 10 year old and a 8 year old that I use  it on also and the bonnet is too high, so I had to go out and get a shorter table to sit it on and with the help of pillow it works fine. Overall its a good dryer especially those who are looking for a dryer with vent holes in the back to dry the back of your head.</li>
            <li> never again sounds like a vacum cleaner, smells like burn. Horrible experience I will go back to blowdrying my hair</li>
