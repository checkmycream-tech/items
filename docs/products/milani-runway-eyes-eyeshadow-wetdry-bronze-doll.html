            <li> MILANI this eye shadow seems to be a little too soft, doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on</li>
            <li> will continue ordering it as long as it is</li>
            <li> It works for an everyday natural look.</li>
            <li> You can use it dry or wet, wet stays on longer, I think.</li>
            <li> Using the Bronze Doll, the apply the Golden Touch from the bronze to the eyebrow, use a brush and blind.</li>
            <li> I also bought three other shades from L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> Apply the Antigua in a V shape at the end of eye, EX: cover very little up to the eyelid down to the lashes to form a V (but not to wide) just the corner,  I use brushes.</li>
            <li> this is such a subtle &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li> a cocoa complexion woman gold usually has laot of pay off.</li>

            <li> It is perfect to make blue eyes POP</li>
            <li> I use this shade as a highlighter and a blush.. I have pale skin and this shade works very well :)</li>
            <li> Love it and the color stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I bought three shades of Milani and own over 300 shades of Sephora, L&#x27;Oreal and Estee Lauder. I must say these three shades matched Purrr-fet! Milani Runway Eyes Eyeshadow, Wet/Dry, Bronze Doll - Milani Runway Eyes Wet/Dry Eyeshadow, Antigua - Milani Runway Eyes Wet/Dry Eyeshadow. Golden Touch. all true to color and beautiful. They all have a gold shimmer in these colors. The colors stay on and don&#x27;t flake on skin like some Sephora does/ I also bought three other shades from L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;To Use: Apply the Golden Touch to the eye lid, using a windshield swipe apply the  Bronze Doll (Med brown) with gold accent. Apply the Antigua in a V shape at the end of eye, EX: cover very little up to the eyelid down to the lashes to form a V (but not to wide) just the corner,  I use brushes. Then apply the Golden Touch under the bottom of the lashes, starting wide at the ends and coming in narrow towards the tear duck, then using the  Bronze Doll starting at the tear duck for middle section of the eye, bringing it lightly to the bottom lashes as close as you can, you don&#x27;t want to cover the gold.

These colors are beautiful, if you have any questions please ask as it took me a month to figure out how to blind 3-5 shades.</li>
            <li> This gold eyeshadow is the perfect shade. It works for an everyday natural look. It&#x27;s not to shiny nor to matte.</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow - it glides on. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Milani Eye Eyeshadow is reasonable and works reasonable.  There are several colors so you can choice what colors you like.  You can use it dry or wet, wet stays on longer, I think.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye shadow. It has hints of glitter and is a nice warm bronze shade.</li>
            <li> I simply adore this makeup, love milani colors</li>
            <li> MILANI this eye shadow seems to be a little too soft, doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on but it is a nice sparkly color....I have used it as a face bronzer in a pitch.</li>
            <li> This bronze eye shadow has a glittery shimmer to it, and it is great use over black eyeliner so you get a smokey eye look without it looking too trashy or too bold. If that is the look you are going for and don&#x27;t mind some glitter, I would reccommend!</li>
            <li> I prefer to use as a highlighter im a cocoa complexion woman gold usually has laot of pay off. this just leaves more of a shimmer sparkle than anything. i just added to my collection, milani shadows are great and yes u can use wet or dry with a good brush not the one in the compact.</li>
            <li> Nice color and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is a very versatile product. It can also be used as a bronzer. Lopks great on olive skin.</li>
