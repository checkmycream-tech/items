            <li>I will use for next many years .</li>
            <li>just finished my first box</li>

            <li>You won&#x27;t start feeling anything until the end of the first box</li>
            <li>so be patient, it really works!</li>
            <li>I feel better and am starting to see results.</li>
            <li>so far so good...BUT still awaiting for the rest!!!!</li>
            <li>, I work out regularly and so would expect decent gains, my grey hair hasn&#x27;t improved and it&#x27;s fair to say nothing else has as per described</li>
            <li>Better mood and mental sharpness - yes,</li>
            <li>I am 43 and do so much for my anti-aging but</li>
            <li>I can absolutely tell when I use it as compared to when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Really helps with the arthritis and gives her a bit of and energy boost.</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>This works very well...</li>
            <li>Okay so some 5 stars reviews are fake be aware :)</li>
            <li>I realized that I was not eating good vegetarian diet but no much meat for long years and it turned against me.  </li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m 34 yrs old!  </li>
            <li>My skin is completely clear since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>but it works just the same, minus the weight loss factor of the original.</li>

            <li> Boundless energy -</li>

            <li> Waste of money, had no effect even after six weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased a three month supply, and followed the instruction to the letter, but saw no notable improvements at all.  </li>
            <li> A strengthened immune system - hard to prove or deny&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Stronger bones and increased bone density - hard to prove or deny&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was relying on B complex tablets spiked with caffeine and energy drinks to make it through the day, but I would wake up at 3 am with shakes from the caffeine.</li>
            <li> serious folks.</li>
            <li> I take just one pill and my dick went very hard.</li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s the excuse for refusing to return my money for their worthless product</li>
            <li> decreased body fat - no&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Absolute CRAP!!  </li>
            <li> but now I see that all the hard work pays off!!</li>
            <li> , I brought this to aid in my training and strengthen my ligaments as my knees give me pain, sadly this hasn&#x27;t had any effect&lt;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to buy the sublingual spray to go with it, as it facilitates uptake of these ingredients and your results will be disappointing without it.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just tried and had doubts. Results were noticed  within 7. I have a physical had job which requires climbing ladders up to 187 ft. I gain a faster recovery time and less days of fatigue. I really wasn&#x27;t after the repair of the old age skin on hands and face until someone at work noticed. I am impressed with my first 30 days and have ordered the next months supply. I will update next month. Thanks for this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start tomorrow, the first Sunday of 2015.  Ask me again in two weeks!!</li>
            <li> At two months.....so far so good...BUT still awaiting for the rest!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a three month supply, and followed the instruction to the letter, but saw no notable improvements at all.  I could not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the original formula but it works just the same, minus the weight loss factor of the original.</li>
            <li> I take just one pill and my dick went very hard. I never ever seen nothing like that. I wonder if i took 4 like the instructions,kkkkkk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im serious folks. I dont know about the others promises, but that one hapens to me.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product as directed and there have been no changes or improvements there have been changes but not positive ones so I have stopped taking this product. I am in my early 40&#x27;s physically active female in the gym 4 times or more a week and this product did nothing positive for me. I did develop heart burn and experienced extended bloating so I stopped taking it to see if this product is the cause. I feel better not taking it.</li>
            <li> After the first week, I felt more energetic, and clearer skin. Increased my stamina... less loss of hair, more vitality, better sleep... I could go on and on...</li>
            <li> I am 36yo female, taking GenF2@plus for 2 months. I experience bloating as sight effect, Seller recommends to do not excess the daily dose to avoid bloating and diarrhea, but I never did and always been taken 4 only as recommended. Here is the list of benefits mentioned in pills describtion. I ll use it to show my personal results&lt;br /&gt;  *  A more youthful appearance -yes, I noticed better skin turgor&lt;br /&gt;  *  Increased muscle tone - no&lt;br /&gt;  *  Fat loss and increased metabolism  - no&lt;br /&gt;  *  A super-charged sex drive -no&lt;br /&gt;  *  Boundless energy - yes, there is burst of energy while taking these pills&lt;br /&gt;  * Lowered cholesterol - not applicable, as I havnt measured it prior taking pills&lt;br /&gt;  *  Better sleep -yes, deeper sleep.&lt;br /&gt;  *  Clearer, healthier vision - no&lt;br /&gt;  *  A strengthened immune system - hard to prove or deny&lt;br /&gt;  * Better mood and mental sharpness - yes, more stayable mood&lt;br /&gt;  * Greater memory and focus -no&lt;br /&gt;  * Stronger bones and increased bone density - hard to prove or deny&lt;br /&gt;  * Increased physical stamina -yes, more energy leads to physical stamina&lt;br /&gt;  * Weight loss with decreased body fat - no&lt;br /&gt;  * Restored hair condition and color - no&lt;br /&gt;  * A faster metabolism- no&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Would recommend to try for a month prior buying more than 1 box.</li>
            <li> this is my second box. I noticed difference in my skin texture after one week of use. I am 43 and do so much for my anti-aging but no results- I age faster  and faster and skin looser every month I panic , but I dont want surgery  skin lift etc .  so I try amino acids and I am so glad I did . I will use for next many years . I realized that I was not eating good vegetarian diet but no much meat for long years and it turned against me.  Amino- acids from this pills giving me  good supply and skin just love it-  be sure to use it with the spray which  u can buy separately .</li>
            <li> I was relying on B complex tablets spiked with caffeine and energy drinks to make it through the day, but I would wake up at 3 am with shakes from the caffeine. The GenF20 Plus  changed by  energy level within 4 days. It has cut my consumption of energy drinks out, and less than half of everything else.. I sleep through the night refreshed. I keep telling my wife how amazed I am at my energy level. I have been able to save money because of needing so much less of the energy drinks, etc. GenF20 Plus made me feel 15 years younger. GenF20 Plus is now part of my daily supplement regime-- until I die.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this stuff for 3 years, and I think it&#x27;s effective. It does pretty much what it&#x27;s advertised to do--over a long period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Immediate effect is nails grow faster. I believe it has improved my muscle tone and kept my hair fuller and darker. It&#x27;s difficult to pinpoint improvements, as you are swimming against the tide when you grow older. It may be just slowing things down--which is good enough.</li>
            <li> just finished my first box and I can say my skin looks better and I have better recovery time after work outs.</li>
            <li> Of the different supplements I have tried this year this one seems to be giving me the most return. I can absolutely tell when I use it as compared to when I don&#x27;t. I have tried cycling off of it for one month and within a few days I feel the difference. I sleep better, recover from workouts better, and can actually feel the effects in about an hour after each dose. It&#x27;s difficult to explain other than at 41 yrs old I feel more like I did at 30. I have tried a couple other of these male energy/virility supplements and this one seems to be the only one that I can say I feel any difference... It won&#x27;t take you back to being 19 but it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I feel awesome and notice a change in my muscle tone......I work out regularly and in shape but now I see that all the hard work pays off!!</li>
            <li> Okay so some 5 stars reviews are fake be aware :)</li>
            <li> Waste of money, had no effect even after six weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what It shows and was delivered quickly</li>
            <li> I have my Mom on the second box now, she loves it. Really helps with the arthritis and gives her a bit of and energy boost. You won&#x27;t start feeling anything until the end of the first box so be patient, it really works!</li>
            <li> Ive been taking this product for 4 months and the only thing that&#x27;s lost weight it my wallet, I work out regularly and so would expect decent gains, my grey hair hasn&#x27;t improved and it&#x27;s fair to say nothing else has as per described, I brought this to aid in my training and strengthen my ligaments as my knees give me pain, sadly this hasn&#x27;t had any effect&lt;br /&gt;¬£140 for 4 months supply, day light robbery I&#x27;m affraid, save your money and don&#x27;t bother, I&#x27;ve only added a star rating as I couldn&#x27;t proceed without doing so</li>
            <li> Absolute CRAP!!  Save your money.  Does absolutely nothing.  Took the product religiously for 60 days following directions.  Their &amp;#34;money back&amp;#34; policy is good for 67 days from your order date.......at least that&#x27;s the excuse for refusing to return my money for their worthless product</li>
            <li> I feel no different, No extra energy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Genf20 for a month and a half now. I feel better and am starting to see results. Noticeable bodyfat loss. Overall good product at this point.</li>
            <li> Works but your going to need more than one months supply to boost your hgh levels</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to feel more stamina and an improved circadian rhythm so quickly! This product is also gradually &#x27;powering up&#x27; in the other ways it advertises. I am very satisfied üòÅ at three weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin is completely clear since I started using this product.  I have always had acne and I&#x27;m 34 yrs old!  I&#x27;m only halfway through the box and often only take it once a day.  I am still seeing results. Definitely getting better sleep and have more energy. Only product I&#x27;ve ever bought that I felt the need to comment on...</li>
            <li> Great product; great customer service!</li>
            <li> This works very well... Noticed huge strength gains and toning</li>
            <li> quick shipping, great item!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a year or so, and another brand of hGH release before that (I switched because of unreliable availability of the other brand).  It boosts energy without edginess, improves muscle tone and endurance, and skin tone and texture, and decreases overall aches and pains.  Don&#x27;t forget to buy the sublingual spray to go with it, as it facilitates uptake of these ingredients and your results will be disappointing without it.  A bottle of the spray lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> They r doing as they say they do.  I feel great.</li>
            <li> I think this product can be effective. But with any supplement you take to increase muscle mass, you must work your butt off while you&#x27;re taking it in order to get the desired result. My problem with GenF20 is that I never had a normal bowel movement during the 45 days I took the pills. I dosed as directed and relatively quickly I suffered from a liquid bowel syndrome. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Worked as planned need to order more</li>
            <li> Always order this product...been taking it for a couple of years and seems to be working.</li>
            <li> It does work, but the quality of the product it is not constant or reliable.  Sometimes the tablets come with humid inside. Last time I bought it, I had to throw them to the trash without consuming the product.  I lost my money and my time.  When they come with good quality and dry, they work like magic. It is a shame I don&#x27;t want to risk my money again.</li>
