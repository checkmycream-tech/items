            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>3- all hell break lose ( pit wise)</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free product!</li>
            <li>so I decided to put more on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li>I feel safe using this product because it does not contain harmful ingrediants.  </li>
            <li>but it works great and all natural</li>
            <li>Almost sweat free :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind light perspiration since I think it&#x27;s healthy for the body.</li>
            <li>Also, as far as the block deoderants go, this one travels great.  </li>
            <li>i.m looking for aluminum free deodorant that works ...</li>
            <li>I got this because the I tried the aluminium free deodorants before and couldn&#x27;t stand them.</li>
            <li>natural powder fragrance is nice since more fragrances annoy me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it was true.</li>
            <li>Fresh, comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I picked it up at a surplus store for cheap and it was the powder fresh version.</li>
            <li>The first day went fine.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so super embarrassed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>My main concerns about deodorants are parabens, aluminum, and strong</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on vacation in Florida and thought it would be a good idea to stop by the Vitamin Shoppe and try some new deodorant since I&#x27;d left mine at home.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to have found a new deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum!</li>
            <li>I solely intend to use it for hot days when I may perspire the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shopped around for other brands, didn&#x27;t really find anything I liked, and now I don&#x27;t use deodorant at all.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of dryness, even though that&#x27;s what the aluminium is for.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, this particular product, ordered in error, does contain aluminum.</li>
            <li>I felt pretty self conscious but thought maybe it was since I&#x27;d been out all day in the Florida heat and humidity</li>
            <li>People have traditionally come to Tom&#x27;s looking for healthy alternatives to commercial deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with it, but in the future I would buy one of the scented ones.</li>
            <li>far more so then any other antiperspirant).</li>
            <li>The wetness protection really surprised me and worked better than some of my other deodorants.</li>
            <li>Now they just need to make this in more aroma&#x27;s other than natural powder and unscented.</li>
            <li>Out of all the antiperspirants I have ever used, this one is the least effective.  </li>
            <li>I love the Tom&#x27;s with Lavender &amp; even with Apricot but this plain one sticks to your skin</li>
            <li>It kept me dry, smelling good for a day and a half!</li>
            <li>9yr old dont like it because there is no scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wetness is NATURAL.  </li>
            <li>I have used tons of deodorants and te natural stuff never works well like others claim.</li>
            <li>This one was natural (except the aluminum of course).</li>
            <li>Needs to be reapplied frequently.</li>
            <li>, aluminum is natural (even if this aluminum comes from recycled cans, apparently), but so is arsenic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have wet armpits on hot days or when working out or nervous, than Alzheimer&#x27;s or dementia when I&#x27;m 70 because I wore aluminum under my armpits every day.  </li>
            <li>stain dark clothes with a white residue like most deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;One has to scrub harder to remove the deodorant from the armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It, however, works better than the suave 24hr, arrid extra dry and less irritating than most.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff. Shipped quickly. Well but again.</li>
            <li> 9yr old dont like it because there is no scent but it works great and all natural</li>
            <li> Cruelty free product!</li>
            <li> Update: someone told me my underarms smelled at work after I wrote this reviewed this. I thought they were crazy since I slapped this stuff on good and proper everyday. But it was true. I guess I didn&#x27;t notice as much as other people did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my remaining deodorant to my sister. Maybe it will work for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. No complaints. Does the job.</li>
            <li> I have used Tom&#x27;s of Maine for years as it does not contain aluminum.  Much to my surprise, this particular product, ordered in error, does contain aluminum. Very disappointed. The unfortunate part is you receive two...</li>
            <li> Not this product. It is weird. It dries my skin out (far more so then any other antiperspirant). It goes on thick and creates those annoying deodorant balls almost immediately. NOT good for bare shoulders and underarms! Emphatically, not a transparent product. And lastly, even though I bought the &amp;#34;unscented,&amp;#34; there is definitely an unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on vacation in Florida and thought it would be a good idea to stop by the Vitamin Shoppe and try some new deodorant since I&#x27;d left mine at home. The first day went fine. No sweaty pits or odor. I was so excited to have found a new deodorant that didn&#x27;t contain aluminum! Well day 2, I noticed I was getting a bit sweaty by the middle of the day so I decided to put more on. That night by the time I got to my room I felt pretty self conscious but thought maybe it was since I&#x27;d been out all day in the Florida heat and humidity and I just needed to shower again. Day 3- all hell break lose ( pit wise) and I&#x27;m awaiting my flight back home. It&#x27;s not even 9 am and my arm pits are SCREAMING body odor! Omg. I&#x27;m on the plane and I&#x27;m so super embarrassed. I smell like I didn&#x27;t even  bathe!</li>
            <li> This is the closest I can find to organic that actually works! I only have to apply it once a day and I&#x27;m smell/. Almost sweat free :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 5 years since I&#x27;ve used regular deodorant. My main concerns about deodorants are parabens, aluminum, and strong fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced deodorant with a crystal body deodorant stick which works for me. This summer I decided to use this Tom&#x27;s of Maine Deodorant because it is also an antiperspirant. This is something my crystal stick doesn&#x27;t offer. I solely intend to use it for hot days when I may perspire the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It does control my perspiration which is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The natural powder fragrance is nice since more fragrances annoy me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Will stain dark clothes with a white residue like most deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;One has to scrub harder to remove the deodorant from the armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I use this product again? Yes but only during the hottest months of the year. I plan on returning to my crystal deodorant that still keeps odors away. I don&#x27;t mind light perspiration since I think it&#x27;s healthy for the body. I&#x27;m glad I tried this product. It&#x27;s an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who should use this product? Well it depends on your needs and issues with deodorants.</li>
            <li> Out of all the antiperspirants I have ever used, this one is the least effective.  It keeps me dry, but it doesn&#x27;t control odor well at all.  :-(</li>
            <li> Good price. Great product.</li>
            <li> Does not work well, switched back to secret immediately. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love the Tom&#x27;s with Lavender &amp; even with Apricot but this plain one sticks to your skin so it&#x27;s hard to put on &amp; then difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> I think this is a bit of a misrepresentation.  People have traditionally come to Tom&#x27;s looking for healthy alternatives to commercial deodorants.  One ingredient people are commonly trying to avoid is aluminum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, aluminum is natural (even if this aluminum comes from recycled cans, apparently), but so is arsenic.  People who trust Tom&#x27;s might not even bother looking at the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use one of the Tom&#x27;s varieties that contained no aluminum, but once the company got bought out, I thought the heck with it.  I shopped around for other brands, didn&#x27;t really find anything I liked, and now I don&#x27;t use deodorant at all.  You probably don&#x27;t need it either, especially if you&#x27;re an average woman and eat a sensible diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wetness is NATURAL.  We need to get over it.  I&#x27;d rather have wet armpits on hot days or when working out or nervous, than Alzheimer&#x27;s or dementia when I&#x27;m 70 because I wore aluminum under my armpits every day.  This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with it, but in the future I would buy one of the scented ones. The wetness protection really surprised me and worked better than some of my other deodorants. The only issue I had with this product is the streaks and clumps. I assumed all deodorant was invisible solids nowwdays but I was wrong. You won&#x27;t see it all over but throughout the day pieces start to come to gether.</li>
            <li> Fresh, comfortable.  I feel safe using this product because it does not contain harmful ingrediants.  Also, as far as the block deoderants go, this one travels great.  It doesn&#x27;t leak and it doesn&#x27;t shatter, even on multiple flights and adventures.</li>
            <li> i.m looking for aluminum free deodorant that works ... this works sometimes</li>
            <li> I have used tons of deodorants and te natural stuff never works well like others claim. This isn&#x27;t that natural due to the aluminum. It, however, works better than the suave 24hr, arrid extra dry and less irritating than most. I picked it up at a surplus store for cheap and it was the powder fresh version. It kept me dry, smelling good for a day and a half!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  Now they just need to make this in more aroma&#x27;s other than natural powder and unscented.</li>
            <li> I got this because the I tried the aluminium free deodorants before and couldn&#x27;t stand them. This one was natural (except the aluminum of course). It&#x27;s still pretty terrible. Needs to be reapplied frequently. Very powdery and messy as well. Doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of dryness, even though that&#x27;s what the aluminium is for.</li>
            <li> Works well, but was disappointed that this still comtained aluminum</li>
