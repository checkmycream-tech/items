            <li>Great coverage when first applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with this product since recommended by my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands Chanel, Clinique, Lanc√¥me , and the list goes on.</li>
            <li>Had gone back to liquid makeup, which settles into pores, this does not, my skin looks incredible. !!!</li>
            <li>Will not clog pores and helps keep skin healthy.</li>
            <li>will say that, if you want more coverage, I have tried using this along with the liquid foundations from Glominerals.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure that I have a spare one</li>
            <li>Love this pressed powder/foundation.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on my skin since I began wearing this product.</li>
            <li>This time around, it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this pressed powder.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>excellent coverage but feels light and sheer.</li>
            <li>It looks natural, gives great coverage without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>great- plus cheap and natural.</li>
            <li>Applies easily</li>
            <li>Great coverage and last all day.</li>
            <li>Let me say that I rarely review an item, but I love this face powder.  </li>
            <li>and I got FREE shipping and didn&#x27;t pay tax.</li>
            <li>Light and feels like I&#x27;m not even wearing anything at all.</li>
            <li>I still like it because it goes on evenly and very smooth; but I really need it to be the original shade.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Love this powder, and really love having NO facial irritation or breakouts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend either using the primer or make sure your skin is well moisturized so the powder has something to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>Covers very wel,l goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>This is the same product I was getting at the salon but at a much better price!</li>
            <li>With Glominerals, though, my face tends to have a fresh, dewy and natural look (which I love) when I brush it on with a powder.  </li>
            <li>The color is not quite right.  </li>
            <li>Glo minerals pressed foundation is the best foundation I have ever purchased, I love paying less than half the price on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Looks even better if you mist your face with a little water very lightly after applying.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need very much for it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this powder to anyone who is prone to breakout, wants something light weight that gives coverage,</li>
            <li>I will never go back to department store powder foundation and spend top dollar.</li>
            <li>It was only slightly more than I would have paid wholesale</li>
            <li>and I can tell my face reacts so much better to this mineral makeup than it did to the regular name-brand stuff you could get anywhere.</li>
            <li>Covers really well too!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>So much so that I have been dusting on a loose powder that is closer to my skin tone over the top of it.  </li>
            <li>This really helps to set  your make up.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product based upon a sample I had, but it is so much lighter than the sample.  </li>
            <li>The cover is phenomenal, the texture is much much better than other competitive brands and why I have ever tried other brands is beyond me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past and liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Powder is kind of thick</li>
            <li>I receive complements from everyone on how fabulous my skin looks, especially from people I haven&#x27;t seen in ten years!  </li>
            <li>Excited to find it here for less.</li>
            <li>Totally natural and does protect from the sun.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light coverage and would recommend it to anyone who is not looking for a heavy made up look.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase GloMinerals Pressed directly through my Dermatologist...</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that my order from QskinZone arrived in about a week.</li>
            <li>This is the same brand and color that I had before, but this particular one is a lighter.  </li>
            <li>This mineral make up has medium coverage, totally covering my mild red acne scarring and a few sun spots.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin that can be on the dry side.  </li>

            <li> Too bad because it&#x27;s goes on nicely and lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always weary of buying professional products online because you never know if the product will be expired or the formula will be different / fake, but Qskincare sells the REAL thing.</li>
            <li> Did not give me the coverage I need and dry finish!</li>
            <li> I have tried some top of the line mineral powder makeups and none stand up to the performance of Glo Minerals Pressed Base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many makeup lines for pressed base powder</li>
            <li> I have been using this makeup for  a year and a half and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> no special technique needed.  </li>
            <li> I have been using GloMinerals pressed base/powder for few years now.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble skin</li>
            <li> Through Amazon, the price was HALF!  </li>
            <li> and it seems to stay on for at least 8 hrs</li>
            <li> I am allergic to something in Bare Escentuals mineral foundation, but I have no problems with this GloMinerals Base.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different types of pressed base powder mineral makeups.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that a powder base could possibly give me the coverage that my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Not great for oily skin though.</li>
            <li> Everyone asks my secret!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> ; liquid had for years - I was wrong!!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with this product since recommended by my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Have used it before and  do not want to be withut it.</li>
            <li> Glo minerals pressed foundation is the best foundation I have ever purchased, I love paying less than half the price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great foundation mineral powder.... It looks natural, gives great coverage without looking cakey. I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 months , this is my second compact. I will never go back to department store powder foundation and spend top dollar. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands Chanel, Clinique, Lanc√¥me , and the list goes on. They call clogged my pools and didn&#x27;t match perfectly. I highly recommend this powder to anyone who is prone to breakout, wants something light weight that gives coverage,</li>
            <li> This is the same brand and color that I had before, but this particular one is a lighter.  I still like it because it goes on evenly and very smooth; but I really need it to be the original shade.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> excellent coverage but feels light and sheer. Looks even better if you mist your face with a little water very lightly after applying.</li>
            <li> Covers very wel,l goes on easy.  Totally natural and does protect from the sun.  I don&#x27;t have to add sunscreen underneath it</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products! Great coverage and has sunscreen added.  Have used for 2 years, no breaking out. Applies easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different types of pressed base powder mineral makeups.  This in my opinion is the best by far.  I have tried some top of the line mineral powder makeups and none stand up to the performance of Glo Minerals Pressed Base.  The cover is phenomenal, the texture is much much better than other competitive brands and why I have ever tried other brands is beyond me. I won&#x27;t sway away from this, it&#x27;s my fav!  Additionally, this makeup has never ever made me break out (unlike some brands).  I highly recommend this. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone being disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> This is the same product I was getting at the salon but at a much better price! I&#x27;m so very happy with this new outlet and it is delivered to my door! Awesome!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the liquid foundation. This really helps to set  your make up. This stays on until you take it off.</li>
            <li> Favorite makeup ever!! Makes me look like a porcelain doll &amp; never makes me break out. As a matter of fact, it makes my skin look healthier without any makeup on!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I order every six weeks!</li>
            <li> I used this a number of years ago.  forgot how nice it is, it goes on flawlessly, and has good coverage.  Had gone back to liquid makeup, which settles into pores, this does not, my skin looks incredible. !!!</li>
            <li> This color is now paler and grayer than it used to be. I now have to buy another color to brush over it.</li>
            <li> Matches skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup I have ever used. Great coverage and last all day. Will not clog pores and helps keep skin healthy. I have been using this makeup for  a year and a half and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Did not give me the coverage I need and dry finish!</li>
            <li> wonderful powder, love it</li>
            <li> Finally, a mineral powder that doesn&#x27;t cake up or accent krinkles at the corners of my eyes. I highly recommend either using the primer or make sure your skin is well moisturized so the powder has something to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to. you can buy also buy a finishing spray but a simple mix of 3 parts water plus 1 part aloe vera gel or juice works great- plus cheap and natural. This mineral make up has medium coverage, totally covering my mild red acne scarring and a few sun spots. Pores appear smaller and it does not sink into wrinkles as long as you are well moisturized and use a finishing spray to help it &amp;#34;melt in&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I found out about this powder from a anestitican.  She recommended it.  I tried it and liked it&#x27;s light coverage and would recommend it to anyone who is not looking for a heavy made up look.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase GloMinerals Pressed directly through my Dermatologist... Through Amazon, the price was HALF!  I receive complements from everyone on how fabulous my skin looks, especially from people I haven&#x27;t seen in ten years!  With skin over 50 this is perfect to hide lines!  Everyone asks my secret!</li>
            <li> Let me say that I rarely review an item, but I love this face powder.  I have extremely sensitive skin that can be on the dry side.  With Glominerals, though, my face tends to have a fresh, dewy and natural look (which I love) when I brush it on with a powder.  Using the sponge makes it thicker and increases the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that, if you want more coverage, I have tried using this along with the liquid foundations from Glominerals.  It goes on thicker, but it still makes your skin look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top it off with the fact that I do think it helps me not to break out as often, and you can see why I love it! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Amazon because of the great price, and it has turned out to be an excellent purchase!  This is a really great foundation for me.  I have oily skin, and I use a primer underneath this foundation.  I am allergic to something in Bare Escentuals mineral foundation, but I have no problems with this GloMinerals Base.  I use a brush to apply it, and it&#x27;s very easy to do- no special technique needed.  I don&#x27;t need very much for it to even out my skin tone and leave my skin looking pretty great.  I am very happy with how easy this is to use, the great price, and how nice it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based upon a sample I had, but it is so much lighter than the sample.  So much so that I have been dusting on a loose powder that is closer to my skin tone over the top of it.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed in pictures that I look ghost white, so I&#x27;m going to discontinue using it altogether.  Too bad because it&#x27;s goes on nicely and lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed skincare professional and LOVE how beautiful my skin looks with this light mineral foundation that provides excellent coverage. I was pleasantly surprised to find that my order from QskinZone arrived in about a week. It was only slightly more than I would have paid wholesale and I got FREE shipping and didn&#x27;t pay tax. This is amazing considering that I would have had to pay tax and $15 shipping through my Glo account.  I&#x27;m always weary of buying professional products online because you never know if the product will be expired or the formula will be different / fake, but Qskincare sells the REAL thing. I will buy again from them.</li>
            <li> I have been using GloMinerals pressed base/powder for few years now.  I always make sure that I have a spare one so I don&#x27;t ran out.  You can use it with a powder brush for a lighter feel, or you can use the sponge for the evening look. Blends wonderfully with my sensitive and problem prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and it is amazing.  Great coverage without looking over made up.</li>
            <li> Love this pressed powder/foundation. Very natural looking!</li>
            <li> Powder is kind of thick but once you spread it well and blend in to your skin, it covers well and it seems to stay on for at least 8 hrs</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin and was concerned that a mineral makeup might accentuate the wrinkles.  It doesn&#x27;t !  The makeup goes on evenly and can be layered for heavier coverage without looking unnatural.  The primer and the kabuki brush are a must have to get great results.  This is great summer time makeup.  I have gotten many compliments on my skin since I began wearing this product. Very satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and liked it a lot.  This time around, it&#x27;s just okay.  The color is not quite right.  I have oily skin, and I thought a powder would help that... it doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m a grease pit by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Excited to find it here for less. Love this powder, and really love having NO facial irritation or breakouts. Yay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that a powder base could possibly give me the coverage that my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; liquid had for years - I was wrong!!  This is great!</li>
            <li> Great coverage when first applied. Not great for oily skin though.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup! Light and feels like I&#x27;m not even wearing anything at all. I have trouble skin and I can tell my face reacts so much better to this mineral makeup than it did to the regular name-brand stuff you could get anywhere. Covers really well too! This is my third purchase and will continue to buy gloMinerals!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love this pressed powder. It gives great coverage without ever looking cakey. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product... I&#x27;ve used so many makeup lines for pressed base powder and I keep coming back to GloMinerals.  When I lost my makeup bag I even rush delivered this product, because it&#x27;s so wonderful.</li>
