            <li>Great pure product!</li>
            <li>Though if I&#x27;d known about their prices I would have bought from BA in the first place lol</li>
            <li>Coconut and even Olive oil would be fine for an hour or so, but then leavemy hair drier than before!</li>
            <li>Mailed quickly and good quality product</li>
            <li>Quick shipping through Prime, good price, quality oil.</li>

            <li>do your research about how to use this and what it does you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>(I use about a quarter sized amount in my hand, add 2 - 3 drops of jojoba oil, rub it between my hands, then apply it to my face) and love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, if you DO love castor oil - and this brand especially - this is the best option out there for you.</li>
            <li>There are so many applications for its use</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more</li>

            <li>This castor oil is outstanding for those knowing the uses.</li>
            <li>So if it doesn&#x27;t work on the critters, I will still be able to use it.</li>
            <li>Something like this should be wrapped in a plastic bag, wrapped in bubble wrap, and more bubble wrap added to the box to keep movement during travel to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>:)</li>

            <li>The traps that leave skewered moles in my yard aren&#x27;t much better than the dozens of holes and tunnels, so we are giving this castor oil concoction</li>

            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I believe that if you can use it on your body, it should be safe to consume.</li>
            <li>very pleased and received item quick</li>
            <li>Using it with a mixture of fractionated coconut oil and avocado oil for my eye lashes for thickening and growth as a skin care regimen and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to swallow...and certainly more reasonable</li>

            <li>Excellent for dry skin patches</li>
            <li>Excellent product and quality, carefully packaged.  </li>
            <li>Good product, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Very weary good</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of Castro Oil, but nothing seems to work as best as Home Health</li>
            <li>This is, at most, a minor inconvenience, and I still think it&#x27;s worth it since, as of the time of my writing, this is one of the best prices you&#x27;ll find.</li>
            <li>Very good organic oil turned out to be better than I expected</li>
            <li>Huge, Huge, HUGE  bottle of castor oil goodness!</li>
            <li>I suggest diluting with a carrier oil for easy application.</li>
            <li>so soft and smooth felt like weave lol</li>
            <li>This  came very quickly and on time, it was well package</li>
            <li>I ran out of my home made Oilve oil and thought to use something easy to get.</li>
            <li>Great product for many different uses.</li>
            <li>so if you are looking into more natural therapy this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li>If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  </li>
            <li>Have tried using it a number of times to see if it is as strong as it seemed</li>
            <li>Castor Oil has a distinct smell to it which usually is very strong, this brand Castor Oil however does not have a strong smell as it is well processed.</li>
            <li>High quality castor oil at a good price.</li>
            <li>Nice size for this much money!</li>
            <li>First time buying this kind of oil, i&#x27;ve been using it to help with hair growth, my eyebrows and my eyelashes</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle of castor oil, but I have used this brand&#x27;s vitamin e serum, which I liked.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day to relieve back pain from a work injury and it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>product arrived clean and smells good shipping was fast</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge, and it was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always kept Olive oil and jojoba oil out of the fridge and they do fine.</li>
            <li>After the first bottle, I bought two more to make sure that I never run out.</li>
            <li>My daughters eye lashes are all ready growing and it helps keep hair healthy as well!</li>
            <li>and like it before you buy this huge bottle online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and I can&#x27;t wait to start using it.</li>
            <li>(did I mention how huge this bottle is?)</li>
            <li>I also put a bit in my face lotion at night and it makes a huge difference with my complexion.</li>
            <li>I will repurchase when I run out, which is not going to be anytime soon since this is a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>I find GREAT value in this product in using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Its makes ur skin/face smooth, I put it on my face</li>
            <li>Great product, use it daily.</li>
            <li>great product, big size!</li>
            <li>/&gt;About a month ago however my aunt found an article on Pinterest about how oil actually dissolves oil and is a great remedy for washing your face of impurities.</li>
            <li>so I can have a pump bottle filled in the shower and on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its great for hair, face, internally as a laxative and for the skin.</li>
            <li>Castor oil is such a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for control of political cyst</li>
            <li>( I always had a notion \\&quot;Cheap things are never</li>
            <li>My boyfriend always compliments me on how smooth my skin is.  </li>
            <li>It is soooo useful for so many things.</li>
            <li>It really is a fantastic oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as a scrub with coffee grounds and it leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Yes, it works great for those areas only but as an all over moisturizer</li>
            <li>So this turns out to be a great alternative mixed with 1/3 olive oil and 2/3 caster oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on my face, my feet and hands...making me look and feel younger.</li>
            <li>I purchased it primarily for thickening my hair and to make it grow longer.  </li>
            <li>but the quality of this product was fantastic and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy that my castor oil finally got here!</li>
            <li>It is so great on face especially for your eye area.  </li>
            <li>I use it for hair treatments and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different castor oils, but nothing seems to work as good as this.</li>
            <li>but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this formula has really good healing properties.</li>
            <li>Thanks you guys for sending me my Castor Oil new as purchase and in great condition.</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon has great customer service and gave me an instant refund</li>
            <li>A+ purchase that has me excited for my skin.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>originally bought the 8 ounce bottle and just bought a 32 ounce</li>
            <li>Husband excited to see results of health benefits.</li>
            <li>this is supposed to be 100% pure oil, Hexane free, which means it should be safe to ingest ...</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR DRY FEET</li>
            <li>Works great in my hair and on my baby&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is heavily used in the cosmetic industry also....very happy with it and plan to,buy more in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I also use the oil to clean my kitty&#x27;s ears.</li>
            <li>true pure oil would be safe for consumption (for constipation &amp; health issues)</li>
            <li>takes a couple washes to get out but left hair very strong and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>Everything I expected and for the price you can&#x27;t beat so happy I choose this company.</li>
            <li>The oil itself is stickier than I expected, but is otherwise great.</li>
            <li>It works great with peppermint essential oil and hot compress.</li>
            <li>Same good quality castor oil</li>
            <li>Castor oil is really good for liver flukes, we all have parasites in us its time we fight back.</li>
            <li>I mix this with shea butter ( 2 parts castor oil and 1 part shea butter) and put it on after my morning shower, or my after the gym shower and my skin stays nice and soft all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, odorless, and does an excellent job of enhancing  moisture.  </li>
            <li>Like what I&#x27;m seeing so far and how effective it is on joint and muscular pain.</li>
            <li>I love so much  </li>
            <li>I love this product it is actually, what it is suppose to be good reasonable price, came in a timely manor.</li>
            <li>It really works, and it was better by about two weeks.</li>
            <li>There are several things on Pinterest that you can read what Castor Oil is good for.</li>
            <li>Mmmm 8cm basically a full inch.</li>
            <li>But hair wise this is possibly the smartest purchase I&#x27;ve made</li>
            <li>but this new bottle smells like petroleum jelly with a very strong petroleum smell.</li>
            <li>I use this for homemade soap and the first batch turned out just fine, I have nothing negitive to report on this product.</li>
            <li>Quickly delivered.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>I  use every day without a tremendous amount of buildup</li>
            <li>but it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend doing a better job with packaging.</li>
            <li>Many uses, right now using it for my skin and hair, thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it three times, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This is a great and cheaper alternative to the black Jamaican castor oil found in hair stores.</li>
            <li>Good use also for children with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and long lasting!</li>
            <li>I mix it with olive oil and some essential oils and my hair drinks it up and gets soft bouncy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable also!!</li>
            <li>Love using this for a natural hair growth for eyelashes and eyebrows !</li>
            <li>I was using coconut oil before but mixing it both and leaving in it on my hair for more than two hours made my hair so soft and gave a volume that needed during the summer time!</li>
            <li>My hair has grown since i first started using this as well as the thickness of my hair!.</li>
            <li>Especially the lashes, growing in much more full and longer!</li>
            <li>So I see that this castor oil is pure and free of contaminants.</li>
            <li>The Home Health Castor oil is good quality, it is thick and does not have a strong odor,  and good  price value for buying larger size.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m super pleased :)</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, there was only one sheet of bubble wrap to the side of the bottle, and the bottle itself had a huge dent in the top.</li>
            <li>Why spend a lot of money on face products when you can look great for a few cents?</li>
            <li>This is worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Oil was fresh and the finished result was gr8.</li>
            <li>I continue to get emails asking me to return this order worth $14.00</li>
            <li>Ordered one bottle then ordered four more to be used as a natural deterrent to moles in yard.</li>
            <li>but after seeing it wow that is a lot of oil for such a great price.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a considerable difference for the better.  </li>
            <li>and I think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This oil is simple to use, but very much effective.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if there was a different type of opening.</li>
            <li>It handy to have around for various health reasons.  </li>
            <li>Boy did I get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Although I cant attribute this to new growth I will say that my existing hair feels like its becoming thicker at the root.</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective compared to other pricey hair and skin care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are many other uses, this product will always be a staple in our household.  </li>
            <li>Gtreat Value and super fast shipping, Thank you!</li>
            <li>I received it pretty quick.</li>
            <li>It also is a good buy compared to other castor oils sold in the chain</li>
            <li>This brand, although no frills, is a lighter consistency allowing me to add other good stuff to make a hair and scalp oil</li>
            <li>the difference is right after a shower..</li>
            <li>It came right on time and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>The product I received had the right label though.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 4 stars is the plastic bottle and cap it has: I would appreciate a dark glass container and a better pouring top, because it always runs when I pour it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting this on some major scar tissue and wounds and its making a huge difference!</li>
            <li>very large bottle...</li>
            <li>My skin in general looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no more pain ever,we are happy</li>
            <li>thing you might care about is that this bottle has only a screw top, not a flip top like you might find on other bottles (where you can pour out a more controlled amount of the oil).</li>
            <li>be cuz the shipping from Amazon is a full fledged $5 which totals the whole purchase to $19.</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Have given my 3b hair much volume and tremendous hair growth.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast, too.</li>
            <li>My ankle had been giving me some aches recently, so I have been using this the last couple nights and now it feels great.</li>
            <li>Luckily, since the oil was sticky and I opened it within hours of delivery, not too much of it leaked.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my hair straight as I can&#x27;t use any products on my straightened hair because the hair turns greasy and lifeless quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this and have used it in lip balms, soaps and other beauty products.  </li>
            <li>You very s huge bottle for a low price!</li>
            <li>Big huge difference on my feet!</li>
            <li>it is the consistency of vitamin e.  since my purchase, i have done further research and uncovered so many additional uses.  </li>
            <li>Also, it shipped really fast, within two days!</li>
            <li>bottle lasts a while if you&#x27;re using it for the same thing I am, so just make sure you try it</li>
            <li>A mix of castor oil, dish detergent and water sprayed over my entire yard seems to have worked in convincing the moles to move to a different location for better tasting meals.  </li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural, and require an oil that will keep my hair moist and tangle free, and this brand does the trick.</li>
            <li>What exactly do they have to do to prep the item for shipment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the smell, I suggest use your favorite essential oil to make smell pretty.</li>
            <li>Fast forward 4 days, and the rash is all but gone!</li>
            <li>It is my first time using castor oil</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for so many uses.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I use castor oil.  </li>
            <li>I do an oil rinse with it (apply in sections, rinse out after a few minutes with warm water, apply conditioner and rinse with cool water).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>so I had to buy from Bulk Apothecary, where the Castor Oil was more affordable with larger amounts!!</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are darker and also looks better overall</li>
            <li>I mix the Castor Oil with extremely hot ground pepper to treat an infestation of voles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After applying this to my eyelashes daily I was able to see visible improvement to the length and thickness of my lashes within four days.</li>
            <li>I love this castor oil helps in my skin lightening the scars, helps my hair grow back.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more when this runs out, although this 32 oz bottle will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic when I first heard about using castor oil for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great item to have, or at least try out.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up so much!</li>
            <li>I love it for the extra quality it provides my homemade soaps</li>
            <li>so I just knew this would be a great moisurizer for my thick mane.</li>
            <li>I will use it for problem areas until it&#x27;s gone or to use as an hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>More than likely won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>with regular use some were saying my skin was looking much better..</li>
            <li>Product appears to be exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I love the texture of it as well; I plan to use it for numerous things.</li>
            <li>first time user so nothing to compare it too.</li>
            <li>Great thick oil.</li>
            <li>Unexpected size, I am excited to see.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, it actually grew my edges back</li>
            <li>I really enjoy that for almost every use so far I never have to use more than a nickel size amount which means this large bottle is going a long ways.</li>
            <li>But please remember less is more!</li>
            <li>I can see that my eyebrows and lashes are growing and my skin has gotten super soft!</li>
            <li>I used it pretty fast</li>
            <li>I should note however that I also switched to a natural shampoo (True Moroccan)</li>
            <li>It gives my face a healthy, rosy look and helps with dry skin on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this on her feet for just two days and is raving about how much better they feel - they were dry and achy.</li>
            <li>I have many dry patches on my face and this stuff does wonders.</li>
            <li>I make my own black castor oil</li>
            <li>I love castor oil for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>In a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy this oil again.</li>
            <li>I bought the large bottle to share with my friend.</li>
            <li>Received this large bottle of castor oil and this&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I start last week to do packing for COPD.I feel better, almost like new.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality oil sold at a very reasonable price for this size.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a high quality castor oil and not fluid like the other castor oils I had previously experienced.</li>
            <li>: If you are buying this for the first time online without having tried it before, I encourage you to wait on this particular listing.</li>
            <li>I decided on Home Health in particular after comparing price, quantity of product, and the fact that it is not heat processed!  </li>
            <li>I warm it a little and put it in my hair for 15 minutes before shampooing.</li>
            <li>However, who&#x27;s to say what would&#x27;ve happened or how much would&#x27;ve been lost had I not been available to pick up and open the package the day it was delivered.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery with prime membership.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>i use this in his bath and because it is viscous it really nourishes the skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for being a provider.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my face and around my eyes and it has really softened my skin and minimized my wrinkles. . .</li>
            <li>So much for the price, I shared it with my coworkers.</li>
            <li>Thanks Home Health.  </li>
            <li>I had not realized the larger size was available.</li>
            <li>hands and feet; we use it for the entire body), and use castor oil as eyedrops for a fantastic eye restorative (allergies, eyestrain, etc.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and I find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I use it to relieve arthritis pain and it is a real life-saver for me.</li>
            <li>but I wished the bottle had some sort of lid once the cap is removed to control how much oil is poured out.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>The product came in one day as promised which was greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>and i really like it</li>
            <li>that is non toxic and sulfate/paraben free and have changed my diet to healthier eating (no red meat and plenty of veggies and fruits) along with running 3 miles per day.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, using the oil for skin for 3 days do not see results yet.</li>
            <li>My hair is very moisturized and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It has helped to control my appetite and regulate my digestive system very well.  </li>
            <li>This is a high-quality product that is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well</li>

            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>This oil really helped my eyebrows grow .</li>
            <li>In the last minutes of your shower, apply all over body and rinse lightly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using to combat a very sore toe joint.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li>It really does wonders with the likes of mucsles and joints.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This is a very generous size for the price being asked.</li>
            <li>I used it straight out the bottle.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Apart from the application to the hair, I sometimes use it on my face at night and the next day, my skin is so supple and moisturized that it&#x27;s a makeup free day for me.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally very curly kinky hair And oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started to explore more natural options for beauty regimens, and purchased this in an effort to help with hair growth (eyebrows/eyelashes).</li>
            <li>I have been using it for roughly 5 weeks now and this product is absolutely the truth!!!!  </li>
            <li>this product will last me a lifetime so it is well worth the volume and price!</li>
            <li>I have never had a growth problem but as my hair gets longer I have to be more actively combating breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have mainly used it for oil washing but plan to try it for many other things as well.</li>
            <li>The oil arrived in a clear bottle with evident chunks of mold at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen quite improvement in my eyelashes in just the first week in receiving it though since I&#x27;m quite sensitive too smell, the smell of it bothered me</li>
            <li>The bottle is also HUGE - I definitely underestimated the size I was purchasing, but it did make me feel better to know my $13 went to something that will last me a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The castor oil took the pain away pretty fast, the taste is very bland easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>Primarily used for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get her a years supply for much less with no shipping or tax applied.</li>
            <li>main ingredient&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>Secondly, when you wash it off the next day, be sure to shampoo twice.</li>
            <li>It has been growing steadily and I have not seen any of the psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>SPOTS\\&quot; WHEN YOU GET OLDER.  </li>
            <li>This product is nice and thick and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li>Product is highly recommended for skin care as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is a highly inexpensive way to do it.  </li>
            <li>So if you are itching and/or have scars I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this caster oil for treatment and so far this one works better than any other ones from the market.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it is has been gentle on my face and even around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I normally dampen our hair with water before applying the castor oil.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty oil, but I love it.</li>
            <li>The bottle cost me $9 at my local health food store, it as WELL worth it.</li>
            <li>It has a thick and kind of tacky feel to it.</li>
            <li>nice and thick.</li>
            <li>NICE AND THICK...</li>
            <li>Nice thick oil makes it easier to make a compress out of.</li>
            <li>Although this oil can&#x27;t be taken internally, it makes my skin super soft &amp; makes my eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li>This product is for making home made soap, my new hobby.</li>
            <li>I was beginning to notice new hair growth after about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>After the 4th application to my hair, I noticed that there were lots of new hair growth.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t comment on whether it will live up to the purported health benefits.</li>
            <li>it brings the colors out and makes it look new.</li>
            <li>The thickness of my hair is amazing, the texture is soft and manageable and I&#x27;ve started regrowing hair in the hairline areas that were challenged to say the least.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I also applied it on my legs and it leaves skin looking and feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>This was my second order and it shipped even faster than the first order.</li>
            <li>I use this for soap making, and so far, I have no complaints!</li>
            <li>All for Acne in a 20 year old!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for months in my hair and have noticed my hair not only growing faster but being so much softer!</li>
            <li>So far liking the product!</li>
            <li>I used it for deep conditioning and hot oil treatments</li>
            <li>Overall Castor oil is better on your skin than other oils, tends to be thicker than, almond, coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say she was thrilled!</li>
            <li>There is not a lot to say about castor oil, it came on time, it came in an unopened bottle, I&#x27;m not sure what more you can ask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure what a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; castor oil would be like, but I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly, worked as expected and it made my hair and skin very soft.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that you cannot go out with this on your head, it does not absorb into your scalp right away so will leave your hair  an oily mess.</li>
            <li>This is an old product gaining new significance</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t use it yet, but definitely needed for a nice quantity vs buying small from the store.</li>
            <li>With JBCO the oil was TOO strong for my hair and made it heavy.</li>
            <li>Product got all over everything and was a huge mess.</li>
            <li>My 94 yr old Mother has used this product daily for many years to rub down her arthritic  joints.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it is a huge bottle at an unbeatable price that probably will last for a long time!!</li>
            <li>Item came quickly but all the bottle was cracked and a majority of the oil spilled in the box and my other items.</li>
            <li>crazy great stuff will buy again</li>
            <li>Plus, castor oil is supposed to be a consumable product, yet this bottle clearly states &amp;#34;do not consume&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I rub the oil every night before I go to bed on the scar, and I see a clear difference in its appearance from day to day.</li>
            <li>It is also more economical than expensive eye creams and serums.  </li>
            <li>AFter trapping the existing moles, so far none have come in so who knows?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my feet/hands baby soft</li>
            <li>My acne kept at bay or is completely gone.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>yes it smooths the dried and cracked skin on heels and makes it smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product so far doing the job.</li>
            <li>It arrived 1 day early undamaged and it is a humongous bottle.</li>
            <li>or if I am just being overly sensitive.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s soothing for her and has softened her skin which she likes.</li>
            <li>It helps with the problems I have with an added bonus of SOFT, conditioned feet.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this product line to everyone who is in need of natural oils.</li>
            <li>This oil makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I am so surprised how moisturizing this product is for my hair.</li>
            <li>direct leave in.</li>
            <li>Appears to be working well so far.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin so smooth and firm.  </li>
            <li>On weekends, I&#x27;ll put it on early in the day then shampoo it out when showering at night.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m natural</li>
            <li>So the product is as advertized, but I think traps are the only real way to get rid of moles.</li>
            <li>This really soaks into the skin  and makes my skin soft,I can see a big difference in my skin ..</li>
            <li>but my skin was actually sensitive to it</li>
            <li>Use it every day as a hand ointment for my sensitive overworked hands, to sooth  and relieve discomfort.</li>
            <li>As far as I know it is as it&#x27;s suppose to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian and have coarse, very bleached hair.</li>
            <li>but like I said it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>So far my skin seems to be responding well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has worked wonders in every way that I&#x27;ve tried it so far.</li>
            <li>( I read they don&#x27;t like castor oil) so far can&lt;</li>
            <li>Rub it in &amp; then wash it off with a soft washcloth.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for an oil mixture that I use in my natural hair regimen.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural</li>
            <li>, this is why some bottles say not for consumption; Castor oil is a natural remedy derived from the castor bean (Ricinus communis).</li>
            <li>really brought life back to my overly processed hair.</li>
            <li>I have received compliments on my skin looking young.</li>
            <li>keeps my hair so soft and not greasy</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>The oil is thick and for lack of a better word greasy.</li>
            <li>I recommend heating a 1/4c in the microwave for approximately 30 seconds for any kind of cosmetic use.</li>
            <li>I found this product odorless and easy to use, castor oil is castor oil however there are different qualities and this one is nice, price wasn&#x27;t bad and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li>But this castor oil product has given me no less than 1 inch of growth in a month.  </li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for something that would help with my psoriasis and I came across a review for this product so decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Slight nutty smell that does not linger (not unpleasant at all).</li>
            <li>It does tend to get hair greasy and heavy if you use too much, but otherwise, this has really helped keep my natural 4a curls hydrated.</li>
            <li>Need to purchase a small pump that would fit the lid area for ease of application.</li>
            <li>was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>Top some how came partially unscrewed so a little spilled in the box, but otherwise no problems with the product.</li>
            <li>My hair was thinning and falling out before using this product and now I can&#x27;t believe how thick and full my hair has gotten!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, but I&#x27;ve already noticed new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Caution, will likely leave an oil stain on your pillow but, considering the price of a new pillow case I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I took the risk of trying it out with moderate underestimation, the oil is thick and POTENT</li>
            <li>It is certainly thick and it does not smell strongly.  </li>
            <li>looks, feels, and behaves exactly like other castor oil that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality Castor Oil, It is thick and extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and this works very well as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li>Works well, although a bit greasy at first, after a little while it seems to soak into the skin and leave skin soft.</li>
            <li>Great to use on your eyebrows to fix those bad eyebrow wax jobs</li>
            <li>Castor oil in general was recommended to me by a friend, so I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY&lt;br /&gt;I read details and did not see this listed clearly in the description.</li>
            <li>I received my order just as I expected and VERY timely as well.</li>
            <li>I cannot seem to find hexane-free, organic castor oil in this big of a bottle anywhere near me.</li>
            <li>I personally use an all natural Emu oil.</li>
            <li>I finished up the old bottle before starting this one</li>
            <li>I have been natural since December of 2012 and did the big chop in June of 2013.  </li>
            <li>This worked really well as a castor pack for my liver, I was astounded at what it did for my body wide inflammation not by topical application on those spots but by helping my liver clear.  </li>
            <li>I applied it mixed with baking soda and that spot is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>Came fast, as expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to those who has dry skin problems.</li>
            <li>thick, but washes out easy enough.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of this previously and am in the process of seeing if this will be helpful for me as well.</li>
            <li>Have not used a whole lot as yet, but will when I get all my other things together to make what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast.. and just what I expected!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected actually this is the second time I purchase this</li>
            <li>I was surprised, actually at the size of the Oil, since the price was very moderate.</li>
            <li>What I like about it so far is that it was a big bottle and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I also have used this in combination with my african shea butter on my feet, leaving them extra soft.</li>
            <li>Very frustrated, and wasn&#x27;t able to salvage most of the oil.</li>
            <li>bottles, which I can only find at Whole Foods and other health food stores for $9.99).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how things will shape up in the long run, but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I use this on my scalp everyday lightly and i have seen growth my hair is growing fast with this oil and its thick</li>
            <li>It is tacky when you first put it on, but really no more than any other oil type product and maybe not as much as some I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This brand can be found at Whole Foods in a bottle half the size, and you can return it there if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I usually apply my Castor Oil topically and it is absorbed into my systerm.</li>
            <li>Product is really thick &amp; super moisturizing</li>
            <li>It is super moisturizing and it helps me (more than all the other oils and products I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I&#x27;ve tried numerous) flatten and whiten the ugly raised and red scar I have on my belly.</li>
            <li>The only place I could find that carried it was a Dollar General and they were only carrying tiny 2.5 oz bottles.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and this item leave it soft</li>
            <li>The main component of castor oil is ricinoleic acid, a type of fatty acid shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since castor oil can be toxic when consumed in large amounts, medical experts typically recommend using it only externally over unbroken skin.</li>

            <li> I use it with warm damp towels for cramps because it helps relax the muscles.</li>
            <li> and I mix my own hair products</li>
            <li> My friend shared some with me and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Product is good but packing could have been better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a more permanent solution to a vole or mole problem, team up this treatment with a good hunting cat.  </li>
            <li> Awesome thanks</li>

            <li> I use this frequently on the skin to help with detoxing and it seems to be a very good product for me!</li>
            <li> This recommended healing oil by Edgar Cayce arrived in good shape without leaking, which is important for this type of product.  </li>
            <li> This oil is magic, I had a pain in my knee and now is gone, after I used the oil with a warm cloth</li>
            <li> good thing about this oil is that it is cheap and you get lots of it.</li>
            <li> But castor oil is amazing for so many things.  </li>

            <li> Pleasantly surprised at the size and quality of the packaging - very attractive.</li>
            <li> Great pure product!</li>
            <li> Though if I&#x27;d known about their prices I would have bought from BA in the first place lol</li>
            <li> Coconut and even Olive oil would be fine for an hour or so, but then leavemy hair drier than before!</li>
            <li> Mailed quickly and good quality product</li>
            <li> Quick shipping through Prime, good price, quality oil.</li>

            <li> I do need to order more...</li>
            <li> do your research about how to use this and what it does you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> (I use about a quarter sized amount in my hand, add 2 - 3 drops of jojoba oil, rub it between my hands, then apply it to my face) and love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, if you DO love castor oil - and this brand especially - this is the best option out there for you.</li>
            <li> There are so many applications for its use</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses -</li>

            <li> I decided to get one for myself and found many uses for it.  </li>
            <li> This castor oil is outstanding for those knowing the uses.</li>
            <li> So if it doesn&#x27;t work on the critters, I will still be able to use it.</li>
            <li> Something like this should be wrapped in a plastic bag, wrapped in bubble wrap, and more bubble wrap added to the box to keep movement during travel to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> :)</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a massage oil, in homemade lip balm recipes, in homemade lotion recipes, as a deep conditioner on my hair, and it&#x27;s just wonderful!</li>

            <li> The traps that leave skewered moles in my yard aren&#x27;t much better than the dozens of holes and tunnels, so we are giving this castor oil concoction</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product but it leaked so I have to dock for that.</li>

            <li> I have used it on my hands and feet and love the peanutty smell as well as the softer texture it is giving them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> well my granny use to use this for many things</li>
            <li> great product and fast shipping time</li>
            <li> and i have lost so many hairs...</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I believe that if you can use it on your body, it should be safe to consume.</li>
            <li> very pleased and received item quick</li>
            <li> Using it with a mixture of fractionated coconut oil and avocado oil for my eye lashes for thickening and growth as a skin care regimen and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to swallow...and certainly more reasonable</li>
            <li> This size is perfect because it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is a great deal and I will be using it for many natural hair DIY products.</li>
            <li> It helps your hair grow strong, it&#x27;s really healthy and promotes faster growth.</li>
            <li> The order came very quickly and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry skin patches</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quality, carefully packaged.  </li>
            <li> Good product, fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Very weary good</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of Castro Oil, but nothing seems to work as best as Home Health</li>
            <li> This is, at most, a minor inconvenience, and I still think it&#x27;s worth it since, as of the time of my writing, this is one of the best prices you&#x27;ll find.</li>
            <li> Very good organic oil turned out to be better than I expected</li>
            <li> Huge, Huge, HUGE  bottle of castor oil goodness!</li>
            <li> I suggest diluting with a carrier oil for easy application.</li>
            <li> so soft and smooth felt like weave lol</li>
            <li> This  came very quickly and on time, it was well package</li>
            <li> I ran out of my home made Oilve oil and thought to use something easy to get.</li>
            <li> Great product for many different uses.</li>
            <li> so if you are looking into more natural therapy this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li> If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  </li>
            <li> Have tried using it a number of times to see if it is as strong as it seemed</li>
            <li> Castor Oil has a distinct smell to it which usually is very strong, this brand Castor Oil however does not have a strong smell as it is well processed.</li>
            <li> High quality castor oil at a good price.</li>
            <li> Nice size for this much money!</li>
            <li> First time buying this kind of oil, i&#x27;ve been using it to help with hair growth, my eyebrows and my eyelashes</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of castor oil, but I have used this brand&#x27;s vitamin e serum, which I liked.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day to relieve back pain from a work injury and it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li> product arrived clean and smells good shipping was fast</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge, and it was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always kept Olive oil and jojoba oil out of the fridge and they do fine.</li>
            <li> After the first bottle, I bought two more to make sure that I never run out.</li>
            <li> My daughters eye lashes are all ready growing and it helps keep hair healthy as well!</li>
            <li> and like it before you buy this huge bottle online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and I can&#x27;t wait to start using it.</li>
            <li> (did I mention how huge this bottle is?)</li>
            <li> I also put a bit in my face lotion at night and it makes a huge difference with my complexion.</li>
            <li> I will repurchase when I run out, which is not going to be anytime soon since this is a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> I find GREAT value in this product in using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Its makes ur skin/face smooth, I put it on my face</li>
            <li> Great product, use it daily.</li>
            <li> great product, big size!</li>
            <li> /&gt;About a month ago however my aunt found an article on Pinterest about how oil actually dissolves oil and is a great remedy for washing your face of impurities.</li>
            <li> so I can have a pump bottle filled in the shower and on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its great for hair, face, internally as a laxative and for the skin.</li>
            <li> Castor oil is such a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for control of political cyst</li>
            <li> ( I always had a notion \\&quot;Cheap things are never</li>
            <li> My boyfriend always compliments me on how smooth my skin is.  </li>
            <li> It is soooo useful for so many things.</li>
            <li> It really is a fantastic oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a scrub with coffee grounds and it leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works great for those areas only but as an all over moisturizer</li>
            <li> So this turns out to be a great alternative mixed with 1/3 olive oil and 2/3 caster oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on my face, my feet and hands...making me look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> I purchased it primarily for thickening my hair and to make it grow longer.  </li>
            <li> but the quality of this product was fantastic and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy that my castor oil finally got here!</li>
            <li> It is so great on face especially for your eye area.  </li>
            <li> I use it for hair treatments and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different castor oils, but nothing seems to work as good as this.</li>
            <li> but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this formula has really good healing properties.</li>
            <li> Thanks you guys for sending me my Castor Oil new as purchase and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon has great customer service and gave me an instant refund</li>
            <li> A+ purchase that has me excited for my skin.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> originally bought the 8 ounce bottle and just bought a 32 ounce</li>
            <li> Husband excited to see results of health benefits.</li>
            <li> this is supposed to be 100% pure oil, Hexane free, which means it should be safe to ingest ...</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR DRY FEET</li>
            <li> Works great in my hair and on my baby&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is heavily used in the cosmetic industry also....very happy with it and plan to,buy more in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I also use the oil to clean my kitty&#x27;s ears.</li>
            <li> true pure oil would be safe for consumption (for constipation &amp; health issues)</li>
            <li> takes a couple washes to get out but left hair very strong and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and for the price you can&#x27;t beat so happy I choose this company.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is stickier than I expected, but is otherwise great.</li>
            <li> It works great with peppermint essential oil and hot compress.</li>
            <li> Same good quality castor oil</li>
            <li> Castor oil is really good for liver flukes, we all have parasites in us its time we fight back.</li>
            <li> I mix this with shea butter ( 2 parts castor oil and 1 part shea butter) and put it on after my morning shower, or my after the gym shower and my skin stays nice and soft all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, odorless, and does an excellent job of enhancing  moisture.  </li>
            <li> Like what I&#x27;m seeing so far and how effective it is on joint and muscular pain.</li>
            <li> I love so much  </li>
            <li> I love this product it is actually, what it is suppose to be good reasonable price, came in a timely manor.</li>
            <li> It really works, and it was better by about two weeks.</li>
            <li> There are several things on Pinterest that you can read what Castor Oil is good for.</li>
            <li> Mmmm 8cm basically a full inch.</li>
            <li> But hair wise this is possibly the smartest purchase I&#x27;ve made</li>
            <li> but this new bottle smells like petroleum jelly with a very strong petroleum smell.</li>
            <li> I use this for homemade soap and the first batch turned out just fine, I have nothing negitive to report on this product.</li>
            <li> Quickly delivered.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> hair tremendously.</li>
            <li> I  use every day without a tremendous amount of buildup</li>
            <li> but it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend doing a better job with packaging.</li>
            <li> Many uses, right now using it for my skin and hair, thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it three times, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is a great and cheaper alternative to the black Jamaican castor oil found in hair stores.</li>
            <li> Good use also for children with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and long lasting!</li>
            <li> I mix it with olive oil and some essential oils and my hair drinks it up and gets soft bouncy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable also!!</li>
            <li> Love using this for a natural hair growth for eyelashes and eyebrows !</li>
            <li> I was using coconut oil before but mixing it both and leaving in it on my hair for more than two hours made my hair so soft and gave a volume that needed during the summer time!</li>
            <li> My hair has grown since i first started using this as well as the thickness of my hair!.</li>
            <li> Especially the lashes, growing in much more full and longer!</li>
            <li> So I see that this castor oil is pure and free of contaminants.</li>
            <li> The Home Health Castor oil is good quality, it is thick and does not have a strong odor,  and good  price value for buying larger size.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m super pleased :)</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, there was only one sheet of bubble wrap to the side of the bottle, and the bottle itself had a huge dent in the top.</li>
            <li> Why spend a lot of money on face products when you can look great for a few cents?</li>
            <li> This is worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Oil was fresh and the finished result was gr8.</li>
            <li> I continue to get emails asking me to return this order worth $14.00</li>
            <li> Ordered one bottle then ordered four more to be used as a natural deterrent to moles in yard.</li>
            <li> but after seeing it wow that is a lot of oil for such a great price.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a considerable difference for the better.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This oil is simple to use, but very much effective.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if there was a different type of opening.</li>
            <li> It handy to have around for various health reasons.  </li>
            <li> Boy did I get my money&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Although I cant attribute this to new growth I will say that my existing hair feels like its becoming thicker at the root.</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective compared to other pricey hair and skin care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are many other uses, this product will always be a staple in our household.  </li>
            <li> Gtreat Value and super fast shipping, Thank you!</li>
            <li> I received it pretty quick.</li>
            <li> It also is a good buy compared to other castor oils sold in the chain</li>
            <li> This brand, although no frills, is a lighter consistency allowing me to add other good stuff to make a hair and scalp oil</li>
            <li> the difference is right after a shower..</li>
            <li> It came right on time and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> The product I received had the right label though.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars is the plastic bottle and cap it has: I would appreciate a dark glass container and a better pouring top, because it always runs when I pour it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this on some major scar tissue and wounds and its making a huge difference!</li>
            <li> very large bottle...</li>
            <li> My skin in general looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no more pain ever,we are happy</li>
            <li> thing you might care about is that this bottle has only a screw top, not a flip top like you might find on other bottles (where you can pour out a more controlled amount of the oil).</li>
            <li> be cuz the shipping from Amazon is a full fledged $5 which totals the whole purchase to $19.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Have given my 3b hair much volume and tremendous hair growth.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast, too.</li>
            <li> My ankle had been giving me some aches recently, so I have been using this the last couple nights and now it feels great.</li>
            <li> Luckily, since the oil was sticky and I opened it within hours of delivery, not too much of it leaked.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my hair straight as I can&#x27;t use any products on my straightened hair because the hair turns greasy and lifeless quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this and have used it in lip balms, soaps and other beauty products.  </li>
            <li> You very s huge bottle for a low price!</li>
            <li> Big huge difference on my feet!</li>
            <li> it is the consistency of vitamin e.  since my purchase, i have done further research and uncovered so many additional uses.  </li>
            <li> Also, it shipped really fast, within two days!</li>
            <li> bottle lasts a while if you&#x27;re using it for the same thing I am, so just make sure you try it</li>
            <li> A mix of castor oil, dish detergent and water sprayed over my entire yard seems to have worked in convincing the moles to move to a different location for better tasting meals.  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural, and require an oil that will keep my hair moist and tangle free, and this brand does the trick.</li>
            <li> What exactly do they have to do to prep the item for shipment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the smell, I suggest use your favorite essential oil to make smell pretty.</li>
            <li> Fast forward 4 days, and the rash is all but gone!</li>
            <li> It is my first time using castor oil</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for so many uses.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I use castor oil.  </li>
            <li> I do an oil rinse with it (apply in sections, rinse out after a few minutes with warm water, apply conditioner and rinse with cool water).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> so I had to buy from Bulk Apothecary, where the Castor Oil was more affordable with larger amounts!!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are darker and also looks better overall</li>
            <li> I mix the Castor Oil with extremely hot ground pepper to treat an infestation of voles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After applying this to my eyelashes daily I was able to see visible improvement to the length and thickness of my lashes within four days.</li>
            <li> I love this castor oil helps in my skin lightening the scars, helps my hair grow back.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more when this runs out, although this 32 oz bottle will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic when I first heard about using castor oil for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great item to have, or at least try out.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up so much!</li>
            <li> I love it for the extra quality it provides my homemade soaps</li>
            <li> so I just knew this would be a great moisurizer for my thick mane.</li>
            <li> I will use it for problem areas until it&#x27;s gone or to use as an hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> More than likely won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> with regular use some were saying my skin was looking much better..</li>
            <li> Product appears to be exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I love the texture of it as well; I plan to use it for numerous things.</li>
            <li> first time user so nothing to compare it too.</li>
            <li> Great thick oil.</li>
            <li> Unexpected size, I am excited to see.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it actually grew my edges back</li>
            <li> I really enjoy that for almost every use so far I never have to use more than a nickel size amount which means this large bottle is going a long ways.</li>
            <li> But please remember less is more!</li>
            <li> I can see that my eyebrows and lashes are growing and my skin has gotten super soft!</li>
            <li> I used it pretty fast</li>
            <li> I should note however that I also switched to a natural shampoo (True Moroccan)</li>
            <li> It gives my face a healthy, rosy look and helps with dry skin on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this on her feet for just two days and is raving about how much better they feel - they were dry and achy.</li>
            <li> I have many dry patches on my face and this stuff does wonders.</li>
            <li> I make my own black castor oil</li>
            <li> I love castor oil for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> In a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy this oil again.</li>
            <li> I bought the large bottle to share with my friend.</li>
            <li> Received this large bottle of castor oil and this&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I start last week to do packing for COPD.I feel better, almost like new.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality oil sold at a very reasonable price for this size.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a high quality castor oil and not fluid like the other castor oils I had previously experienced.</li>
            <li> : If you are buying this for the first time online without having tried it before, I encourage you to wait on this particular listing.</li>
            <li> I decided on Home Health in particular after comparing price, quantity of product, and the fact that it is not heat processed!  </li>
            <li> I warm it a little and put it in my hair for 15 minutes before shampooing.</li>
            <li> However, who&#x27;s to say what would&#x27;ve happened or how much would&#x27;ve been lost had I not been available to pick up and open the package the day it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery with prime membership.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> i use this in his bath and because it is viscous it really nourishes the skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for being a provider.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my face and around my eyes and it has really softened my skin and minimized my wrinkles. . .</li>
            <li> So much for the price, I shared it with my coworkers.</li>
            <li> Thanks Home Health.  </li>
            <li> I had not realized the larger size was available.</li>
            <li> hands and feet; we use it for the entire body), and use castor oil as eyedrops for a fantastic eye restorative (allergies, eyestrain, etc.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and I find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I use it to relieve arthritis pain and it is a real life-saver for me.</li>
            <li> but I wished the bottle had some sort of lid once the cap is removed to control how much oil is poured out.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> The product came in one day as promised which was greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> and i really like it</li>
            <li> that is non toxic and sulfate/paraben free and have changed my diet to healthier eating (no red meat and plenty of veggies and fruits) along with running 3 miles per day.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, using the oil for skin for 3 days do not see results yet.</li>
            <li> My hair is very moisturized and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> It has helped to control my appetite and regulate my digestive system very well.  </li>

            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> This oil really helped my eyebrows grow .</li>
            <li> In the last minutes of your shower, apply all over body and rinse lightly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using to combat a very sore toe joint.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li> It really does wonders with the likes of mucsles and joints.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a very generous size for the price being asked.</li>
            <li> I used it straight out the bottle.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Apart from the application to the hair, I sometimes use it on my face at night and the next day, my skin is so supple and moisturized that it&#x27;s a makeup free day for me.  </li>
            <li> Very versatile.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally very curly kinky hair And oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started to explore more natural options for beauty regimens, and purchased this in an effort to help with hair growth (eyebrows/eyelashes).</li>
            <li> I have been using it for roughly 5 weeks now and this product is absolutely the truth!!!!  </li>
            <li> this product will last me a lifetime so it is well worth the volume and price!</li>
            <li> I have never had a growth problem but as my hair gets longer I have to be more actively combating breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have mainly used it for oil washing but plan to try it for many other things as well.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived in a clear bottle with evident chunks of mold at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen quite improvement in my eyelashes in just the first week in receiving it though since I&#x27;m quite sensitive too smell, the smell of it bothered me</li>
            <li> The bottle is also HUGE - I definitely underestimated the size I was purchasing, but it did make me feel better to know my $13 went to something that will last me a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The castor oil took the pain away pretty fast, the taste is very bland easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> Primarily used for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get her a years supply for much less with no shipping or tax applied.</li>
            <li> main ingredient&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> Secondly, when you wash it off the next day, be sure to shampoo twice.</li>
            <li> It has been growing steadily and I have not seen any of the psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> SPOTS\\&quot; WHEN YOU GET OLDER.  </li>
            <li> This product is nice and thick and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li> Product is highly recommended for skin care as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a highly inexpensive way to do it.  </li>
            <li> So if you are itching and/or have scars I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this caster oil for treatment and so far this one works better than any other ones from the market.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it is has been gentle on my face and even around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I normally dampen our hair with water before applying the castor oil.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty oil, but I love it.</li>
            <li> The bottle cost me $9 at my local health food store, it as WELL worth it.</li>
            <li> It has a thick and kind of tacky feel to it.</li>
            <li> nice and thick.</li>
            <li> NICE AND THICK...</li>
            <li> Nice thick oil makes it easier to make a compress out of.</li>
            <li> Although this oil can&#x27;t be taken internally, it makes my skin super soft &amp; makes my eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li> This product is for making home made soap, my new hobby.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to notice new hair growth after about 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> After the 4th application to my hair, I noticed that there were lots of new hair growth.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t comment on whether it will live up to the purported health benefits.</li>
            <li> it brings the colors out and makes it look new.</li>
            <li> The thickness of my hair is amazing, the texture is soft and manageable and I&#x27;ve started regrowing hair in the hairline areas that were challenged to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I also applied it on my legs and it leaves skin looking and feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> This was my second order and it shipped even faster than the first order.</li>
            <li> I use this for soap making, and so far, I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> All for Acne in a 20 year old!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months in my hair and have noticed my hair not only growing faster but being so much softer!</li>
            <li> So far liking the product!</li>
            <li> I used it for deep conditioning and hot oil treatments</li>
            <li> Overall Castor oil is better on your skin than other oils, tends to be thicker than, almond, coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say she was thrilled!</li>
            <li> There is not a lot to say about castor oil, it came on time, it came in an unopened bottle, I&#x27;m not sure what more you can ask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure what a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; castor oil would be like, but I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, worked as expected and it made my hair and skin very soft.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that you cannot go out with this on your head, it does not absorb into your scalp right away so will leave your hair  an oily mess.</li>
            <li> This is an old product gaining new significance</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t use it yet, but definitely needed for a nice quantity vs buying small from the store.</li>
            <li> With JBCO the oil was TOO strong for my hair and made it heavy.</li>
            <li> Product got all over everything and was a huge mess.</li>
            <li> My 94 yr old Mother has used this product daily for many years to rub down her arthritic  joints.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it is a huge bottle at an unbeatable price that probably will last for a long time!!</li>
            <li> Item came quickly but all the bottle was cracked and a majority of the oil spilled in the box and my other items.</li>
            <li> crazy great stuff will buy again</li>
            <li> Plus, castor oil is supposed to be a consumable product, yet this bottle clearly states &amp;#34;do not consume&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I rub the oil every night before I go to bed on the scar, and I see a clear difference in its appearance from day to day.</li>
            <li> It is also more economical than expensive eye creams and serums.  </li>
            <li> AFter trapping the existing moles, so far none have come in so who knows?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my feet/hands baby soft</li>
            <li> My acne kept at bay or is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> yes it smooths the dried and cracked skin on heels and makes it smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product so far doing the job.</li>
            <li> It arrived 1 day early undamaged and it is a humongous bottle.</li>
            <li> or if I am just being overly sensitive.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s soothing for her and has softened her skin which she likes.</li>
            <li> It helps with the problems I have with an added bonus of SOFT, conditioned feet.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this product line to everyone who is in need of natural oils.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised how moisturizing this product is for my hair.</li>
            <li> direct leave in.</li>
            <li> Appears to be working well so far.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin so smooth and firm.  </li>
            <li> On weekends, I&#x27;ll put it on early in the day then shampoo it out when showering at night.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m natural</li>
            <li> So the product is as advertized, but I think traps are the only real way to get rid of moles.</li>
            <li> This really soaks into the skin  and makes my skin soft,I can see a big difference in my skin ..</li>
            <li> but my skin was actually sensitive to it</li>
            <li> Use it every day as a hand ointment for my sensitive overworked hands, to sooth  and relieve discomfort.</li>
            <li> As far as I know it is as it&#x27;s suppose to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian and have coarse, very bleached hair.</li>
            <li> but like I said it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> So far my skin seems to be responding well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders in every way that I&#x27;ve tried it so far.</li>
            <li> ( I read they don&#x27;t like castor oil) so far can&lt;</li>
            <li> Rub it in &amp; then wash it off with a soft washcloth.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for an oil mixture that I use in my natural hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural</li>
            <li> , this is why some bottles say not for consumption; Castor oil is a natural remedy derived from the castor bean (Ricinus communis).</li>
            <li> really brought life back to my overly processed hair.</li>
            <li> I have received compliments on my skin looking young.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair so soft and not greasy</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> The oil is thick and for lack of a better word greasy.</li>
            <li> I recommend heating a 1/4c in the microwave for approximately 30 seconds for any kind of cosmetic use.</li>
            <li> I found this product odorless and easy to use, castor oil is castor oil however there are different qualities and this one is nice, price wasn&#x27;t bad and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> But this castor oil product has given me no less than 1 inch of growth in a month.  </li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for something that would help with my psoriasis and I came across a review for this product so decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Slight nutty smell that does not linger (not unpleasant at all).</li>
            <li> It does tend to get hair greasy and heavy if you use too much, but otherwise, this has really helped keep my natural 4a curls hydrated.</li>
            <li> Need to purchase a small pump that would fit the lid area for ease of application.</li>
            <li> was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> Top some how came partially unscrewed so a little spilled in the box, but otherwise no problems with the product.</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning and falling out before using this product and now I can&#x27;t believe how thick and full my hair has gotten!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, but I&#x27;ve already noticed new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Caution, will likely leave an oil stain on your pillow but, considering the price of a new pillow case I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I took the risk of trying it out with moderate underestimation, the oil is thick and POTENT</li>
            <li> It is certainly thick and it does not smell strongly.  </li>
            <li> looks, feels, and behaves exactly like other castor oil that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality Castor Oil, It is thick and extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and this works very well as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li> Works well, although a bit greasy at first, after a little while it seems to soak into the skin and leave skin soft.</li>
            <li> Great to use on your eyebrows to fix those bad eyebrow wax jobs</li>
            <li> Castor oil in general was recommended to me by a friend, so I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY&lt;br /&gt;I read details and did not see this listed clearly in the description.</li>
            <li> I received my order just as I expected and VERY timely as well.</li>
            <li> I cannot seem to find hexane-free, organic castor oil in this big of a bottle anywhere near me.</li>
            <li> I personally use an all natural Emu oil.</li>
            <li> I finished up the old bottle before starting this one</li>
            <li> I have been natural since December of 2012 and did the big chop in June of 2013.  </li>
            <li> This worked really well as a castor pack for my liver, I was astounded at what it did for my body wide inflammation not by topical application on those spots but by helping my liver clear.  </li>
            <li> I applied it mixed with baking soda and that spot is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> Came fast, as expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to those who has dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> thick, but washes out easy enough.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of this previously and am in the process of seeing if this will be helpful for me as well.</li>
            <li> Have not used a whole lot as yet, but will when I get all my other things together to make what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast.. and just what I expected!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected actually this is the second time I purchase this</li>
            <li> I was surprised, actually at the size of the Oil, since the price was very moderate.</li>
            <li> What I like about it so far is that it was a big bottle and relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I also have used this in combination with my african shea butter on my feet, leaving them extra soft.</li>
            <li> Very frustrated, and wasn&#x27;t able to salvage most of the oil.</li>
            <li> bottles, which I can only find at Whole Foods and other health food stores for $9.99).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how things will shape up in the long run, but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp everyday lightly and i have seen growth my hair is growing fast with this oil and its thick</li>
            <li> It is tacky when you first put it on, but really no more than any other oil type product and maybe not as much as some I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This brand can be found at Whole Foods in a bottle half the size, and you can return it there if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I usually apply my Castor Oil topically and it is absorbed into my systerm.</li>
            <li> Product is really thick &amp; super moisturizing</li>
            <li> It is super moisturizing and it helps me (more than all the other oils and products I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I&#x27;ve tried numerous) flatten and whiten the ugly raised and red scar I have on my belly.</li>
            <li> The only place I could find that carried it was a Dollar General and they were only carrying tiny 2.5 oz bottles.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and this item leave it soft</li>
            <li> The main component of castor oil is ricinoleic acid, a type of fatty acid shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since castor oil can be toxic when consumed in large amounts, medical experts typically recommend using it only externally over unbroken skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews and tutorials I read and watched on You Tube that recommended it highly for kinky, black hair - type 4C.</li>
            <li> Even though it is a little messy, it is truly worth it!</li>
            <li> FOR MY NATURAL HAIR ALSO WHEN I MIX IT WITH OTHER OILS</li>
            <li> At first it was hard to believe, but it actually works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been religiously slathering my head and face with this stuff with special emphasis on my lashes, brows and hairline every other day or at least 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that such a large bottle should come with a pump for easier dispensing.</li>
            <li> Personally, it helped clear my acne (I know this is not true for everyone).</li>
            <li> Will last me a long time</li>
            <li> Long used in traditional medicine, castor oil is often found in lubricants and in laxatives.</li>
            <li> I just knew this is what I needed to add to those dry area such as my elbows, knees, and heels.</li>
            <li> but the bottle was broken luckily</li>
            <li> /&gt;t tell if it works or not, they are still with me, but a large amount that was hard to find anywhere else and delivered in 2 days.</li>
            <li> The little ones in the store are almost $6.00 for a tiny bottle, and this cold pressed and a much better bargain!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find reasonably priced castor oil that is a quality product.  </li>
            <li> It certainly smells bad enough to keep me away, but apparently the moles really don&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> or I will wake up to a face full of blemishes which is too bad for me because it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Truly love the Castor Cold Pressed Oil.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to give yourself a hair spa treatment with castor oil, be sure it&#x27;s cold processed.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the better cold pressed castor oils.  </li>
            <li> I will have this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I find the smell of it strange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just strange but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from applying it to my eyelashes, eyebrows, and hair.</li>
            <li> The amount goes  a long way.</li>
            <li> So far used it on a few fungus spots that my husband has just started on his arm from his job.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this product for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> Feels very oily but slowly rubs away.</li>
            <li> When you use it properly is really helps with breakage and slow growth.</li>
            <li> the texture is very goopy and thick.</li>
            <li> -I use it for my hair, skin, bad knee, and even as an effective remedy for dry eyes (I am a contact lens wearer).</li>
            <li> I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil -</li>
            <li> Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> but I have never had to wait this long!  </li>
            <li> , I put a little of this oil in a separate  smaller squeeze bottle, add a couple drops of the lavender essential oil and mix..</li>
            <li> It was suggested that castor oil be used for arthritis, sciatica, back pain and other conditions.</li>
            <li> I use in in my home made skin cream along with other essential oils.</li>
            <li> Use the castor oil for hair, skin, and several other things.</li>
            <li> Very thick, I now know that I really didn&#x27;t need to buy the 32 oz because this bottle will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry skin during the colder months.</li>
            <li> If youve got flakes, dry or oily skin</li>
            <li> If I have dry patches on my scalp,</li>
            <li> Bought the product because I have extremely dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with dry brittle hair  and flaky scalp (psoriasis) and researched that this product would help thicken and seal moisture within the hair strands and relieve psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> Towel dry.  </li>
            <li> I have to reapply them to my dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li> my hair was dry and brittle and skin dry and chapped...</li>
            <li> I have long afro textured hair and this is what I mainly use to seal in the moisture, and because it&#x27;s thick I only have to use a little.</li>
            <li> So to say I was impress with this product is a understatement, my legs aren&#x27;t dry and flaky anymore!  </li>
            <li> That is a big plus and it has also helped to strengthen (less breakage) and grow our hair faster.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that cold pressed castor oil should be a part of every all natural first aid kit, so I went ahead and purchased it.</li>
            <li> This one wasn&#x27;t sealed tight (the inner seal was loose) and it dripped a bit in shipping.</li>
            <li> : this does come in a plastic bag, which is obviously to help with a mess in the case of a leak.</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil it had begun to dry my skin badly...</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was very afraid that I will have to cut it</li>
            <li> but the little rascals just tossed it back out of their tunnels.</li>
            <li> From hard course to soft.</li>
            <li> Not much difference.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and gross.</li>
            <li> so I was careful about applying it</li>
            <li> Works as expected in soap making recipes...</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I never really had Acne issues</li>
            <li> Received quickly as expected with Amazon prime.  </li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> You can add a few drops of essential oil in your choice of fragrance..</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as expected.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about it.</li>
            <li> I washed it out and flat ironed my hair with a little coconut oil and my hair was</li>
            <li> I have been debating to try castor oil as I never really had any experience with it before or could have an idea what to expect like other oils coconut tea tree</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not positive</li>
            <li> Plastic isn&#x27;t a solid and really not good to hold especially oils.  </li>
            <li> especially if it&#x27;s labeled &#x27;First Cold Pressed.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The other plus is that it comes in a recyclable bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I add other oils to it for makeup removal and by its self for my face and hair.</li>
            <li> Word of caution this is not to be taken with anything else, like medicines or other supplements, take it alone with nothing else.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair ends, but I can smell the stink during the day, even if I mix it up with the other oils, anyways I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars bc</li>
            <li> She usually buys from a different vendor, supplies are often spotty.</li>
            <li> Bought it to apply on my eyebrows and remembered I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> After waiting many months for results, I was always disappointed.</li>
            <li> Want to start mixing it with other oils to see what I can create</li>
            <li> I bought this once before and had problems with the other bottle as well.  </li>
            <li> I used shea, olive, and other oils.</li>
            <li> Have not used Vaseline in decades because of that smell so not happy with this new twist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m impatient because I have Grave&#x27;s and seriously dry skin and can&#x27;t wait to try this along with trying it for my hair that is falling out in droves.  </li>
            <li> Some oil is left behind, but not enough to soil clothes (as I have found).  </li>
            <li> I realize that its still very early in the game</li>
            <li> (Plus, the clerk gave me a strange look when I bought 4 of their little bottles!)  </li>
            <li> A little truly goes a long way!!!.  </li>
            <li> just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand.</li>
            <li> only complaint is how the package was shipped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and takes some getting used to, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to people with thick and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to return it but thought that would be a waste because it would probably  be half empty before it got anywhere or to its destination.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put down the gopher holes.</li>
            <li> Other treatments have had little effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the oil for my under eye area and it&#x27;s caused the area to be smoother, less puffy, dark circles are fading, and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> On workdays, I usually put this on before I go to bed then shower it off during my morning shower letting it air dry at work, be warned, this stuff WILL get on your pillows</li>
            <li> I always have to keep the bottle in a plastic bag, as the oil runs down the sides of the bottle and makes a mess.</li>
            <li> is so much less.</li>
            <li> I mix it half with coconut oil and use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t like half of it leaked out</li>
            <li> I recieved an odd looking Cator oil.</li>
            <li> I had an odd growth on the side of my breast.</li>
            <li> oz jamaican black castor oil&lt;br</li>
            <li> Half of the bottle leaked out before it arrived.</li>
            <li> My first  brand was super thick and horrible on my scalp.</li>
            <li> There were no perceivable cracks in the bottle and the cap was screwed on firmly, but the bottle leaked half the oil onto the carpet.</li>
            <li> it also help my eyebrows grow just a little.</li>
            <li> I had a little snafu with my delivery/packaging and Home Health took care of me with no questions asked and within seconds of me contacting them.</li>
            <li> so this is my non toxic, non lethal effort to get the little varmints to vamoose.</li>
            <li> And it did leak a little..  bit still..  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, so only a little is needed.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use it during winter months since it&#x27;s so heavy &amp; it helps to keep me a little bit warmer.</li>
            <li> I use this product to make cold process soap and have found it to work very well.  </li>
            <li> i just started using this product a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> Bottle had been knocked over and unnoticed lay on its side overnight.  </li>
            <li> It does wonders for dried heels,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in a recipe for getting rid of ground hogs who are destroying my garden.</li>
            <li> and I use it on her skin everyday.</li>
            <li> But it does make me sad that my old reliable was not so reliable.</li>
            <li> You can also use this for the oil cleansing method to wash your face, I find it a bit to heavy for that myself.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> I obviously cannot use it since the plastic is broken and therefore I can no longer guarantee the authenticity of the contents.</li>
            <li> My hair was was almost dead because of the pool bleach ..</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick, but I expected that.  </li>
            <li> Works well on my Shi-Tzu&#x27;s fatty cysts.</li>
            <li> I find it to be quite messy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even gotten through half the bottle and it&#x27;s been over a year now!</li>
            <li> I notice this because in the past I had applied argan oil and coconut oil too around my eyes just to try them on my face... and  all the times I got little pimples in my eyelids and near the eyelash line...very scary.  </li>
            <li> This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.   </li>
            <li> It is not as thick and mixes well with other oils.</li>
            <li> I have used this product myself in the winter when my hands get a bit stiff, I can say it seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed to find a large mold cloud forming in the bottom of the bottle (which is a clear bottle</li>
            <li> Tons for just a little!</li>
            <li> You get a lot for a little price; will buy again!</li>
            <li> but I must say I was shocked at the size I knew it would be a large bottle</li>
            <li> and it pours out just as thick and slowly as the other castor oils I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> a try, whether or not it works probably has very little to do with the quality of the castor oil.</li>
            <li> Castor oil from the local pharmacy was relatively expensive</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it will work, but I did find a side benefit/use for the oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whose fault it was</li>
            <li> but I can see some small improvement with time.  </li>
            <li> The benefits definitely outweigh the weird smell.</li>
            <li> Well now I use it for hair because I thought I paid for a small bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to soften scar tissue from a past surgery</li>
            <li> No more department store chemical laden moisturizers for me.</li>
            <li> Castor oil is very heavy</li>
            <li> It is a very thick product and is a bit difficult to apply directly to your scalp at room temperature.</li>
            <li> u can apply a lot easier on your hair without all the mess as I was reading in sum of the reviews!!</li>
            <li> but its was hard to get the castor oil out of my other&lt;br /&gt;Products.</li>
            <li> hard to tell what effect this has.  </li>
            <li> I think castor oil has gotten a bad rap as a natural labor inducer/laxative.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need the \\&quot;home health\\&quot; label but it is reassuring at least.  </li>
            <li> I thought because it was cold pressed and the only ingredient is \\&quot;Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil\\&quot; that it could be stored at room temperature</li>
            <li> The recipe called for 3/4 cup castor oil (cold pressed) and 1/4 extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li> I used it to make several cold infusions with herbs for my hair.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product 2 days ago and will switch to Biotin to see if I can get my Hair back in shape.&lt;br /&gt;Really bad product I feel like wasted my money on this bottle.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> spray my thick curly hair with water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its really thick</li>
            <li> It has a thick texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> Yes, it moisturizes well, but it&#x27;s so thick to rub in and not to mention the smell is not something you would want to leave on your hair.</li>
            <li> Oil does not smell and looks like does not taste bad, for those who want to use it internally; very thick, little hard to apply on skin, so some people mix it with other oil.</li>
            <li> Grateful to have discovered this little secret!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the bottle.</li>
            <li> But it can get uncomfortable when you put them on your eyelashes as they make them sticky and heavy</li>
            <li> This cold pressed castor oil works just as expected.</li>
            <li> After 1 month I have been cured of my painful, wretched and terrible Cystic acne that I&#x27;ve spent several hundred dollars trying to fix in the last two</li>
            <li> needless to say, i am anxious to give the product time and see the results.  </li>
            <li> ive tried everything from JBCO to shea mosture products, to almond oil, and yet my hair kept responding negatively to it!</li>
            <li> Thick, Sticky Castor Oil and the smell isn&#x27;t that offensive!</li>
            <li> I purchase Home Health castor oil on a regular basis but, I was very unhappy with this shipment.</li>
            <li> cuz I didn&#x27;t want it to rip my hair out its very thick</li>
            <li> Very thick oil.</li>
            <li> I mix this with argan oil, as castor oil alone is very thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> The oil came broken in the Amazon box.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help the rash at all, if anything, it was getting worse..</li>
            <li> This is the least expensive castor oil I have found yet</li>
            <li> If you have thinning hair, acne or thin eyelashes get some Castor oil.</li>
            <li> Just started using this but wanted to add that if u poor it in like a dropper bottle</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, my shipping carton was oily and greasy and upon opening the shipment, I found a bottle with a crack in the area of bottle&#x27;s neck and the content had wasted all over everything that was shipped along with it, money wasted!!!!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say this will work on your head too if your hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> I ordered and paid for 32 ounce Home Health Castor Oil, Cold Pressed and Cold Processed and received  4 ounce Home Health Moisturizing Cream, Hyaluronic Acid, with Restorative Hydration Complex.</li>
            <li> After further research I found this castor oil and decided what the heck I was miserable...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to wash out of hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry this is not going to work for me.</li>
            <li> Needless to say she is also using it now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good or bad.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell, but there is nothing to do about it, since is too thick</li>
            <li> I and VERY DISAPPOINTED, MONEY WASTED.</li>
            <li> cold pressed is always recommended.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived and is just as it says it is, cold pressed castor oil.  </li>
            <li> but is has to be COLD PRESSED</li>
            <li> Used for making cold process soap.</li>
            <li> I used this oil for making cold process soap.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom who suffers from arthritis pain in her hands and knees.</li>
            <li> This product behaved well in my cold processed soap.</li>
            <li> treatment does not kill the voles, but makes their lives so miserable that they move to my neighbors&#x27; yard for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quality product, cold pressed means untreated  healthful product.</li>
            <li> But I was desperate</li>
            <li> /&gt;2oz cold pressed castor oil</li>
            <li> you name it, all with disappointing results.  </li>
            <li> I read an article about using castor oil for bad joints.</li>
            <li> It has helped alot, so I recommend it to everyone who has bad knees or whatever.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Gophers are supposed to hate the smell of castor oil</li>
            <li> and this is my base.  </li>
            <li> Used as a mole repellent, the jury is still out.</li>
            <li> It does dissipate after a while but in the meanwhile gives me a very sick feeling.</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Please please try cold pressed castor oil!!!</li>
            <li> maybe it does have some mole repellent value!</li>
            <li> It looked horrible!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i just started using this product a few days ago.  i purchased it for thickening lashes and brows.  it is the consistency of vitamin e.  since my purchase, i have done further research and uncovered so many additional uses.  needless to say, i am anxious to give the product time and see the results.  cold pressed is always recommended.  this product will last me a lifetime so it is well worth the volume and price!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, awesome price. Will re-order</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My Dad has rheumatoid arthritis and after 15min. of putting this on he said he felt relief from his pain. So thankful I purchased this for him and it works!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for the winter months.</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time. I like this castor and use it as a pre poo (before shampooing) for my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle at a reasonable price. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it.</li>
            <li> Still using it. Not much difference.</li>
            <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
            <li> Good product I like it...will purchase another soon.</li>
            <li> great product for massages, and i have also been putting into my hair and my eye brows (no results yet).&lt;br /&gt;very thick, but washes out easy enough.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use this in my hair as a bath oil. Makes my skin very soft. Fast delivery with prime membership.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived in a clear bottle with evident chunks of mold at the bottom.  They continue to grow, and I have therefore never even opened the bottle.  Waste of money and gross.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I used it on my foot to dissolve a ganglion cyst. Now I don&#x27;t have to have surgery. Great pure product!</li>
            <li> Great product good for the body inside and out</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, quality good.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Castor Oil.  What more can be said.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, quantity huge, price competitive, and delivery is prompt. Definitely deserves five stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it&#x27;s just amazing. I actually combine this oil with almond oil and massage it on to my scalp, let it set while I&#x27;m sleeping and wash it out in the morning. It helps your hair grow strong, it&#x27;s really healthy and promotes faster growth. I just love it! Also, it shipped really fast, within two days!</li>
            <li> I purchased of use in the yard For what I needed for it worked just as I was told it would.  helped to get rid of unwanted pest in the yard.</li>
            <li> The product arrived and is just as it says it is, cold pressed castor oil.  Nothing added.  I am happy.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more, it works so well as my hair regimen!! The price was reasonable also!!</li>
            <li> Same good quality castor oil I buy at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> I do need to order more...I have non ethnic hair so I was careful about applying it cuz I didn&#x27;t want it to rip my hair out its very thick do your research about how to use this and what it does you&#x27;ll love it I promise give it a chance</li>
            <li> I bought the castor oil to use in my daughter&#x27;s hair and mine as well.  I normally dampen our hair with water before applying the castor oil. I notice that when using this, it keeps our hair moist all day. That is a big plus and it has also helped to strengthen (less breakage) and grow our hair faster. This is a great and cheaper alternative to the black Jamaican castor oil found in hair stores.</li>
            <li> I purchase Home Health castor oil on a regular basis but, I was very unhappy with this shipment. Upon arrival, my shipping carton was oily and greasy and upon opening the shipment, I found a bottle with a crack in the area of bottle&#x27;s neck and the content had wasted all over everything that was shipped along with it, money wasted!!!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM...WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Home Health castor oil on my skin and to condition my hair. It gives my face a healthy, rosy look and helps with dry skin on my hands and feet. I warm it a little and put it in my hair for 15 minutes before shampooing. I have to cover it with a plastic bag so that I&#x27;m not dripping oil all over the house. It makes my hair softer and glossier. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I received my order just as I expected and VERY timely as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Bottle had been knocked over and unnoticed lay on its side overnight.  There were no perceivable cracks in the bottle and the cap was screwed on firmly, but the bottle leaked half the oil onto the carpet. Plus, castor oil is supposed to be a consumable product, yet this bottle clearly states &amp;#34;do not consume&amp;#34;.  If it&#x27;s processed in such a way that it is not consumable, then it&#x27;s not something that I want to put on my skin or hair.</li>
            <li> Love using this for a natural hair growth for eyelashes and eyebrows !</li>
            <li> Item as described.  Will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty oil, but I love it. I use it for hair treatments and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Because I am a hipster wannabe that&#x27;s totally into the environment, I wash my face with the oil cleansing method. I&#x27;ve been using this brand of castor oil for months now (I use about a quarter sized amount in my hand, add 2 - 3 drops of jojoba oil, rub it between my hands, then apply it to my face) and love it. It&#x27;s thick and takes some getting used to, but that&#x27;s just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST TIME CASTOR OIL USERS: If you are buying this for the first time online without having tried it before, I encourage you to wait on this particular listing. This brand can be found at Whole Foods in a bottle half the size, and you can return it there if you don&#x27;t like it. Even the 16 oz. bottle lasts a while if you&#x27;re using it for the same thing I am, so just make sure you try it and like it before you buy this huge bottle online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you DO love castor oil - and this brand especially - this is the best option out there for you. I cannot seem to find hexane-free, organic castor oil in this big of a bottle anywhere near me. The price is also a tad lower since you&#x27;re technically &#x27;buying in bulk&#x27; (versus if you were to buy two 16 oz. bottles, which I can only find at Whole Foods and other health food stores for $9.99).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff and don&#x27;t ever see myself changing back to store-bought facial cleansers. Personally, it helped clear my acne (I know this is not true for everyone). The other plus is that it comes in a recyclable bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you zero waste/plastic-free people out there: this does come in a plastic bag, which is obviously to help with a mess in the case of a leak. It&#x27;s your decision to buy it or not because of this... Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> A mix of castor oil, dish detergent and water sprayed over my entire yard seems to have worked in convincing the moles to move to a different location for better tasting meals.  Castor oil from the local pharmacy was relatively expensive so I&#x27;m happy to have found this solution.  (Plus, the clerk gave me a strange look when I bought 4 of their little bottles!)  It&#x27;s been about 6 weeks since I sprayed the yard and I need to do it again.</li>
            <li> Great for soaking in a towel then laying on sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Great product received in a timely manner!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This was my second order and it shipped even faster than the first order. This is a great product with many uses.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT!  This is worth the purchase.  I plan on making a repeat purchase.  I find GREAT value in this product in using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Please please try cold pressed castor oil!!! My kitty had a sore that would not heal after 5 operations and skin graphs!! incredible but true, the vet was astounded! but is has to be COLD PRESSED or it would not work!!! It is an amazing skin healing tool in my medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> Good product, fast delivery.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent store and product</li>
            <li> delivered in timely matter. As advertised</li>
            <li> Works as expected in soap making recipes...</li>
            <li> Works well for soap making.</li>
            <li> Product is really thick &amp; super moisturizing In a large bottle. I am very happy for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Will definitely shop again for the same brand when I need it. Castor Oil has a distinct smell to it which usually is very strong, this brand Castor Oil however does not have a strong smell as it is well processed. 5 stars to the Seller OxKom for post sale follow up to ensure Customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time - good price, good quality</li>
            <li> Great product from a great seller</li>
            <li> I have gotten this brand from a local supplement store. I found it on Amazon and grabbed it up. Saves me a trip to town. I use this alot for my son who has eczema and muscle pain. i use this in his bath and because it is viscous it really nourishes the skin. I use it with warm damp towels for cramps because it helps relax the muscles. There are so many applications for its use so if you are looking into more natural therapy this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li> Great service. Great product</li>
            <li> Love this oil ! I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this oil.  It is certainly thick and it does not smell strongly.  I was surprised that it is has been gentle on my face and even around my eyes.  I applied a bit on my eyebrows and eyelashes and it has not irritated my skin.  I notice this because in the past I had applied argan oil and coconut oil too around my eyes just to try them on my face... and  all the times I got little pimples in my eyelids and near the eyelash line...very scary.  So I see that this castor oil is pure and free of contaminants. I also applied it on my legs and it leaves skin looking and feeling very soft. I definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.   I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.  I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
            <li> Castor oil is amazing- I add it to my conditioners and scalp oil mix &amp; my 3C/4A hair feels like butter. I will never be with out it!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of Castor Oil before and loved it. This is an oil I use strictly at home. Definitely not an oil you want to smear on your face and hair if you want to appear in public. It has a thick and kind of tacky feel to it. I add other oils to it for makeup removal and by its self for my face and hair. I cannot leave this on my face overnight or I will wake up to a face full of blemishes which is too bad for me because it is very moisturizing. Cheap and effective compared to other pricey hair and skin care. Lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I read an article about using castor oil for bad joints. It has helped alot, so I recommend it to everyone who has bad knees or whatever. I like the larger bottles because I use it every day instead of lotion. I even have my husband using it</li>
            <li> Glad we found this on Amazon. Great Product!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need the \\&quot;home health\\&quot; label but it is reassuring at least.  A good value for the money.  I am using it for a home remedy on my lawn.  AFter trapping the existing moles, so far none have come in so who knows?  maybe it does have some mole repellent value!</li>
            <li> Love this product and the manner and speed with which it came.  I was surprised, actually at the size of the Oil, since the price was very moderate.</li>
            <li> Truly love the Castor Cold Pressed Oil. A staple in my hair care routine to keep my tresses moisturized and shiny. Do not over apply; hair will become sticky.  A little truly goes a long way!!!.  Have given my 3b hair much volume and tremendous hair growth. Product is highly recommended for skin care as well.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected and for the price you can&#x27;t beat so happy I choose this company. Please try them great product true to description.</li>
            <li> Great Product, fast service, will order again</li>
            <li> Great product! Skin feels amazing</li>
            <li> Locally the stores do not stock caster oil.  The only place I could find that carried it was a Dollar General and they were only carrying tiny 2.5 oz bottles.  Since I wanted the Castor Oil for soap making, I needed a larger bottle.  So far this has been working great!</li>
            <li> i use this as part of my oil cleansing mix (75% castor oil, 25% avocado oil -- i&#x27;m acne-prone). works terrifically.</li>
            <li> Used for making cold process soap. Came packaged well, did not leak. Oil was fresh and the finished result was gr8. Will certainly buy this oil again. Thanks Amazon for being a provider.</li>
            <li> Pure Product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of Castro Oil, but nothing seems to work as best as Home Health Castro Oil does.  I wear my hair natural, and require an oil that will keep my hair moist and tangle free, and this brand does the trick.</li>
            <li> The best deal and the best oil! Shipped super fast, too.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived on time</li>
            <li> love it ! 😍😍😍😍❤️ came on time 😏</li>
            <li> The Best Castor Oil Product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Using on hair. Plenty of product. Cut with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I get that they have the allotted time frame within to ship the product but I have never had to wait this long!  What exactly do they have to do to prep the item for shipment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impatient because I have Grave&#x27;s and seriously dry skin and can&#x27;t wait to try this along with trying it for my hair that is falling out in droves.  Get here already... please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product and I will either update or edit this review once I get it.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair stylist recommended this oil for her hair. She says it helps keep her hair from drying out.</li>
            <li> Even though it says do not take internally you can, that is on there because of the FDA and lawsuits. I use it internally for a parasite protocol, I was having severe intestinal discomfort brought on by worms aka: Parasites. The castor oil took the pain away pretty fast, the taste is very bland easy to swallow. Word of caution this is not to be taken with anything else, like medicines or other supplements, take it alone with nothing else. I take it at night before bed. Castor oil is really good for liver flukes, we all have parasites in us its time we fight back.</li>
            <li> I use this for soap making and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Order came on time. Good quality castor oil. I used oil twice and going to use for making soap. I like it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product! It has made my hair thicker and healthier. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Its makes ur skin/face smooth, I put it on my face cause I have dry skin it works perfectly it also help my eyebrows grow just a little.</li>
            <li> Received in time. I love this oil and I start last week to do packing for COPD.I feel better, almost like new. I did 3 times in 3 different days, I will do 4 more days than I will start to pack my neck and after that,my liver. I will update you to let you know.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I have been using it on my face and around my eyes and it has really softened my skin and minimized my wrinkles. . .</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s made my feet/hands baby soft, it feels awesome on your skin and has a lasting effect on joints/muscles. My ankle had been giving me some aches recently, so I have been using this the last couple nights and now it feels great. I&#x27;ve used the oil for my under eye area and it&#x27;s caused the area to be smoother, less puffy, dark circles are fading, and rejuvenated. I&#x27;ll never go without Castor Oil in my life again, A+ purchase that has me excited for my skin.</li>
            <li> I never knew how good Cator Oil were for muscle and joint pain !! Can&#x27;t wait to do the castor oil pack !!!</li>
            <li> Mailed quickly and good quality product</li>
            <li> We use this for our hair, and we love it!</li>
            <li> Great product, plus great price</li>
            <li> So much for the price, I shared it with my coworkers. I will have this for a long time. Many uses, right now using it for my skin and hair, thanks</li>
            <li> On my third Order. Size is perfect.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price! Will buy again. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Large bottle,  great product,  great price,  fast shipping!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love love love this oil. I have been debating to try castor oil as I never really had any experience with it before or could have an idea what to expect like other oils coconut tea tree etc... But i researched and found all good things about it and decided to give it a try for my hair. I was using coconut oil before but mixing it both and leaving in it on my hair for more than two hours made my hair so soft and gave a volume that needed during the summer time! I am absolutely in love with it. I am using it for my eyebrows eyelashes and under myeyes as well. It is not greasy at all and my skin  absorbs it quicker than coconut oil. Not to mention it is a huge bottle at an unbeatable price that probably will last for a long time!! Shipping was earlier than estimated time provided as well so well deserves the 5 star!!!</li>
            <li> I always purchase this brand of oil because of the quality and value. I use it on my knees for arthritis and also on my hair to thicken and condition it. The oil is thick and for lack of a better word greasy.Please don&#x27;t let that stop you from trying this product ,because it is awsome!</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price. I use this frequently on the skin to help with detoxing and it seems to be a very good product for me!</li>
            <li> Good, great, excellent.</li>
            <li> I used this oil for making cold process soap.  The order came very quickly and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> As expected. I use it to make soap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leak in shipping, even though I was expecting it to. It&#x27;s a great product. I  mix the product with grape seed oil in a pump bottle and use it as a all over moisturizer. I have had some good results. My Scars  from acne have lightened. My acne kept at bay or is completely gone. Prickly heat rash disappeared. Skin feels soft. I suggest diluting with a carrier oil for easy application. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me. I have smelt Neem oil and in comparison castor smells like roses. If you don&#x27;t like the smell, I suggest use your favorite essential oil to make smell pretty.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. I use this for soap making, and so far, I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> Great products. Top some how came partially unscrewed so a little spilled in the box, but otherwise no problems with the product.</li>
            <li> Even though it took a while before I received my oil (and the bottle came with a crack and started spilling in the box), I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It is super moisturizing and it helps me (more than all the other oils and products I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I&#x27;ve tried numerous) flatten and whiten the ugly raised and red scar I have on my belly. I rub the oil every night before I go to bed on the scar, and I see a clear difference in its appearance from day to day. Give it a try and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> My friend shared some with me and I really liked it.  I decided to get one for myself and found many uses for it.  Definitely a high quality castor oil and not fluid like the other castor oils I had previously experienced.</li>
            <li> I love the price for the size it is! I use it for my hair, eyebrows and eyelashes. I have seen results on my eyelashes already. I am doing the castor oil challenge so this will last a while</li>
            <li> This castor oil is the perfect size and price.  My husband uses it for a concoction to spray on the lawn to eliminate moles.  Works like a charm.  Have ordered this brand before and will order it again</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected actually this is the second time I purchase this and it will not the last time, I have recommended this numerous time</li>
            <li> Purchased castor oil based on friend&#x27;s recommendation.  Check online to read about all the benefits.  Primarily used for dry skin.  It does wonders for dried heels, yes it smooths the dried and cracked skin on heels and makes it smooth.  Feels very oily but slowly rubs away.</li>
            <li> Use this castor oil on my hair and it&#x27;s great! I haven&#x27;t even gotten through half the bottle and it&#x27;s been over a year now! Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever done to my hair! And great value!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in tact. Great product, use it daily. Will be reordering soon as it runs out.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t use it yet, but definitely needed for a nice quantity vs buying small from the store.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Home Health Castor oil from my local health foods store about a month ago and it doesn&#x27;t expire for another TWO YEARS and I was very disappointed to find a large mold cloud forming in the bottom of the bottle (which is a clear bottle so it&#x27;s very easy to see). I thought because it was cold pressed and the only ingredient is \\&quot;Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil\\&quot; that it could be stored at room temperature (I haven&#x27;t read anywhere that it needed to be store in the fridge, no where on the product label either). I&#x27;ve always kept Olive oil and jojoba oil out of the fridge and they do fine. I guess I would recommend to others to try keeping it in the fridge. I and VERY DISAPPOINTED, MONEY WASTED.</li>
            <li> This castor oil is a very good product.  It also is a good buy compared to other castor oils sold in the chain stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great.!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NET</li>
            <li> This castor oil is outstanding for those knowing the uses. To me, a trusted source.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in a recipe for getting rid of ground hogs who are destroying my garden. Not sure yet if it will work, but I did find a side benefit/use for the oil. My skin is very dry and this works very well as a moisturizer. So if it doesn&#x27;t work on the critters, I will still be able to use it.</li>
            <li> great product, big size!</li>
            <li> The Cure all for Acne!! I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled with acne for the last two years, been to the dermatologist, put on topical antibiotics, had to orally ingest antibiotics, tried the wholistic approach, bentonite clay and all. You name it and I tried it!... All for Acne in a 20 year old! (Mind you I never really had Acne issues before)&lt;br /&gt;About a month ago however my aunt found an article on Pinterest about how oil actually dissolves oil and is a great remedy for washing your face of impurities. The recipe called for 3/4 cup castor oil (cold pressed) and 1/4 extra virgin olive oil. After 1 DAY using this product I could tell a noticeable differences. After 1 month I have been cured of my painful, wretched and terrible Cystic acne that I&#x27;ve spent several hundred dollars trying to fix in the last two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought the 8 ounce bottle and just bought a 32 ounce so I can have a pump bottle filled in the shower and on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a heaven send!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I would advise to always use a moisturizer after washing your face with this product. I personally use an all natural Emu oil.</li>
            <li> product arrived clean and smells good shipping was fast and I would buy again</li>
            <li> FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY&lt;br /&gt;I read details and did not see this listed clearly in the description. I guess I&#x27;ll use as a hair care item but still upset I bought this and it&#x27;s not what I needed.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started to explore more natural options for beauty regimens, and purchased this in an effort to help with hair growth (eyebrows/eyelashes). The oil itself is stickier than I expected, but is otherwise great. I&#x27;ve only used it three times, but so far, so good! The bottle is also HUGE - I definitely underestimated the size I was purchasing, but it did make me feel better to know my $13 went to something that will last me a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is how the package was shipped. It wasn&#x27;t wrapped protectively enough, and by the time I received the box, the bottom of the box was covered in and dripping oil. When I opened the package, there was only one sheet of bubble wrap to the side of the bottle, and the bottle itself had a huge dent in the top. The box itself was well-sealed, but it definitely didn&#x27;t look it was packed for ground shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend doing a better job with packaging. Something like this should be wrapped in a plastic bag, wrapped in bubble wrap, and more bubble wrap added to the box to keep movement during travel to a minimum. Luckily, since the oil was sticky and I opened it within hours of delivery, not too much of it leaked. However, who&#x27;s to say what would&#x27;ve happened or how much would&#x27;ve been lost had I not been available to pick up and open the package the day it was delivered.</li>
            <li> The oil came broken in the Amazon box. I&#x27;m not sure whose fault it was but its was hard to get the castor oil out of my other&lt;br /&gt;Products. Very frustrated, and wasn&#x27;t able to salvage most of the oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bees knees. I use to have before/after photos... but my hair grew an inch a month for the three months i used this. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my hair. Works wonders! My hair has grown since i first started using this as well as the thickness of my hair!. If you are looking for a good hair oil, this is it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I had a rash and was using an Rx cream prescribed by my Dr and the cream didn&#x27;t help the rash at all, if anything, it was getting worse.. So, I decided to try my Home Health Castor Oil with it&#x27;s antifungal properties. Fast forward 4 days, and the rash is all but gone! Thanks Home Health.  :)</li>
            <li> During a Lymphatic Reflexology Detox session, I use Caster Oil on the stomach of my clients to stimulate the colon to ease constipation.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quality, carefully packaged.  I had not realized the larger size was available. We mix it with coconut oil for a superlative skin moisturizer (esp. hands and feet; we use it for the entire body), and use castor oil as eyedrops for a fantastic eye restorative (allergies, eyestrain, etc. that also wards away wrinkles).</li>
            <li> I use this product to make cold process soap and have found it to work very well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find reasonably priced castor oil that is a quality product.  This is and I will order again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this caster oil for treatment and so far this one works better than any other ones from the market.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the castor oil I ordered.  I received two jars of cream that I did not want and never heard of.  I continue to get emails asking me to return this order worth $14.00 but I am not going to take the time to pack it up, go to the post office, take time from work, etc. to do that.  So that is never going to happen.  I am out $14, shame on me, you are out one customer, shame on you.  Is that enough about this already??????</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair was thinning up front.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, but I&#x27;ve already noticed new hair growth.  I don&#x27;t know how things will shape up in the long run, but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product! Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think castor oil has gotten a bad rap as a natural labor inducer/laxative.  Use this stuff in your oil cleansing method ( [...]) to wash your face without stripping it, use it as an eyebrow/eyelash growth enhancer ( [...] ), and as a skin pack for sore muscles or upset tummy ( [...] ) .</li>
            <li> I mix this with shea butter ( 2 parts castor oil and 1 part shea butter) and put it on after my morning shower, or my after the gym shower and my skin stays nice and soft all day.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. I use it for my hair and my skin. The price is really good for this product. It is my first time using castor oil and I find it very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff, have been putting it on a wart for about 2 weeks now and it is almost gone.  I have l have also been putting it on my eyelashes and eye brows nightly and the growth is incredible</li>
            <li> Great product.  Received quickly as expected with Amazon prime.  Ordered one bottle then ordered four more to be used as a natural deterrent to moles in yard.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for months in my hair and have noticed my hair not only growing faster but being so much softer! I definitely recommend this product for so many uses.</li>
            <li> This oil is a gift from God. It&#x27;s real good for your skin. My mother is a invalid and I use it on her skin everyday.</li>
            <li> Nice size for this much money!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product. I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure. My only complaint is that such a large bottle should come with a pump for easier dispensing. Other than that, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use it to relieve arthritis pain and it is a real life-saver for me. I like the big size and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> MY wife is using for our daughter to soften her hair. This product so far doing the job.</li>
            <li> A great oil but I must say I was shocked at the size I knew it would be a large bottle but after seeing it wow that is a lot of oil for such a great price. I have been using it now for about 2wks. I have to say my skin is getting softer and what it did for my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
            <li> Very good organic oil turned out to be better than I expected</li>
            <li> I use this oil to make hair and skin mixtures. I am very happy with the quality and consistency.</li>
            <li> I have bought this same product twice and will buy again when needed. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very Satisfied customer. :-)</li>
            <li> Amazing quality oil! I put this castor oil on my eyebrows, eyelashes, and face before bed. I already see such a difference! Especially the lashes, growing in much more full and longer! This is an amazing buy. You very s huge bottle for a low price!</li>
            <li> Use it for eyebrows and eyelashes for growth hair and also for face cleansing. Love it.</li>
            <li> main ingredient&lt;br /&gt;my doctor approved this cleanse, try it for $1.41&lt;br /&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;V88c-HTXl8U</li>
            <li> I use castor oil on my scalp to encourage hair growth and thickening and on my hair to seal in moisture and keep split ends at bay.  I also add it to my body lotions to increase their emollient effect. This is a high quality oil sold at a very reasonable price for this size.  It&#x27;s thick, odorless, and does an excellent job of enhancing  moisture.  Highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use castor oil for my skin and hair. It arrived 1 day early undamaged and it is a humongous bottle. I will be ordering from her again</li>
            <li> Patience is key if you purchased this product for hair growth. I applied this daily before bed.  On my eyelashes and after 3 months I finally see the results I so desired. My eyelashes are longer,thicker and darker. I would have given 5 stars but I wished the bottle had some sort of lid once the cap is removed to control how much oil is poured out. Otherwise I&#x27;m content with this product.</li>
            <li> Product is good but packing could have been better.</li>
            <li> I had a little snafu with my delivery/packaging and Home Health took care of me with no questions asked and within seconds of me contacting them. Customer service like that speaks VOLUMES now a days.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil, great seller.  I buy often.  Used in my homemade bath and products</li>
            <li> The Castor oil is good quality and arrived very quickly. The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Have not used a whole lot as yet, but will when I get all my other things together to make what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I use castor oil.  It works great.  :)</li>
            <li> I have bought this brand before and loved it but this new bottle smells like petroleum jelly with a very strong petroleum smell. Have not used Vaseline in decades because of that smell so not happy with this new twist. Have tried using it a number of times to see if it is as strong as it seemed or if I am just being overly sensitive. It does dissipate after a while but in the meanwhile gives me a very sick feeling. I finished up the old bottle before starting this one so I am well beyond the return window. Guess I will just have to eat the cost. Ordered a different brand to try to assure not having a repeat twist.  But it does make me sad that my old reliable was not so reliable.</li>
            <li> Great product. My son  uses it as a treatment for IBD/IBS by massaging into his entire abdomen, back, etc. each night. It is supposed to be a great therapy via skin for any disease. Since it is topical, it won&#x27;t hurt. Try.</li>
            <li> Tons for just a little!</li>
            <li> Provides a lot of moisture for my curls. I do an oil rinse with it (apply in sections, rinse out after a few minutes with warm water, apply conditioner and rinse with cool water). It does tend to get hair greasy and heavy if you use too much, but otherwise, this has really helped keep my natural 4a curls hydrated.</li>
            <li> I just started using the oil. I bought the large bottle to share with my friend. I&#x27;m using it on my eyelashes to help them thicken and grow longer. I&#x27;m also using it on my hair to stop breakage and hair loss. I have used it twice on my hair and I have definitely noticed my hair loss now is so much less. I&#x27;m very happy about that. I hope it works as well for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product is for making home made soap, my new hobby. It is what maked the soap bubble. It arrived in perfect shape on the date promised.</li>
            <li> Great oil for making handmade soap. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Great product for castor oil packs. Also use to thicken hair, eyelashes and eyebrows. Shipped on time. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The castor oil is very good and I have ordered it several times. However the last two times the cap was not secured properly and some of the oil leaked out. I hope in the future this is corrected.</li>
            <li> So far liking the product! Using it with a mixture of fractionated coconut oil and avocado oil for my eye lashes for thickening and growth as a skin care regimen and so far so good!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil for soap making only.  I don&#x27;t think it is made for ingestion but it makes a great hand made soap component and is a good price.  I bought 2 of these and will buy more when needed.  This is the least expensive castor oil I have found yet and it pours out just as thick and slowly as the other castor oils I have purchased in the past.  I will definitely be using this again.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hair along with a leave-in conditioner every day. It&#x27;s really transformed my hair. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This recommended healing oil by Edgar Cayce arrived in good shape without leaking, which is important for this type of product.  Look it up...it might help your health too!!</li>
            <li> This castor oil is helping to soften my feet. I&#x27;m also using as a hair conditioner before I shampoo. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very good price for the size of the bottle. This oil is magic, I had a pain in my knee and now is gone, after I used the oil with a warm cloth</li>
            <li> Love it!  My daughters eye lashes are all ready growing and it helps keep hair healthy as well!</li>
            <li> Quickly delivered.  Good quality.  I use it on my hair and eye lashes so see some good results.  Nothing happens overnight but I can see some small improvement with time.  I have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are growing. Softened my hair and skin. I love this!!!</li>
            <li> The product came in one day as promised which was greatly appreciated. I bought it for my mom who suffers from arthritis pain in her hands and knees. So far it&#x27;s soothing for her and has softened her skin which she likes.</li>
            <li> This is for external use only. I have neuropathy in my feet and use it as a massage oil. It helps with the problems I have with an added bonus of SOFT, conditioned feet. I store mine in the refrigerator. Need to purchase a small pump that would fit the lid area for ease of application.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil, works well in my CP soap.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the castor oil packs, this was the best value, enough to share with my siblings who also suffer with chronic pain. I will be ordering again. This has no odor, softens my skin and does the trick for pain, even if I don&#x27;t have time for the pack, I just rub it into the area where needed. I have also used this as a carrier oil to blend with my essential oils to ease pain and stiffness</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that cold pressed castor oil should be a part of every all natural first aid kit, so I went ahead and purchased it. I&#x27;ve used it as a massage oil, in homemade lip balm recipes, in homemade lotion recipes, as a deep conditioner on my hair, and it&#x27;s just wonderful!</li>
            <li> Good quality product! I love it and I would recommend this product line to everyone who is in need of natural oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this to make soaps. The quality is good, my soaps turn out great. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the bottle or lid. The bottle is labelled for external use only, so if you&#x27;re planning to ingest it you&#x27;ll need to get a different product.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my skin feel soft. I suffer from dry skin during the colder months. This castor oil has helped a great deal.</li>
            <li> Love this oil...it heals up scabbed up wounds...I mix it with olive oil for an overnight line softener..I had to use it on my grandsons bottom since his mom forgot the rash paste. The next time I changed him, the rash was gone!  I&#x27;m researching more uses :)</li>
            <li> If youve got flakes, dry or oily skin this is perfect for you. You can uss this for just about any beauty need and this bottle will last your forevverrrrr. If you use a Qtip and apply some to your lash line it will make them feel softer as well as grow in thicker. Ive only been using this for two weeks and i already notice a difference in my skin and scalp &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This product came within days of buying it!! The bottle is huge and I can&#x27;t wait to start using it. I got it for eye lash growth and as I&#x27;m reading it grows hair on your scalp too!!! Really good brand! I will defiantly be buying from them again!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to put down the gopher holes. Gophers are supposed to hate the smell of castor oil so this is my non toxic, non lethal effort to get the little varmints to vamoose. I tried garlic but the little rascals just tossed it back out of their tunnels. They can&#x27;t do that with this oil. What I like about it so far is that it was a big bottle and relatively inexpensive. So we shall see if I get to see fewer gophers...</li>
            <li> I am so surprised how moisturizing this product is for my hair. I love it. A must have for all relaxed hairs.</li>
            <li> I love this product. That&#x27;s why I ordered it.  But, when it arrived and when I removed it from the box, I noticed that the bottom of the box had an oil stain.  When I checked the bottle&#x27;s cap, I saw that it had been loosened or was never put on correctly. And when I checked the foil seal under the cap, I saw it had been damaged somehow.  I can&#x27;t use this product. The seal is on for consumer protection.  If it&#x27;s damaged and oil has leaked out, that means anything could&#x27;ve gotten in.  I need to return it.</li>
            <li> very good product my wife started to use it her skin is showing improvement. Very happy with the product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Product as expected.</li>
            <li> Product as Described :)</li>
            <li> It works great to seal moisture into my hair, and also softens and protects my edges. It&#x27;s very thick, so only a little is needed. If I have dry patches on my scalp,</li>
            <li> Read how great this brand of castor oil was. Castor oil is a miracle product. Its great for hair, face, internally as a laxative and for the skin. It even grows eyelashes. If you have thinning hair, acne or thin eyelashes get some Castor oil. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I use this alone on my scalp or with my leave in to make the Kimmaytube Leave in with jojoba oil, aloe vera juice and Giovanni direct leave in. It it amazing at moisturizing curly hair. I also use castor oil for shine. Its good for everything</li>
            <li> I have long afro textured hair and this is what I mainly use to seal in the moisture, and because it&#x27;s thick I only have to use a little. This size is perfect because it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Appears to be working well so far.  Fast delivery!  Good product!</li>
            <li> Gtreat Value and super fast shipping, Thank you!</li>
            <li> Okay, I have to say I am impressed.  Bought the product because I have extremely dry skin in the winter (mostly my doing, I tend to neglect myself, by not keep moisturized, especially the legs!).  So to say I was impress with this product is a understatement, my legs aren&#x27;t dry and flaky anymore!  I will be using this product throughout winter and beyond.  WONDERFUL......</li>
            <li> This castor oil is the best.  It leaves the skin so smooth and firm.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and I am looking forward to its benefits</li>
            <li> Great quality. I use this oil in many of my products! works great. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Good oil for CP soaping! I used it pretty fast so I had to buy from Bulk Apothecary, where the Castor Oil was more affordable with larger amounts!! Though if I&#x27;d known about their prices I would have bought from BA in the first place lol</li>
            <li> nice and thick. I used it for deep conditioning and hot oil treatments</li>
            <li> So many uses....I use every night on my face after I have cleansed. Skin has a healthy glow. It has also helped to diminish blemishes, plus longer and fuller eyebrows and eyelashes! I use the castor oil pack 3x a week to shrink ovarian cyst.</li>
            <li> great product.  Using it to repel moles.</li>
            <li> Great for caster oil packs!</li>
            <li> Grateful to have discovered this little secret! I&#x27;m using this alone and with coconut oil depending on the usage. I&#x27;m also using essential oils with castor oil for various things like cellulite and varicose veins. Like what I&#x27;m seeing so far and how effective it is on joint and muscular pain.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to give yourself a hair spa treatment with castor oil, be sure it&#x27;s cold processed.  The one you find on the supermaket shelf is not the same thing.</li>
            <li> It is a plastic container if that is a wonder of yours.  32 oz is a whole lot of oil we have been combining it with a few drops of essential oils (in a separate container) and using it as a bed time skin conditioner!</li>
            <li> I like this product becuse it serves several purposes. I purchased this product to thicken up my hair, I haven&#x27;t yet seen any results but I like the way it makes my hair feel and the size of the bottle is great. I would reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a good oil and i really like it hopefully you can discount this product in the future for multiple orders,</li>
            <li> Unexpected size, I am excited to see. This product is a great deal and I will be using it for many natural hair DIY products.</li>
            <li> Noticed already the benefits of using this castor oil on chin acne.</li>
            <li> Thick, Sticky Castor Oil and the smell isn&#x27;t that offensive!</li>
            <li> She used it to massage her sore knee.  It seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I am using this everywhere.  It is smoothing hair,  soothing skin  and helping  moisturize limbs.  This is an old product gaining new significance</li>
            <li> This product behaved well in my cold processed soap. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Huge, Huge, HUGE  bottle of castor oil goodness! Price point was very awesome, shipping was super quick and bottle was wrapped well with no leakage or spills. I&#x27;ve been religiously slathering my head and face with this stuff with special emphasis on my lashes, brows and hairline every other day or at least 4 times a week. First off, let me say that you cannot go out with this on your head, it does not absorb into your scalp right away so will leave your hair  an oily mess. Secondly, when you wash it off the next day, be sure to shampoo twice. Yes, it is THAT oily! On workdays, I usually put this on before I go to bed then shower it off during my morning shower letting it air dry at work, be warned, this stuff WILL get on your pillows so I just place something over it when sleeping. On weekends, I&#x27;ll put it on early in the day then shampoo it out when showering at night. I&#x27;ve been using it this way since I received it 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair seems? to be getting thicker. Although I cant attribute this to new growth I will say that my existing hair feels like its becoming thicker at the root. My eyebrows are darker and also looks better overall and my lashes are starting to appear longer as well. I realize that its still very early in the game but I feel that it is making a difference. I should note however that I also switched to a natural shampoo (True Moroccan) that is non toxic and sulfate/paraben free and have changed my diet to healthier eating (no red meat and plenty of veggies and fruits) along with running 3 miles per day. In short, I would definitely recommend this castor oil and if and when I do happen to run out (did I mention how huge this bottle is?) I will continue on this hair regimen and report back after another 2-3 months has passed to update my review.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this on her feet for just two days and is raving about how much better they feel - they were dry and achy.</li>
            <li> The Home Health Castor oil is good quality, it is thick and does not have a strong odor,  and good  price value for buying larger size.  Overall Castor oil is better on your skin than other oils, tends to be thicker than, almond, coconut oil.  Good use also for children with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the seller. Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, using the oil for skin for 3 days do not see results yet. Oil does not smell and looks like does not taste bad, for those who want to use it internally; very thick, little hard to apply on skin, so some people mix it with other oil.</li>
            <li> I have been natural since December of 2012 and did the big chop in June of 2013.  I have been struggling with dry brittle hair  and flaky scalp (psoriasis) and researched that this product would help thicken and seal moisture within the hair strands and relieve psoriasis.  I use this in a mixture of olive, tea tree, glycerin, and coconut oils.  My hair is very moisturized and shiny.  It has been growing steadily and I have not seen any of the psoriasis.  I will be ordering more.  I wish all the best in their healthy hair challenge!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly and frizzy hair. I love using oils on my ends to keep them healthy and supple. Castor oil is such a great product. When you use it properly is really helps with breakage and slow growth. I have never had a growth problem but as my hair gets longer I have to be more actively combating breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;I spray my thick curly hair with water.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the castor oil. (Just enough to coat my hair not drown my hair)&lt;br /&gt;I apply conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is always supple hydrated curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this oil is that it is cheap and you get lots of it. I even share mine with my brother who is working on growing his hair out and his friends and family and still have plenty left over. I would recommend this to people with thick and coarse hair. Castor oil is very heavy so if you have thin/medium hair it may weigh your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing when I run out.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell, but there is nothing to do about it, since is too thick I thinned it with lavender oil, I&#x27;ve been using it every night in my eye lashes and no lie, my lashes are longer that fuller. Love it. I use it in my hair ends, but I can smell the stink during the day, even if I mix it up with the other oils, anyways I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars bc it gave me amazing eye lashes!</li>
            <li> Very good quality. Will buy more from this company.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality Castor Oil, It is thick and extremely moisturizing. It worked wonders on my hair and is also a great base oil for herb infusion.</li>
            <li> I use this for my eyelashes and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in just a couple of days after using it! My eyelashes were darker and longer. But it can get uncomfortable when you put them on your eyelashes as they make them sticky and heavy but if you want results you&#x27;re gonna have to be patient. I bought a mascara brush and use it to apply on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I gave it 4 stars because I think it is better in glass bottles.  Plastic isn&#x27;t a solid and really not good to hold especially oils.  But castor oil is amazing for so many things.  you need to google it. you would be amazed.  It helps relieve pain in your feet or joints.  Sometimes when I am on my feet all day and they are killing me, I will rub this on them and it&#x27;s amazing how much better they feel.  It also will help in growing eyelashes and eyebrows back in or thickening them up.  Needless to say this will work on your head too if your hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> I use this product not for home health but for yard health.  I mix the Castor Oil with extremely hot ground pepper to treat an infestation of voles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment does not kill the voles, but makes their lives so miserable that they move to my neighbors&#x27; yard for a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a more permanent solution to a vole or mole problem, team up this treatment with a good hunting cat.  The treatment drives the critters out of the ground and the cat does what cats do..</li>
            <li> Excellent product for hair and castor oil packs!</li>
            <li> Great quality product</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used it to make several cold infusions with herbs for my hair. I use it on my scalp to promote hair growth as well as my eye lashes and eye brows. It works really well. I was beginning to notice new hair growth after about 2 weeks.  It is a very thick product and is a bit difficult to apply directly to your scalp at room temperature. I recommend heating a 1/4c in the microwave for approximately 30 seconds for any kind of cosmetic use.</li>
            <li> Great product...  Will purchase again...  It has helped to control my appetite and regulate my digestive system very well.  It is a must in our household now...</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price!</li>
            <li> My 94 yr old Mother has used this product daily for many years to rub down her arthritic  joints. She swears by it. She usually buys from a different vendor, supplies are often spotty. I was able to get her a years supply for much less with no shipping or tax applied. Needless to say she was thrilled! Hope I can buy another years supply when she hits 95! I have used this product myself in the winter when my hands get a bit stiff, I can say it seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Good price for product. Very thick oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I mix it half with coconut oil and use it on my hair. Works wonders....</li>
            <li> There is not a lot to say about castor oil, it came on time, it came in an unopened bottle, I&#x27;m not sure what more you can ask. We purchased it after reading about a castor oil based concoction used to ward off moles.  The traps that leave skewered moles in my yard aren&#x27;t much better than the dozens of holes and tunnels, so we are giving this castor oil concoction a try, whether or not it works probably has very little to do with the quality of the castor oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great cold-pressed castor oil.  This is a wonderful oil for the face - will keep you hydrated and stave off wrinkles.  You can also use this for the oil cleansing method to wash your face, I find it a bit to heavy for that myself.  I use this under my eyes, on my lids, on my lashes and on my forehead as a mask.  Its a great quality oil and an awesome one to have in every household.</li>
            <li> Mix this with Rosemary or jojoba and watch your skin glow and hair grow! It&#x27;s wonderful and long lasting! Try it now!</li>
            <li> I dnt like the smell but I let this sit on my ends as a treatment cause they are always so frizzy and I&#x27;m natural I washed it out and flat ironed my hair with a little coconut oil and my hair was so soft and smooth felt like weave lol but my hair is also growing like crazy great stuff will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different castor oils, but nothing seems to work as good as this. I have many dry patches on my face and this stuff does wonders. Love it</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Fast, professional transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li> Great quality; use it in all sorts of homemade lotion/salves. You get a lot for a little price; will buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought this to try on moles,  It certainly smells bad enough to keep me away, but apparently the moles really don&#x27;t care.  So the product is as advertized, but I think traps are the only real way to get rid of moles.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great for control of political cyst</li>
            <li> I use this in soap making. Awesome thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product but it leaked so I have to dock for that. Product packaging may have to improve in this case, so buyers beware. Buy it if you need Castor Oil I guess? It wasn&#x27;t like half of it leaked out but it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> This is some awesome stuff!! I wasn&#x27;t sure about it when I bought it,but after using it I&#x27;m hooked!! This and coconut oil is all i use now.. I stopped using all the chemical laden products out there.. This really soaks into the skin  and makes my skin soft,I can see a big difference in my skin .. Great time to really see the difference is right after a shower.. I will never again use  anything else on my skin except this and coconut oil.. I even use this on my face.. You can add a few drops of essential oil in your choice of fragrance.. I have lavender, I put a little of this oil in a separate  smaller squeeze bottle, add a couple drops of the lavender essential oil and mix.. and it&#x27;s good to go!!  I will buy this again, when it runs out ..</li>
            <li> works out great in homemade body washes and Eyebrows and eyelashes</li>
            <li> Use it every day in my practice.  It works great with peppermint essential oil and hot compress.</li>
            <li> I love using this oil for packs it is very great. This  came very quickly and on time, it was well package but once I took it out the package I noticed it was leaking so I had to put it in a glass jar to save what I can. I think next time it needs to be packed tighter.</li>
            <li> After applying this to my eyelashes daily I was able to see visible improvement to the length and thickness of my lashes within four days. I&#x27;m highly impressed. I find the smell of it strange. It&#x27;s not good or bad. It&#x27;s just strange but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from applying it to my eyelashes, eyebrows, and hair. The benefits definitely outweigh the weird smell.</li>
            <li> Bought it to apply on my eyebrows and remembered I have extremely oily skin and this will break my skin out. Well now I use it for hair because I thought I paid for a small bottle but this bottle was huge for this amazing price. I might even share some with a friend. :)</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing &amp; has done wonders for my aches and pains.  Even though it is a little messy, it is truly worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this castor oil on my face for 2 weeks and I have seen a considerable difference for the better.  I hope it continue to work this good on my skin. Grate buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Item came quickly but all the bottle was cracked and a majority of the oil spilled in the box and my other items. It was covered in plastic but that didn&#x27;t help at all</li>
            <li> Good stuff; I continue to order this!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It is castor oil at a great value. We use it on our hair and skin. It has helped our hair to grow thicker and faster.</li>
            <li> Repeat user and this year was recommended by my doctor/ told her i have been using it for many years..... Recently i have been rubbing my body with it as an oil message and showering after 15-30 mins/ I read that the skin is able to absorb all the vitamins❗️ Excellent for dry skin patches</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Great Value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this weekly and love the results.  This is a high-quality product that is reasonably priced.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wonderful healing oil. Used for massages n its great</li>
            <li> I use it for my castor oil packs and its a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Very good quality produt i use it on hair and skin</li>
            <li> It arrived fast.. and just what I expected!  Except for the fact that the bottle was cracked at the top.  And it did leak a little..  bit still..  great product!</li>
            <li> I buy castor oil regularly.  It is great for a pre-poo for your hair. Great to use on your eyebrows to fix those bad eyebrow wax jobs and my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle! Works for any different uses. I use this in my oil cleansing method. Great value and product</li>
            <li> made soap with this oil. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I make my owns shaving oil and this is my base.  Tons of value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cold pressed is always the highest quality in any oil... especially if it&#x27;s labeled &#x27;First Cold Pressed.&#x27;</li>
            <li> ive tried everything from JBCO to shea mosture products, to almond oil, and yet my hair kept responding negatively to it! (I have 4c hair btw) With JBCO the oil was TOO strong for my hair and made it heavy. I mix HHCO with 2 drops of essential peppermint oil massage it into my scalp every morning, and my hairline is back! The bottle cost me $9 at my local health food store, it as WELL worth it.</li>
            <li> Received this large bottle of castor oil and this&lt;br /&gt;I believe will last me awhile. It was wrapped again&lt;br /&gt;in plastic for spillage I guess. And I am grateful&lt;br /&gt;for that. When I do run out I will order this size&lt;br /&gt;again. I am pleased with its size.</li>
            <li> Oh yum!! No, I don&#x27;t actually drink this nooooooo! I bought it to use in making My own homemade soaps and shampoo bars,</li>
            <li> It was suggested that castor oil be used for arthritis, sciatica, back pain and other conditions. I wasn&#x27;t aware of this previously and am in the process of seeing if this will be helpful for me as well.</li>
            <li> This bottle is quite large and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. I use quite a bit of Castor Oil at home with castor oil packs to ward off gallstone attacks (works like a charm). I also put a bit in my face lotion at night and it makes a huge difference with my complexion. Why spend a lot of money on face products when you can look great for a few cents? Caution, will likely leave an oil stain on your pillow but, considering the price of a new pillow case I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well</li>
            <li> Good quality product. I&#x27;m using it to soften scar tissue from a past surgery and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and product was very good quality!</li>
            <li> This worked really well as a castor pack for my liver, I was astounded at what it did for my body wide inflammation not by topical application on those spots but by helping my liver clear.  This sounds like quackery but take it from a guy who has tried everything and does not expect anything to work.  This also helped me recover from a respiratory infection, this increases white blood cells and I preach it, this stuff works.  I bought this for topical application but my skin was actually sensitive to it so I couldn&#x27;t use it for my atopic dermatitis.  This is one of the best buys ive had for the year.</li>
            <li> I like it very much !!!</li>
            <li> It came right on time and was well packaged. This oil works really great for my hair will keep using it. It needs to be refrigerated if not after awhile you&#x27;ll see mold in it. Its really thick so if you are using it on your hair mix it with coconut oil, olive oil or you can just warm it up.</li>
            <li> I love this castor oil helps in my skin lightening the scars, helps my hair grow back. I love so much  I will buy this again and again for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil in various ways- for medical and hair use. I have used this oil on the chest, temples and under the feet to help fight colds and flu. This is a really good product to have at home!</li>
            <li> Quality product, cold pressed means untreated  healthful product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better cold pressed castor oils.  It is not as thick and mixes well with other oils.</li>
            <li> Love it, it has helped my skin feel softer and my hair also. I do recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I use this for homemade soap and the first batch turned out just fine, I have nothing negitive to report on this product.</li>
            <li> Very good item use it in my hair creams and shampoos. My hair is very dry and this item leave it soft</li>
            <li> Yes! Great stuff fast ship!!</li>
            <li> Best thing for my hair and skin. I use it to moisturize my hair on a weekly basis and it works great. My last bottle lasted me about a year and I think it is well worth the money. Will keep repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it as a facial cleanser and am very happy with it. The amount goes  a long way. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I recieved an odd looking Cator oil. The oil was very yellow and had a tear in the bottle from which it had leaked all over the packaging. I am sure even the delivery guy felt the oil cos it seeped through the cardbox. I wanted to return it but thought that would be a waste because it would probably  be half empty before it got anywhere or to its destination. I will not be using the product, however. I usually apply my Castor Oil topically and it is absorbed into my systerm. I obviously cannot use it since the plastic is broken and therefore I can no longer guarantee the authenticity of the contents. Very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is actually, what it is suppose to be good reasonable price, came in a timely manor. I will be purchasing more.  I love it</li>
            <li> Bottle was cracked and leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> I am using this in a solution to repel moles so it works great.</li>
            <li> Price was good and product works well! I think it has the best value for what I was looking for, I am mixing it with virgin olive oil for a face wash.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes skin perfectly. It has a thick texture. So I use it at nights, before going to bed. Until morning my skin absorbs it totally. So the oily appearance disappears. I highly recommend it to those who has dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it actually grew my edges back</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as expected. The item didn&#x27;t arrive damaged. Perfect!! Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Castor oil packs are a great way to detox.  Liking this.</li>
            <li> Love castor oil. I use in in my home made skin cream along with other essential oils. I also use it on my face, lashes, and as cuticle oil. The size of the bottle is perfect.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping through Prime, good price, quality oil.</li>
            <li> this is supposed to be 100% pure oil, Hexane free, which means it should be safe to ingest ... yet the bottle says &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34;. true pure oil would be safe for consumption (for constipation &amp; health issues)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this and have used it in lip balms, soaps and other beauty products.  I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils. I have had stubborn toenail fungus on my big toe for over twenty five years. I sought help from all kinds of doctors who would prescribe creams, pills, or otc products. After waiting many months for results, I was always disappointed. I even decided to ask to have the toenail removed till I found out it wouldn&#x27;t grow back. Way in the back of my medicine cabinet I saw this castor oil and gave it a try. At first it was hard to believe, but it actually works! Yay! It really works, and it was better by about two weeks. That was 6 months ago. I still apply it once a day or so because I don&#x27;t want the fungus to ever come back. I put it on my feet too, feet never looked so good!</li>
            <li> Awesome ! Just came from vocation. My hair was was almost dead because of the pool bleach .. Honestly, I was very afraid that I will have to cut it ( got ombres couple of months ago ). It looked horrible!!! Until tried this castor oil and things changed !! My hair is so shiny and healthy .. Even the blonde ends look so good!! I&#x27;m going To order it all the time!!!</li>
            <li> NICE AND THICK...MY SKIN IS SOFTER ALREADY....GREAT FOR DRY FEET</li>
            <li> I used this with the flannel wool that I purchased and it worked very well. I like the quality of this Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, worked as expected and it made my hair and skin very soft. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month but so far, so good.  I will be purchasing it again.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my home made Oilve oil and thought to use something easy to get. I researched a bit and planned to get this bottle ( I always had a notion \\&quot;Cheap things are never good and good things are never cheap\\&quot;). I used Castor Oil with a mix of few drops of Almond oil on daily basis and after 3 months of use, when I got haircut, to my surprise I find my hair thinner and am loosing them fast. I stopped using this product 2 days ago and will switch to Biotin to see if I can get my Hair back in shape.&lt;br /&gt;Really bad product I feel like wasted my money on this bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to rate oil since I am just getting into using oils for health and beauty...but this seem to be a very good oil.</li>
            <li> I totally love this castor oil I use it for everything. I make my own black castor oil and it has grown me and my children hair tremendously.</li>
            <li> Arrived when stated and at a good price!!</li>
            <li> Use it every day as a hand ointment for my sensitive overworked hands, to sooth  and relieve discomfort. Works well, although a bit greasy at first, after a little while it seems to soak into the skin and leave skin soft.</li>
            <li> First time buying this kind of oil, i&#x27;ve been using it to help with hair growth, my eyebrows and my eyelashes and I&#x27;ve seen quite improvement in my eyelashes in just the first week in receiving it though since I&#x27;m quite sensitive too smell, the smell of it bothered me but you definitely get over it !</li>
            <li> LOVE THE THICKNESS OF THE CASTOR OIL AND IT DOES WONDERS FOR MY NATURAL HAIR ALSO WHEN I MIX IT WITH OTHER OILS AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH I WILL BE REORDERING THIS CASTOR IN THE FUTURE</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly,well packed, worked well</li>
            <li> Great quality. I got this to try out the oil cleansing method of face washing. I use 20% castor oil and 80% sunflower and it&#x27;s a great combination. Works perfectly!!</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to swallow...and certainly more reasonable that all of the stool softeners on the market!</li>
            <li> Castor oil in general was recommended to me by a friend, so I decided to try it.  I decided on Home Health in particular after comparing price, quantity of product, and the fact that it is not heat processed!  I like this product a lot!  It is a bit thick, but I expected that.  It is tacky when you first put it on, but really no more than any other oil type product and maybe not as much as some I have tried.  The best thing for me is that I put this on my areas in need right after I get out of the shower and it helps hold the moisture!</li>
            <li> FOLK MEDICINE SUGGESTS IF YOU RUB CASTSOR OIL INTO THE BACK OF YOUR HANDS EVERY NIGHT YOU WON&#x27;T DEVELOP \\&quot;LIVER SPOTS\\&quot; WHEN YOU GET OLDER.  IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. This oil really helped my eyebrows grow . Using it in my hair now. Want to start mixing it with other oils to see what I can create</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert on castor oil. As far as I know it is as it&#x27;s suppose to be. it came on time and was packaged well.. I used it for arthritis and sometimes internally.</li>
            <li> This product was as described and I would say it is a good price.  I use it for soap making.</li>
            <li> I ordered and paid for 32 ounce Home Health Castor Oil, Cold Pressed and Cold Processed and received  4 ounce Home Health Moisturizing Cream, Hyaluronic Acid, with Restorative Hydration Complex. The product I received had the right label though. Luckily Amazon has great customer service and gave me an instant refund and I returned the product.</li>
            <li> Nice and good in quality</li>
            <li> Arrived in a box and it was protected well...no leaks or spills!</li>
            <li> great price. good for healing the body, great for hair softening and highly recommend this brand. also get the wool cloth</li>
            <li> Very satisfied will repurchase for sure</li>
            <li> It is amazing and I never felt my hair so healthier before</li>
            <li> Husband excited to see results of health benefits.</li>
            <li> This is the only oil I&#x27;ve found that actually softens my hair. Coconut and even Olive oil would be fine for an hour or so, but then leavemy hair drier than before! I&#x27;m Caucasian and have coarse, very bleached hair. So I needed to find something that would make it look not so fried and damaged. I mix this with argan oil, as castor oil alone is very thick and sticky. but like I said it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Best castor oil. I love it.</li>
            <li> Just started using this but wanted to add that if u poor it in like a dropper bottle u can apply a lot easier on your hair without all the mess as I was reading in sum of the reviews!! 😊</li>
            <li> Arrived well-packaged. This is my first bottle of castor oil, but I have used this brand&#x27;s vitamin e serum, which I liked. I use it as part of a face wash with sunflower oil and tea tree oil. So far my skin seems to be responding well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; castor oil would be like, but I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> very pleased and received item quick</li>
            <li> Works great in my hair and on my baby&#x27;s dry skin. The bottle is huge, and it was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I use this on my scalp everyday lightly and i have seen growth my hair is growing fast with this oil and its thick so it lasts a very long time. It doesn&#x27;t smell great but it doesn&#x27;t stink either it made my hair thicker and longer and its a great price for that size.</li>
            <li> It works wonders for hemorrhoids, they disappear with continued use and i also use it to remove make-up.  I&#x27;m sure there are many other uses, this product will always be a staple in our household.  Glad to see it on Amazon and good price.</li>
            <li> Great seller, great product, A++</li>
            <li> I use this for my skin, my eyebrows, and lashes! I can see that my eyebrows and lashes are growing and my skin has gotten super soft! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> As described. Very thick, I now know that I really didn&#x27;t need to buy the 32 oz because this bottle will last me a very long time. I have mainly used it for oil washing but plan to try it for many other things as well. Also bought a bottle for my mother to help with some issues she has.</li>
            <li> I make my own whipped shea butter mix &amp; this is a good quality ingredient.</li>
            <li> Great for my daughter who has eczema. Wish I knew about this year&#x27;s ago to treat ski scars.</li>
            <li> good for hair and skin  , i am very happy with the product.  my skin is now  nice and smooth</li>
            <li> Very weary good it has increased my hair growth a lot I even apply it to my eyebrows and lashes.</li>
            <li> Used as a mole repellent, the jury is still out.</li>
            <li> This castor oil is my second attempt at implementing into my hair routine. My first  brand was super thick and horrible on my scalp. This brand, although no frills, is a lighter consistency allowing me to add other good stuff to make a hair and scalp oil I  use every day without a tremendous amount of buildup</li>
            <li> Amazing brand: I appreciate the quality of the castor oil-I use it for my hair, skin, bad knee, and even as an effective remedy for dry eyes (I am a contact lens wearer). The reason I gave it 4 stars is the plastic bottle and cap it has: I would appreciate a dark glass container and a better pouring top, because it always runs when I pour it.</li>
            <li> This has worked wonders in every way that I&#x27;ve tried it so far. There are several things on Pinterest that you can read what Castor Oil is good for. So far used it on a few fungus spots that my husband has just started on his arm from his job. Used it on my moms hair that is falling out from several brain injuries this year. I soaked her head in Castor Oil then I added a lil almond oil and coconut oil and tea tree oil. Her hair looked amazing in one treatment. From hard course to soft. I&#x27;ve made lotions with it also bc of all of its great benefits.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve been putting this on some major scar tissue and wounds and its making a huge difference! My skin in general looks better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Castor oil can help you fight infection. The oil can energize the immune system by increasing the number of white blood cells in your system. In studies, when castor oil was applied to the outside of the body, the white blood cell count was increased within 24 hours of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I just wish I had found out about all the wonderful things this oil does sooner! Check it out... http://www.beautyandtips.com/beautyoils/28-wonderful-castor-oil-benefits-and-uses-for-beauty-hair-and-health/</li>
            <li> My boyfriend always compliments me on how smooth my skin is.  This is a highly inexpensive way to do it.  In the last minutes of your shower, apply all over body and rinse lightly.  Towel dry.  Some oil is left behind, but not enough to soil clothes (as I have found).  No more department store chemical laden moisturizers for me.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. Delivered quickly and an excellent product. Use the castor oil for hair, skin, and several other things. Never realized how well it works for hair and skin moisturizing. This product is nice and thick and it doesn&#x27;t take much. Slight nutty smell that does not linger (not unpleasant at all). Will be buying more when this runs out, although this 32 oz bottle will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I found this product odorless and easy to use, castor oil is castor oil however there are different qualities and this one is nice, price wasn&#x27;t bad and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> It fits the bill, bought it to help with moles in back yard. ( I read they don&#x27;t like castor oil) so far can&lt;br /&gt;t tell if it works or not, they are still with me, but a large amount that was hard to find anywhere else and delivered in 2 days.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I am so happy to use it.  I use it for my castor oil pack for various of treatments and works well.</li>
            <li> great product/gr8 price/overall purchase experience, it met met my expectations :-)</li>
            <li> I started using this in my face and body scrub and it has helped make my scrub do its job so much better than the castor oil I was using before. Great product and price!</li>
            <li> Good for castor oil packs to soothe the belly and also for skin. I wish it were organic..</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the bottle. I bought this once before and had problems with the other bottle as well.  This one wasn&#x27;t sealed tight (the inner seal was loose) and it dripped a bit in shipping. I always have to keep the bottle in a plastic bag, as the oil runs down the sides of the bottle and makes a mess. Wish they would do something to remedy this!</li>
            <li> Diluted with water,  I use this as a hair moisturizer and to massage my scalp. My hair is curly and coarse so 3B if going by the hair chart and this is great for when my curls need a boost. I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my hair straight as I can&#x27;t use any products on my straightened hair because the hair turns greasy and lifeless quick. I also have used this in combination with my african shea butter on my feet, leaving them extra soft. It seems I am weekly finding various uses for this product! I really enjoy that for almost every use so far I never have to use more than a nickel size amount which means this large bottle is going a long ways.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at the size and quality of the packaging - very attractive. I&#x27;m using to combat a very sore toe joint. Other treatments have had little effect. I&#x27;ve been using about a week a couple of times a day and it is helping. I plan to continue using to see if the soreness disappears.</li>
            <li> Great product works well for my joint pain</li>
            <li> It is soooo useful for so many things. I use on my hair,eyebrows, eyelashes, and I even oil pull with it for my teeth. I love it</li>
            <li> was exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic when I first heard about using castor oil for thinning hair. But I was desperate so I tried it anyway... and wallah, It does work!!! After the 4th application to my hair, I noticed that there were lots of new hair growth. So I&#x27;m going to continue to use it until it produces the optimum desired effect .</li>
            <li> I purchased this for someone knowing nothing of castor oil... this brand cannot be used internally so it had to be returned. Just know that ahead of time so you dont drink it :)</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> She used it in one of her beauty treatments and plans on buying more once this one runs out.  Shipping was fast and ahead of schedule.  Great job guys!</li>
            <li> My favorite. Use it for my hair and skin... Just perfect</li>
            <li> very large bottle...great quality too!</li>
            <li> I sent this Castor Oil back because it had numerous warnings regarding its usage on the label on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for a castor oil compress.  I used it twice a day to relieve back pain from a work injury and it worked beautifully.  Within 2 days the pain was gone and inflammation greatly reduced.  Can&#x27;t beat the price on a great product.</li>
            <li> This oil is simple to use, but very much effective.  It really does wonders with the likes of mucsles and joints. Plus it goes well with the likes of [[ASIN:B000BNRKPY Heritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ounce]] which I found to be a surprise. I think this is a great item to have, or at least try out. It really is a fantastic oil.</li>
            <li> very good product. Has many uses. Love it for my skin and for facials. Great for skin and facials. Would by again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use this castor oil to clean my face &amp; it does a great job! My skin has cleared up so much! I use 1 tsp castor oil &amp; 3 tsps of almond oil. Rub it in &amp; then wash it off with a soft washcloth. I don&#x27;t even have to use moisturizer afterwards. Does a great job of keeping my skin clean &amp; moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been itching for years! I have tried everything. I purchased castor oil at Walmart - no luck. After further research I found this castor oil and decided what the heck I was miserable...This stuff is like liquid gold. It actually works in minutes. As an added benefit it is also lightening my scars on my legs from all the scratching. So if you are itching and/or have scars I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works well on my Shi-Tzu&#x27;s fatty cysts.</li>
            <li> I just have 3 days using the product but I am waiting for teh results because I have read that it is miracle for many things.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for something that would help with my psoriasis and I came across a review for this product so decided to try it. I have been able to use it on my scalp and my body to ease itch and flaking. It&#x27;s thick so it&#x27;s difficult to wash out of hair but it helps tremendously. I&#x27;ve used it as a scrub with coffee grounds and it leaves my skin silky smooth. It was delivered to my doorstep in 2 days. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I had an odd growth on the side of my breast. After reading about caster oil and that it is used for warts and skin tags I bought some.  I applied it mixed with baking soda and that spot is completely gone.  I saved me a visit to the doctors which would have been over $100 I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> This cold pressed castor oil works just as expected. I purchased it for an oil mixture that I use in my natural hair regimen. Which is:&lt;br /&gt;1oz jamaican black castor oil&lt;br /&gt;2oz cold pressed castor oil&lt;br /&gt;1oz hempseed oil&lt;br /&gt;10 drops Rosehip seed oil&lt;br /&gt;5 drops tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;It helps me spread out the use of the jbco and still get the great benefits of castor oil. I will repurchase when I run out, which is not going to be anytime soon since this is a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> I love it for the extra quality it provides my homemade soaps</li>
            <li> Great bargain for the price! I got this to use as part of my nightly facial routine. This is a very generous size for the price being asked.</li>
            <li> sent promptly. good product.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for it&#x27;s heaviness. I used shea, olive, and other oils. I have to reapply them to my dry skin and hair. I had so many plans for this 32 oz bottle after reading the great reviews. I wanted to use it in my hair and on my skin. I just knew this is what I needed to add to those dry area such as my elbows, knees, and heels. Oh my it&#x27;s so sticky and smelly. Yes, it works great for those areas only but as an all over moisturizer NO...too sticky. I was hoping this would be my next all over oil...no way. I wear my hair natural so I just knew this would be a great moisurizer for my thick mane. Yes, it moisturizes well, but it&#x27;s so thick to rub in and not to mention the smell is not something you would want to leave on your hair. I&#x27;m sorry this is not going to work for me. I will use it for problem areas until it&#x27;s gone or to use as an hot oil treatment. More than likely won&#x27;t buy again. I will stick to my olive and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> What can you say about Castor Oil</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this product...my hair was dry and brittle and skin dry and chapped...I recently had my son and hormones caused alot of dryness...I used this product on my hair and skin and the results were amazing...My skin is shiny, glowing and my husband can&#x27;t keep his hands off...my hair has grown thicker and shiny. I&#x27;m a believer and this is the product for me. I didn&#x27;t mix it with anything. I used it straight out the bottle.</li>
            <li> hard to tell what effect this has.  with regular use some were saying my skin was looking much better..xx xxx xx xx xx xx xx</li>
            <li> Great value, love this brand</li>
            <li> I received it pretty quick. Is perfect for the project i was working on and seems to be very high quality.  Would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It is Castor oil. There is not much to say about it. I&#x27;m not a castor oil expert. I used it for soap and it worked. I don&#x27;t take it internally, so I can&#x27;t say anything about that.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. Got this for my hair as oil treatments once a week. I mix it with Rosemary hair oil and leave for about an hr. Has made my hair stronger and healthier. Also great for acne. Had some acne bumps on my forehead. I use this as my OCM and has cleared any acne that appears. I also use it as a face moisturizer overnight then wash in the AM. Great product for many different uses.</li>
            <li> Excellent and prontly service</li>
            <li> Although this oil can&#x27;t be taken internally, it makes my skin super soft &amp; makes my eyelashes grow. For whatever reason, I can&#x27;t put it in my hair because it makes my head burn &amp; it makes my face break out (must be some sort of allergic reaction). But when I apply it to my arms &amp; legs, it works wonders at softening my skin. I prefer to use it during winter months since it&#x27;s so heavy &amp; it helps to keep me a little bit warmer. Try applying some to your stomach if you have issues with constipation.</li>
            <li> I wish it was organic</li>
            <li> Product appears to be exactly as described.  Product was properly sealed against contamination.  Just started using this castor oil so can&#x27;t comment on whether it will live up to the purported health benefits.</li>
            <li> Someone told me about using this for your facial moisturizer.while I love coconut oil it had begun to dry my skin badly...go ahead...Google it don&#x27;t dispute it. So this turns out to be a great alternative mixed with 1/3 olive oil and 2/3 caster oil. It&#x27;s great on my face, my feet and hands...making me look and feel younger. Big huge difference on my feet! It is heavily used in the cosmetic industry also....very happy with it and plan to,buy more in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my massage practice. It is to be used on the feet as it is heavy/thick. No perfume.</li>
            <li> Love it and will order more.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff around.....it says your not suppose to drink it but I did, I love the results.  I put it on my hair my skin.......I love it</li>
            <li> I have been using castor oil for about 2 months and I can say that this works!. I started on May 2 and today is June 27. My eyelashes had improved enormously.In fact 7 days layer my eyelashes grown and got thicker. I am very disciplined person and put it in my eyelids everyday. So be patient. Next i will try it in my scalp .&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews but I just had to for this product. My hair was thinning and falling out before using this product and now I can&#x27;t believe how thick and full my hair has gotten! Will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> Great value for amount . Will last me a long time</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the purchase. Came fast, as expected. Good price. Nice thick oil makes it easier to make a compress out of.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this Castor oil. I use it by itself and also mix it with coconut oil to slather on as a moisturizer. Heavenly! After the first bottle, I bought two more to make sure that I never run out. ;)</li>
            <li> High quality castor oil at a good price.</li>
            <li> Wow, this formula has really good healing properties. One massage with this help to relieve my husband&#x27;s acheing knees. I love the texture of it as well; I plan to use it for numerous things. Thanks you guys for sending me my Castor Oil new as purchase and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my hands and feet and love the peanutty smell as well as the softer texture it is giving them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://altmedicine.about.com/od/constipation/a/Castor-Oil.htm - About consumption, this is why some bottles say not for consumption; Castor oil is a natural remedy derived from the castor bean (Ricinus communis). Long used in traditional medicine, castor oil is often found in lubricants and in laxatives. The main component of castor oil is ricinoleic acid, a type of fatty acid shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since castor oil can be toxic when consumed in large amounts, medical experts typically recommend using it only externally over unbroken skin.</li>
            <li> well my granny use to use this for many things&lt;br /&gt;I remember this and decided to purchase the oil. I was very pleased with its quality and the quantity</li>
            <li> The product is great but did not suit me.</li>
            <li> Great product for my hair</li>
            <li> I used this product in the evening before bed for two weeks to get rid of ache. It works really well. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it!</li>
            <li> really brought life back to my overly processed hair. I would not out this on my hair before going out. the texture is very goopy and thick. I also use this on my tattoo. it brings the colors out and makes it look new. using on hair overnight would be best. takes a couple washes to get out but left hair very strong and healthy feeling. you also get a lot and doesn&#x27;t take a lot for application.</li>
            <li> great product and fast shipping time</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. It would be nice if there was a different type of opening. I find it to be quite messy.</li>
            <li> Excellent,my daughter had knee pain from getting hit in soccer and we applied ice for two days ,i was told to use this oil and give her a massage + heat,i did it,i bought it and gave her massage and applied heat three times a week ,her pain is gone,no more pain ever,we are happy ,now i am use it for my shoulder pain,i would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Best Castor Oil I have ever used. The little ones in the store are almost $6.00 for a tiny bottle, and this cold pressed and a much better bargain!</li>
            <li> i have start to use this product.. i have a problem of hair fall and i have lost so many hairs... now i am using this... lets see the result....&lt;br /&gt;can any one tell me the usage process? means any precautions etc?</li>
            <li> first time user so nothing to compare it too. Use it as a topical ointment for hand tendons.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time buying this brand....and I love it</li>
            <li> Great product very satisfied</li>
            <li> Good quality, I use it to remove my makeup and my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews and tutorials I read and watched on You Tube that recommended it highly for kinky, black hair - type 4C. I purchased it primarily for thickening my hair and to make it grow longer.  I have been using it for roughly 5 weeks now and this product is absolutely the truth!!!!  The thickness of my hair is amazing, the texture is soft and manageable and I&#x27;ve started regrowing hair in the hairline areas that were challenged to say the least.  I have used the biotins, hair vitamins, the hair pomades, hair growth lotions you name it, all with disappointing results.  But this castor oil product has given me no less than 1 inch of growth in a month.  That is unheard of.  My hairdresser was very impressive and asked that the heck I was using. Needless to say she is also using it now.  I honestly thought that all the testimonials on You Tube for this product were embellished but having used it myself I have to admit it works, works, works!  I have found that applying peppermint oil to the scalp in conjunction with this oil is an added bonus.  I will be ordering this product for a long time to come.  Apart from the application to the hair, I sometimes use it on my face at night and the next day, my skin is so supple and moisturized that it&#x27;s a makeup free day for me.  This product is a must have among your beauty products.</li>
            <li> This castor oil has performed wonderfully in my handcrafted bath products!!</li>
            <li> This was a great value, I use it as a cleansing oil for my face. Recently I&#x27;ve read mixed reviews on using Castor oil for facial cleansing so I&#x27;m not positive I will be buying it again when it runs out but the quality of this product was fantastic and I loved being able to buy a large size for a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy that my castor oil finally got here! I would&#x27;ve definitely given 5stars but the bottle was broken luckily I had another bottle that I was able to transfer the castor oil into! That was my only problem with it. Other than that I&#x27;m super pleased :)</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> Good quality, great price</li>
            <li> Satisfied in every way!</li>
            <li> I use this oil to make soap, and it&#x27;s worked well--looks, feels, and behaves exactly like other castor oil that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve also used it on my skin a few times instead of lotion when my hands get really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you might care about is that this bottle has only a screw top, not a flip top like you might find on other bottles (where you can pour out a more controlled amount of the oil). This is, at most, a minor inconvenience, and I still think it&#x27;s worth it since, as of the time of my writing, this is one of the best prices you&#x27;ll find.</li>
            <li> Good old-fashioned castor oil.  It handy to have around for various health reasons.  i put the oil on my age spots and it seems  to lighten them.  I also use the oil to clean my kitty&#x27;s ears.</li>
            <li> I got this oil after doing thorough research on castor oil. I finally decided to try this. Boy did I get my money&#x27;s worth this stuff is incredible! I took the risk of trying it out with moderate underestimation, the oil is thick and POTENT so I mixed it with melted coconut oil. Then I massaged it into my scalp along with the inversion method. Low and behold I had about. Mmmm 8cm basically a full inch. And no my hair DOES NOT FRIZZ it just doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m blessed. But please remember less is more! I got homehealth castor oil from vitacost dot com be cuz the shipping from Amazon is a full fledged $5 which totals the whole purchase to $19. Not for me. But hair wise this is possibly the smartest purchase I&#x27;ve made</li>
            <li> I love castor oil for my dry skin.  It is so great on face especially for your eye area.  I have received compliments on my skin looking young. I am 65. And I am blessed.  It is also more economical than expensive eye creams and serums.  It is rather oily. But it absorbs and stays in the skin to keep it hydrated.  I also use olive and coconut oil.  Very versatile.  I believe that if you can use it on your body, it should be safe to consume.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this. I mix it with olive oil and some essential oils and my hair drinks it up and gets soft bouncy and beautiful. I have naturally very curly kinky hair And oil keeps my hair so soft and not greasy</li>
            <li> Great thick oil. I use this in a homemade baby wipe recipe.</li>
            <li> Half of the bottle leaked out before it arrived. There was a a plastic covering over it but it didn&#x27;t help at all. Product got all over everything and was a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and moisturized</li>
