            <li> This product is okay.  I&#x27;d like to see it have a little more of a firmer hold. I definately like the fine mist spray! That is very good for fine limp hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for baby fine hair. Amazon has the best prices around for Phyto products!! I keep reordering</li>
            <li> I have been using Phyto hair care products for a couple of years.  I absolutely love the look and the feel of this volumnizer.</li>
            <li> This product, believe it or not, actually does increase the volume of one&#x27;s hair! I use it on the front part of my hairline and along the part, both places that have thinned out with age (in my 50&#x27;s). When I want a fuller look, I use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for baby fine hair----Works great----I have used  for many years and just love it.  Highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  No odor, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because the product did everything it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;Love what it does to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommed this product to several friend.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair.  This product gives my hair volume and makes it look fantastic.  My hair does have more static when I use this product, but it&#x27;s easily manageable.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with spray nozzle.  Gives volume.  Staying power.  Makes my hair look&lt;br /&gt;thicker than ever before.  One of the best.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin and hard to curl hair. I was very excited about using this product after reading reviews here and else where.&lt;br /&gt;All it did for my hair was \\&quot;Weigh\\&quot; it down and make it even harder to curl. Really had no volume at the roots.  Would not recommend&lt;br /&gt;for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight volumizer.  Gives lift and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> Love this spray for my fine hair; works well without make my hair sticky or heavy.  I am happy with purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone that has fine or thinning hair.  Does not make your hair feel dry.  Found this product on a Celebrity cruise ship when using the salon service.  Wish it was sold locally in a CVS, Rite Aid or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> The spray does add volume to my hair.  The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that I have to blowdry my hair to use this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the vendor I purchased it from is wonderful!</li>
            <li> This works well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> first let me say i payed $25 for this size bottle and it is now nearly double the price.  my opinion is based on the price i paid.  that being said, despite my disappointment with the other phyto products i bought, this one is definitely the exception.  it doesn&#x27;t volumize by lifting, it does it by making each hair strand swell...at least that&#x27;s how it feels.  even the next day when i run a brush through it or in the shower when im washing the stuff out, i can feel the thickness.  once it&#x27;s washed out, my hair returns back to the original thickness.  i will be repurchasing...but not at $47!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting 1 big one, but got 2 of the regular size.  Smells and works just like the bottles I purchased from the Ulta in my town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives my fine/thin hair volume without making my hair HUGE.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky like some products.</li>
            <li> This is a hard product to find locally and not always in the packaging this size. Love the one click and be done. Good experience.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair. I have used this product for several years. It adds volume and makes my hair look and feel thicker. I found that it works best to partially blow dry my hair and apply the product on damp (not wet) hair. Then finish blow drying and styling. This works better than any mouse I have tried. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years.  It&#x27;s a great spray to use after shampooing and prior to blow drying.  The price was a plus too.</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure if I see a difference in my hair. The spray nozzle shoots out really strong and in one spot, so it&#x27;s hard to get it all over your hair. It also does not smell good, it smells like harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> good product for adding volume to my fine, limp hair. I like the smell, too, which is a factor for me.</li>
