    <ol>
            <li>and i was very impressed.</li>
            <li>Without question, this is the very best of them all.</li>
            <li>I based my decision on what the reviews I read suggested was the best shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li>It gives a close shave, and battery life is excellent.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Best Razor ever..!!</li>
            <li>The reviews were excellent, so I figured that I couldn&#x27;t lose.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I have had a very good experience.    </li>
            <li>It performs great.  </li>
            <li>At $30.00 is it a great deal.  </li>
            <li>but after that it works great.  </li>
            <li>it was giving me a great shave</li>
            <li>and it still works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>it bit me but good.</li>
            <li>Now the Remington works on the power cord and continues to give good service.</li>
            <li>For the money this is a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>I do not know how it would compare to models that cost much more, but for me, the Remington 960 does a great job.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but not as great as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>saw\\&quot; guy who used it once and set it aside, is give it a try, use it lightly, and I think you find it&#x27;s a great tool.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own and</li>
            <li>I kind of got used to it.</li>
            <li>Particularly at the discount Amazon offers, the Remington R-960 is an excellent, excellent buy.</li>
            <li>a clean, close shave - and it has a good trimmer, too.</li>
            <li>In my experience, the best shave is the first one after a full charge, after that the razor gets gradually slower and slower, and the performance goes downhill.    </li>
            <li>I had also wanted to try a rotary shaver because of reviews that indicated that they were quieter and did a better job on neck hairs.    </li>
            <li>But within a short time it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>I really love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>and I have always been satisfied with their quality.</li>
            <li>It shaves closer and quicker than the many Norelcos I&#x27;ve used, all of which costed a lot more than the R-960.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I have used it with the cord plugged in, not needing the battery feature.</li>
            <li>But if you can afford it, consider getting a better quality razor.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean- very satisfied.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, it is very important to use a light touch with a rotary shaver.  </li>
            <li>Given the excellent results and the much lower price than the Norelcos I am happy to give Remington a pass on the less sturdy construction.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for high quality at a great price!</li>
            <li>The shave is the closest I&#x27;ve ever received, and the shaver itself is easy both to clean and to recharge, going for more than a dozen shaves without needing a recharge.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever posted a comment about a product, but I am so enthusiastic about this shaver that I feel I must share my experience.</li>
            <li>I have had it ever since and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>The R-960 appears to me to be better built, certainly more stylish, and comes with a sturdy, high quality case.</li>
            <li>Use a light touch and you will be fine.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>Cuts close and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does a great job, and holds it charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>After using this razor for over two months I have continued to experience significant scratching on my neck.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a Norelco 7810XL and have been using it for the past 8 months with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>I migrated from blades to foil shaving 5 years ago, and thought that was a remarkable achievement, in addition to conserving blood and possibly saving my life.</li>
            <li>My neck and throat area was bright red and all swollen!</li>
            <li>Quiet, gentle - a great shaver...</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good razor, and not bad for the money.  </li>
            <li>After the first few days I went back and got another R-960 for travel, and I have been happily shaving for the first time in my life because of this great shaver.</li>
            <li>It does give a great shave, and it takes much less time to shave with the Remington.  </li>
            <li>The recharge time is very quick and it shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought one for my 50 year old son, who also thinks it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I have used various electric shavers over the years but none of them can compare to this one, it shaves very close and has a good battery life after charging.</li>
            <li>It has a good grip and requires absolutely no pressure on  my face in order to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first electrical shaver</li>
            <li>I had always been a bit nervous about using one, since I had heard so many stories about skin irritation and not getting a close enough shave.</li>
            <li>Really close shave with no skin irritation!</li>
            <li>Secondly, it definitely does a better job on my neck.  </li>
            <li>It takes a couple of weeks for your skin to adjust to this shaver at first</li>
            <li>This is the first rotary shaver I have owned - I always got the square shaped triple foil type before this.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if he would like it or not, being that it was a different type of shaver than what he was used to.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this particular rotary shaver was b/c of the quick charge it had.</li>
            <li>and if I may be honest here, I&#x27;m a little frightened of the thing now.</li>
            <li>It takes too much time to shave.   </li>
            <li>He said it does really well on his chin, but not so much on his neck.</li>
            <li>I much prefer tne Remington TA4570.</li>
            <li>head doesn&#x27;t pivot that much at all.</li>
            <li>It woths a lot more than its amazon price and the delivery was faster than expected.</li>
            <li>Another problem: the low battery light on mine doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t say much about Remington&#x27;s quality control process.    </li>
            <li>It takes too much time to shave.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this new razor</li>
            <li>Secondly, the cost to replace the blades and foil of my old shaver was more than the discounted price on Amazon for a new Remington 960.</li>
            <li>The Remington is clearly not as well-built as the two Norelcos I have used in the past (more plastic, shaving head clips on rather that having a hinged latch release), but the results are slightly better.  </li>
            <li>One of it&#x27;s plusses and a secret to comfortable use, is that it shaves closely with a very light touch.</li>
            <li>I actually bought two recently because I think it is better than the newer style Remington shavers with the floating heads.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.  </li>
            <li>This razor have done an amazing work, i really dont get the reason of the bad comments, but surely i will recommend this product and the company.</li>
            <li>Based upon its short useful life I can no longer recommend the Remington R-960.    </li>
            <li>My most hated daily routine has become a joy!</li>
            <li>My wife bought this for me four years ago and when I was ready to buy a new shaving I got the exact same model again.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I am able to shave in less time than with my old foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>Though I am sure it is not unique to this Remington, this shaver was dramatically quieter than my old one.  </li>
            <li>It is a shame the replacement blades cost almost as much as a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I decided to purchase a new shaver for two reasons.  </li>
            <li>and when I accidently broke the clipper, I immediately bought a new one.</li>
            <li>What happened to you?\\&quot; \\&quot;Why, I just shaved with my brand new Remington R-960 this morning.</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And I mean BRIGHT RED and SWOLLEN!</li>
            <li>This is my first Remington shaver I have ever owned and the last one to.</li>
            <li>First, my old razor (a Panasonic foil shaver that was highly rated when I purchased it many years ago) did a poor job on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Felt pretty much like any other electric razor.</li>
            <li>This razor was much lighter than my old Norelco, and now I see why, it&#x27;s got a smaller battery.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, this product has so far surpassed my expectations with flying colors.</li>
            <li>My old razor was no longer holding its charge, so I found this one as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>About an hour later I really felt this burning sensation.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my boyfriend to use because his old one (a foil type) was shewed up by a dog.</li>
            <li>left area under my chin and my neck very irritated.  </li>
            <li>I was coming home from Korea and stopped in Hawaii in August of 2004 and my 11 year old Norelco died.</li>
            <li>I think electric shavers should be quiet, shave close, shave fast, shave without irritation, and have some degree of quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used anything but an electric razor, and while in general I&#x27;ve been happy with their performance, I was less than enamored of the last few shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>With its ergonomic design, it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas.  </li>
            <li>I had always gotten excellent results using Remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug.  </li>
            <li>I was about to leave for work when I did a quick &#x27;mirror check&#x27; in the bathroom and HOLY COW!!</li>
            <li>Some have complained that the trimmer blade is too broad, but it suits my sideburns just fine.</li>
            <li>As was my habit with my old foil shaver, on my first shave I applied excessive pressure, particularly on my neck, and it took several days for my skin to recover.  </li>
            <li>My last one, a basic Braun model, left me with that oh-so-&#x27;80s Miami Vice look; the one before that, a Norelco, literally fell apart in my hands (the rotary heads fell out while I was cleaning them, gently, with the brush provided by the manufacturer).</li>
            <li>With the first use of this product, I felt as if I had come out of the dark ages of shaving.</li>
            <li>(In the spirit of full disclosure, however, I must admit my beard is only moderately heavy.)</li>
            <li>I finally gave up and went back to my old foil razor.  </li>

            <li> I think electric shavers should be quiet, shave close, shave fast, shave without irritation, and have some degree of quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything but an electric razor, and while in general I&#x27;ve been happy with their performance, I was less than enamored of the last few shavers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> With its ergonomic design, it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas.  </li>
            <li> I had always gotten excellent results using Remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug.  </li>
            <li> I was about to leave for work when I did a quick &#x27;mirror check&#x27; in the bathroom and HOLY COW!!</li>
            <li> Some have complained that the trimmer blade is too broad, but it suits my sideburns just fine.</li>
            <li> As was my habit with my old foil shaver, on my first shave I applied excessive pressure, particularly on my neck, and it took several days for my skin to recover.  </li>
            <li> My last one, a basic Braun model, left me with that oh-so-&#x27;80s Miami Vice look; the one before that, a Norelco, literally fell apart in my hands (the rotary heads fell out while I was cleaning them, gently, with the brush provided by the manufacturer).</li>

            <li> (In the spirit of full disclosure, however, I must admit my beard is only moderately heavy.)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this as my first electrical shaver and i was very impressed. I had always been a bit nervous about using one, since I had heard so many stories about skin irritation and not getting a close enough shave. I have to say, this product has so far surpassed my expectations with flying colors. Really close shave with no skin irritation! Would buy it again!</li>
            <li> My old razor was no longer holding its charge, so I found this one as a replacement.  It does a great job, and holds it charge for a long time.  I get a clean, close shave - and it has a good trimmer, too.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Remington R-960 I&#x27;ve purchased.  It performs great.  The recharge time is very quick and it shaves very close.  It is a shame the replacement blades cost almost as much as a new shaver.  The only reason I purchased a new one is the blades are dull.  The other one I still use and have had it for 2+ years.  Very satisified with the purchase and will buy another one when the blades get dull.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase a new shaver for two reasons.  First, my old razor (a Panasonic foil shaver that was highly rated when I purchased it many years ago) did a poor job on my neck.  Periodically, my wife would notice long neck hairs that she would cut off with small scissors.  Secondly, the cost to replace the blades and foil of my old shaver was more than the discounted price on Amazon for a new Remington 960. Further, the parts were back ordered and, after a couple of months, I was tired of waiting. I had also wanted to try a rotary shaver because of reviews that indicated that they were quieter and did a better job on neck hairs.    Though I am sure it is not unique to this Remington, this shaver was dramatically quieter than my old one.  It actually makes sense that a mechanism that spins rather than vibrates, would be quieter.  Secondly, it definitely does a better job on my neck.  No more long hairs that resist cutting.  Finally, I am able to shave in less time than with my old foil shaver.  All in all, I have had a very good experience.    As others have noted, it is very important to use a light touch with a rotary shaver.  As was my habit with my old foil shaver, on my first shave I applied excessive pressure, particularly on my neck, and it took several days for my skin to recover.  This was my fault, not the shaver.  Use a light touch and you will be fine.    I highly recommend this shaver.  At $30.00 is it a great deal.  I do not know how it would compare to models that cost much more, but for me, the Remington 960 does a great job.    Two Month Update:  After using this razor for over two months I have continued to experience significant scratching on my neck.  I finally gave up and went back to my old foil razor.  I do have very sensitive skin and I suspect I would have this problem with any rotary razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything but an electric razor, and while in general I&#x27;ve been happy with their performance, I was less than enamored of the last few shavers I&#x27;ve owned. My last one, a basic Braun model, left me with that oh-so-&#x27;80s Miami Vice look; the one before that, a Norelco, literally fell apart in my hands (the rotary heads fell out while I was cleaning them, gently, with the brush provided by the manufacturer). Those recent experiences make me doubly ecstatic about the Remington R-960 Titanium Rotary Shaver I got a month ago from Amazon. The shave is the closest I&#x27;ve ever received, and the shaver itself is easy both to clean and to recharge, going for more than a dozen shaves without needing a recharge. (In the spirit of full disclosure, however, I must admit my beard is only moderately heavy.) Some have complained that the trimmer blade is too broad, but it suits my sideburns just fine. Particularly at the discount Amazon offers, the Remington R-960 is an excellent, excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Over the past 50 years I have used every type of electric shaver made and almost every brand, including Remington Micro, Norelco, Braun et al.. Without question, this is the very best of them all. Admittidly, it does require a break-in period. But within a short time it does an excellent job. One of it&#x27;s plusses and a secret to comfortable use, is that it shaves closely with a very light touch. Pressing down hard, as we usually need to do with other shavers, causes irritation and burn.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My advice to the \\&quot;chain-saw\\&quot; guy who used it once and set it aside, is give it a try, use it lightly, and I think you find it&#x27;s a great tool. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years and when I accidently broke the clipper, I immediately bought a new one. I recently bought one for my 50 year old son, who also thinks it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Shortly after I posted my initial review the Remington R-960 became a shaving nightmare.  Within 2 months of purchase the blades had dulled to the point that it felt as though it was chewing rather than cutting.  I purchased a Norelco 7810XL and have been using it for the past 8 months with excellent results.  Based upon its short useful life I can no longer recommend the Remington R-960.    Origininal review:  I purchased this razor when the batter on my Norelco died.  I based my decision on what the reviews I read suggested was the best shaver for the price.  The Remington is clearly not as well-built as the two Norelcos I have used in the past (more plastic, shaving head clips on rather that having a hinged latch release), but the results are slightly better.  I am getting a closer shave in a slightly shorter amount of time.  Given the excellent results and the much lower price than the Norelcos I am happy to give Remington a pass on the less sturdy construction.</li>
            <li> I really love this shaver.  I actually bought two recently because I think it is better than the newer style Remington shavers with the floating heads.  It takes a couple of weeks for your skin to adjust to this shaver at first but after that it works great.  It&#x27;s also easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Yo nunca habia usado una afeitadora electrica y al comprar esta hice una excelente inversion porque me deja la piel practicamente lisa, muy suave y lo mejor de todo no tengo que usar agua. Le dura la bateria y se limpia muy facilmente con el cepillito que trae. Si compras el polvo de remington que ellos recomiendan es mucho mejor porque la afeitadora se desliza con mas suavidad. Saludos Rafael desde Cabimas Venezuela</li>
            <li> I have used various electric shavers over the years but none of them can compare to this one, it shaves very close and has a good battery life after charging. The only negitive is that it will not work if it&#x27;s plugged in, so if the battery is flat you have to charge it before you can shave.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me four years ago and when I was ready to buy a new shaving I got the exact same model again.  The quality is unsurpassed for the price even by much more expensive models I&#x27;ve tried.  I highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for high quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is my first Remington shaver I have ever owned and the last one to.A close shave is one that you cannot feel stubble when you push your finger against the direction of beard growth. This shaver did not shave close. It takes too much time to shave.   It is fairly quiet.   The battery longevity is average.   Construction quality is average for the price range.   I rate it 1 star overall. I will not replace the cutting head when it wears out but will discard the shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Remington R960 about a month ago, and have not had any problems at all with it.  I am in the Marine Corps. so I am inspected every day on my shave.  It gives a close shave, and battery life is excellent.  It does take some time for your skin to get use to using an electric razor, but after a couple of weeks I have gotten use to it.  This product can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
            <li> I have owned Remington electric razors for over 30 years and I have always been satisfied with their quality. This is the first rotary shaver I have owned - I always got the square shaped triple foil type before this. The battery on the last one finally died and the foil cover wore out after about 12 years. The first time I used this new razor I thought something was wrong with it. It is so quiet that I thought the motor was malfunctioning. The cutting action was so smooth that I assumed that it was not working at all. Surprise - it was giving me a great shave and I never even realized it. Quiet, gentle - a great shaver... I&#x27;m guessing this one will keep me going well into 2015!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  It shaves closer and quicker than the many Norelcos I&#x27;ve used, all of which costed a lot more than the R-960.  The only improvement I&#x27;d like to see is in the battery, which does not really maintain its strength well between charges.</li>
            <li> Cuts close and smooth. Had it about 5 months now and it still works great. Would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I don&#x27;t derive any pleasure from writing bad or negative product reviews. But I&#x27;m afraid in this case I have no choice but to voice my opinion of this Remington R-960 electric razor. I have been shaving with electric razors for 30 plus years now. I&#x27;ve used all models of Norelco and Remington triple-header razors over the years as well as Remingtom Micro Screen electric razors (which I currently use). And I&#x27;m sorry to have to report that this is probably the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used. (Yes, before you ask,  I do always use a pre-electric shave lotion prior to shaving). The first morning I used this Remington R-960, I felt nothing out of the ordinary. Felt pretty much like any other electric razor. About 15 to 20 minutes after I finished shaving I began to notice a burning-type feeling around my neck/throat area. About an hour later I really felt this burning sensation. I was about to leave for work when I did a quick &#x27;mirror check&#x27; in the bathroom and HOLY COW!! My neck and throat area was bright red and all swollen! And I mean BRIGHT RED and SWOLLEN! No wonder the burning sensation I was feeling. I looked like I just finished (trying to) shave with a gas powered hedge trimmer! I got to work and the guys I work with were like \\&quot;Holy Crap!! What happened to you?\\&quot; \\&quot;Why, I just shaved with my brand new Remington R-960 this morning. Why do you ask\\&quot;, I sarcastically replied. They said it looked like someone took a chain saw to my throat! You get the idea. The bottom line ... it took approximately 6 days for all of the redness and swelling to entirely clear up in my neck/throat area. Needless to say, that morning which was the first time I used my new Remington R-960 electric was also the LAST time I used it. I haven&#x27;t touched it since. Frankly and if I may be honest here, I&#x27;m a little frightened of the thing now. It&#x27;s like it had a mind of it&#x27;s own and it bit me but good. Now, each morning when I&#x27;m shaving with my Remington MS2-300 Micro Screen (not triple head) razor, I sort of have a tendency to keep one eye on the little monster as it is still sitting there on the shelf near the sink and mirror, patiently waiting for the next time I&#x27;m foolish enough to pick it up again. You have been warned!d) razor, I sort of have a tendency to keep one eye on the little monster as it is still sitting there on the shelf near the sink and mirror, patiently waiting for the next time I&#x27;m foolish enough to pick it up again. You have been warned!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend to use because his old one (a foil type) was shewed up by a dog. I wasn&#x27;t sure if he would like it or not, being that it was a different type of shaver than what he was used to. On the one hand, the 3 blade rotary shaver IS a closer shave, but on the other hand, the shaver scrapes up his neck. He said it does really well on his chin, but not so much on his neck. The main reason I bought this particular rotary shaver was b/c of the quick charge it had. So far, I&#x27;m not sure if he&#x27;s used that benefit. It&#x27;s ok, but not as great as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Odd fat boomerang shape, hard to get access to cutters, hard to clean, on-off switch is almost flush to razor and very hard to turn on and off. Shave is marginal. I much prefer tne Remington TA4570.</li>
            <li> holds a charge well, but thats about it.  head doesn&#x27;t pivot that much at all. doesnt \\&quot;lift n&#x27; cut\\&quot; hair as well as my norelco did. i would have to shave every 1.5 days with this, as opposed to 3-4 with other shavers. shave would also take longer than a conventional  razor with shaving cream. i had to \\&quot;carve\\&quot; out a close shave. not worth it.  left area under my chin and my neck very irritated.  skip this razor &amp; spend the extra few dollars on something that will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Esta es una gran afeitadora, suave, silenciosa, la batera le dura bastante, altamente recomendable.</li>
            <li> So, I travel internationally a lot. I was coming home from Korea and stopped in Hawaii in August of 2004 and my 11 year old Norelco died. I bought this R960 Remington at Walmart for $80 then. I have had it ever since and it worked fine. Most of the time I have used it with the cord plugged in, not needing the battery feature. Now the shaver won&#x27;t even start, no lights, no nothing. I can only assume the battery circut has malfunctioned. Needing a shaver immediately and being back in Korea I have bought a Philips made in Europe. I did not get enough service life from the Remington, considering my Norelco&#x27;s excess of 11 years. Bye, bye Remington... too bad though. I kind of got used to it. Update....I disassembled the Remington and removed the battery completly. Now the Remington works on the power cord and continues to give good service. I really hated the Philips.</li>
            <li> This razor have done an amazing work, i really dont get the reason of the bad comments, but surely i will recommend this product and the company. It woths a lot more than its amazon price and the delivery was faster than expected. By tinanium i thought it was titanium material but it is just a describe of the color thought. Best Razor ever..!! 6 stars!</li>
            <li> For the money this is a good electric razor. If you don&#x27;t press down too hard you will not get any razor burn marks. Easy to clean- very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever posted a comment about a product, but I am so enthusiastic about this shaver that I feel I must share my experience. With the first use of this product, I felt as if I had come out of the dark ages of shaving. My most hated daily routine has become a joy! I migrated from blades to foil shaving 5 years ago, and thought that was a remarkable achievement, in addition to conserving blood and possibly saving my life. Although the last Consumer Reports test showed that there was virtually no difference between foil and rotary shaving, I got the bug when a local store put all their rotary shavers on sale. They assured me that I could return any shaver for any reason, so I had nothing to lose. After reviewing online comments, and wanting a cord/cordless, I narrowed my search down to the Norelco 7885XL and the Remington R-960, which was quite a bit less expensive than the Norelco. I brought them home, waited for 2 days growth of beard, and performed a \\&quot;face-off.\\&quot; (Pardon the pun) I shaved one side of my face with the Noreleo and the other with the Remington. I felt my face and noticed no big difference. But later, I noticed that the Norelco side felt slightly irritated. I was warned that there might be a transition period from foil to rotary, so this didn&#x27;t concern me. But, I never did get an irritated on the Remington side. The next day I felt my face and could clearly tell that the growth on the Remington side was less than the Norelco side. My conclusion was that I got a closer shave with no irritation with the Remington--and for far less money! My lifelong belief that price does not necessarily equal excellence in a product was again reinforced. After the first few days I went back and got another R-960 for travel, and I have been happily shaving for the first time in my life because of this great shaver. The R-960 appears to me to be better built, certainly more stylish, and comes with a sturdy, high quality case. It has a good grip and requires absolutely no pressure on  my face in order to get a close shave. And no more stray hairs that my girlfriend usually discovers after it&#x27;s too late to remove them. I never in my life believed that I would look forward to shaving--but now I&#x27;m in shave heaven!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  If you are in the market for one, considered the Remington R-960.  I am of Afro-American descent and was very skeptical about buying a rotary we shaver.  I had always gotten excellent results using Remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug.  With its ergonomic design, it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas.  I had considered purchasing that of another brand until I discovered that Remington makes one and now... I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> After my trusty Norelco finally gave up the ghost, I decided to try the Remington R-960.  The reviews were excellent, so I figured that I couldn&#x27;t lose.  Well my results were mixed.    It does give a great shave, and it takes much less time to shave with the Remington.  But the battery pack is wimpy.  You have to charge it every week, where my Norelco would go for 2-3 weeks between charges.  You can&#x27;t run it while it&#x27;s plugged in; technically it works, but the manual says that this is bad for the battery.  (So what&#x27;s the point of having a corded razor if it&#x27;s bad for the thing to be used that way?  Might as well just use a charging cradle.)  In my experience, the best shave is the first one after a full charge, after that the razor gets gradually slower and slower, and the performance goes downhill.    Another problem: the low battery light on mine doesn&#x27;t work.  Not a big deal, but it doesn&#x27;t say much about Remington&#x27;s quality control process.    This razor was much lighter than my old Norelco, and now I see why, it&#x27;s got a smaller battery.  Overall, it&#x27;s a pretty good razor, and not bad for the money.  But if you can afford it, consider getting a better quality razor.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews before I bought this shaver.  There were a couple who didn&#x27;t like the shaver.  I agree with them. &lt;br /&gt;  I think electric shavers should be quiet, shave close, shave fast, shave without irritation, and have some degree of quality. &lt;br /&gt;   A close shave is one that you cannot feel stubble when you push your finger against the direction of beard growth.  This shaver did not shave close.  After several weeks of shaving it still burns putting on after-shave. &lt;br /&gt;   It takes too much time to shave. &lt;br /&gt;   It is fairly quiet. &lt;br /&gt;   The battery longevity is average. &lt;br /&gt;   Construction quality is average for the price range. &lt;br /&gt;   It is rated 2 stars overall.  I will not replace the cutting head when it wears out but will discard the shaver. &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;br /&gt;</li>
