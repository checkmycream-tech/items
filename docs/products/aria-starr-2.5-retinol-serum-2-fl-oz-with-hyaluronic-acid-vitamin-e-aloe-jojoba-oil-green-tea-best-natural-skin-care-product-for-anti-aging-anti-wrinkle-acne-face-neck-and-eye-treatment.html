            <li>Seems to be toning up my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>loving this product</li>
            <li>(but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that it has surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>The two ounce bottle is very generous and the pump dispenses the serum perfectly.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve used the product faithfully</li>

            <li>I am very excited to see how much more improved my skin will become!</li>
            <li>My skin is looking amazing :)</li>
            <li>love that it comes out as a gel and feels amazing when you apply it.</li>
            <li>fortunately have good skin</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>Besides that, the serum is light but feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>I liked this product so much (my first experience with Aria Starr) that I also purchased the Vitamin C Serum which I also am happy with</li>
            <li>Love love love!  </li>
            <li>The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the</li>
            <li>I can honestly say most of my skin issues or gradually getting better.</li>
            <li>I received the product very fast and was greatly please with that.  </li>
            <li>I guess if it&#x27;s too good to be true, then it probably is.</li>
            <li>Read the fashion magazines to the beauty newsletters,, and everyone is always pushing a retinol product with a very huge price tag.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth, no irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li>I am a performer so taking care of my appearance is very important to me.</li>
            <li>my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li>The pump feature is great too; it&#x27;s so easy to dispense just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>I have good skin anyways, but always looking to smooth out fine lines.</li>
            <li>I love using this before I put my makeup on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Better than any serum that I&#x27;ve tried at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I love this retinol serum.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>but I should have more definitive results over a longer time period.</li>
            <li>A must have for all women  :)</li>
            <li>I can use any product on top of it without any problems.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s time to get more aggressive with my aging skin.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency and find it an alternative to greasy moisturizers.</li>
            <li>and it seems to do more than this serum.  </li>
            <li>I will keep purchasing this product for sure.  </li>
            <li>It feels as if it is mostly water.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth</li>
            <li>After couple of weeks of use this product it makes my face better, this product is better than most product I used before.</li>
            <li>Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>,my pores are shrinking,my makeup looks much better on my skin</li>
            <li>Just purchased two more bottles of the Serum.  </li>
            <li>I can see that with continued use there would be more improvement.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this serum would be able to improve wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This serum goes on the skin smoothly and soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li>Within 5 days I could tell my skin was brighter and felt more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be ,more please with their &amp;#34;CAN DO, WE NEVER GIVE UP ATTITUDE&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>am 67 in age and most people tell me that I do not look my age.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I love the organic ingredients and the fact that this serum is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>My skin is much more healthier feeling</li>
            <li>and I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait for a couple weeks before writing a review, just to make sure I like the product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use and add to this review when I have given it more time.  </li>
            <li>and I do love this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I tried this.</li>

            <li>Product smells ok.</li>
            <li>Now I am using it every night, and I feel that my skin absorbs the moisturizer much better.  </li>
            <li>, I have been asked how I stay so healthy and have been  asked if I am in love</li>
            <li>Thank you Aria; you gave me an opportunity to make my purchase at a reduced price and I am writing this review, without reservation, to let others know how pleased I am with the results.</li>

            <li>I absolutely LOVE this serum..........</li>
            <li>This serum has made my skin nice and smooth, reduced the oil, and a lot fewer blackheads.</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It gave me more cyst acne.</li>

            <li>The skin does not lie! :)</li>
            <li>I also like pump tops because I think they are more sanitary.</li>
            <li>This Aria Starr Super Retinol had a high percentage of retinol (2.5%) and it seemed like an excellent value given the price and the 2 oz size, and the reviews were favorable, so</li>
            <li>Plus, Aria is very friendly and approachable to her customers thru email. :)</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Just started using, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>High quality  and very potent!</li>
            <li>The pump made it very easy to use the advanced anti aging serum.</li>
            <li>a great high quality product.</li>
            <li>So, so far so good, or better, so far so great!  </li>
            <li>what the hay, and I found it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Pretty good start.</li>
            <li>Something is happening to my skin, and I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Just started this week but so far so good :)!</li>
            <li>They offer Argan oil, a Vitamin C serum and the Super Retinol serum they kindly sent me to try out.</li>
            <li>and I feel more confident going makeup free on the weekends.</li>
            <li>Most of those also state that they received a discount on the product, or received it for free for a &amp;#34;unbiased review&amp;#34;, making me even more leery.  </li>
            <li>But its great so far!</li>
            <li>Love the texture and its not sticky at all which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Most dermatologists say retinol, not prescribed, takes 8-10 weeks to see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>after use it, my face skin is more smooth.</li>
            <li>and so far I am happy with the result.</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with the buy.</li>
            <li>would pay full price for this because I am confident my skin will get better with use.</li>
            <li>So far, great product.</li>
            <li>It does however smell of witch hazel - a great natural medicine</li>
            <li>I love the texture, the way it feels on my skin, and I have noticed these deeper lines I have on my forehead are really light now, and almost gone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing after the first time that  you use you can feel your face softer I love it.</li>
            <li>The compliments tell the true story!</li>
            <li>pump makes it easy for application vs. using a dropper, and the 2 oz.</li>
            <li>, I like the pump for the easy application.  </li>
            <li>makes easy to use.</li>
            <li>Product is easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li>/pump for easy application.</li>

            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>With 2.5% Retinol in this serum by Aria Starr, this is a strong over-the-counter concentration.  </li>
            <li>So far; so good....  :)</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t have to get used to the Retinol serum at all; from Day 1 there was never a problem with it being too strong.  </li>
            <li>Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Buying more right now!</li>
            <li>I loved this serum from the first moment I used it: it absorbs quickly and leaves my face feeling fully hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>My fine lines is getting lighter after using it.</li>
            <li>I loved this serum from the first moment I used it: such great texture, and it absorbs quickly yet leaves my face feeling fully hydrated even before I apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Helps reduce appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I am over 50 and the fine lines on the neck have improved and the dropping of the jaw skin seems to have improved too.</li>
            <li>I noticed a change in my fine wrinkles in about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Wrinkles and fine lines were dissapearing.</li>
            <li>I love super retinol.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly (made in the usa!)</li>
            <li>QUICK SHIPPER!</li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>The satisfaction guarantee that the seller provides is also a great thing because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my sensitive skin would take the higher retinol.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t breakout as much as I did before, another good thing is that since the serum absorbs quickly I can also use the moisturizer almost immediately.</li>
            <li>So I am hoping that this is gently working to improve fine lines, but I honestly can&#x27;t see a difference yet.</li>
            <li>I love this product , it has helped with my breakouts and fine lines in just 2 weeks worth of time.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t see huge results.</li>
            <li>I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this product are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Frankly depending on whether you view your face in incandescent light or CFL or LED makes a difference on any improvement you may perceive.</li>
            <li>The aloe and plant oils in this serum do help ease the light burn I tend to get, however.  </li>
            <li>Amazing products with fast delivery service</li>
            <li>I did not receive free product, or a discount.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I can honestly say that I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Aria for such a great product.</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I received both products to try free from Amazon Review trader.</li>
            <li>The size is great and will last awhile.</li>
            <li>This is a great product especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>Skin looks more dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>Works well and feels light.</li>
            <li>feels great, big results</li>
            <li>Smooth, non greasy serum.</li>
            <li>Product goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It tightens my skin and leaves it feeling smooth, taught and youthful.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>Overall its a good product, need more time to see optimal results.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This product is working good so far.  </li>
            <li>Do far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Good product seems to work well on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far, so good with this product - I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li>Overall the product works very nice.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for the sagging neck area, it&#x27;s cool as it is applied but dries pretty quickly so you can continue daily routine.</li>
            <li>a few close friends say that I look like I am getting more beautiful with age.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the Super Retinol is not heavy or tacky and absorbs quickly and can be used successfully under foundation,</li>
            <li>The serum is powerful yet mild without the sun sensitivity of Retin A. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Don’t make this your only anti-aging product, but if you are looking to add retinol to your routine easily, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>and I have been using it consistently for 2 or more weeks now.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see the progress I&#x27;ll make in the months to come.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I noticed a difference in my skin/face after the first week.</li>
            <li>many thanks!</li>
            <li>I was especially pleased with packaging of the product as it was protected in a small box.</li>
            <li>I can tell the soften of my laugh lines!</li>
            <li>This is new to me, but it is really nice.</li>
            <li>was thrilled when I was able to test out this serum at a deeply discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>The serum soaks into the skin quickly and is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Starr Super Retinol is labeled as a advanced anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li>I like that the product comes in a glass colored bottle to avoid oxidation caused by light, plus it&#x27;s a gorgeous cobalt blue in color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to stay positive and a couple more weeks will tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it more time to see if there will be positive results..</li>
            <li>This serum is really great, and has all the right ingredients, but the only thing I keep finding in these serums is witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Of course I don&#x27;t go any days without using it, but so far it seems to work amazingly.  </li>
            <li>I have really noticed more of a difference with this than the $90.00 bottle that I got from my dermatologist</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 star because I have only been using it for 3 weeks and need more time to see how good it really works.</li>
            <li>(2 pumps is all it takes for full face and neck coverage).  </li>
            <li>Got this for my sister and she said she liked it so far.</li>
            <li>have to take the whole top off of the bottle to get any product out, so</li>
            <li>Really feels fabulous on my face!</li>
            <li>Good product overall.</li>
            <li>I am 40ish lol and have seen many Sun filled days and have visual pores which appear to be looking smaller and an age spot that looks lighter.</li>
            <li>my skin) time for a more realistic opinion  than others I have seen, and hopefully one that others would trust as a true trial period.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;LOVE LOVE LOVE this product it made my skin instantly smoother</li>
            <li>I bought both Belitae and this Super Retinol.</li>
            <li>I use Belite in the morning and Super Retinol at night.</li>
            <li>I use it at  night, absorbs quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate the email from the company after placing my order that contained great information especially if you&#x27;ve never used a retinol product.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly &amp; well packaged.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>It has always looked good going out the door but within a few hours it needs refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Apply 1-2 pumps of Super Retinol on my face and neck and follow with a moisturizer before bed.</li>
            <li>decent results, more for complexion rather than wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used the super retinol twice a day which might be the cause of my pimples.</li>
            <li>The product also absorbs quickly and gave me zero issues when used under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product also absorbs quickly and gave me zero issues when used under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and not sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m continuing to use the Super Retinol</li>
            <li>I chose this product over others because it is formulated with many highly desirable skin care products not just retinol.</li>
            <li>My dry skin really drinks this up and it makes my makeup glide on beautifully.</li>
            <li>Like this product very much!</li>
            <li>Vanishes into the skin nicely but does leave a barely perceptible non-sticky film.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky when I put it on, no unpleasant smell,  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li>For the price I would consider it as a decent option for evening out my skin tone in conjunction with a great cleanser, moisturizer, and regular exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I can see a big difference in my wrinkles and my skin is so soft and has a beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell much difference on my face, but there is a tremendous improvement with Mom&#x27;s fine lines, after just two weeks.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Bot sure how the long term results are but love how it feels now</li>
            <li>and I really am pleased that this retinal is not harsh because of the aloe and vitamin e in it!</li>
            <li>I particularly love the fact that you can purchase a 2-ounce bottle at a great, reasonable price whereas most of the other beauty serums are just 1-ounce bottles at the same price.</li>
            <li>I love it so far!</li>
            <li>I absolutely will reorder this product!!</li>
            <li>With Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E, Aloe, Jojoba Oil, Green Tea - Best Natural Skin Care Product For Anti Aging Anti Wrinkle, Acne Face, Neck &amp; Eye Treatment!  </li>
            <li>But, my skin is taking it fine and it absorbs into the skin really well.  </li>
            <li>bottle, but am genuinely grateful they offer it at a very generous price.  </li>
            <li>The serum is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li>Seller was very helpful, emailed me to help me use the product accurately.</li>
            <li>Applying my make up is much funner when my skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li>reviews of skin products that people post stating how great a product is when they also say they saw results within a few days to a week.  </li>
            <li>The powerful combination of ingredients attracted me to buying this serum:&lt;br /&gt;- 2.5% Retinol Serum</li>
            <li>The biggest difference that I&#x27;ve noticed is that overall, my skin appears healthier and it has a nice glow to it.  </li>
            <li>Rapidly absorbed.</li>
            <li>In addition, my skin has become brighter and more clear.</li>
            <li>but so far my skin does appear more even toned.</li>
            <li>Facial serum but fairly effective.</li>
            <li>Love it so far</li>
            <li>The serum goes on smooth and is absorbed fast.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night before bed and in the morning my skin looks fresh and radiant.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne more often as an adult</li>
            <li>Seems powerful.  </li>
            <li>and I think it works pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li>the other day compliment my skin, and one of them even said that the one side of my face was really good.  </li>
            <li>and it soaks right in.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped right away.</li>
            <li>So as of right now I can not say if I do or don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Notice a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>After using it once a day (after I clean my face at night) for a couple weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed an even skin tone and my skin is much brighter.  </li>
            <li>WOW ARIA☆STARR SUPER RETINOL Came in a huge 2 FL Oz / 60 ml bottle.</li>
            <li>: If there is alcohol in the witch hazel (and there may not be), it might not be great for sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not brand loyal but do love the packaging and blue bottle of this one (for the subjective part of how we perceive products to work)</li>
            <li>easy to use , very light and absorbs immediately, I have been using this product for about 3 weeks however every other day</li>
            <li>I am 37 years old and people are amazed at how my skin looks - within the last week I&#x27;ve received so many compliments and I think it&#x27;s because of this product :)</li>
            <li>I am certainly going to continue to use this product!</li>
            <li>So happy to have finally found something that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and wears really well under moisturizer (I use it at night under a retinol moisturizer).</li>
            <li>I really like this Super Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li>So far, I can see a difference with smoothness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this serum is perfect...diminishing fine lines and noticed plumping, hydrating effects now.  </li>
            <li>Some things simply do get better with age.</li>
            <li>I will order more in future!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in my skin within the first week</li>
            <li>reasonable price !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely purchasing again. :)</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to see what happens.</li>
            <li>Pores seem smaller and blotchy patches look better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in my skin within the first week.</li>
            <li>I probably need a higher percentage of retin A.</li>
            <li>So far, I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I read reviews where people said they could tell a difference the first time they used it.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I still really like this product and use it as a toner!</li>
            <li>I have never used this maker before, but I am willing to keep with this till it is finished.  </li>
            <li>I would say it is working very well!</li>
            <li>Actually it works better than Retin-A on my skin.</li>
            <li>Its great to use in moderation, but long term daily use is not recommended.</li>
            <li>and I forget to use it consistently, but I do notice when I use it at night</li>
            <li>I felt my face and it was soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I started using this product a couple weeks ago and at first I was like</li>
            <li>It makes the consumer aware of manufacture date (11/17/2014) and expiration date (11/16/2016).</li>
            <li>I still have more than 1/2 left because I needed 1 pump at night and a 1/2 a pump in the day.  </li>
            <li>I still have more than 1/2 left because I needed 1 pump at night and a 1/2 a pump in the day.  </li>
            <li>I really loved how after a few weeks of use my pores have shrunk drastically.</li>
            <li>As far as ease of use, I love the pump feature (much better than droppers that other products use).  </li>
            <li>the advanced skin care products haven&#x27;t had any profound effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is never to early or later to start taking care of your skin.**product was sent for review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>But she had nothing but positive things to say about it.</li>
            <li>My son tells me that it is having a positive effect on me.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 10 days and am hopeful that I&#x27;ll see some positive change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Been using it for about a month now and it pretty much hasn&#x27;t done anything for acne</li>
            <li>Now I know that retinol products usually take months to have their full effect, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that Super Retinol contains Vitamin E and organic aloe and after just a week and a half I could see the difference that this serum was making in my skin.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the personal attention I received from the company representative who sent me information about the product before I received it and to my surprise, she answered two other specific questions I had when I asked.</li>
            <li>Glides on easily, one pump covers entire face.</li>
            <li>Not so strong that it irritates the skin,just enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It feels like it is nothing but pure aloe.  </li>
            <li>( because I have that certain glow).</li>
            <li>However, I do have a prominent dark spot (about a quarter size) on the right side of my face that has been a cosmetic concern for quite awhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also noticed a slight difference in my laugh lines, but I focused more around my crows feet.</li>
            <li>A very gentle product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I stick to 2.5% retinol for now until the time the fine lines start fighting back harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aria</li>
            <li>I do think that wrinkles around my eyes are lessening, however, I am interested to see if there will be significant change after further usage and time.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase Super Retinol again!</li>
            <li>Retinol products tend to sting a little bit, but have been greatly effective to my skin.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very picky.</li>
            <li>It shrinks your pores and really tightened my skin..</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>really well priced with 2.5% Retinol</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice anything, however, I had 2 people</li>
            <li>At this point, I haven&#x27;t seen much change.</li>
            <li>fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>I use it after shaving and my skin feels very refreshed without feeling greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>I had really noticeable hyperpigmentation since 2013 from my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I am very ease and will continue to use if needed</li>
            <li>and I really think that I found it.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews, I thought this product would be much better, but has not really improved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Appears to be working very well</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>I realized how much balanced my skin appeared.  </li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>Let this skin rejuvenator with organic aloe do all the work while your fast asleep.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much as I thought...</li>
            <li>My skin seems to be much smoother.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used much of it yet since I just got it a couple of days ago.</li>
            <li>It really smoothed out my skin and tighten it around the neck area.</li>
            <li>It does really work....</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But this is basically a very “vanishing” product.</li>
            <li>No visible change as yet, can&#x27;t say much about product at all but will continue using.</li>
            <li>works really well reduces visible lines</li>
            <li>is you are having issues - it really works wonders.</li>
            <li>REALLY RETINOL?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to its anti-aging properties, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Aria Starr Beauty.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Aria Starr Beauty.  </li>
            <li>Retinol is effective if you continue daily use,  though it can take time to work on deep wrinkles, so as you may not see immediate results, you will see results, if you stick with it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest only using at night as this will make you more sensitive to sun.</li>
            <li>Aria Starr took one step further and opted for a pump action top versus the glass droppers you see with some products, so again protecting the potency of the retinol by limiting oxygen/air from diluting it&#x27;s contents.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as promotional sample, in order that I use the product and express my objective and honest opinion of such.</li>
            <li>After all, you have to have a good base for a good application.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel young!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited based on the other reviews; it certainly hasn&#x27;t hurt but it didn&#x27;t brighten as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>but it turns out I just needed to exfoliate more due to the increased cell turnover.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value for the money, as a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and can honestly say that my small lines around my eyes when I smile have disappeared completely.</li>
            <li>Started to see results about a week in, but progress is slow so far,  it feels nice on the skin, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I apply after my face has been cleansed and I apply twice a day very comparable to high end products.</li>
            <li>Although they haven&#x27;t disappeared completely, they are much lighter now!</li>
            <li>There are small amounts of some nice oils too.&lt;br /&gt;*Know</li>
            <li>Love it, I noticed a difference in the disappearance of my wrinkles in less than 2weeks</li>
            <li>I also used this serum for the acne on my face and noticed that the more I used it, the less acne that appeared.</li>
            <li>My skin seems brighter and some of my eye wrinkles are less prominent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 and have tried several skin creams and serums including expensive retinols but haven&#x27;t been too impressed until now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this super retinol for only about two weeks every night  with an addition of coconut oil which I&#x27;ve always applied.  </li>
            <li>Maybe because I am older...</li>
            <li>Aria Super Retinol made enough changes to my skin that I am getting compliments.</li>
            <li>I have been using Super Retinol for several days now.</li>
            <li>In my particular case I need a stronger solution of retinol.</li>
            <li>You get a combination of main ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E and Organic Aloe.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry if you need to rest a dropper&#x27;s top on the counter and picking up whatever to not only affect your skin, but the contents of the product, and it&#x27;s future applications.</li>
            <li>I have only had this product for about 4-5 days, I have used it nightly and could see the difference in 3 days, with very clear and clean pours on my nose</li>
            <li>what and the pump squirted it so forcefully sometimes it made more of a mess than anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>And it would help if I were applying a high percentage of vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend the serum to others.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Nothing in comparison with high line products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>This serum didn&#x27;t unclog pores, if anything my pores became a little more clogged</li>
            <li>I did not have any adverse reactions and this serum seems to leave a little more of a moisture barrier and this may be because of the additional beneficial properties added (i.e. vitamin oils and enriching</li>
            <li>I did not have any adverse reactions and this serum seems to leave a little more of a moisture barrier and this may be because of the additional beneficial properties added (i.e. vitamin oils and enriching</li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s working really well for me</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking it but not seeing much improvement in my skin like I would with a prescription retinol product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56 years old and it has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this are great, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li>Ive noticed a significant difference in my skin, and as long as I just use this every other day with a heavier moisturizer, its fantastic.</li>
            <li>I received it, I washed my face like normal and started applying it twice a day.</li>
            <li>After a couple days I&#x27;ve noticed more firm and smoother skin.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with acne, I was prescribed Retinol from a dermatologist and this product has done more justice for my skin.</li>
            <li>This also means you get a softer potency that is sometimes better because delicate areas like your eyes can&#x27;t tolerate higher doses.</li>
            <li>I also use it right around the edges of my lips and have noticed the same results.  </li>
            <li>Ha I do tell them that I am using this new product.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen any new ones.</li>
            <li>but now I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin so smooth in a second only and supple.</li>
            <li>Its leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I know very little about the science of it, but it has helped my oily, clogged, acne prone skin look so much better.</li>
            <li>Like the product so far!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The positives of this serum is I did see a slight diminishment in the discolorations on my skin as well as some fine lines.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and the dark spot on my face seems to going away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed a slight difference with fine lines I have.  </li>
            <li>Will update my review once a month has past (that&#x27;s when most people see results or lack thereof)</li>
            <li>I have not seen huge results as of yet, but have not had it quite long enough for that.</li>
            <li>as I found that my skin will dry out more quickly unless I remember to moisturizer at least 2 to 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for a little over a year now and it has made a huge difference in my skin at age 56</li>
            <li>So hard to find retinol plus HA in meaningful doses together.  </li>
            <li>Just after a few days I noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Started to clear up my complexion within a week, without the peeling and sensitivity to sunlight that I had on</li>
            <li>It is a clear gel like substance with no smell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and don&#x27;t feel heavy or look greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started using this product and so far like my smoother skin.  </li>
            <li>My adult acne has cleared and my skil appears smoother.</li>
            <li>serum is professional strength, FDA approved and 2.5% retinol of Vitamin A for anti-aging.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend for people with acne prone skin like myself as it has help to zap my occasional zit.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for about 2 weeks now, so I can&#x27;t really tell if it is having an effect on my acne scars,</li>
            <li>Have only used 5 times and skin is much softer.</li>
            <li>I am 75 years old</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>This has so far seemed like it has been helping heal my pitted acne scars and hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I should have taken before after pictures but so far I don&#x27;t notice a difference after using the serum for almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not expecting a complete reversal</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and I hope it will help me with my wrinks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely suggest giving it a try before going straight to prescription-strength</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I cleanse with natural castille soap then use toner and follow with this retinol serum</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the personal follow-up email for suggestions on using the product.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been a miracle worker for old acne scars or anything, but I think with continued use it will help even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>but so far I like this product and can notice and feel a difference.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for three nights, but I really like how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man who is almost 50 years old.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s to early still</li>
            <li>i have been battling acne for a few years now and this the only thing that is clearing my acne scars without causing me to breakout some more.</li>
            <li>I am starting to look young again!!!</li>
            <li>The left side of my face around my eye was more wrinkled than the other side which I think is from the sun when driving over the years; now both sides look smoother which makes me feel younger</li>
            <li>I started using Aria Super Retinol, after 3 days I started seeing smoothness in my face, after 3 weeks my dark spots has been lightened.</li>
            <li>been using it for 2 months now, and i can finally give a decent review.</li>
            <li>Ingredient list on description does not show Wheat germ oil, which is a MAJOR pore clogger!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, not greasy or sticky, and has very little if any smell.  </li>
            <li>Not all vitamin A products are created equal but that does not mean that retinol product is not going to cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not ready for injections or surgery, but using this product has worked really well to perk up my skin!</li>
            <li>certain facial characteristics can actually be reversed.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast so can apply a moisturizer once dry.</li>
            <li>It has brightened it, noticeably shrunk pores, and I have noticed my makeup goes on much smoother than it used to as it has also helped dry patches I had on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so I anticipate the effects will be fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks, I also was using the Super Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>5 Stars - &amp;#34;Great product I am very surprised on the results after only using it one time.</li>
            <li>and that is a major</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great consistency, subtle to no scent, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The serum does have retinol present, as my past achievements of ditching fine lines continued.</li>
            <li>The serum does have retinol present, as my past achievements of ditching fine lines continued.</li>
            <li>Compared to another high end retinal treatment I use regularly, this one misses the mark and doesn&#x27;t give the same results.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>I am a big believer in taking care of your skin while you&#x27;re young.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started using it because I had some left of the old product.  </li>
            <li>I know that witch hazel can be beneficial to the skin, as I am an Esthetician, but for someone with dryer, sensitive skin, daily use can cause peeling, and irritations.</li>
            <li>I have only had this one week and used it three times so far without any dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li>and some start small but as long as you do it right, I prefer to know I can count on a brand for this product versus just having a large selection of beauty items that do not work.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a few weeks since I began using the Arria Starr vitamin  C serum and super retinol serum.</li>
            <li>The Retinol serum sinks right in, and then I apply either Hyaluronic acid or moisturizer so that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li>I have other Aria Starr products and I&#x27;m really beginning to become a fan of their quality skin care range.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product every night faithfully, and I can see a positive difference in my skin, the wrinkles are toned down quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I noticed it made my skin tight the first week.</li>
            <li>The bottle upon receiving it for review is a large dark bottle with pump of 2 Fl Oz.</li>
            <li>I definitely can tell a major difference.  </li>
            <li>My eyes also seem to be less puffy after a couple of weeks of this, which used to be a pretty big</li>
            <li>Other retinol products have made my skin look better but this does nothing - I find it hard to believe it has the concentration of retinol that it claims to contain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used prescription retin-A on my face for 30 years (originally for adult acne), but it is too irritating for my neck and decollete, which were beginning to show crepiness, despite my lifetime use of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>that first night I had already noticed that half of my crows feet had disappeared!</li>
            <li>I plan to reorder both Belitae and Super Retinol for at least one year.</li>
            <li>It works very well and I am seeing a little improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>and if I saw any improvements or worse, any fine lines coming back.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really liked this stuff.</li>
            <li> Also, the shipping was fast and customer service great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes in a handy pump bottle that dispenses what you need with a couple of pumps.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet using this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a seemingly great product!</li>
            <li> Seems to be toning up my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> loving this product</li>
            <li> (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that it has surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> The two ounce bottle is very generous and the pump dispenses the serum perfectly.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve used the product faithfully</li>
            <li> and they have their own heart beat and hurt like hell.</li>

            <li> My skin is looking amazing :)</li>
            <li> love that it comes out as a gel and feels amazing when you apply it.</li>
            <li> fortunately have good skin</li>
            <li> My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> Besides that, the serum is light but feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> I liked this product so much (my first experience with Aria Starr) that I also purchased the Vitamin C Serum which I also am happy with</li>
            <li> Love love love!  </li>
            <li> The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the</li>
            <li> I can honestly say most of my skin issues or gradually getting better.</li>
            <li> I received the product very fast and was greatly please with that.  </li>
            <li> I guess if it&#x27;s too good to be true, then it probably is.</li>
            <li> Read the fashion magazines to the beauty newsletters,, and everyone is always pushing a retinol product with a very huge price tag.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth, no irritation or dryness.</li>
            <li> I am a performer so taking care of my appearance is very important to me.</li>
            <li> my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> The pump feature is great too; it&#x27;s so easy to dispense just the right amount.  </li>
            <li> I have good skin anyways, but always looking to smooth out fine lines.</li>
            <li> I love using this before I put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Better than any serum that I&#x27;ve tried at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I love this retinol serum.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> but I should have more definitive results over a longer time period.</li>
            <li> A must have for all women  :)</li>
            <li> I can use any product on top of it without any problems.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to get more aggressive with my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and find it an alternative to greasy moisturizers.</li>
            <li> and it seems to do more than this serum.  </li>
            <li> I will keep purchasing this product for sure.  </li>
            <li> It feels as if it is mostly water.  </li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth</li>
            <li> After couple of weeks of use this product it makes my face better, this product is better than most product I used before.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> ,my pores are shrinking,my makeup looks much better on my skin</li>
            <li> Just purchased two more bottles of the Serum.  </li>
            <li> I can see that with continued use there would be more improvement.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this serum would be able to improve wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on the skin smoothly and soaks in nicely.</li>
            <li> Within 5 days I could tell my skin was brighter and felt more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be ,more please with their &amp;#34;CAN DO, WE NEVER GIVE UP ATTITUDE&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> am 67 in age and most people tell me that I do not look my age.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I love the organic ingredients and the fact that this serum is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> This product is ok.</li>
            <li> My skin is much more healthier feeling</li>
            <li> and I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait for a couple weeks before writing a review, just to make sure I like the product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and add to this review when I have given it more time.  </li>
            <li> and I do love this product.  </li>
            <li> Glad I tried this.</li>

            <li> Product smells ok.</li>
            <li> Now I am using it every night, and I feel that my skin absorbs the moisturizer much better.  </li>
            <li> , I have been asked how I stay so healthy and have been  asked if I am in love</li>
            <li> Thank you Aria; you gave me an opportunity to make my purchase at a reduced price and I am writing this review, without reservation, to let others know how pleased I am with the results.</li>
            <li> overnight you wake up looking refreshed definitely the best retinol I have tried</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I read many descriptions and reviews on Amazon and settled on this one.</li>
            <li> I will give it more time.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love those products but</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this serum..........</li>
            <li> This serum has made my skin nice and smooth, reduced the oil, and a lot fewer blackheads.</li>
            <li> My remarks are sincere and my own.is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It gave me more cyst acne.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for my face especially the eye area.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> However, I have been able to compensate for that</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again and recommend it to others ,also it&#x27;s a great price to!</li>
            <li> The skin does not lie! :)</li>
            <li> I also like pump tops because I think they are more sanitary.</li>
            <li> This Aria Starr Super Retinol had a high percentage of retinol (2.5%) and it seemed like an excellent value given the price and the 2 oz size, and the reviews were favorable, so</li>
            <li> Plus, Aria is very friendly and approachable to her customers thru email. :)</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Just started using, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> High quality  and very potent!</li>
            <li> The pump made it very easy to use the advanced anti aging serum.</li>
            <li> a great high quality product.</li>
            <li> So, so far so good, or better, so far so great!  </li>
            <li> what the hay, and I found it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good start.</li>
            <li> Something is happening to my skin, and I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Just started this week but so far so good :)!</li>
            <li> They offer Argan oil, a Vitamin C serum and the Super Retinol serum they kindly sent me to try out.</li>
            <li> and I feel more confident going makeup free on the weekends.</li>
            <li> Most of those also state that they received a discount on the product, or received it for free for a &amp;#34;unbiased review&amp;#34;, making me even more leery.  </li>
            <li> But its great so far!</li>
            <li> Love the texture and its not sticky at all which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Most dermatologists say retinol, not prescribed, takes 8-10 weeks to see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> after use it, my face skin is more smooth.</li>
            <li> and so far I am happy with the result.</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with the buy.</li>
            <li> would pay full price for this because I am confident my skin will get better with use.</li>
            <li> So far, great product.</li>
            <li> It does however smell of witch hazel - a great natural medicine</li>
            <li> I love the texture, the way it feels on my skin, and I have noticed these deeper lines I have on my forehead are really light now, and almost gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing after the first time that  you use you can feel your face softer I love it.</li>
            <li> The compliments tell the true story!</li>
            <li> pump makes it easy for application vs. using a dropper, and the 2 oz.</li>
            <li> , I like the pump for the easy application.  </li>
            <li> makes easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li> /pump for easy application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and no scent.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> With 2.5% Retinol in this serum by Aria Starr, this is a strong over-the-counter concentration.  </li>
            <li> So far; so good....  :)</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t have to get used to the Retinol serum at all; from Day 1 there was never a problem with it being too strong.  </li>
            <li> Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Buying more right now!</li>
            <li> I loved this serum from the first moment I used it: it absorbs quickly and leaves my face feeling fully hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> My fine lines is getting lighter after using it.</li>
            <li> I loved this serum from the first moment I used it: such great texture, and it absorbs quickly yet leaves my face feeling fully hydrated even before I apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and the fine lines on the neck have improved and the dropping of the jaw skin seems to have improved too.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change in my fine wrinkles in about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles and fine lines were dissapearing.</li>
            <li> I love super retinol.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly (made in the usa!)</li>
            <li> QUICK SHIPPER!</li>
            <li> I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> The satisfaction guarantee that the seller provides is also a great thing because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my sensitive skin would take the higher retinol.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t breakout as much as I did before, another good thing is that since the serum absorbs quickly I can also use the moisturizer almost immediately.</li>
            <li> So I am hoping that this is gently working to improve fine lines, but I honestly can&#x27;t see a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I love this product , it has helped with my breakouts and fine lines in just 2 weeks worth of time.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t see huge results.</li>
            <li> I received this free product to review.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Frankly depending on whether you view your face in incandescent light or CFL or LED makes a difference on any improvement you may perceive.</li>
            <li> The aloe and plant oils in this serum do help ease the light burn I tend to get, however.  </li>
            <li> Amazing products with fast delivery service</li>
            <li> I did not receive free product, or a discount.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I can honestly say that I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Aria for such a great product.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I received both products to try free from Amazon Review trader.</li>
            <li> The size is great and will last awhile.</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> Skin looks more dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li> Works well and feels light.</li>
            <li> feels great, big results</li>
            <li> Smooth, non greasy serum.</li>
            <li> Product goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It tightens my skin and leaves it feeling smooth, taught and youthful.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> Overall its a good product, need more time to see optimal results.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This product is working good so far.  </li>
            <li> Do far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good product seems to work well on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far, so good with this product - I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Overall the product works very nice.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for the sagging neck area, it&#x27;s cool as it is applied but dries pretty quickly so you can continue daily routine.</li>
            <li> a few close friends say that I look like I am getting more beautiful with age.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the Super Retinol is not heavy or tacky and absorbs quickly and can be used successfully under foundation,</li>
            <li> The serum is powerful yet mild without the sun sensitivity of Retin A. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Don’t make this your only anti-aging product, but if you are looking to add retinol to your routine easily, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it consistently for 2 or more weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to see the progress I&#x27;ll make in the months to come.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I noticed a difference in my skin/face after the first week.</li>
            <li> many thanks!</li>
            <li> I was especially pleased with packaging of the product as it was protected in a small box.</li>
            <li> I can tell the soften of my laugh lines!</li>
            <li> This is new to me, but it is really nice.</li>
            <li> was thrilled when I was able to test out this serum at a deeply discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> The serum soaks into the skin quickly and is smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Starr Super Retinol is labeled as a advanced anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li> I like that the product comes in a glass colored bottle to avoid oxidation caused by light, plus it&#x27;s a gorgeous cobalt blue in color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to stay positive and a couple more weeks will tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it more time to see if there will be positive results..</li>
            <li> This serum is really great, and has all the right ingredients, but the only thing I keep finding in these serums is witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Of course I don&#x27;t go any days without using it, but so far it seems to work amazingly.  </li>
            <li> I have really noticed more of a difference with this than the $90.00 bottle that I got from my dermatologist</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star because I have only been using it for 3 weeks and need more time to see how good it really works.</li>
            <li> (2 pumps is all it takes for full face and neck coverage).  </li>
            <li> Got this for my sister and she said she liked it so far.</li>
            <li> have to take the whole top off of the bottle to get any product out, so</li>
            <li> Really feels fabulous on my face!</li>
            <li> Good product overall.</li>
            <li> I am 40ish lol and have seen many Sun filled days and have visual pores which appear to be looking smaller and an age spot that looks lighter.</li>
            <li> my skin) time for a more realistic opinion  than others I have seen, and hopefully one that others would trust as a true trial period.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;LOVE LOVE LOVE this product it made my skin instantly smoother</li>
            <li> I bought both Belitae and this Super Retinol.</li>
            <li> I use Belite in the morning and Super Retinol at night.</li>
            <li> I use it at  night, absorbs quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li> I also really appreciate the email from the company after placing my order that contained great information especially if you&#x27;ve never used a retinol product.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly &amp; well packaged.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> It has always looked good going out the door but within a few hours it needs refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Apply 1-2 pumps of Super Retinol on my face and neck and follow with a moisturizer before bed.</li>
            <li> decent results, more for complexion rather than wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used the super retinol twice a day which might be the cause of my pimples.</li>
            <li> The product also absorbs quickly and gave me zero issues when used under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product also absorbs quickly and gave me zero issues when used under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continuing to use the Super Retinol</li>
            <li> I chose this product over others because it is formulated with many highly desirable skin care products not just retinol.</li>
            <li> My dry skin really drinks this up and it makes my makeup glide on beautifully.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much!</li>
            <li> Vanishes into the skin nicely but does leave a barely perceptible non-sticky film.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky when I put it on, no unpleasant smell,  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> For the price I would consider it as a decent option for evening out my skin tone in conjunction with a great cleanser, moisturizer, and regular exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I can see a big difference in my wrinkles and my skin is so soft and has a beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell much difference on my face, but there is a tremendous improvement with Mom&#x27;s fine lines, after just two weeks.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Bot sure how the long term results are but love how it feels now</li>
            <li> and I really am pleased that this retinal is not harsh because of the aloe and vitamin e in it!</li>
            <li> I particularly love the fact that you can purchase a 2-ounce bottle at a great, reasonable price whereas most of the other beauty serums are just 1-ounce bottles at the same price.</li>
            <li> I love it so far!</li>
            <li> I absolutely will reorder this product!!</li>
            <li> With Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E, Aloe, Jojoba Oil, Green Tea - Best Natural Skin Care Product For Anti Aging Anti Wrinkle, Acne Face, Neck &amp; Eye Treatment!  </li>
            <li> But, my skin is taking it fine and it absorbs into the skin really well.  </li>
            <li> bottle, but am genuinely grateful they offer it at a very generous price.  </li>
            <li> The serum is light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li> Seller was very helpful, emailed me to help me use the product accurately.</li>
            <li> Applying my make up is much funner when my skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li> reviews of skin products that people post stating how great a product is when they also say they saw results within a few days to a week.  </li>
            <li> The powerful combination of ingredients attracted me to buying this serum:&lt;br /&gt;- 2.5% Retinol Serum</li>
            <li> The biggest difference that I&#x27;ve noticed is that overall, my skin appears healthier and it has a nice glow to it.  </li>
            <li> Rapidly absorbed.</li>
            <li> In addition, my skin has become brighter and more clear.</li>
            <li> but so far my skin does appear more even toned.</li>
            <li> Facial serum but fairly effective.</li>
            <li> Love it so far</li>
            <li> The serum goes on smooth and is absorbed fast.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night before bed and in the morning my skin looks fresh and radiant.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne more often as an adult</li>
            <li> Seems powerful.  </li>
            <li> and I think it works pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li> the other day compliment my skin, and one of them even said that the one side of my face was really good.  </li>
            <li> and it soaks right in.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped right away.</li>
            <li> So as of right now I can not say if I do or don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Notice a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> After using it once a day (after I clean my face at night) for a couple weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed an even skin tone and my skin is much brighter.  </li>
            <li> WOW ARIA☆STARR SUPER RETINOL Came in a huge 2 FL Oz / 60 ml bottle.</li>
            <li> : If there is alcohol in the witch hazel (and there may not be), it might not be great for sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not brand loyal but do love the packaging and blue bottle of this one (for the subjective part of how we perceive products to work)</li>
            <li> easy to use , very light and absorbs immediately, I have been using this product for about 3 weeks however every other day</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and people are amazed at how my skin looks - within the last week I&#x27;ve received so many compliments and I think it&#x27;s because of this product :)</li>
            <li> I am certainly going to continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> So happy to have finally found something that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and wears really well under moisturizer (I use it at night under a retinol moisturizer).</li>
            <li> I really like this Super Retinol Serum.</li>
            <li> So far, I can see a difference with smoothness and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this serum is perfect...diminishing fine lines and noticed plumping, hydrating effects now.  </li>
            <li> Some things simply do get better with age.</li>
            <li> I will order more in future!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in my skin within the first week</li>
            <li> reasonable price !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely purchasing again. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to see what happens.</li>
            <li> Pores seem smaller and blotchy patches look better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in my skin within the first week.</li>
            <li> I probably need a higher percentage of retin A.</li>
            <li> So far, I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I read reviews where people said they could tell a difference the first time they used it.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I still really like this product and use it as a toner!</li>
            <li> I have never used this maker before, but I am willing to keep with this till it is finished.  </li>
            <li> I would say it is working very well!</li>
            <li> Actually it works better than Retin-A on my skin.</li>
            <li> Its great to use in moderation, but long term daily use is not recommended.</li>
            <li> and I forget to use it consistently, but I do notice when I use it at night</li>
            <li> I felt my face and it was soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I started using this product a couple weeks ago and at first I was like</li>
            <li> It makes the consumer aware of manufacture date (11/17/2014) and expiration date (11/16/2016).</li>
            <li> I still have more than 1/2 left because I needed 1 pump at night and a 1/2 a pump in the day.  </li>
            <li> I still have more than 1/2 left because I needed 1 pump at night and a 1/2 a pump in the day.  </li>
            <li> I really loved how after a few weeks of use my pores have shrunk drastically.</li>
            <li> As far as ease of use, I love the pump feature (much better than droppers that other products use).  </li>
            <li> the advanced skin care products haven&#x27;t had any profound effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is never to early or later to start taking care of your skin.**product was sent for review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> But she had nothing but positive things to say about it.</li>
            <li> My son tells me that it is having a positive effect on me.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 10 days and am hopeful that I&#x27;ll see some positive change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month now and it pretty much hasn&#x27;t done anything for acne</li>
            <li> Now I know that retinol products usually take months to have their full effect, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that Super Retinol contains Vitamin E and organic aloe and after just a week and a half I could see the difference that this serum was making in my skin.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the personal attention I received from the company representative who sent me information about the product before I received it and to my surprise, she answered two other specific questions I had when I asked.</li>
            <li> Glides on easily, one pump covers entire face.</li>
            <li> Not so strong that it irritates the skin,just enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It feels like it is nothing but pure aloe.  </li>
            <li> ( because I have that certain glow).</li>
            <li> However, I do have a prominent dark spot (about a quarter size) on the right side of my face that has been a cosmetic concern for quite awhile.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also noticed a slight difference in my laugh lines, but I focused more around my crows feet.</li>
            <li> A very gentle product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I stick to 2.5% retinol for now until the time the fine lines start fighting back harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aria</li>
            <li> I do think that wrinkles around my eyes are lessening, however, I am interested to see if there will be significant change after further usage and time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase Super Retinol again!</li>
            <li> Retinol products tend to sting a little bit, but have been greatly effective to my skin.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s very picky.</li>
            <li> It shrinks your pores and really tightened my skin..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> really well priced with 2.5% Retinol</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice anything, however, I had 2 people</li>
            <li> At this point, I haven&#x27;t seen much change.</li>
            <li> fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> I use it after shaving and my skin feels very refreshed without feeling greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> I had really noticeable hyperpigmentation since 2013 from my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I am very ease and will continue to use if needed</li>
            <li> and I really think that I found it.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the reviews, I thought this product would be much better, but has not really improved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Appears to be working very well</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> I realized how much balanced my skin appeared.  </li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> Let this skin rejuvenator with organic aloe do all the work while your fast asleep.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much as I thought...</li>
            <li> My skin seems to be much smoother.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used much of it yet since I just got it a couple of days ago.</li>
            <li> It really smoothed out my skin and tighten it around the neck area.</li>
            <li> It does really work....</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> price is reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But this is basically a very “vanishing” product.</li>
            <li> No visible change as yet, can&#x27;t say much about product at all but will continue using.</li>
            <li> works really well reduces visible lines</li>
            <li> is you are having issues - it really works wonders.</li>
            <li> REALLY RETINOL?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to its anti-aging properties, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Aria Starr Beauty.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Aria Starr Beauty.  </li>
            <li> Retinol is effective if you continue daily use,  though it can take time to work on deep wrinkles, so as you may not see immediate results, you will see results, if you stick with it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest only using at night as this will make you more sensitive to sun.</li>
            <li> Aria Starr took one step further and opted for a pump action top versus the glass droppers you see with some products, so again protecting the potency of the retinol by limiting oxygen/air from diluting it&#x27;s contents.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as promotional sample, in order that I use the product and express my objective and honest opinion of such.</li>
            <li> After all, you have to have a good base for a good application.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel young!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited based on the other reviews; it certainly hasn&#x27;t hurt but it didn&#x27;t brighten as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> but it turns out I just needed to exfoliate more due to the increased cell turnover.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value for the money, as a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and can honestly say that my small lines around my eyes when I smile have disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> Started to see results about a week in, but progress is slow so far,  it feels nice on the skin, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I apply after my face has been cleansed and I apply twice a day very comparable to high end products.</li>
            <li> Although they haven&#x27;t disappeared completely, they are much lighter now!</li>
            <li> There are small amounts of some nice oils too.&lt;br /&gt;*Know</li>
            <li> Love it, I noticed a difference in the disappearance of my wrinkles in less than 2weeks</li>
            <li> I also used this serum for the acne on my face and noticed that the more I used it, the less acne that appeared.</li>
            <li> My skin seems brighter and some of my eye wrinkles are less prominent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 and have tried several skin creams and serums including expensive retinols but haven&#x27;t been too impressed until now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this super retinol for only about two weeks every night  with an addition of coconut oil which I&#x27;ve always applied.  </li>
            <li> Maybe because I am older...</li>
            <li> Aria Super Retinol made enough changes to my skin that I am getting compliments.</li>
            <li> I have been using Super Retinol for several days now.</li>
            <li> In my particular case I need a stronger solution of retinol.</li>
            <li> You get a combination of main ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E and Organic Aloe.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry if you need to rest a dropper&#x27;s top on the counter and picking up whatever to not only affect your skin, but the contents of the product, and it&#x27;s future applications.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for about 4-5 days, I have used it nightly and could see the difference in 3 days, with very clear and clean pours on my nose</li>
            <li> what and the pump squirted it so forcefully sometimes it made more of a mess than anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> And it would help if I were applying a high percentage of vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend the serum to others.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nothing in comparison with high line products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This serum didn&#x27;t unclog pores, if anything my pores became a little more clogged</li>
            <li> I did not have any adverse reactions and this serum seems to leave a little more of a moisture barrier and this may be because of the additional beneficial properties added (i.e. vitamin oils and enriching</li>
            <li> I did not have any adverse reactions and this serum seems to leave a little more of a moisture barrier and this may be because of the additional beneficial properties added (i.e. vitamin oils and enriching</li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s working really well for me</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking it but not seeing much improvement in my skin like I would with a prescription retinol product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 years old and it has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this are great, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed a significant difference in my skin, and as long as I just use this every other day with a heavier moisturizer, its fantastic.</li>
            <li> I received it, I washed my face like normal and started applying it twice a day.</li>
            <li> After a couple days I&#x27;ve noticed more firm and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with acne, I was prescribed Retinol from a dermatologist and this product has done more justice for my skin.</li>
            <li> This also means you get a softer potency that is sometimes better because delicate areas like your eyes can&#x27;t tolerate higher doses.</li>
            <li> I also use it right around the edges of my lips and have noticed the same results.  </li>
            <li> Ha I do tell them that I am using this new product.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen any new ones.</li>
            <li> but now I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so smooth in a second only and supple.</li>
            <li> Its leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I know very little about the science of it, but it has helped my oily, clogged, acne prone skin look so much better.</li>
            <li> Like the product so far!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> The positives of this serum is I did see a slight diminishment in the discolorations on my skin as well as some fine lines.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and the dark spot on my face seems to going away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed a slight difference with fine lines I have.  </li>
            <li> Will update my review once a month has past (that&#x27;s when most people see results or lack thereof)</li>
            <li> I have not seen huge results as of yet, but have not had it quite long enough for that.</li>
            <li> as I found that my skin will dry out more quickly unless I remember to moisturizer at least 2 to 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for a little over a year now and it has made a huge difference in my skin at age 56</li>
            <li> So hard to find retinol plus HA in meaningful doses together.  </li>
            <li> Just after a few days I noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Started to clear up my complexion within a week, without the peeling and sensitivity to sunlight that I had on</li>
            <li> It is a clear gel like substance with no smell.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and don&#x27;t feel heavy or look greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product and so far like my smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> My adult acne has cleared and my skil appears smoother.</li>
            <li> serum is professional strength, FDA approved and 2.5% retinol of Vitamin A for anti-aging.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend for people with acne prone skin like myself as it has help to zap my occasional zit.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 2 weeks now, so I can&#x27;t really tell if it is having an effect on my acne scars,</li>
            <li> Have only used 5 times and skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> This has so far seemed like it has been helping heal my pitted acne scars and hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I should have taken before after pictures but so far I don&#x27;t notice a difference after using the serum for almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not expecting a complete reversal</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and I hope it will help me with my wrinks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely suggest giving it a try before going straight to prescription-strength</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I cleanse with natural castille soap then use toner and follow with this retinol serum</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the personal follow-up email for suggestions on using the product.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been a miracle worker for old acne scars or anything, but I think with continued use it will help even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> but so far I like this product and can notice and feel a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for three nights, but I really like how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man who is almost 50 years old.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s to early still</li>
            <li> i have been battling acne for a few years now and this the only thing that is clearing my acne scars without causing me to breakout some more.</li>
            <li> I am starting to look young again!!!</li>
            <li> The left side of my face around my eye was more wrinkled than the other side which I think is from the sun when driving over the years; now both sides look smoother which makes me feel younger</li>
            <li> I started using Aria Super Retinol, after 3 days I started seeing smoothness in my face, after 3 weeks my dark spots has been lightened.</li>
            <li> been using it for 2 months now, and i can finally give a decent review.</li>
            <li> Ingredient list on description does not show Wheat germ oil, which is a MAJOR pore clogger!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, not greasy or sticky, and has very little if any smell.  </li>
            <li> Not all vitamin A products are created equal but that does not mean that retinol product is not going to cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready for injections or surgery, but using this product has worked really well to perk up my skin!</li>
            <li> certain facial characteristics can actually be reversed.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast so can apply a moisturizer once dry.</li>
            <li> It has brightened it, noticeably shrunk pores, and I have noticed my makeup goes on much smoother than it used to as it has also helped dry patches I had on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so I anticipate the effects will be fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks, I also was using the Super Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;Great product I am very surprised on the results after only using it one time.</li>
            <li> and that is a major</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great consistency, subtle to no scent, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The serum does have retinol present, as my past achievements of ditching fine lines continued.</li>
            <li> The serum does have retinol present, as my past achievements of ditching fine lines continued.</li>
            <li> Compared to another high end retinal treatment I use regularly, this one misses the mark and doesn&#x27;t give the same results.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in taking care of your skin while you&#x27;re young.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it because I had some left of the old product.  </li>
            <li> I know that witch hazel can be beneficial to the skin, as I am an Esthetician, but for someone with dryer, sensitive skin, daily use can cause peeling, and irritations.</li>
            <li> I have only had this one week and used it three times so far without any dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li> and some start small but as long as you do it right, I prefer to know I can count on a brand for this product versus just having a large selection of beauty items that do not work.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks since I began using the Arria Starr vitamin  C serum and super retinol serum.</li>
            <li> The Retinol serum sinks right in, and then I apply either Hyaluronic acid or moisturizer so that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li> I have other Aria Starr products and I&#x27;m really beginning to become a fan of their quality skin care range.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every night faithfully, and I can see a positive difference in my skin, the wrinkles are toned down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I noticed it made my skin tight the first week.</li>
            <li> The bottle upon receiving it for review is a large dark bottle with pump of 2 Fl Oz.</li>
            <li> I definitely can tell a major difference.  </li>
            <li> My eyes also seem to be less puffy after a couple of weeks of this, which used to be a pretty big</li>
            <li> Other retinol products have made my skin look better but this does nothing - I find it hard to believe it has the concentration of retinol that it claims to contain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used prescription retin-A on my face for 30 years (originally for adult acne), but it is too irritating for my neck and decollete, which were beginning to show crepiness, despite my lifetime use of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> that first night I had already noticed that half of my crows feet had disappeared!</li>
            <li> I plan to reorder both Belitae and Super Retinol for at least one year.</li>
            <li> It works very well and I am seeing a little improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> and if I saw any improvements or worse, any fine lines coming back.</li>
            <li> I usually use Olay, but so far this is my new pick.</li>
            <li> I definitely suggest anyone with sensitive skin to follow advice or instructions to use every other day in the beginning.</li>
            <li> After this rough winter, I found my face more moisturized and less dull looking.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the retinol or just sunscreen, I live in southern California and we have had a year round summer.</li>
            <li> Since using this product for almost two weeks, the dark spot on my face has lessened considerably.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be sticking with this product long term.</li>
            <li> Maybe just haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Also, I have noticed a big difference in how long my foundation stays on now.  </li>
            <li> My skin is already starting to be smoother and clearer than it has been in a long time, and it hasn&#x27;t even been two weeks yet.  </li>
            <li> And on days that have been grey and I&#x27;m not doing much outside</li>
            <li> Starr Beauty is a young company, which originates in Corona, California and with only a few products currently on the market.</li>
            <li> In the first few days, I noticed an increase in breakouts as the pores seemed to be purging themselves of little white hardened plugs.  </li>
            <li> The company name&#x27;s is the same as the founder, and they provide their beauty aids currently only via the Amazon&#x27;s Marketplace and other sites.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and when I wake up my skin is soft and a little lighter then the night before.</li>
            <li> I see her face looking firm and clear.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know the long term results yet.  </li>
            <li> This serum has 72% natural ingredients in it like Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, Organic Aloe and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Will continue using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> and with the manufacturing date which I also appreciate because I wonder how long products sit on the shelf at the store.</li>
            <li> It does not seem too harsh for my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and firm.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I wish that I had this serum a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> One bottle will last quite a bit of time because you only a few drops to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely improved facial skin after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> How long does it take?</li>
            <li> I am pretty hard to sell on skin care products other than what I have used for 20+ years with a well known cosmetic/skin care company.</li>
            <li> Although I have broken out with a few pimples I think that&#x27;s due to the change of cells turning over more rapidly.</li>
            <li> Sorry - this was not doing much for very mature skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product every other night for over a week,</li>
            <li> not satisfied with the product the company offers a one year guarantee!</li>
            <li> My initial 4-star rating is mainly due to the time factor.</li>
            <li> Noticeable change in a deep wrinkle since beginning to use it (again, in combination with my other products).</li>
            <li> Despite my age and due to medication, I have facial break outs still</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all</li>
            <li> Helps remove dry skin cells.</li>
            <li> I would cleanse my face thoroughly and pat dry.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be oily in some places and dry in others.  </li>
            <li> The first few days I thought I could see some small difference in the deepest wrinkle and skin</li>
            <li> am using this at night with my dark spot reducer cream to try to make the bottle last as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I personally cannot afford to do so, nor would I put my skin through such a harsh process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the consistency of the serum is thick enough that there was no waste of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice base over my daily routine.</li>
            <li> and I saw dark patches on my skin (facial), which my doctor attributed to genetic factors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always discount if a company has little social media traffic or even a limited selection.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with serums and especially retinol infused ones.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with serums and especially retinol infused ones.  </li>
            <li> This small wrinkle is starting to get smaller every time I use this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes only a small pump of the product to use on my entire face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the serum for a couple of days, but I can feel a little bit of a difference already.</li>
            <li> Only used for a little while</li>
            <li> has tightened my skin both on my face and neck and after only a few days of using it</li>
            <li> Not much on pores yet.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this roughly 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days</li>
            <li> , I look forward to seeing what it will do in the next few months.</li>
            <li> I use the excess on the back of my hands and the few spots I have there are noticeably lighter.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product right now.</li>
            <li> NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING  </li>
            <li> * Very slight lightening and mattifying.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:</li>
            <li> The dark sun and age discoloration is also already starting to lighten a little.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not positive</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body 3x per week and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles or anything except for a small one under my eye on the side of my face where I sleep.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other products from this company,</li>
            <li> not sure if that&#x27;s enough time to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Application of a moisturizer or other product would do away with</li>
            <li> I have tried other retinol products.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product and see what other results I can see.</li>
            <li> The lines around eyes seem tighter as do other areas on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> but I have a few recent scars from popping pimples that seemed to have faded a little.</li>
            <li> have some friends who go once a month to an anesthetist to get a facial peel and deal with dead peeling skin for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The only reason it is not 5 stars is I do not know the long term outcome and the product is a little thick and takes some effort to get it to dispense correctly.</li>
            <li> This type of personal service is hard to find these days and something that I value.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are lightening up.</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots and acne scars that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of forever.</li>
            <li> It’s a clear colorless thin gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting some wrinkles and some dark discoloration from age and sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed the dark spots getting lighter.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin is mildly annoyed upon application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with hopes of slowing down the &amp;#34;wrinkly skin&amp;#34; process.  </li>
            <li> Used the product every other night!</li>
            <li> This combined with a few other beauty products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost a month, and I decided to try on half of my face because I wanted to see if there was a difference.  </li>
            <li> , i have a scar in my face and  is less visible now.</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement in lines around my eyes in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> Less breakouts.</li>
            <li> Tighter skin in less than a week???</li>
            <li> I am black with medium brown complexion</li>
            <li> The aging process is difficult enough without having facial break outs like you had as a teenager!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks, but it seems to be starting to have an effect on some post-inflammatory erythema I had on my nose from a particularly angry blemish.  </li>
            <li> I did not see any diminished gains that I had previously achieved and the product does work well with my skin.  </li>
            <li> I did not see any diminished gains that I had previously achieved and the product does work well with my skin.  </li>
            <li> A few pumps rubbed into washed skin, let it dry, then follow with a little moisturizer and viola!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky after it dries</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this product a little longer before rating it.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks maybe a little improvement in skin tone.</li>
            <li> to me it looks a little smoother.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a little over a month before reviewing this product to see how and if it would work.  </li>
            <li> However, it goes on well and has not caused any irritation as other products have in the past.  </li>
            <li> and I do feel my skin appears and feels a little smoother.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I thought my face had changed perceptibly using a 1% retinol product sold by a cosmetic surgeon.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Green Tea&lt;</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks this serum has reduced the discoloration to the point where I do not need tons of makeup to cover it up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for a few weeks now, and I can tell the difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it and update my review in a few weeks.</li>

            <li> I received my Retinol Serum a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> believe this product is getting rid of dead skin cells that my routine skin care products have not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this serum for a few months now</li>
            <li> The last brand I used was thin like water and it ran out of my hand no matter</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing the difference in my skin in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and I have waited a bit before I wrote.</li>

            <li> I can see a difference in how tight my skin looks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Retinol products in the past and they have been too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> Even the expensive brands from Sephora only carries 1.5% retinol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot...just small amounts.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to ween off using my expensive topical acne meds.</li>
            <li> still have some blackheads but no more cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see how my face looks in a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using it about 16 days and it does seem to make a small difference in my fight against sun wrinkles around my mouth and side of face.  </li>
            <li> Not many companies do something like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably not the usual user of this product.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a small improvement on my skin pores however</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I use this every other night and have not experienced any dryness or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I noticed subtle changes after just a few days.</li>
            <li> When I say acne they are hard knots under my skin</li>
            <li> Getting noticed is hard in the beauty world, so</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything negative about it either.</li>
            <li> No break-outs, blemishes, or anything negative</li>

            <li> Like thick water.</li>
            <li> Just as well as costly name brands I have tried in the past!</li>
            <li> I had read the review about this product and was very anxious to try it.  </li>
            <li> but this break out was worse than usual.  </li>
            <li> You seriously cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> I realized that achieving age spot dilution is a very slow process</li>
            <li> I do not keep it a secret</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the pump was broken.  </li>
            <li> At a price of under $20, you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> I use an expensive brand of foundation</li>
            <li> I do not have any exposure to the sun so am unable to know if there is irritation with that.</li>
            <li> So I decided to start using an over the counter retinol product because prescription retinoids are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I had the worst dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> A few years ago I thought my face had changed perceptibly using a 1% retinol product sold by a cosmetic surgeon. At that time, 1% was the greatest strength sold. Now the impressive 2.5% has come into view by many companies.  I not only purchased the 2.5% created by Aria Starr in a 2 oz. bottle, but am genuinely grateful they offer it at a very generous price.  You will notice (over time) certain facial characteristics can actually be reversed.  Use it and be happy.  Some things simply do get better with age.</li>
            <li> Great for your skin! Helps with keeping you ageless and wrinkles away!</li>
            <li> My face and under chin area are getting tighter! I follow up use with a collagen cream! I will order more in future! Thanks! Great product!&lt;br /&gt;PS I am 68!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a month, but I think it is making a big difference in my skin. Specifically the texture of my skin. I have experienced some dryness and peeling, as is often the case with retinol, but I know it is working. I have seen the difference.</li>
            <li> I love using this before I put my makeup on. It hydrates the skin well. I also use it after I have cleaned my face, before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> The powerful combination of ingredients attracted me to buying this serum:&lt;br /&gt;- 2.5% Retinol Serum&lt;br /&gt;- Botanical Hyaluronic Acid,&lt;br /&gt;- Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;- Organic Aloe&lt;br /&gt;- Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;- Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;It proved to work wonders on my skin.  I saw pore reduction, tightening of skin, reduction of wrinkles--especially around my eyes--, and overall skin brightening.  I&#x27;m totally pleased.  It is one of the best serums I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump makes it easy for application vs. using a dropper, and the 2 oz. quantity is a very good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In return for my candid assessment of this product, expressed in my review, I did receive a price reduction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. Apply after cleaning and before moisturizer. Awesome anti aging product.</li>
            <li> I received this a short time ago and already I feel like I can see a difference!</li>
            <li> I love it! Just started this week but so far so good :)!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness what a difference this serum has made on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a chance to get a discount for my review of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more as needed.&lt;br /&gt;It has tightened my skin both on my face and neck and after only a few days of using it I can see a big difference in my wrinkles and my skin is so soft and has a beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;I give this a 5 star rating because it&#x27;s the best anti agony serum I have tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for fair lines around the mouth and eyes. Skin looks and feels supple and hydrated. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff works Great and it&#x27;s all natural. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mother to try and she&#x27;s very picky. But she had nothing but positive things to say about it. I&#x27;m happy that she&#x27;s happy and she&#x27;s happy that she&#x27;s happy too. :)</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my face. I have been using this and they seem like they are getting lighter and some are gone. I did get this to review.</li>
            <li> Better than any serum that I&#x27;ve tried at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Great product thank you and feels great on skin.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel and look tighter, brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> it smells nice. I like it. after use it, my face skin is more smooth.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed!! It shrinks your pores and really tightened my skin.. I noticed a difference after only two days! I have sensitive skin and I really am pleased that this retinal is not harsh because of the aloe and vitamin e in it!</li>
            <li> I loved this serum from the first moment I used it: it absorbs quickly and leaves my face feeling fully hydrated.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in my skin within the first week can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month, I like the pump for the easy application.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month now and I do not see any change.</li>
            <li> I love this - makes my skin so nice! 5 stars! Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It goes on smooth and don&#x27;t feel heavy or look greasy. My skin feels great after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> i have been battling acne for a few years now and this the only thing that is clearing my acne scars without causing me to breakout some more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference.  At this point I will not buy product again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product and so far like my smoother skin.  But, I&#x27;ve had to increase my moisturizer... as I found that my skin will dry out more quickly unless I remember to moisturizer at least 2 to 3 times a day.  I&#x27;ve only been using the product every other night for over a week, so don&#x27;t know the long term results yet.  I&#x27;m trying to stay positive and a couple more weeks will tell.</li>
            <li> I love super retinol. I have used the product twice daily as recommended and have gone through 1/2 of the bottle. I can truly see a difference! I am going to order more so that I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels!</li>
            <li> My adult acne has cleared and my skil appears smoother.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Glass bottle with a pump makes easy to use. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple days, but like it. It dries fast so can apply a moisturizer once dry. Like the product so far!</li>
            <li> I love this retinol serum. It works for me! The serum is light and absorb fast. My fine lines is getting lighter after using it. Love it. Will recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Love it, I noticed a difference in the disappearance of my wrinkles in less than 2weeks</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  It softens and moisturizes skin without drying it out and actually smooths out scaly areas. I use it all over my body 3x per week and a little goes a long way. Will definitely be sticking with this product long term. The proof is in the results.</li>
            <li> Very nice item for price</li>
            <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is professional strength, FDA approved and 2.5% retinol of Vitamin A for anti-aging. The bottle upon receiving it for review is a large dark bottle with pump of 2 Fl Oz. Within a week I noticed that my face felt smoother, firmer and more youthful. After this rough winter, I found my face more moisturized and less dull looking. This serum has 72% natural ingredients in it like Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, Organic Aloe and Vitamin E. I also used this serum for the acne on my face and noticed that the more I used it, the less acne that appeared. I really loved how after a few weeks of use my pores have shrunk drastically. If you mix this with Vitamin C serum you will see even more effects on your face! I pair both up at night before bed and in the morning when I start my day. There is no odor/fragrance and once placed on the skin it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not satisfied with the product the company offers a one year guarantee! At a price of under $20, you cannot go wrong. Rejuvenate your skin today with Retinol 2.5% serum by Aria Starr Beauty.</li>
            <li> Love this product .  . . .  It seems to make my face &amp;#34;rejuvenate&amp;#34; already . .  .  Has the perfect ingredients to help your skin glow again!</li>
            <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;Great product and really well priced with 2.5% Retinol and it&#x27;s in a 2oz bottle. You seriously cannot beat the price. I will definitely be purchasing this again.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This retinol serum is wonderful. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all and that is a major plus!!! Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 3 weeks and so far it&#x27;s working really well for me; specifically, it&#x27;s not causing me to break out or peel as another retinol serum I purchased on Amazon did.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> gave as a gift to a friend and they love this product, and demanded i tell them where to get more.</li>
            <li> You hear a lot about the benifits of retinol in magazines so I thought I would try this product.  I absolutely love it.  It has a nice lightweight consistence and is not greasy.  I have been using it for over a month now and I can already see an improved texture in my skin.  I would absolutely recommend for people with acne prone skin like myself as it has help to zap my occasional zit.</li>
            <li> works ! reasonable price !</li>
            <li> Seller was very helpful, emailed me to help me use the product accurately. I was very impressed. Product is a great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and plan to continue buying.  The biggest difference that I&#x27;ve noticed is that overall, my skin appears healthier and it has a nice glow to it.  When I wake up in the morning with no makeup on, I&#x27;m very pleased with how my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Appears to be working!!</li>
            <li> Great product! I am truly impressed with how well this product is working after using for one week. I&#x27;ll be placing an order for my next bottle soon.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 2 weeks now, so I can&#x27;t really tell if it is having an effect on my acne scars, but I should have more definitive results over a longer time period.</li>
            <li> This retinol product is one of the best I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks but do not see any changes yet.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery for an AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> WOW! I loved this serum from the first moment I used it: such great texture, and it absorbs quickly yet leaves my face feeling fully hydrated even before I apply my moisturizer. A must have for all women  :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My face felt and looked great. I would recommend this to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive still this product:Aria Starr 2.5% Retinol Serum - 2 FL OZ - With Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E, Aloe, Jojoba Oil, Green Tea - Best Natural Skin Care Product For Anti Aging Anti Wrinkle, Acne Face, Neck &amp; Eye Treatment!  Ordered on June 18, 2015  Order# 116-4530086-0632260</li>
            <li> I have noticed a change in my skin texture and appearance. Product is easy to use and apply. Rapidly absorbed. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Perfect for my skin which is combo and it soaks right in. I can use any product on top of it without any problems.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I loved trying this product with a discount code I had received. It&#x27;s time to get more aggressive with my aging skin. I&#x27;m not ready for injections or surgery, but using this product has worked really well to perk up my skin!</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are fantastic. I use it at night before bed on the problems areas of my face and neck. It&#x27;s a little sticky after it dries but it feels great. My skin feels tighter and looks great. This combined with a few other beauty products and I feel more confident going makeup free on the weekends. A keeper!</li>
            <li> Yes to the serum. I use some form of this every day. I love the consistency and find it an alternative to greasy moisturizers. I&#x27;m not brand loyal but do love the packaging and blue bottle of this one (for the subjective part of how we perceive products to work)</li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s working!?</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My skin feels much smoother. I&#x27;ve tried Retinol products in the past and they have been too harsh for my skin. I use this every other night and have not experienced any dryness or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Great product and price can&#x27;t be beat!  I&#x27;ve noticed a definite difference in the clarity and evenness of my skin tone.  I will definitely purchase Super Retinol again!</li>
            <li> Have only used 5 times and skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> I have really noticed more of a difference with this than the $90.00 bottle that I got from my dermatologist</li>
            <li> Very good product! I got this because it&#x27;s 2.5% retinol. Even the expensive brands from Sephora only carries 1.5% retinol. I pair this with a vitamin C serum because everywhere I&#x27;ve read, retinol and vitamin C work great together to get the best results.  After using it once a day (after I clean my face at night) for a couple weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed an even skin tone and my skin is much brighter.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my pores are cleaner.  Applying my make up is much funner when my skin is smooth.  The pump feature is great too; it&#x27;s so easy to dispense just the right amount.  The satisfaction guarantee that the seller provides is also a great thing because I wasn&#x27;t sure how my sensitive skin would take the higher retinol.  But, my skin is taking it fine and it absorbs into the skin really well.  I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews plus the bottle suggest using a moisturizer after using this. That made my skin entirely too oily and greasy. I have stopped using moisturizer and had not noticed any drying. My skin seems brighter and some of my eye wrinkles are less prominent. The only reason it is not 5 stars is I do not know the long term outcome and the product is a little thick and takes some effort to get it to dispense correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I have been using Retin A .25 and it seems to do more than this serum.  However, this serum is very nice on my skin, I have to say.  Just didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Really liked this stuff. The texture is awesome and I think it is helping with my problem areas.  I enjoy the scent and the company was awesome to deal with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost a month, and I decided to try on half of my face because I wanted to see if there was a difference.  I didn&#x27;t really notice anything, however, I had 2 people the other day compliment my skin, and one of them even said that the one side of my face was really good.  So, I believe it&#x27;s doing something!  I have good skin anyways, but always looking to smooth out fine lines. It&#x27;s not sticky when I put it on, no unpleasant smell,  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it. will update as I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the serum for a couple of days, but I can feel a little bit of a difference already. I use it at night and when I wake up my skin is soft and a little lighter then the night before. The product arrived on time and was packaged well. No worries of the bottle breaking.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;LOVE LOVE LOVE this product it made my skin instantly smoother,it arrive just on time the seller help me to learn a perfect way to use love it I&#x27;m definitely purchasing again. :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this product a little longer before rating it.  At this point, I haven&#x27;t seen much change. Skin may be a fraction smoother.</li>
            <li> Amazing Retinol formula. I switched to this product when Affirm discontinued their line of retinol cream and my skin looks great. The serum is powerful yet mild without the sun sensitivity of Retin A. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Wow...I am really impressed with this product.  I use it only at night after washing my face and I have been using it consistently for 2 or more weeks now.  I can see a difference in how tight my skin looks! I will keep purchasing this product for sure.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot...just small amounts.  So happy to have finally found something that actually does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin since using this product.  It feels as if it is mostly water.  I use it twice a day - morning and night.  I was hoping it would make a difference since it contains retinol.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Two weeks maybe a little improvement in skin tone. Not much on pores yet.  Goes on nice and smooth and I have not had any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Good fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> After couple of weeks of use this product it makes my face better, this product is better than most product I used before.</li>
            <li> I bought both Belitae and this Super Retinol. I use Belite in the morning and Super Retinol at night. I am 75 years old and I saw dark patches on my skin (facial), which my doctor attributed to genetic factors. He prescribed a medication called Triloma which the insurance does not cover and it costs upwards of $200. I decided to give OTC medication a chance and so far I am happy with the result. I realized that achieving age spot dilution is a very slow process and it may not work for all. My son tells me that it is having a positive effect on me. Frankly depending on whether you view your face in incandescent light or CFL or LED makes a difference on any improvement you may perceive. I will give both products a year and then write another review. My initial 4-star rating is mainly due to the time factor. I plan to reorder both Belitae and Super Retinol for at least one year.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. Haven&#x27;t seen results, but have only applied it about 10 times.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed any difference in my skin after using it for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for myself and for my mom.  I can&#x27;t tell much difference on my face, but there is a tremendous improvement with Mom&#x27;s fine lines, after just two weeks.  Will definitely keep using this product!</li>
            <li> I use this every night!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! I am trying to ween off using my expensive topical acne meds. This has so far seemed like it has been helping heal my pitted acne scars and hyper-pigmentation. It&#x27;s inexpensive too and you get a lot for your money. Definitely going to buy again when I runs out! Also, the shipping was fast and customer service great!</li>
            <li> You can feel this working when you put it on your cleansed face.  I use it at  night, absorbs quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li> you can feel the aloe</li>
            <li> Worked better than I thought! Just don&#x27;t get it on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!! Not so strong that it irritates the skin,just enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Does exactly what it should do. My skin is looking amazing :)</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking it but not seeing much improvement in my skin like I would with a prescription retinol product.</li>
            <li> Very good serum...I&#x27;ve been using it just for 4 days,but I noticed that my overall skin texture has improved,my pores are shrinking,my makeup looks much better on my skin</li>
            <li> Just purchased two more bottles of the Serum.  I have seen a difference in the tightening of my skin.  It is well priced and is not drying.  Will continue using this product for a long time.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and it works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used prescription retin-A on my face for 30 years (originally for adult acne), but it is too irritating for my neck and decollete, which were beginning to show crepiness, despite my lifetime use of sunscreen.  This preparation of OTC retinol, with hyaluronic acid and antioxidants, has plumped and softened the skin in these areas.</li>
            <li> Awesome customer after service. been using it for 2 months now, and i can finally give a decent review. my acne scars are starting to fade. still have some blackheads but no more cystic acne. today i had my period but i just have 3 big hormonal pimples.. overall my face is brighter.. Plus, Aria is very friendly and approachable to her customers thru email. :)</li>
            <li> I should have taken before after pictures but so far I don&#x27;t notice a difference after using the serum for almost 3 weeks. I can&#x27;t say anything negative about it either. I&#x27;ll give it more time to see if there will be positive results..</li>
            <li> Goes on very easy.  I use it after shaving and my skin feels very refreshed without feeling greasy or oily.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and service.</li>
            <li> This product has transformed my skin! I had really noticeable hyperpigmentation since 2013 from my pregnancy. In just a few weeks this serum has reduced the discoloration to the point where I do not need tons of makeup to cover it up. I am more than happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Excellent - already need to buy more as gifts!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week and will continue to use it. I like the way it goes on and my face does seem a bit brighter. So far so good. I am anxious to see how my face looks in a month.</li>
            <li> The positives of this serum is I did see a slight diminishment in the discolorations on my skin as well as some fine lines. I can see that with continued use there would be more improvement. This serum didn&#x27;t unclog pores, if anything my pores became a little more clogged but it turns out I just needed to exfoliate more due to the increased cell turnover.  I don&#x27;t think this serum would be able to improve wrinkles. It has a great light non greasy texture that absorbs well. For the price I would consider it as a decent option for evening out my skin tone in conjunction with a great cleanser, moisturizer, and regular exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I can truly see a difference already. My dark spots are lightening up. I am very pleased. There&#x27;s no itching, burning, peeling etc. I am very ease and will continue to use if needed</li>
            <li> With 2.5% Retinol in this serum by Aria Starr, this is a strong over-the-counter concentration.  We purchased the serum in a promotion for testing and review.  Retinol products tend to sting a little bit, but have been greatly effective to my skin. The aloe and plant oils in this serum do help ease the light burn I tend to get, however.  Retinol is effective if you continue daily use,  though it can take time to work on deep wrinkles, so as you may not see immediate results, you will see results, if you stick with it.</li>
            <li> Forget the dermatologist, this product is awesome. Do your research people. If you have gone to the dermatologist and they have prescribed retinol or any product similar please try this.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly. I chose this product over others because it is formulated with many highly desirable skin care products not just retinol. I have used retinol, vitamin e, and aloe for quite some time and appreciate having all of these in one product. I also really appreciate the email from the company after placing my order that contained great information especially if you&#x27;ve never used a retinol product. It was shipped quickly (made in the usa!) and with the manufacturing date which I also appreciate because I wonder how long products sit on the shelf at the store. I was looking for a product after running out of my retinol product and chose this one based on the ingredients and discount for a review. Happy I did and recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a good serum.</li>
            <li> Great product and very affordable!!</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this, what the hay, and I found it was pretty good.  I have been using it about 16 days and it does seem to make a small difference in my fight against sun wrinkles around my mouth and side of face.  to me it looks a little smoother.  I&#x27;m not expecting a complete reversal but as a nightime moisturizer I would definitely recommend.  I&#x27;m willing to see what happens.</li>
            <li> Did not see any visible results from this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;I can tell and feel the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;m 56 years old and it has really helped my skin. Pores seem smaller and blotchy patches look better.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It goes on non greasy and works great under makeup</li>
            <li> This serum goes on the skin smoothly and soaks in nicely. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin at all. I&#x27;ve noticed improvement in my skin within the first week. So far; so good....  :)</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work and it feels watery. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was so amazed at this product...it makes my skin so smooth in a second only and supple. Worth a try :) very happy and love this producr:)</li>
            <li> So far so good, Im trying it for one week.. Will come back again in a couple of weeks to see how it is working... My face feels soft and I hope it will help me with my wrinks.</li>
            <li> Started to clear up my complexion within a week, without the peeling and sensitivity to sunlight that I had on Retin-A some 20 years ago. I&#x27;d definitely suggest giving it a try before going straight to prescription-strength guns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a handy pump bottle that dispenses what you need with a couple of pumps. The 2 oz bottle of this should last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Good product! easy to use , very light and absorbs immediately, I have been using this product for about 3 weeks however every other day and I can see even skin tone especially around the chin and mouth area, I don&#x27;t breakout as much as I did before, another good thing is that since the serum absorbs quickly I can also use the moisturizer almost immediately. So far I am happy with the buy. Overall its a good product, need more time to see optimal results.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The seller shipped right away. I noticed it made my skin tight the first week. But I don&#x27;t see huge results. I probably need a higher percentage of retin A. And it would help if I were applying a high percentage of vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It doesn&#x27;t make me break out like others do! My skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in taking care of your skin while you&#x27;re young. I just turned 30 and have noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t as bright as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled when I was able to test out this serum at a deeply discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;Once I received it, I washed my face like normal and started applying it twice a day. Within 5 days I could tell my skin was brighter and felt more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles or anything except for a small one under my eye on the side of my face where I sleep. This small wrinkle is starting to get smaller every time I use this.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it comes out as a gel and feels amazing when you apply it. It just takes two drops to cover my entire face and part of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I would pay full price for this because I am confident my skin will get better with use. My dry skin really drinks this up and it makes my makeup glide on beautifully. After all, you have to have a good base for a good application.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product to protect and improve my skin, since working out in the sun quite a bit. It has improved the texture, feel, and appearance of my skin. I am very pleased with this serum! Lots of good, nourishing ingredients!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks, but I can already see a difference in my skin! I have some dark spots and acne scars that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of forever. Although they haven&#x27;t disappeared completely, they are much lighter now! In addition, my skin has become brighter and more clear. A very gentle product, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about 2 weeks but so far my skin does appear more even toned. i don&#x27;t have acne but I have a few recent scars from popping pimples that seemed to have faded a little. Love the texture and its not sticky at all which is a huge plus. I use it with the vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product right now.I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I can already see a difference! I used it at night before I went to bed, after I washed my face, and then followed up with a Paula&#x27;s Choice lotion (which I do not recommend).&lt;br /&gt;I may only be 22 but I work in a children&#x27;s hospital, and trust me when I say that stress shows on your face! I don&#x27;t want to look 60 by the time I&#x27;m 40 so I&#x27;m trying to find the perfect anti-aging serum and I really think that I found it.&lt;br /&gt;After that first night I had already noticed that half of my crows feet had disappeared! I also noticed a slight difference in my laugh lines, but I focused more around my crows feet. I am excited to see the progress I&#x27;ll make in the months to come. I know this product works and I will definitely continue to use it! I recommend for you to at least try it, because it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product. You receive a generous portion.  Works great.</li>
            <li> These guys are THE BEST!  They did all the testing needed on my 94 Lexus - resolved the promble!  Couldn&#x27;t be ,more please with their &amp;#34;CAN DO, WE NEVER GIVE UP ATTITUDE&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Steve &amp; your Crew,&lt;br /&gt;Lynda McCorkle</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month now. Haven&#x27;t seen any difference at all. Looks like the trash bin for this.</li>
            <li> At 72, I&#x27;m looking for a miracle, but my face seems to have a more even tone. I&#x27;ve always been a sun-lover and it shows...I will continue to use it for the even tone.</li>
            <li> So far, I really enjoy this product. It does not seem too harsh for my somewhat sensitive skin. I have not seen huge results as of yet, but have not had it quite long enough for that. It&#x27;s a great consistency, subtle to no scent, and a little goes a long way. So far, great product.</li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  She&#x27;s only been using it for a while but she thinks it works well.</li>
            <li> Love love love!  So hard to find retinol plus HA in meaningful doses together.  Works great.  Use once or twice a week or mix with moisturizer.  I had the worst dark circles under my eyes.  I use this plus coconut oil and after two weeks they are almost gone.</li>
            <li> It does work! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in one week.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing!  I read reviews where people said they could tell a difference the first time they used it.  I definitely can tell a major difference.  My face feels soft and firm.  Can&#x27;t wait to try other products from this company,</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin looks great.</li>
            <li> After a couple days I&#x27;ve noticed more firm and smoother skin. I have trouble with acne, I was prescribed Retinol from a dermatologist and this product has done more justice for my skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff. I like the bottle/pump for easy application. It makes my skin feels so soft and I think it works pretty quickly too. I can definitely see a difference when I use it. I use it under my make up in the morning, and also after I wash my face at night as a night serum. Good stuff! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I begun using Aria Star on 07/14/15.  The first few days I thought I could see some small difference in the deepest wrinkle and skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;As I continue to use it, I only see  a immediate difference after applying  and within 30 minutes no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews, I thought this product would be much better, but has not really improved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am 67 in age and most people tell me that I do not look my age.  I am continuing to use it with the hope that with continued use I will see some&lt;br /&gt;improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for a few weeks now, and I can tell the difference, i have a scar in my face and  is less visible now.</li>
            <li> Just started using, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve been using this product just a week, I like it. It is absorbed quickly. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Started to see results about a week in, but progress is slow so far,  it feels nice on the skin, absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ll keep using it and update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using it because I had some left of the old product.  Appears to be working very well and I&#x27;m pleased with it.  If that changes, I&#x27;ll post an update here.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. It&#x27;s easy to apply. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I already noticed a difference in my skin. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing products with fast delivery service</li>
            <li> My wife is still using it and not complains. I see her face looking firm and clear. Miracle product it works great !!</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great exceeded my  expectations</li>
            <li> Great product.  I saw visible results in 7 days. I would totally recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 and have tried several skin creams and serums including expensive retinols but haven&#x27;t been too impressed until now.  I&#x27;ve used this super retinol for only about two weeks every night  with an addition of coconut oil which I&#x27;ve always applied.  I didn&#x27;t know whether I just wanted to see the difference but when a friend took pictures on Mother&#x27;s Day and everyone commented on how I looked I realized how much balanced my skin appeared.  The left side of my face around my eye was more wrinkled than the other side which I think is from the sun when driving over the years; now both sides look smoother which makes me feel younger both inside and out.  I have been using two pumps each night and now I can&#x27;t wait to see the results next week.  I love the organic ingredients and the fact that this serum is made in the USA.  I am impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I noticed a difference in my skin/face after the first week. I have deep wrinkles on left side of my face I can see a difference. I highly recommend this product. I have been using for a little over a year now and it has made a huge difference in my skin at age 56 I look great!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a little over a month before reviewing this product to see how and if it would work.  I have seen no change in my skin.  It feels like it is nothing but pure aloe.  I was very excited based on the other reviews; it certainly hasn&#x27;t hurt but it didn&#x27;t brighten as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results that I have received with this product.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month now and it pretty much hasn&#x27;t done anything for acne</li>
            <li> Beware! Ingredient list on description does not show Wheat germ oil, which is a MAJOR pore clogger! Did not know this until I received and read the bottle before opening- returned promptly!</li>
            <li> This product is ok. I just started using it but have not noticed a difference yet. I only been using it for about 2 weeks not sure if that&#x27;s enough time to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Facial serum but fairly effective.</li>
            <li> My skin is much more healthier feeling and my husband says I look younger since using the Retinol Serum.  I have to say that this does work and I highly recommend the serum to others.</li>
            <li> This product is working good so far.  My face feels smooth and the dark spot on my face seems to going away. I gave it a 4 star because I have only been using it for 3 weeks and need more time to see how good it really works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum on my skin for about 5 days and I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 35 and have been trying to add anti ageing products to my skin care routine over the last year or so.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that I had this serum a long time ago.  In just a week my skin has brightened and some of my stubborn wrinkles on my forehead are going down.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this at night with my dark spot reducer cream to try to make the bottle last as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Its a great high quality product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at an amazing price.  Delivered quickly &amp; well packaged.</li>
            <li> Have been using once a day before bedtime for for 2 weeks, no chnage in my skin as of yet.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait for a couple weeks before writing a review, just to make sure I like the product. And I love it! My face feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product to review. I work for a dermatologist and she prescribed me a product with a retinol but I prefer to use this one. Its leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel young!!!</li>
            <li> A great retinal serum that I love adding to my moisturizer. Helps reduce appearance of fine lines. I will repurchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks. The serum soaks into the skin quickly and is smooth and silky. It does however smell of witch hazel - a great natural medicine but I&#x27;m not in love with the smell. Compared to another high end retinal treatment I use regularly, this one misses the mark and doesn&#x27;t give the same results. That being said, I still really like this product and use it as a toner! It&#x27;s a great astringent, reduces the size of my pores, reduces oil production, and hydrates my skin. Gotta love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a while before I reviewed this product.  It works very well and I am seeing a little improvement in my skin.  I will continue to use and add to this review when I have given it more time.  I have never used this maker before, but I am willing to keep with this till it is finished.  I received the product very fast and was greatly please with that.  I have used this for some time now and I do love this product.  I have noticed an improvement in my skin.  I use on face, neck and shoulder area. I am over 50 and the fine lines on the neck have improved and the dropping of the jaw skin seems to have improved too. I have had a few close friends say that I look like I am getting more beautiful with age.  Ha Ha I do tell them that I am using this new product.  I do not keep it a secret, I pull it out when they are around and tell them about it.  Very Glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand (or trust) reviews of skin products that people post stating how great a product is when they also say they saw results within a few days to a week.  Most of those also state that they received a discount on the product, or received it for free for a &amp;#34;unbiased review&amp;#34;, making me even more leery.  I did not receive free product, or a discount.  I also felt that waiting 6 weeks to post this review would give me (and my skin) time for a more realistic opinion  than others I have seen, and hopefully one that others would trust as a true trial period. That being said, I can honestly say that I really like this product.  As far as ease of use, I love the pump feature (much better than droppers that other products use).  I have definitely noticed improvement in my skin.  It has brightened it, noticeably shrunk pores, and I have noticed my makeup goes on much smoother than it used to as it has also helped dry patches I had on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve also noticed a slight difference with fine lines I have.  I liked this product so much (my first experience with Aria Starr) that I also purchased the Vitamin C Serum which I also am happy with (I&#x27;ll review that separately).  I use this product after cleansing my face at night, then use the Vitamin C Serum, followed by my moisturizer.  I will continue to use this product and buy it again once it runs out, though that might be a while.  It&#x27;s a great value for the money, as a little goes a long way (2 pumps is all it takes for full face and neck coverage).  If you&#x27;ve never tried Aria Starr products before or are looking for a great retinol serum, don&#x27;t hesitate to try this one ... I think you&#x27;ll be very happy with your purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using this with some regularity for about two weeks. When I was putting on my foundation this morning, my skin was rolling off... I would say it is working very well! Just as well as costly name brands I have tried in the past!</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for about 4-5 days, I have used it nightly and could see the difference in 3 days, with very clear and clean pours on my nose, this is amazing stuff.  This works great and I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet using this product. Maybe just haven&#x27;t used it long enough. So as of right now I can not say if I do or don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth, no irritation or dryness. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so I anticipate the effects will be fantastic.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this roughly 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;m already seeing results! This definitely helps with acne, it&#x27;s cleared up existing break outs and I haven&#x27;t seen any new ones. You do need to moisturize though! The first week I didn&#x27;t notice any dryness, but by the second week my skin was drier than usual. I would suggest only using at night as this will make you more sensitive to sun.</li>
            <li> The price was really great so I decided to try it. Actually it works better than Retin-A on my skin. I have only been using it a few days and my husband can see a difference.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product</li>
            <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;Great product I am very surprised on the results after only using it one time. Im 26 i dont have any wrinkles i purchased this product for acne and this products works great. Thank you Aria for such a great product. Thank you Amazon for sending my product on time. I have 0 complaints. This product is everything. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is new to me, but it is really nice. I usually use Olay, but so far this is my new pick. I received a discount for reviewing this product. many thanks!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using Aria Starr&#x27;s Retinol Serum on my face for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;m qualified to tell you that I&#x27;m very pleased with my face&#x27;s texture (softer and brighter than before) -- and I&#x27;ve also been using Vitamin C serum and Hyaluronic acid for a while now.  I use the Retinol serum every night after I&#x27;ve washed my face.  The Retinol serum sinks right in, and then I apply either Hyaluronic acid or moisturizer so that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.  My skin didn&#x27;t have to get used to the Retinol serum at all; from Day 1 there was never a problem with it being too strong.  I particularly love the fact that you can purchase a 2-ounce bottle at a great, reasonable price whereas most of the other beauty serums are just 1-ounce bottles at the same price.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell yet.  Most dermatologists say retinol, not prescribed, takes 8-10 weeks to see a huge difference. Anyway I like it, no redness or dryness. Plus I incorporate rosehip oil and peptides over the retinol.  Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Let this skin rejuvenator with organic aloe do all the work while your fast asleep.  A few pumps rubbed into washed skin, let it dry, then follow with a little moisturizer and viola!  A great product to have on your side in the never-ending battle for healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I used this faithfully until the entire bottle was gone. It did not make any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Sorry - this was not doing much for very mature skin.  I gave it to my much younger daughter, and she seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I am older...but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do as much as I thought...it is ok...goes on great....just doesn&#x27;t seem to remove spots...</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product. Will definitely by again. Thank you</li>
            <li> Had a great exsp with my retinol serum the seller was great on telling me about product</li>
            <li> Very effective. Noticeable improvement in lines around my eyes in less than two weeks. Great value and great product.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! I have only been using it for a couple of days but I can already see improvement. I cleanse with natural castille soap then use toner and follow with this retinol serum and it makes my skin feel tighter and more even! I love it so far!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. I like the consistency of the product. Only been using it about a week so can&#x27;t say how it works yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and I&#x27;m definitely seeing results. My skin seems to be much smoother. Less breakouts. Make sure to follow the instructions. Thanks for a seemingly great product!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Helps remove dry skin cells.</li>
            <li> Do far so good. Product smells ok. Haven&#x27;t really used much of it yet since I just got it a couple of days ago. Will update my review once a month has past (that&#x27;s when most people see results or lack thereof)</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister and she said she liked it so far. Made her skin feels softer and smoother</li>
            <li> Very nice, works as good or better that what I was using.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 3 weeks now.  I started out with only twice a week, then increased to 3 times a week.  Now I am using it every night, and I feel that my skin absorbs the moisturizer much better.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I received my Retinol Serum a few weeks ago. I have been wanting ( Needing ) a product for my aging face. I am 71 and although I have always taken great care with  cleansing and moisturizing, the years still take their toll. I am a performer so taking care of my appearance is very important to me. Aria Super Retinol made enough changes to my skin that I am getting compliments. No one says your skin looks terrific: rather I have been told I look great, I have been asked how I stay so healthy and have been  asked if I am in love ( because I have that certain glow). Nothing is different in my life except that I am using the Aria Retinol. Thank you Aria; you gave me an opportunity to make my purchase at a reduced price and I am writing this review, without reservation, to let others know how pleased I am with the results. The compliments tell the true story!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and was well packaged. The product is fantastic.It is a clear gel like substance with no smell.It really smoothed out my skin and tighten it around the neck area.I apply after my face has been cleansed and I apply twice a day very comparable to high end products.Would highly recommend.It is never to early or later to start taking care of your skin.**product was sent for review but all opinions are my own.**</li>
            <li> Great product! So far so good. Been using to combat some aging wrinkles. Seems to be toning up my skin nicely. Easy to apply and no scent. Purchase thru promotion for evaluation.</li>
            <li> This serum is really great, and has all the right ingredients, but the only thing I keep finding in these serums is witch hazel. I know that witch hazel can be beneficial to the skin, as I am an Esthetician, but for someone with dryer, sensitive skin, daily use can cause peeling, and irritations. Its great to use in moderation, but long term daily use is not recommended. The ingredients in this are great, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I love the texture, the way it feels on my skin, and I have noticed these deeper lines I have on my forehead are really light now, and almost gone. Ive noticed a significant difference in my skin, and as long as I just use this every other day with a heavier moisturizer, its fantastic. I would definitely use this product on my clients that have oilier or problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Before this product. I used  Paula&#x27;s choice  of their retinol product .. . Now  I am switching to this one....loving this product It does really work....I used it as my moisturizer night and day .</li>
            <li> I noticed a change in my fine wrinkles in about two weeks.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Amazing serum overnight you wake up looking refreshed definitely the best retinol I have tried</li>
            <li> It works well, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be a miracle or anything. But it has definitely evened out my skin tone a bit. It&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job. There are a lot of factors that go into skin care, etc. so i didn&#x27;t expect it to work alone. But its great so far!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the CSerum from Aria Starr an have seen noticeable differences in both the evenness of my skin texture an also in its tone or color. I recommend trying them together in the morning and at night. I received both products to try free from Amazon Review trader. The size is great and will last awhile. The texture of the Super Retinol is not heavy or tacky and absorbs quickly and can be used successfully under foundation,</li>
            <li> Notice a difference right away.  This is a great product especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I know very little about the science of it, but it has helped my oily, clogged, acne prone skin look so much better. And I&#x27;m 32! I&#x27;ve also noticed fewer blackheads. I found this because my friend, who is the wife of a plastic surgeon, told me retinol is the way to go. I read many descriptions and reviews on Amazon and settled on this one. I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream every night, but do not see any difference as of yet. I will give it more time. After results....I can see a difference  in using this cream, my wrinkles have diminished and my skin is very smooth. Thank you for that. Good product....I have been using this product every night faithfully, and I can see a positive difference in my skin, the wrinkles are toned down quite a bit. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> I love it! I also appreciated the personal follow-up email for suggestions on using the product. Not many companies do something like this. Kudos!</li>
            <li> Best product I have used with Retinal.  It is not greasy or sticky like others I have tried and the best part is my skin is soft and glowing every morning!  Not to mention the size of the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. Glides on easily, one pump covers entire face. Absorbs quickly and wears really well under moisturizer (I use it at night under a retinol moisturizer). Noticeable change in a deep wrinkle since beginning to use it (again, in combination with my other products).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. makes my face feel so good and i think it looks better!</li>
            <li> This is in combination with my dermaroller is working wonders on my body. Tighter skin in less than a week??? YES PLEASE AND THANK YOU! Buying more right now!</li>
            <li> Awesome product...I am using for 1 week; my pimples are gone. price is reasonable too. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am pretty hard to sell on skin care products other than what I have used for 20+ years with a well known cosmetic/skin care company. I love those products but the advanced skin care products haven&#x27;t had any profound effect on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some friends who go once a month to an anesthetist to get a facial peel and deal with dead peeling skin for a few days.  I personally cannot afford to do so, nor would I put my skin through such a harsh process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fortunately have good skin but I credit that to having a daily routine morning and night of using my skin care products religiously.  I have NEVER gone to bed with make-up on.  However, I do have a prominent dark spot (about a quarter size) on the right side of my face that has been a cosmetic concern for quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes only a small pump of the product to use on my entire face.  No noticeable scent.  Since using this product for almost two weeks, the dark spot on my face has lessened considerably.  Also, I have noticed a big difference in how long my foundation stays on now.  It has always looked good going out the door but within a few hours it needs refreshing.  I use an expensive brand of foundation so it&#x27;s not the foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this product is getting rid of dead skin cells that my routine skin care products have not. I will continue to use my routine skin care of 20+ years as I do have great skin, but will be adding this to my routine as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is working this well within two weeks, I look forward to seeing what it will do in the next few months.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Bot sure how the long term results are but love how it feels now</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long and I forget to use it consistently, but I do notice when I use it at night my face seems brighter the next morning. It hasn&#x27;t been a miracle worker for old acne scars or anything, but I think with continued use it will help even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing after the first time that  you use you can feel your face softer I love it.</li>
            <li> Skin looks more dewy and fresh. Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this serum..........Just after a few days I noticed a huge difference in my skin. I have oily skin and I get blackheads. This serum has made my skin nice and smooth, reduced the oil, and a lot fewer blackheads. I absolutely will reorder this product!!</li>
            <li> WOW ARIA☆STARR SUPER RETINOL Came in a huge 2 FL Oz / 60 ml bottle. The pump made it very easy to use the advanced anti aging serum. I would cleanse my face thoroughly and pat dry. Apply 1-2 pumps of Super Retinol on my face and neck and follow with a moisturizer before bed. I love the fact that Super Retinol contains Vitamin E and organic aloe and after just a week and a half I could see the difference that this serum was making in my skin. Wrinkles and fine lines were dissapearing. I am starting to look young again!!!</li>
            <li> Great product,price andservice.Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCTS.  I GOT GREAT RESULTS LIKE 10 YEARS JUST GONE FROM MY FACE AND NECK</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Smells like witch hazel, possibly in alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Like thick water. It’s a clear colorless thin gel. If you’re looking for a non-lotion-based retinol product, this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Vanishes into the skin nicely but does leave a barely perceptible non-sticky film. Application of a moisturizer or other product would do away with that.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: If there is alcohol in the witch hazel (and there may not be), it might not be great for sensitive or dry skin. But this is basically a very “vanishing” product. My sensitive skin is mildly annoyed upon application.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 2oz blue glass bottle with plastic press pump.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Very slight lightening and mattifying.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Retinol, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E are good for your skin long-term. Don’t make this your only anti-aging product, but if you are looking to add retinol to your routine easily, this is a good choice. There are small amounts of some nice oils too.&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> Nothing in comparison with high line products. You are getting for what you are paying . Did not notice any results. Gave it a month to try and going back to the Image night retinol cream again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this serum for a few months now and I can honestly say that it has surpassed my expectations. After I wash and exfoliate my face I apply the serum all over my face and neck area. I didn&#x27;t think it was working until one day I felt my face and it was soft and smooth, I look in the mirror and acne scars that I&#x27;ve had for years are disappearing and it also helps minimize the oiliness of my skin. I would differently recommend anyone looking to improve their skin for what ever reason get this product. I am black with medium brown complexion I have oily skin and open pores along my t-zone. I can honestly say most of my skin issues or gradually getting better.</li>
            <li> I have only had this one week and used it three times so far without any dryness or irritation. I do not have any exposure to the sun so am unable to know if there is irritation with that. I was especially pleased with packaging of the product as it was protected in a small box. The two ounce bottle is very generous and the pump dispenses the serum perfectly. Also the consistency of the serum is thick enough that there was no waste of it. The last brand I used was thin like water and it ran out of my hand no matter what and the pump squirted it so forcefully sometimes it made more of a mess than anything.&lt;br /&gt;  I am impressed with the personal attention I received from the company representative who sent me information about the product before I received it and to my surprise, she answered two other specific questions I had when I asked. This type of personal service is hard to find these days and something that I value. I am an &amp;#34;old timer&amp;#34; that remembers when everyone was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;  Despite my age and due to medication, I have facial break outs still and this serum has already helped. The aging process is difficult enough without having facial break outs like you had as a teenager!</li>
            <li> It gave me more cyst acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working,  do you have any stronger dose??</li>
            <li> Recently received this and have just started using it. Too soon to tell any differences, but I do like the feel and texture of the serum. I am looking forward to seeing the difference in my skin in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Works well and feels light. Love it so far</li>
            <li> Only used for a little while but so far I like this product and can notice and feel a difference.  I like the 2.5% retinol and I would buy this again I believe.</li>
            <li> No visible change as yet, can&#x27;t say much about product at all but will continue using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks and I see no difference.  However, it goes on well and has not caused any irritation as other products have in the past.  So I am hoping that this is gently working to improve fine lines, but I honestly can&#x27;t see a difference yet.</li>
            <li> We absolutely LOVE this serum, will be buying more soon !</li>
            <li> High quality  and very potent! I use this after my derma roller.</li>
            <li> works really well reduces visible lines</li>
            <li> I ordered this product with hopes of slowing down the &amp;#34;wrinkly skin&amp;#34; process.  I can honestly say that I&#x27;ve used the product faithfully and I am actual seeing results.  My skin is getting firmer and my complextion is a lot smoother looking.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Used the product every other night! Could feel and see visible difference in diminished wrinkles on face, especially on throat and eye area! Looked younger, couldn&#x27;t believe it! It&#x27;s wonderful and totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> decent results, more for complexion rather than wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for my face especially the eye area. I use it twice a day and can honestly say that my small lines around my eyes when I smile have disappeared completely. Of course I don&#x27;t go any days without using it, but so far it seems to work amazingly.  I also use it right around the edges of my lips and have noticed the same results.  Quite amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have really sensitive skin and adult acne. When I say acne they are hard knots under my skin and they have their own heart beat and hurt like hell. I started using this product a couple weeks ago and at first I was like this stuff is not going to do a thing....but now I cannot live without it. I use it morning and night and absolutely love it!!! I would recommend everyone try this is you are having issues - it really works wonders. I am 37 years old and people are amazed at how my skin looks - within the last week I&#x27;ve received so many compliments and I think it&#x27;s because of this product :)</li>
            <li> Very pleased, seeing good results!</li>
            <li> feels great, big results</li>
            <li> The serum goes on smooth and is absorbed fast.  I have used this product for 10 days and am hopeful that I&#x27;ll see some positive change in my skin.</li>
            <li> NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING  IS IT REALLY RETINOL?</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for the sagging neck area, it&#x27;s cool as it is applied but dries pretty quickly so you can continue daily routine. I noticed subtle changes after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I have tried other retinol products. This one surpassed even some of the more expensive companies. It arrived on time and it does what is said it would.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and I have waited a bit before I wrote. I have noticed my skin is smoother and brighter. I will continue using this product and see what other results I can see. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good product seems to work well on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Using it every night and I do feel my skin appears and feels a little smoother.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time. I started using Aria Super Retinol, after 3 days I started seeing smoothness in my face, after 3 weeks my dark spots has been lightened. I will continue to use this product. I love it and I recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the product works and perhaps it doesn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s virtually unusable since the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  have to take the whole top off of the bottle to get any product out, so it&#x27;s inconvenient.  Because of this, I don&#x27;t use it as often as I am supposed to to receive any of the purported benefits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice base over my daily routine. I use it in the morning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of weeks but it seems like it is evening and smoothing my skin tone already. I will be making retinol a regular part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  Odorless.  Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. It works as good as the leaders in the beauty market. I had no problems with the formula at all. One bottle will last quite a bit of time because you only a few drops to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for three nights, but I really like how it makes my skin feel.  Almost immediately after use my skin feels firmer, smoother and softer.  I can&#x27;t attest to its anti-aging properties, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a month and have noticed no difference. Other retinol products have made my skin look better but this does nothing - I find it hard to believe it has the concentration of retinol that it claims to contain. I guess if it&#x27;s too good to be true, then it probably is.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Smooth, non greasy serum. Definitely improved facial skin after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have been using Super Retinol for several days now. Really feels fabulous on my face! I&#x27;m almost 45 and im scrambling to turn back the hands of time. Haven&#x27;t received hugh results yet but can&#x27;t hurt! I can tell the soften of my laugh lines! Pretty good start.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks, but it seems to be starting to have an effect on some post-inflammatory erythema I had on my nose from a particularly angry blemish.  My eyes also seem to be less puffy after a couple of weeks of this, which used to be a pretty big issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY! QUICK SHIPPER!</li>
            <li> I always like to wait a few weeks before I give a review.  Overall the product works very nice. In my particular case I need a stronger solution of retinol. However, I have been able to compensate for that and I can use this product as a daily routine.</li>
            <li> I love this product , it has helped with my breakouts and fine lines in just 2 weeks worth of time. I will definitely buy this product again and recommend it to others ,also it&#x27;s a great price to!</li>
            <li> I bought this several weeks ago and noticed immediate improvement with my acne. I used jojoba oil mixed with teatree oil after to prevent drying. I used on my shoulders and face and neck and saw noticing improvement. All my spots are gone now!</li>
            <li> So far, I can see a difference with smoothness and fine lines. I do have to use a good moisterizer after applying this. Product goes on smoothly. I am very excited to see how much more improved my skin will become! I received this at  discount for my trial and review of this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful serum.  I have sensitive skin and this serum is perfect...diminishing fine lines and noticed plumping, hydrating effects now.  Will continue purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably not the usual user of this product.  I&#x27;m a man who is almost 50 years old.  I have always had problems with blocked pores and acne even at this age.  My skin tends to be oily in some places and dry in others.  I&#x27;m getting some wrinkles and some dark discoloration from age and sun exposure.  So I decided to start using an over the counter retinol product because prescription retinoids are so expensive.  This Aria Starr Super Retinol had a high percentage of retinol (2.5%) and it seemed like an excellent value given the price and the 2 oz size, and the reviews were favorable, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I&#x27;ve been using the product nightly for the last 12-13 days.  Now I know that retinol products usually take months to have their full effect, but so far so good.  In the first few days, I noticed an increase in breakouts as the pores seemed to be purging themselves of little white hardened plugs.  Now, everything is clearing up.  My skin is already starting to be smoother and clearer than it has been in a long time, and it hasn&#x27;t even been two weeks yet.  The dark sun and age discoloration is also already starting to lighten a little.  I&#x27;ve had no irritation.  The product is easy to apply.  I use 2-3 pumps to cover my entire forehead and face.  It&#x27;s light, not greasy or sticky, and has very little if any smell.  So, so far so good, or better, so far so great!  I&#x27;ll post an update after I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the pump was broken.  So I have to open the bottle to apply the serum.  Besides that, the serum is light but feels good on my face. It has no smell and provides optimal moisture to your skin.  I use it at night before bed and in the morning my skin looks fresh and radiant. Good product overall.</li>
            <li> works well, just as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks since I began using the Arria Starr vitamin  C serum and super retinol serum. Something is happening to my skin, and I think it&#x27;s pretty good. Although I have broken out with a few pimples I think that&#x27;s due to the change of cells turning over more rapidly. I have been using the vitamin C in the morning and C and retinol serum at night. And on days that have been grey and I&#x27;m not doing much outside I have used the super retinol twice a day which might be the cause of my pimples. I can say my skin looks smoother but it&#x27;s to early still but I think I&#x27;ll write an update in a month. I am 40ish lol and have seen many Sun filled days and have visual pores which appear to be looking smaller and an age spot that looks lighter. I have been very good about wearing sunscreen since beginning my serum so I&#x27;m not positive it&#x27;s the retinol or just sunscreen, I live in southern California and we have had a year round summer. So I hope it&#x27;s not just wishful thinking and I continue to see a healthier glow and smaller pores, and plumper skin.</li>
            <li> Read the fashion magazines to the beauty newsletters,, and everyone is always pushing a retinol product with a very huge price tag. Not all vitamin A products are created equal but that does not mean that retinol product is not going to cost an arm and a leg. One thing I learned, is that Vitamin A should not be as costly and it&#x27;s effectiveness will come from what the formulation yields. You then get into the source and potency of the product and that is where I come to see if the bottle has what it says it does. The skin does not lie! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aria Starr Beauty is a young company, which originates in Corona, California and with only a few products currently on the market. They offer Argan oil, a Vitamin C serum and the Super Retinol serum they kindly sent me to try out. The company name&#x27;s is the same as the founder, and they provide their beauty aids currently only via the Amazon&#x27;s Marketplace and other sites. Getting noticed is hard in the beauty world, so I don&#x27;t always discount if a company has little social media traffic or even a limited selection. Everything starts somewhere and some start small but as long as you do it right, I prefer to know I can count on a brand for this product versus just having a large selection of beauty items that do not work.....we all have sort of been there at one time or another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always on a retinol product as it is, and currently the OTC brands are only allowed to distribute a maximum of 2.5% without a prescription. This also means you get a softer potency that is sometimes better because delicate areas like your eyes can&#x27;t tolerate higher doses. You would need a script for retinol, which contains Tretinoin and comes in both topical and even pill form (i.e. Accutane). I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m there yet when it comes to my skin&#x27;s needs both in appearance and let&#x27;s admit it, in cost. I stick to 2.5% retinol for now until the time the fine lines start fighting back harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aria Starr Super Retinol is labeled as a advanced anti-aging serum. You get a combination of main ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E and Organic Aloe. I like that the product comes in a glass colored bottle to avoid oxidation caused by light, plus it&#x27;s a gorgeous cobalt blue in color. Aria Starr took one step further and opted for a pump action top versus the glass droppers you see with some products, so again protecting the potency of the retinol by limiting oxygen/air from diluting it&#x27;s contents. I also like pump tops because I think they are more sanitary. You don&#x27;t have to worry if you need to rest a dropper&#x27;s top on the counter and picking up whatever to not only affect your skin, but the contents of the product, and it&#x27;s future applications. I&#x27;m just not into spreading germs with my beauty routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (as listed on Amazon): Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Jojoba Oil, Triticum Vulgare, Vitamin E (Tocopheryl Acetate), Organic Green Tea, Wildcrafted Resina Propoli, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label has a printed on expiration date, which I like. It makes the consumer aware of manufacture date (11/17/2014) and expiration date (11/16/2016). Aria Starr&#x27;s products are manufactured in the USA and lot/batch numbers are also recorded on the label.  Covered by a 1-year Satisfaction Guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;As I stated I use retinol, so I am passed the &amp;#34;sensitive period&amp;#34; where peeling and/or redness may occur. Aria Starr&#x27;s serum is the same potency as the brand I was currently using, so I simply just jumped from one brand to another. I used the product for 3.5 weeks to see if the serum continued with my skin&#x27;s upkeep and if I saw any improvements or worse, any fine lines coming back. I used the product twice a day but in the A.M., I tend to go lighter with application and always follow-up with a SPF moisturizer. The serum does have retinol present, as my past achievements of ditching fine lines continued. I did not have any adverse reactions and this serum seems to leave a little more of a moisture barrier and this may be because of the additional beneficial properties added (i.e. vitamin oils and enriching oils).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price point for a product where 1 to 2 pumps is needed. I still have more than 1/2 left because I needed 1 pump at night and a 1/2 a pump in the day.  A little goes a long way with serums and especially retinol infused ones.  I did not see any diminished gains that I had previously achieved and the product does work well with my skin.  No break-outs, blemishes, or anything negative I could attribute to the serum.  The product also absorbs quickly and gave me zero issues when used under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Aria Starr Beauty.

            <li> A very good product.  I am loving the results</li>
            <li> Works great prompt delivery.recommend</li>
            <li> I really like this Super Retinol Serum. It tightens my skin and leaves it feeling smooth, taught and youthful. I do think that wrinkles around my eyes are lessening, however, I am interested to see if there will be significant change after further usage and time. I have other Aria Starr products and I&#x27;m really beginning to become a fan of their quality skin care range. So far, so good with this product - I would purchase this again. I purchased this as promotional sample, in order that I use the product and express my objective and honest opinion of such.</li>
            <li> Impressive! Dries quickly and not sticky. Moisturizer glides on after application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks, I also was using the Super Vitamin C Serum. I had to stop using the C because it made my face breakout. I&#x27;m continuing to use the Super Retinol I hope to see a difference soon. How long does it take? Is it common for the C to cause acne? Thank You in advance for your suggestions</li>
            <li> I had read the review about this product and was very anxious to try it.  I have seen a small improvement on my skin pores however, I broke out in acne all over my face.  I have struggled with acne more often as an adult but this break out was worse than usual.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from the product purging the pores.  I have noticed the dark spots getting lighter.  I use the excess on the back of my hands and the few spots I have there are noticeably lighter.  I am certainly going to continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Seems to be very good product. The lines around eyes seem tighter as do other areas on my face and neck.  Seems powerful.  Have only used couple weeks.  I definitely suggest anyone with sensitive skin to follow advice or instructions to use every other day in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I love this retinol product! I have used it for about a week now and have already noticed a difference in my skin! The texture in my skin is smoother and feels tighter! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> In two weeks time I can already see a difference.  The sun damage spots on my face are fading and my skin seems to be toning up.</li>
