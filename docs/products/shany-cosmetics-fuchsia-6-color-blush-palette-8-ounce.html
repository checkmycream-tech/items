            <li>Not as pictured in the photo, way too bright.</li>
            <li>The colors on the palette are extremely bright.</li>
            <li>it does come off brightly</li>
            <li>otherwise the blush will end up being overly bright.</li>
            <li>The colors look alright in the picture, but when I got them, they&#x27;re too bright.  </li>
            <li>and for the price its good.</li>
            <li>Although the colors are so gorgeous that it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>They did not look good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Good for someone wanting to practice technique, but not for every day use.</li>
            <li>The colors do need a good blending or they look patchy</li>
            <li>The product got in a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Good packaging.</li>
            <li>Although the colors are so gorgeous that it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and was a good cost.</li>
            <li>I loved the pigments.</li>
            <li>and my bff has fair skin.</li>

            <li>I love love these colors in this blush palette!</li>
            <li>The first time I got it, Ontrac had been playing football with my package and the blushes were shattered, but I could tell from the powder fragments that the colors were beautiful and well pigmented.</li>
            <li>The color of blushes goes on and gets blended easily!</li>
            <li>so i can apply it easily!</li>
            <li>The quality of the product isn&#x27;t all that excellent compared to other products, but it&#x27;s good for the price I got it for.</li>
            <li>The case is very cheap even for this price.</li>
            <li>They were very smooth as well</li>
            <li>The colors are perfect for everyday wear and the quality is impeccable.</li>
            <li>If you are a person who likes to stand out from others and wear bold and bright colors then this product is for you.</li>
            <li>It gets on to brush nicely and easy to evens out on cheeks.</li>
            <li>In reality, the colors are a bit darker and more vibrant than the picture shows, but they are beautiful.  </li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful and vibrant so you don&#x27;t need a lot of product, which means more bang for your buck.  </li>

            <li>I love Shany Cosmetics and am never disappointed.</li>

            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product who is looking for a good quality product.</li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented and go on gorgeously.</li>
            <li>Lovely colors - true to what you see on line.  </li>
            <li>nice product, ships fast!</li>
            <li>these blush palettes looks beautiful on the both of us, i definitely recommenced this and will purchase again once it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li>Blush is what makes a woman&#x27;s face look pretty, and this product is perfect for people who want to experiment with different colors without having to buy a lot of palettes and blush products to do so.  </li>
            <li>The colors are super pigmented and they are a set of lovely colors for all skin complexions.</li>
            <li>i love this product it makes finding the right color easy its creamy</li>
            <li>so smooth</li>
            <li>Overall a great find.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all the colors yet, but the ones I tried applied smoothly and kept their color all day.</li>
            <li>AMAZING COLORS VERY PIGMENTED BE CAREFULL WHIT</li>
            <li>They are pigmented really well and contain a nice assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>I have bought several Shany products and they are consistently great makeup products.  </li>
            <li>They go on so smooth and blend evenly.</li>
            <li>The quality and shipping of the product were great, but the colors are definitely brighter than the picture.</li>
            <li>Overall a great find.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and stays.</li>
            <li>Pretty!!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend bought this after looking for hours in Amazon and in local stores, is a great product/price relationship, I haven&#x27;t seen her this happy in a long time.</li>
            <li>The colors are very light but can build up very well!</li>
            <li>I do think you should spend the extra dollars on a better formula that is creamier and more blend able.</li>
            <li>The colors are very rich and it is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am quite satisfied with this product and more than surprised at the amount of blush that came in each well, considering the price.</li>
            <li>I have gone through 3 so far and expect to go through many more.</li>
            <li>The colors are rich and true to picture.</li>
            <li>Still, a good product overall.</li>
            <li>THey have a sophistication that I really like, but the ability to be packed on and made itno a more &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; look for night time.&lt;br /&gt;Neutral, but</li>
            <li>It came nicely intact in slide paper cover case, no messy powder everywhere or anything like that.</li>
            <li>Again the makeup itself is awesome and would recommend it to anyone that wants highly pigmented makeup with lots of different choices!!  </li>
            <li>this was ok..not as happy as I am with the other stuff I have got from them</li>
            <li>when I force the cover to open up I might crack the top and end up placing blush in plastic bag and no longer will b able to keep it with me in my pocketbook</li>
            <li>and I love the way they apply definitely going to buy more</li>
            <li>especially the bottom 3 colours look more pearly than the 3 on top to me.</li>
            <li>I am an AA woman, and I LOVE these colors on my darker skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;They are not childish and &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34;&amp;#60; and are very colorful, but not &amp;#34;nightclub&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Blush is smooth and very pigmented!</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty, it matches a lot of skin tones.</li>
            <li>First off the package smells really bizarre.</li>
            <li>I am a new Shany customer and will be purchasing more products.</li>
            <li>They look very nice on my dark skin.</li>
            <li>I tend to use the top row and the first one on the bottom left the most</li>
            <li>these blush colors are so pretty!</li>
            <li>you dont over apply, start light then build, use a gentle hand when swirling your brush on this blush</li>
            <li>But worth its cost.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth having as a part of your make up arsenal.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite blush palette known to the makeup world.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised at how much I love this palette.  </li>
            <li>The second color on the top row is a beautiful coral for summer and is extremely pigmented!  </li>
            <li>Try this Fuchsia blush just the right color for you.</li>
            <li>The pans are large and the colors in the picture are true to life.</li>
            <li>I used this in my makeup kit and the colors are very pretty, have great color pay off, and can be used across several different skin tones.</li>
            <li>The only con to them, is that it&#x27;s very hard to measure the amount you need, and blending them isnt the best, but they are blendable, it just takes more effort.</li>
            <li>Usually amazon is great-</li>
            <li>The pigment is very vibrant and if used minimally they look gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It came to me at exactly the right date it was suppose to.</li>
            <li>and will certainly be buying again!</li>
            <li>I bought this blush palette to use for my wedding day, and I love the different color choices.</li>
            <li>watch how much you put on or you&#x27;ll end up looking like a clown!</li>
            <li>its highly pigmented!!</li>
            <li>The colors displayed in the picture aren&#x27;t exactly the colors I received in my pallette.</li>
            <li>: The colors are a tad deeper when you open your package, so don&#x27;t expect to have a light shade of pink for fair skin.</li>
            <li>The colors are a pretty variety.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for first blush purchase.</li>
            <li>That being said, I most definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so what I do is I tap my finger onto the colors i want to use and blend them out on my fingers first, then I blend the remaining color onto my cheeks.</li>
            <li>but this is a personal favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of the different colors and they don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is pigmented so it last quite a long time which is great.</li>
            <li>the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>so I sweat mostly on my face especially with makeup on.</li>
            <li>These colors are neutral but are much prettier in person!</li>
            <li>These blushes are very pigmented!</li>
            <li>Most blushes at this price aren’t pigmented like these are, and they last on your skin for hours.</li>
            <li>and it would be nice if the palate left a little room at the top.</li>
            <li>Even if you use a tiny bit, it leaves a strong color on your cheeks.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty and classy.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say how long they last since it has been raining for the last few days, but all in ally I am very impressed with this product and will purchase more Shany items to test out</li>
            <li>The middle blush on the bottom makes my skin look chalky, but the rest of the shades are fine.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the palette, the first thing that I liked was that the wells were covered by a clear sheet of plastic to prevent dishevel due to shipping, leaving them absolutely pristine...</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and honestly I go to this more then my expensive blushes.</li>
            <li>I have never heard of the company SHANY Cosmetics before, I really wanted a blush palette and figured I&#x27;d give them a try.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much, since it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and wear well on the skin.</li>
            <li>The shadows and blushes are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors in the pallette we received were much brighter than in the pictures shown.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented colors.  </li>
            <li>These blushes are much brighter than I thought</li>
            <li>very pigmented</li>
            <li>The shipping arrived fast, not broken.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much, since it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>but if you really like the colour you see in the picture here then you may want to think about it or just be ready</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice having several choices in one, instead of several floating around the make up bag.</li>
            <li>WOW !!!</li>
            <li>The black palette case is pretty stylish look.</li>
            <li>, the other two don&#x27;t work with most of my color palettes, but I haven&#x27;t played around with them much.</li>
            <li>The colors go so well with my skin which is surprising because I am so fair and usually have a hard time making blush look natural but not when I use this pallet.</li>
            <li>When I do use this I only apply a small amount on the apples of my cheeks and blend with a brush with nothing else on it  to look more warm and natural.</li>
            <li>I like this palette because there are a range of colors you can choose from to switch up your make up look which i found is useful because having single blushers would be so much hassle digging through to find the perfect one when this one has the common colors of blushers that i personally would use.</li>
            <li>My favorites are the 1st color in the top row on the left and the 1st color on the second row beneath the bright pink on the left.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting them to be so highly noticeable on my skin</li>
            <li>I have an Makeup Artistry Business and their makeup is highly pigmented, gentle and stays put.  </li>
            <li>Once inside the colors are vibrant and have staying power one day</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok, because as a make up artist, I need different shades for different skin tones.</li>
            <li>This product is so vibrant and silky.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the top three colors, but the bottom three are a little dark for me.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida where there is no such thing as winter or a relatively cool breeze</li>
            <li>I have brand name pallettes and use both drugstore and high end make up.</li>
            <li>These are some highly pigmented blushes.</li>
            <li>I will say that the blushes seem highly pigmented, I know this because I had a hell of a time scrubbing the blush stains off my floor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>but if you aren&#x27;t too rough on the packaging it will work just fine.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice when i received it, nothing was broken or messy, a bit smaller than what i had expected but great pigmentation !!!</li>
            <li>The key to success with this pallete is to dust off the excess powder.</li>
            <li>The colors are SO potent and literally last ALL day long.</li>
            <li>For a low price, these are worth the buy.</li>
            <li>So make sure you use very little of it, otherwise you will look like a clown. :P.</li>
            <li>FOR THE PRICE IS FINE, BUT THEY ARE NOT SUPER QUALITY...</li>
            <li>It was so unexpected and don&#x27;t know why it just cracked!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very pale person and they&#x27;re too bright, or not pink enough to use for blush.</li>
            <li>All these reviewers claiming the positive reviews are fake should really stop,just because you did not like a product for whatever reason does not mean people who love it must have been paid.</li>
            <li>Not bright or obvious - good for day and night.</li>
            <li>Had to return because their was blush all over the inside of the package, it made a huge mess</li>
            <li>The color actually stays on my cheeks all day long, which is a first because even higher end blushes seem to fade away as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>The shades are gorgeous and a little definitely goes a long way with these!</li>
            <li>I only wish they were a little more blendable, but it is bearable.</li>
            <li>This was quite a relief to me, as I had also ordered the 162-Color Runway Collection (eyeshadow) and it wasn&#x27;t so lucky during shipping due to improper packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont like having too much color on my cheeks, just a tiny tint of color</li>
            <li>We have all bought a blush set that had colors that were completely out there and nowhere near wearable...</li>
            <li>This seems like a nice blush set, but one of the color pots arrived broken.</li>
            <li>However, this product does go on fairly chalky unfortunately.</li>
            <li>I loved the pigments but received 3 out of 6 shades broken!</li>
            <li>product, though, was nicely cushioned and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li>i love showing it off to other people i absolutely was bouncing up and down when the mail man came saying package for me!</li>
            <li>you only need a little bit to have color and super pigmented, if you want a sheer finished use very little, but I love really pigmented finish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and have a hard time finding blush sets that actually come with shades that are wearable for me, but this one is one I&#x27;d use every single day.</li>
            <li>Very elegant, expensive looking packing.  </li>
            <li>The color stays on well without being heavy and too bold.</li>
            <li>Extremely pigmented - almost too much!</li>
            <li>They are sheer enough for daytime, yet vibrant and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>The colors here are highly pigmented not something you would expect for such a low cost brand.</li>
            <li>When I used one of the unbroken pots though, the color was super-saturated and very pigmented, so just be careful about that.</li>
            <li>this palette is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>Even if I barely used any color, still too fake-looking on me.</li>
            <li>u need defenatly order it, no regrets.</li>
            <li>Almost hot pink and red colors.</li>
            <li>The product does not have any odors (as makeup reviewers commonly remark about products) and the case has a snap closure that is easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li>My only tiny complaint is that you have to be extremely careful when applying, because the colors go on very strong.</li>
            <li>The only problem I really have with it is that its bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>The only problem I really have with it is that its bigger than I expected.</li>

            <li> Not as pictured in the photo, way too bright.</li>
            <li> The colors on the palette are extremely bright.</li>
            <li> it does come off brightly</li>

            <li> The colors look alright in the picture, but when I got them, they&#x27;re too bright.  </li>

            <li> Good for someone wanting to practice technique, but not for every day use.</li>

            <li> The first time I got it, Ontrac had been playing football with my package and the blushes were shattered, but I could tell from the powder fragments that the colors were beautiful and well pigmented.</li>
            <li> The color of blushes goes on and gets blended easily!</li>
            <li> so i can apply it easily!</li>
            <li> The quality of the product isn&#x27;t all that excellent compared to other products, but it&#x27;s good for the price I got it for.</li>

            <li> If you are a person who likes to stand out from others and wear bold and bright colors then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> It gets on to brush nicely and easy to evens out on cheeks.</li>
            <li> In reality, the colors are a bit darker and more vibrant than the picture shows, but they are beautiful.  </li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and vibrant so you don&#x27;t need a lot of product, which means more bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing more of this brand.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this pallet.</li>

            <li> They go on so smooth and blend evenly.</li>
            <li> The quality and shipping of the product were great, but the colors are definitely brighter than the picture.</li>
            <li> Overall a great find.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and stays.</li>
            <li> Pretty!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this after looking for hours in Amazon and in local stores, is a great product/price relationship, I haven&#x27;t seen her this happy in a long time.</li>
            <li> The colors are very light but can build up very well!</li>
            <li> I do think you should spend the extra dollars on a better formula that is creamier and more blend able.</li>
            <li> The colors are very rich and it is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am quite satisfied with this product and more than surprised at the amount of blush that came in each well, considering the price.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 so far and expect to go through many more.</li>
            <li> The colors are rich and true to picture.</li>
            <li> Still, a good product overall.</li>
            <li> THey have a sophistication that I really like, but the ability to be packed on and made itno a more &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; look for night time.&lt;br /&gt;Neutral, but</li>
            <li> It came nicely intact in slide paper cover case, no messy powder everywhere or anything like that.</li>
            <li> Again the makeup itself is awesome and would recommend it to anyone that wants highly pigmented makeup with lots of different choices!!  </li>
            <li> this was ok..not as happy as I am with the other stuff I have got from them</li>
            <li> when I force the cover to open up I might crack the top and end up placing blush in plastic bag and no longer will b able to keep it with me in my pocketbook</li>
            <li> and I love the way they apply definitely going to buy more</li>
            <li> especially the bottom 3 colours look more pearly than the 3 on top to me.</li>
            <li> I am an AA woman, and I LOVE these colors on my darker skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;They are not childish and &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34;&amp;#60; and are very colorful, but not &amp;#34;nightclub&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Blush is smooth and very pigmented!</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty, it matches a lot of skin tones.</li>
            <li> First off the package smells really bizarre.</li>
            <li> I am a new Shany customer and will be purchasing more products.</li>
            <li> They look very nice on my dark skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to use the top row and the first one on the bottom left the most</li>
            <li> these blush colors are so pretty!</li>
            <li> you dont over apply, start light then build, use a gentle hand when swirling your brush on this blush</li>
            <li> But worth its cost.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth having as a part of your make up arsenal.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite blush palette known to the makeup world.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised at how much I love this palette.  </li>
            <li> The second color on the top row is a beautiful coral for summer and is extremely pigmented!  </li>
            <li> Try this Fuchsia blush just the right color for you.</li>
            <li> The pans are large and the colors in the picture are true to life.</li>
            <li> I used this in my makeup kit and the colors are very pretty, have great color pay off, and can be used across several different skin tones.</li>
            <li> The only con to them, is that it&#x27;s very hard to measure the amount you need, and blending them isnt the best, but they are blendable, it just takes more effort.</li>
            <li> Usually amazon is great-</li>
            <li> The pigment is very vibrant and if used minimally they look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It came to me at exactly the right date it was suppose to.</li>
            <li> and will certainly be buying again!</li>
            <li> I bought this blush palette to use for my wedding day, and I love the different color choices.</li>
            <li> watch how much you put on or you&#x27;ll end up looking like a clown!</li>
            <li> its highly pigmented!!</li>
            <li> The colors displayed in the picture aren&#x27;t exactly the colors I received in my pallette.</li>
            <li> : The colors are a tad deeper when you open your package, so don&#x27;t expect to have a light shade of pink for fair skin.</li>
            <li> The colors are a pretty variety.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for first blush purchase.</li>
            <li> That being said, I most definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so what I do is I tap my finger onto the colors i want to use and blend them out on my fingers first, then I blend the remaining color onto my cheeks.</li>
            <li> but this is a personal favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of the different colors and they don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is pigmented so it last quite a long time which is great.</li>
            <li> the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so I sweat mostly on my face especially with makeup on.</li>
            <li> These colors are neutral but are much prettier in person!</li>
            <li> These blushes are very pigmented!</li>
            <li> Most blushes at this price aren’t pigmented like these are, and they last on your skin for hours.</li>
            <li> and it would be nice if the palate left a little room at the top.</li>
            <li> Even if you use a tiny bit, it leaves a strong color on your cheeks.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty and classy.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say how long they last since it has been raining for the last few days, but all in ally I am very impressed with this product and will purchase more Shany items to test out</li>
            <li> The middle blush on the bottom makes my skin look chalky, but the rest of the shades are fine.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the palette, the first thing that I liked was that the wells were covered by a clear sheet of plastic to prevent dishevel due to shipping, leaving them absolutely pristine...</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and honestly I go to this more then my expensive blushes.</li>
            <li> I have never heard of the company SHANY Cosmetics before, I really wanted a blush palette and figured I&#x27;d give them a try.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much, since it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and wear well on the skin.</li>
            <li> The shadows and blushes are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors in the pallette we received were much brighter than in the pictures shown.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented colors.  </li>
            <li> These blushes are much brighter than I thought</li>
            <li> very pigmented</li>
            <li> The shipping arrived fast, not broken.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much, since it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> but if you really like the colour you see in the picture here then you may want to think about it or just be ready</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s nice having several choices in one, instead of several floating around the make up bag.</li>
            <li> WOW !!!</li>
            <li> The black palette case is pretty stylish look.</li>
            <li> , the other two don&#x27;t work with most of my color palettes, but I haven&#x27;t played around with them much.</li>
            <li> The colors go so well with my skin which is surprising because I am so fair and usually have a hard time making blush look natural but not when I use this pallet.</li>
            <li> When I do use this I only apply a small amount on the apples of my cheeks and blend with a brush with nothing else on it  to look more warm and natural.</li>
            <li> I like this palette because there are a range of colors you can choose from to switch up your make up look which i found is useful because having single blushers would be so much hassle digging through to find the perfect one when this one has the common colors of blushers that i personally would use.</li>
            <li> My favorites are the 1st color in the top row on the left and the 1st color on the second row beneath the bright pink on the left.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting them to be so highly noticeable on my skin</li>
            <li> I have an Makeup Artistry Business and their makeup is highly pigmented, gentle and stays put.  </li>
            <li> Once inside the colors are vibrant and have staying power one day</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok, because as a make up artist, I need different shades for different skin tones.</li>
            <li> This product is so vibrant and silky.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the top three colors, but the bottom three are a little dark for me.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida where there is no such thing as winter or a relatively cool breeze</li>
            <li> I have brand name pallettes and use both drugstore and high end make up.</li>
            <li> These are some highly pigmented blushes.</li>
            <li> I will say that the blushes seem highly pigmented, I know this because I had a hell of a time scrubbing the blush stains off my floor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> but if you aren&#x27;t too rough on the packaging it will work just fine.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice when i received it, nothing was broken or messy, a bit smaller than what i had expected but great pigmentation !!!</li>
            <li> The key to success with this pallete is to dust off the excess powder.</li>
            <li> The colors are SO potent and literally last ALL day long.</li>
            <li> For a low price, these are worth the buy.</li>
            <li> So make sure you use very little of it, otherwise you will look like a clown. :P.</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE IS FINE, BUT THEY ARE NOT SUPER QUALITY...</li>
            <li> It was so unexpected and don&#x27;t know why it just cracked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very pale person and they&#x27;re too bright, or not pink enough to use for blush.</li>
            <li> All these reviewers claiming the positive reviews are fake should really stop,just because you did not like a product for whatever reason does not mean people who love it must have been paid.</li>
            <li> Not bright or obvious - good for day and night.</li>
            <li> Had to return because their was blush all over the inside of the package, it made a huge mess</li>
            <li> The color actually stays on my cheeks all day long, which is a first because even higher end blushes seem to fade away as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li> The shades are gorgeous and a little definitely goes a long way with these!</li>
            <li> I only wish they were a little more blendable, but it is bearable.</li>
            <li> This was quite a relief to me, as I had also ordered the 162-Color Runway Collection (eyeshadow) and it wasn&#x27;t so lucky during shipping due to improper packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont like having too much color on my cheeks, just a tiny tint of color</li>
            <li> We have all bought a blush set that had colors that were completely out there and nowhere near wearable...</li>
            <li> This seems like a nice blush set, but one of the color pots arrived broken.</li>
            <li> However, this product does go on fairly chalky unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I loved the pigments but received 3 out of 6 shades broken!</li>
            <li> product, though, was nicely cushioned and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> i love showing it off to other people i absolutely was bouncing up and down when the mail man came saying package for me!</li>
            <li> you only need a little bit to have color and super pigmented, if you want a sheer finished use very little, but I love really pigmented finish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and have a hard time finding blush sets that actually come with shades that are wearable for me, but this one is one I&#x27;d use every single day.</li>
            <li> Very elegant, expensive looking packing.  </li>
            <li> The color stays on well without being heavy and too bold.</li>
            <li> Extremely pigmented - almost too much!</li>
            <li> They are sheer enough for daytime, yet vibrant and not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> The colors here are highly pigmented not something you would expect for such a low cost brand.</li>
            <li> When I used one of the unbroken pots though, the color was super-saturated and very pigmented, so just be careful about that.</li>
            <li> this palette is the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> Even if I barely used any color, still too fake-looking on me.</li>
            <li> u need defenatly order it, no regrets.</li>
            <li> Almost hot pink and red colors.</li>
            <li> The product does not have any odors (as makeup reviewers commonly remark about products) and the case has a snap closure that is easy to open and close.  </li>
            <li> My only tiny complaint is that you have to be extremely careful when applying, because the colors go on very strong.</li>
            <li> The only problem I really have with it is that its bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> The only problem I really have with it is that its bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way because the colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.  </li>
            <li> These blush colors are highly pigmented- a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Goes long, long ways.  </li>
            <li> but at the same time it is so reasonably priced they at least didn&#x27;t skimp on the quality of the product!</li>
            <li> This is an EXTREMELY pigmented pallet, these colors will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> Lasts all day and only minimal powder required in application!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this palette! :)</li>
            <li> I was excited to use these blushes but was unable to use a single one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fair-skinned, but just a warning that it wasn&#x27;t that \\&quot;sheer, natural color\\&quot; that they claim it is, at least for me.</li>
            <li> but probably should have just invested in a single blush.</li>
            <li> Also, the different colors mean that women can experiment with the colors to get different color types to suit their skin on different days.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way so this will last me a while.</li>
            <li> even if you use a very small amount, it&#x27;s super pigmented and you end up looking like a clown :/.</li>
            <li> I thought this palette would have colors similar to NARS orgasm colors, but they were too peachy, pink or dark.</li>
            <li> The blush is very dry and chalky.</li>
            <li> Only thing you may want to be careful is that all colours look slightly darker in person than on the product image.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit at a time yet the color pops on your face.</li>
            <li> Bam, I was instantly brought back to the late 80&#x27;s and my striped cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have a VERY slight shimmer to them, but not noticeable enough to see when the color is applied on the face.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and blue eyes and am not totally fair skinned</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just know that a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This defiantly beats all other comparison products in price and in quality.</li>
            <li> This product is not too small and not too big.  </li>
            <li> The blush colors were extremely pigmented and looked like clown makeup on me.</li>
            <li> I hardly buy anything online because I like to see and test out the product before I purchase - especially when it comes to make up and clothes.  </li>
            <li> It could be because these are rather dark colors</li>
            <li> If you have dark skin..</li>
            <li> All of them are slightly pearly but</li>
            <li> A MESS</li>
            <li> I bought new makeup because my son broke it and this one comes broken will never  ever buy again!</li>
            <li> You might just have to mix a little of your powder on a brush before dusting it on the blush to mute it a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have a little bit of something for every skin tone.</li>
            <li> The blushes are very plain too, not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Quality of the product isn&#x27;t amazing, though it isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> I use everyday</li>
            <li> My daugher (who is 22) had asked for some &amp;#34;more expensive - professional quality makeup&amp;#34; this year for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I did not have trouble getting them on or experience any issues with them making me look like a clown.</li>
            <li> I opened it up one day and it was broken into tiny pieces!</li>
            <li> Waste of my money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this palette yet.</li>
            <li> x 10 cm W x 1 cm thick.</li>
            <li> Someone else already complained about this and it happened to me too -- one of the pots arrived broken.</li>
            <li> After visiting several stores in the mall and being shocked by the prices, I decided to check out on line options.  </li>
            <li> but this is the only product where I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunetly, the blushes arrived broken.</li>
            <li> It was poorly packaged like it was just thrown into the shipping box without any thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Poorly packed for delivery.</li>
            <li> it was so thin.</li>
            <li> The colors on my screen looks very subtle and neutral.</li>
            <li> Im unable to look at the blushes because all of the product will fall out and over all I&#x27;m bummed out.</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of them!</li>
            <li> and i know the colors are wrong for myself.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately have to return this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does, however, seem like a quality product with low-quality marketing (fake reviews).</li>
            <li> Awful, colors not true, pigment oxidized.</li>
            <li> they failed me this time :(</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong!</li>
            <li> but they look horrible on me.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this pallet, it&#x27;s nice having several choices in one, instead of several floating around the make up bag. The colors are slighlty different than the picture but I&#x27;m still happy with my choice. I plan on purchasing more of this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this blush palette to use for my wedding day, and I love the different color choices. A little goes a long way because the colors are so vibrant. I tend to use the top row and the first one on the bottom left the most, the other two don&#x27;t work with most of my color palettes, but I haven&#x27;t played around with them much.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this pallet. The colors are so vibrant and the feel as I did swatches is wonderful so smooth a little goes a long way. I am a new Shany customer and will be purchasing more products.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of colors I use everyday</li>
            <li> I have never heard of the company SHANY Cosmetics before, I really wanted a blush palette and figured I&#x27;d give them a try.  In reality, the colors are a bit darker and more vibrant than the picture shows, but they are beautiful.  They have a VERY slight shimmer to them, but not noticeable enough to see when the color is applied on the face.  The color actually stays on my cheeks all day long, which is a first because even higher end blushes seem to fade away as the day goes on.  I LOVE the top three colors, but the bottom three are a little dark for me.  It&#x27;s no matter, that just means I can do my friends&#x27; makeup.  :)</li>
            <li> I love the variety in this palette. They work with many outfits, I can change them according to the time of day, the season and they last. The color stays on well without being heavy and too bold.</li>
            <li> watch how much you put on or you&#x27;ll end up looking like a clown! its highly pigmented!! and for the price its good.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice when i received it, nothing was broken or messy, a bit smaller than what i had expected but great pigmentation !!!</li>
            <li> nice good color for a Latins women</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the pigment.....</li>
            <li> This color palette is amazing! I love all the options available! My only tiny complaint is that you have to be extremely careful when applying, because the colors go on very strong. On my skin it lasts all day without reapplication, which is why I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am a coco toned women and this left a grayish look to my face I don&#x27;t recommend for darker skinned women</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much, since it was inexpensive. I was surprised to find how happy I was with the product. The only problem I really have with it is that its bigger than I expected. Although the colors are so gorgeous that it doesn&#x27;t matter. The colors are very reminiscent of NARS colors including orgasm. Overall a great find.</li>
            <li> Love all the blushes came in good condition</li>
            <li> This purchase was a spontaneous buy. I have brand name pallettes and use both drugstore and high end make up. I am very impressed with the color payoff, shades are beautiful. So many possibilities to use these as eye shadows as well. Can&#x27;t say how long they last since it has been raining for the last few days, but all in ally I am very impressed with this product and will purchase more Shany items to test out</li>
            <li> between two products ordered from this company, this one came without any damage.  nice colors although i have not tried them yet. oh well!</li>
            <li> Ashy. But worth its cost. It&#x27;s buildable, but you&#x27;d have to use alot of product. That&#x27;s if you have any sort of complexion.</li>
            <li> Love the colors on this blush set</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it seemed like the perfect blush palette for any skin tone. The first time I got it, Ontrac had been playing football with my package and the blushes were shattered, but I could tell from the powder fragments that the colors were beautiful and well pigmented. So, I ordered it again and I am so pleased that I did. I haven&#x27;t used all the colors yet, but the ones I tried applied smoothly and kept their color all day. I will be using Shany Products again.</li>
            <li> The colors displayed in the picture aren&#x27;t exactly the colors I received in my pallette.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my package because I had purchased the 32 make up brush set and was extremely satisfied with them. Unfortunetly, the blushes arrived broken. Im unable to look at the blushes because all of the product will fall out and over all I&#x27;m bummed out. This is why I gave the product 3 stars.  I think it was the shipping company&#x27;s fault though. Not the cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Beautiful blush! Just know that a little will go a long way. Gorgeous vibrant colors!</li>
            <li> In fact Shany products becomes one of my family&#x27;s best favorites, as they have variety of a very high quality products at a very reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and wear well on the skin. I am African American med tone and all colors compliment my skin tone this product his great for women of color. The item came shipped nicely packaged and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> WOW !!! AMAZING COLORS VERY PIGMENTED BE CAREFULL WHIT THIS BECAUSE YOU DONT WHANT END LOOKING LIKE A CLOWN LOL !!! AWESOME QUALITY IM NOT KIDDING I WILL BUY SOME MORE PRODUCTS FROM THIS BRAND SHANY COSMETICS THE MOST AWESOME PART IS THAT THIS PRODUCTS ARE VERY AFORDABLE PRICE AND YOU WILL END BEIG JUST HAPPY AS IM .. !!</li>
            <li> Love these blushes. They wear all day. The colors are perfect.</li>
            <li> I thought this palette would have colors similar to NARS orgasm colors, but they were too peachy, pink or dark. They did not look good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love Shany cosmetics. After reading several reviews and makeup tutorials I decided to purchase. The price does not equate to the quality. I&#x27;m sold. The shadows and blushes are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> this palate i brought last year an is the only blush I use I love the colors it came in an its a must to have</li>
            <li> These are some highly pigmented blushes. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting them to be so highly noticeable on my skin so I swept my brush too many times over the palette. Bam, I was instantly brought back to the late 80&#x27;s and my striped cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The colors are a tad deeper when you open your package, so don&#x27;t expect to have a light shade of pink for fair skin. You might just have to mix a little of your powder on a brush before dusting it on the blush to mute it a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great find for your money!</li>
            <li> This seems like a nice blush set, but one of the color pots arrived broken. It was poorly packaged like it was just thrown into the shipping box without any thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just something to keep in mind if you&#x27;re thinking about ordering this product. Usually amazon is great- they failed me this time :(</li>
            <li> Someone else already complained about this and it happened to me too -- one of the pots arrived broken. When I used one of the unbroken pots though, the color was super-saturated and very pigmented, so just be careful about that. It could be because these are rather dark colors and I&#x27;m fair-skinned, but just a warning that it wasn&#x27;t that \\&quot;sheer, natural color\\&quot; that they claim it is, at least for me. Still, a good product overall.</li>
            <li> Once inside the colors are vibrant and have staying power one day when I force the cover to open up I might crack the top and end up placing blush in plastic bag and no longer will b able to keep it with me in my pocketbook</li>
            <li> I love Shany Cosmetics and am never disappointed. The colors here are highly pigmented not something you would expect for such a low cost brand. Don&#x27;t let the browns fool you they actually go on as a coral I cant figure out why they look brown in the pallet but they are beautiful and will go on any skin tone. I have oily skin and the color lasts all day until I take it off. My day begins at 4am and ends at 10pm.  I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because they are powdery  and it would be nice if the palate left a little room at the top.</li>
            <li> I just started getting used to wearing blushes after I discovered the contour of my cheeks. These are great colors and compliment any skin tone. Use them lighter or darker depending on what you want.</li>
            <li> this was ok..not as happy as I am with the other stuff I have got from them but it works I guess</li>
            <li> These blushes are awesome! They look very nice on my dark skin. The middle blush on the bottom makes my skin look chalky, but the rest of the shades are fine.</li>
            <li> The colors are a pretty variety. However, this product does go on fairly chalky unfortunately. When I do use this I only apply a small amount on the apples of my cheeks and blend with a brush with nothing else on it  to look more warm and natural. I do think you should spend the extra dollars on a better formula that is creamier and more blend able. I would recommend for first blush purchase.</li>
            <li> Almost hot pink and red colors. Had to return because their was blush all over the inside of the package, it made a huge mess</li>
            <li> I am very HAPPY with this purchase. They are pigmented really well and contain a nice assortment of colors. Definitely worth having as a part of your make up arsenal.</li>
            <li> I used this in my makeup kit and the colors are very pretty, have great color pay off, and can be used across several different skin tones.</li>
            <li> The colors in the pallette we received were much brighter than in the pictures shown. The blush is very dry and chalky. Good for someone wanting to practice technique, but not for every day use.</li>
            <li> Poorly packed for delivery. I was excited to use these blushes but was unable to use a single one. WHAT A MESS IT MADE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Lovely colors - true to what you see on line.  Long lasting.  Easy to apply.  Not bright or obvious - good for day and night.</li>
            <li> My daugher (who is 22) had asked for some &amp;#34;more expensive - professional quality makeup&amp;#34; this year for Christmas.  After visiting several stores in the mall and being shocked by the prices, I decided to check out on line options.  I ordered this blush palette for her from Shany Cosmetics, and she was just thrilled.  The items arrived undamaged and well packaged.  Very elegant, expensive looking packing.  It was very reasonably priced and she loved it!  She and I are both using it.  I would definitely order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Love this palette . No clown cheeks if you know how to blend your makeup.</li>
            <li> Awful, colors not true, pigment oxidized.</li>
            <li> Only a tad of this is needed on your blush brush! Goes long, long ways.  It&#x27;s a great range of blush colors.</li>
            <li> Love the colors!  Pretty!!</li>
            <li> Came on time, great for the price and very happy for service :)</li>
            <li> This palette reminds me of when I was a kid and my mom bought me Barbie blush, even if you use a very small amount, it&#x27;s super pigmented and you end up looking like a clown :/.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented colors.  Little goes a long way so this will last me a while.</li>
            <li> OMG! I love the blushes you only need a little bit to have color and super pigmented, if you want a sheer finished use very little, but I love really pigmented finish so I&#x27;m super happy with them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this palette yet. The key to success with this pallete is to dust off the excess powder. There is a lot of excess powder when you simply tap the brush on the blush, if you do not do this you will end up with clown cheeks (yikes!) I&#x27;m not in love with this but it will do for now ...i think i need time to get used to it...but probably should have just invested in a single blush.</li>
            <li> These blushes are much brighter than I thought but it&#x27;s ok, because as a make up artist, I need different shades for different skin tones. I love how beautiful and well pigmented they are. So make sure you use very little of it, otherwise you will look like a clown. :P. That being said, I most definitely recommend this product! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xoxo,&lt;br /&gt;Elly :)</li>
            <li> The packaging was great and the shipping was fantastic! It came to me at exactly the right date it was suppose to. As for the product itself, it is amazing. The colors are super pigmented and they are a set of lovely colors for all skin complexions. Would recommend this to add to your makeup kit :)</li>
            <li> This product is so vibrant and silky. Definitely one of the best blush palettes I&#x27;ve tried. Inexpensive, good ingredients, inspirational company for those creating their own businesses. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This blush palette is cheap and received broken. It&#x27;s not truly matte, there&#x27;s shine to it like what you find in drugstore blushes.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured in the photo, way too bright. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> it is ok, cannot expect more with this price</li>
            <li> I have bought several Shany products and they are consistently great makeup products.  I have an Makeup Artistry Business and their makeup is highly pigmented, gentle and stays put.  The ONLY issue is the packaging - it isn&#x27;t the strongest plastic...but if you aren&#x27;t too rough on the packaging it will work just fine. Again the makeup itself is awesome and would recommend it to anyone that wants highly pigmented makeup with lots of different choices!!  if it wasn&#x27;t for the packaging I&#x27;d give it a 5..but at the same time it is so reasonably priced they at least didn&#x27;t skimp on the quality of the product!</li>
            <li> Use it daily!  Love it</li>
            <li> Yes! A must have in your makeup kit! The blushes are so beautiful and rich. You can not go wrong!</li>
            <li> great colors arrived on time and in tact great buy!! very pigmented</li>
            <li> Blush is smooth and very pigmented! I&#x27;m happy how I have 6 colors to pick from and I never get tired of them!</li>
            <li> This defiantly beats all other comparison products in price and in quality. They go on so smooth and blend evenly. The colors go so well with my skin which is surprising because I am so fair and usually have a hard time making blush look natural but not when I use this pallet.</li>
            <li> Pretty and bright blush color palette, just need to get some Shany make up brushes and all set for a great look!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this blush.</li>
            <li> The colors on the palette are extremely bright. There was a reviewer that said it it made them look like they were putting on clown makeup and I understand why. Even if you use a tiny bit, it leaves a strong color on your cheeks. I dont like having too much color on my cheeks, just a tiny tint of color so what I do is I tap my finger onto the colors i want to use and blend them out on my fingers first, then I blend the remaining color onto my cheeks. Considering the price, it&#x27;s an okay product but I will probably not buy again. There are so many products out there better than this.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet I love the colors and I love the way they apply definitely going to buy more</li>
            <li> these blush colors are so pretty! i love them! i use the darker ones for contouring my face and the brighter ones for blush its a lovely palette! and the price is really good!</li>
            <li> I love a beautiful flushed cheek - this palette has beautiful pinks and peaches that blend gorgeously on all skin tones.</li>
            <li> This is my go to blush palette. It has everything except coral colors, absolutely love this! Staying power is just ok</li>
            <li> This palette needs to be packaged better. When my palette arrived, 4 out of the 6 blushes came shattered. I opened the box and all these blush pieces fell out onto my floor. I will say that the blushes seem highly pigmented, I know this because I had a hell of a time scrubbing the blush stains off my floor. To those that are selling this product, please consider another packaging method to prevent the blush from shattering.</li>
            <li> The shipping arrived fast, not broken. The colors are very pretty and classy.  I highly recommend this product who is looking for a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! These blush colors are highly pigmented- a little goes a long way! Great colors! My favorites are the 1st color in the top row on the left and the 1st color on the second row beneath the bright pink on the left.  The second color on the top row is a beautiful coral for summer and is extremely pigmented!  This product is not too small and not too big.  Fits in my cosmetic bag and would be ideal for travel.  The product does not have any odors (as makeup reviewers commonly remark about products) and the case has a snap closure that is easy to open and close.  Overall, a wonderful addition to any makeup collector/beginners collection!</li>
            <li> I love Shany products because they are so affordable for the qualify but this is the only product where I was disappointed. It has nothing to do with the quality but the colors. They are VERY bright and VERY warm toned. I&#x27;m medium to tan skin tone and i know the colors are wrong for myself. Unfortunately have to return this one.</li>
            <li> I love the colors they have. You have a little bit of something for every skin tone. I&#x27;m fair skinned and have a hard time finding blush sets that actually come with shades that are wearable for me, but this one is one I&#x27;d use every single day.</li>
            <li> I love love these colors in this blush palette! You get those bright colors, but at the same time you get the colors that are perfect for fall time! Great product.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and honestly I go to this more then my expensive blushes. The colors do need a good blending or they look patchy but this is a personal favorite of mine. My skin is very very fair and the blush  is chalky but goes nice on my cheeks. I guess this is not for everyone. But I am over all pleased.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this after looking for hours in Amazon and in local stores, is a great product/price relationship, I haven&#x27;t seen her this happy in a long time. Has a nice set of colors and appear to be of very good quality</li>
            <li> I guess the work \\&quot;fuchsia\\&quot; should&#x27;ve been a red flag haha The quality and shipping of the product were great, but the colors are definitely brighter than the picture. That said, I still recommend it, it&#x27;s not what I was expecting, but the four colors to the left are gorgeous and perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> These are WAAAAY bolder and darker colors than are in the photos.  I have blonde hair and blue eyes and am not totally fair skinned but they look horrible on me.  If you have dark skin..they would probably work well for you.</li>
            <li> I love this palette.  I love the variety of the different colors and they don&#x27;t irritate my skin.  The darker ones I have used as an eyeshadow since they do not go with my skin color.</li>
            <li> Nice item.  Nice colors.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the palette, the first thing that I liked was that the wells were covered by a clear sheet of plastic to prevent dishevel due to shipping, leaving them absolutely pristine... This was quite a relief to me, as I had also ordered the 162-Color Runway Collection (eyeshadow) and it wasn&#x27;t so lucky during shipping due to improper packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am quite satisfied with this product and more than surprised at the amount of blush that came in each well, considering the price. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this palette because there are a range of colors you can choose from to switch up your make up look which i found is useful because having single blushers would be so much hassle digging through to find the perfect one when this one has the common colors of blushers that i personally would use. it does come off brightly so when applicating this make sure you dont over apply, start light then build, use a gentle hand when swirling your brush on this blush otherwise the blush will end up being overly bright. overall i liked this product its a good start to a growing make up collection</li>
            <li> This blush palette is awesome. The color is very pretty, it matches a lot of skin tones. It is pigmented so it last quite a long time which is great.</li>
            <li> Blush is what makes a woman&#x27;s face look pretty, and this product is perfect for people who want to experiment with different colors without having to buy a lot of palettes and blush products to do so.  This is because this palette contains all of the blush colors for all of the existing skin types.  Also, the different colors mean that women can experiment with the colors to get different color types to suit their skin on different days.</li>
            <li> The product got in a good amount of time. Good packaging. The quality of the product isn&#x27;t all that excellent compared to other products, but it&#x27;s good for the price I got it for. I would buy from this seller again in the future.</li>
            <li> I loved the pigments but received 3 out of 6 shades broken! The case is very cheap even for this price. how can I return it?</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it smelled like chemicals and I had an allergic reaction to it, so I stopped using it for that reason.</li>
            <li> This is an EXTREMELY pigmented pallet, these colors will last you a long time! The only con to them, is that it&#x27;s very hard to measure the amount you need, and blending them isnt the best, but they are blendable, it just takes more effort.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day and only minimal powder required in application!</li>
            <li> I really love these blushes! The color of blushes goes on and gets blended easily! Very easy to use! Packaging was very good! You won&#x27;t go wrong with this palette! :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much, since it was inexpensive. I was surprised to find how happy I was with the product. The only problem I really have with it is that its bigger than I expected. Although the colors are so gorgeous that it doesn&#x27;t matter. The colors are very reminiscent of NARS colors including orgasm. Overall a great find.</li>
            <li> Extremely pigmented - almost too much! Great value, but apply with a light touch.</li>
            <li> I am an AA woman, and I LOVE these colors on my darker skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;They are not childish and &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34;&amp;#60; and are very colorful, but not &amp;#34;nightclub&amp;#34;. THey have a sophistication that I really like, but the ability to be packed on and made itno a more &amp;#34;exotic&amp;#34; look for night time.&lt;br /&gt;Neutral, but visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, arrived on time!&lt;br /&gt;Seller is great!</li>
            <li> She order this one and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. She was surprise how fast it got here and loved the colors. It&#x27;s a good product and nice price. She is very happy.</li>
            <li> The colors look alright in the picture, but when I got them, they&#x27;re too bright.  I&#x27;m a very pale person and they&#x27;re too bright, or not pink enough to use for blush.</li>
            <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Like what I want</li>
            <li> I felt like I was applying children&#x27;s dress up makeup.  Too chalky! I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Colors are not like pictured. They are very chalky and bright.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful. The colors are rich and true to picture. They also add some shimmer in the product which is great for light reflection and illuminating</li>
            <li> I really love my foundation by Shany I have bought from them before so I knew what i was getting.</li>
            <li> We have all bought a blush set that had colors that were completely out there and nowhere near wearable...this palette is the complete opposite. I have gone through 3 so far and expect to go through many more. The colors are perfect for everyday wear and the quality is impeccable.</li>
            <li> i love this product it makes finding the right color easy its creamy so i can apply it easily! i love showing it off to other people i absolutely was bouncing up and down when the mail man came saying package for me! yayayay i love this palette!</li>
            <li> If you are a person who likes to stand out from others and wear bold and bright colors then this product is for you. Try this Fuchsia blush just the right color for you. The price for this product is amazing and compact.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that the reviews are fakes (and I didn&#x27;t notice the first time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product, though, was nicely cushioned and nothing was broken. The blush colors were extremely pigmented and looked like clown makeup on me. Even if I barely used any color, still too fake-looking on me. I&#x27;m pretty fair and can&#x27;t use these colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does, however, seem like a quality product with low-quality marketing (fake reviews).</li>
            <li> nice product, ships fast! good brand,quality, everything is good, im happy. u need defenatly order it, no regrets. very very glad.</li>
            <li> Great blush palette for the money.  Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> FOR THE PRICE IS FINE, BUT THEY ARE NOT SUPER QUALITY...</li>
            <li> I actually like it a lot! The colors are very light but can build up very well! Great fall shades!  They were very smooth as well</li>
            <li> Beautiful palette. Quality of the product isn&#x27;t amazing, though it isn&#x27;t terrible. It gets the job done and was a good cost. I would try something else next purchase though.</li>
            <li> I loved the pigments. The colors are very rich and it is very smooth and soft. I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I´ve never bought any Shany makeup and I didn´t know what to expect. As the price was low, I decided to try it and I was pleasantly surprised when I received the blush palette and found out it was great. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite blush palette known to the makeup world. The colors are SO potent and literally last ALL day long. I live in Florida where there is no such thing as winter or a relatively cool breeze so I sweat mostly on my face especially with makeup on. This blush goes no where. You only need a little bit at a time yet the color pops on your face. Very happy with this and will certainly be buying again!</li>
            <li> Get what you pay for...doesn&#x27;t blend well. Colors are not flattering or quality looking at all.</li>
            <li> I love them. The color goes on nice and stays on. I want to buy  me more :). I very nice colors</li>
            <li> So I must say I really love this palette. The colors are highly pigmented and go on gorgeously. All these reviewers claiming the positive reviews are fake should really stop,just because you did not like a product for whatever reason does not mean people who love it must have been paid. I am just a makeup lover that came across this product through a makeup vlogger doing a tutorial on youtube. The pictures do not do these blushes justice they are beautiful. I did not have trouble getting them on or experience any issues with them making me look like a clown. The packaging was excellent. It was triple bubble wrapped. I look forward to purchasing more products from Shany cosmetics. If anyone doubts the quality of Shany cosmetics  just look at makeup tutorials on youtube. Many vloggers use these products and you can see how great their blushes and eye shadows are.</li>
            <li> Great color payoff and great price. The pans are large and the colors in the picture are true to life. Perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> The colors look even better in person and the pigmentation is phenomenal. Becoming a huge SHANY fan! I must say that they go on very similar to MAC blushes. SO if you like MAC here is a cheap alternative!</li>
            <li> I love these! The shades are gorgeous and a little definitely goes a long way with these! The pigment is very vibrant and if used minimally they look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!! The colors on my screen looks very subtle and neutral. These colors are neutral but are much prettier in person! Goes on smooth and stays. The packaging was also agreeable, I received this product in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> These blushes are very pigmented! For a low price, these are worth the buy. Most blushes at this price aren’t pigmented like these are, and they last on your skin for hours. I only wish they were a little more blendable, but it is bearable.</li>
            <li> First off the package smells really bizarre. It smells like a factory and I didn&#x27;t want that smell on my face. The browns? They are reds. That was deceiving because I thought I could contour with it also. Appears not. And one of my pinks, it shattered! I opened it up one day and it was broken into tiny pieces! I never bring it with my it sits in my makeup drawer all day! It was so unexpected and don&#x27;t know why it just cracked! The blushes are very plain too, not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Unflattering and chalky.</li>
            <li> I am tanned medium olive skinned and the colors in this palette mesh well with my skintone. They are sheer enough for daytime, yet vibrant and not too overpowering. For a bolder look, simply reapply layers 2-3 times. The only downside are the ingredients. Contains parabens</li>
            <li> I love this blush palette but I felt it didnt come with enough blush it was so thin. But overall it was good !</li>
            <li> i love it its perfect</li>
            <li> It came nicely intact in slide paper cover case, no messy powder everywhere or anything like that. The black palette case is pretty stylish look. The rid closes with click so do not think it would accidental open in your purse or cosmetic pouch. Measurements of the palette is about 15 cm L x 10 cm W x 1 cm thick. All of them are slightly pearly but especially the bottom 3 colours look more pearly than the 3 on top to me. It gets on to brush nicely and easy to evens out on cheeks. Only thing you may want to be careful is that all colours look slightly darker in person than on the product image. It is still nice colour and did not bother me but if you really like the colour you see in the picture here then you may want to think about it or just be ready so no surprise when it comes.</li>
            <li> I hardly buy anything online because I like to see and test out the product before I purchase - especially when it comes to make up and clothes.  This was an impulse buy after realizing that I&#x27;ve been overusing one blush (MAC&#x27;s Melba) for months and needed a change.  I am really surprised at how much I love this palette.  The colors are beautiful and vibrant so you don&#x27;t need a lot of product, which means more bang for your buck.  If you do put on too much, it is extremely easy to blend out.  I would definitely buy this again and would recommend it to others who want quality makeup for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, i have chocolate skin and my bff has fair skin. these blush palettes looks beautiful on the both of us, i definitely recommenced this and will purchase again once it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li> I bought new makeup because my son broke it and this one comes broken will never  ever buy again! Waste of my money</li>
