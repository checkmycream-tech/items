            <li>The product is very good.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product on my legs for over 5 years and love it!!</li>
            <li>use a blow dryer to warm up the wax before you peel them apart!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product in perfect condition, very good quality.</li>
            <li>It works really good</li>
            <li>I will be continuing my search for a good waxing product.  </li>
            <li>Excellent to resolve quickly some hair problems</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>All in all, this product is DEFINITELY an amazing buy</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is really good, not TOO sticky like the cheap things you find at Walmart.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and comes with soothing wipes, too!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>IF you know how to wax correctly and don&#x27;t mind hurting yourself :)</li>
            <li>Im glad to find it here....</li>
            <li>Planning to order more.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this product because of all the good reviews, but it didn&#x27;t meet the hype.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and would probably work if u hadent shaved or waxed in forever.</li>
            <li>Definitely easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much of a hassle for me to do all the time, but it&#x27;s really good for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>I hope this was an isolated incident as I do enjoy the convenience of waxing at home.</li>
            <li>Oh, works great for facial hair too.</li>
            <li>Strips are large and the wax grips so much better than Sally Hanson.</li>
            <li>Veet is definitely just as good.</li>
            <li>This product is great and the only ready wax strips that work for me.</li>
            <li>I was so excited at the thought of not having to shave, so I read lots of positive reviews and then went out and bought some for myself.</li>
            <li>I warmed them up with my hair dryer for a few seconds instead of my hands to make sure that the wax was warm and that did nothing.</li>
            <li>i am extremely pleased with my purchase, it is better than expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wax, so you will realize there are parts of your legs that are more sensitive than others.</li>
            <li>You are better off using Nair or getting a professional waxing.</li>
            <li>For those of you who have had similar problems, i have found the best way to remove left over wax is by mixing some sugar and baby oil, gently scrubbing the wax off.</li>
            <li>Clean removal of hair, fast</li>
            <li>I liked that they were for sensitive skin, but I found the regular style at CVS and they have been working just fine.</li>
            <li>I usually cut the strips in half so that they are of a more manageable size and then use the hair dryer on them to get the wax nice and warm and melted.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product many times over the last couple of years.  </li>
            <li>but I have found that if you heat the strips well before pulling them apart it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Got stuck to my legs and had to remove by putting my legs in hot water and then removing by knife.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>It is a cheap alternative to going to the salon to get a wax job, but it will be more time consuming and i highly suggest reading the directions carefully.</li>
            <li>once it&#x27;s really *melted* and works better on legs, than on private areas.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use than the wax you spread on yourself.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>I just know that it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>This is the one of the bext ready to use wax strips I have used till now.</li>
            <li>I tried Sally Hansen, and it didn&#x27;t pull as much hair as Veet.</li>
            <li>well and waxing is much more smoother with not much hassle.</li>
            <li>I had to really work and scrub to get the remaining wax off</li>
            <li>I tried it three separate times before I could get it to remove any hair, and it did not remove nearly as much as it should have.</li>
            <li>I threw the whole thing away after on use.</li>
            <li>These strips are by far my favorite because I can remove 90% of the hair with only one strip.</li>
            <li>I was really skeptical about spending money on yet another thing that seemed to good to be true.  </li>
            <li>A quick once over with the blow dryer on low, pull them apart, and place where needed.  </li>
            <li>This particular Veet wax strips is ineffective.</li>
            <li>you have to use at least two wax strips for this to happen, that would involve a lot of expenses, specially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money!!</li>
            <li>Also, you can cut the larger strips with no hassle at all and do other areas, although it&#x27;s not recommended if you have sensitive skin, as when I did my upper lip, it hurt a lot more than my legs, and it was a bit more red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time, but I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding them recently, so I was definitely excited to be able to purchase them here.</li>
            <li>The box says to warm it up by rubbing it between your hands, but that is definitely not enough head, plus it can get messy!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they were just defective boxes or if the product has gone down in quality, but most of the strips didn&#x27;t actually heat up between my hands, so when I pulled them apart, the wax stuck to one side and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Make sure to pull HARD and FAST not in an upward motion, but back as though you were shaving or pulling the strip up towards your knee.  </li>
            <li>You can cut the peices to fit your needs and reuse them a few times.</li>
            <li>I found that a far easier way than rubbing the strips as suggested in the directions.  </li>
            <li>This is no where near it.</li>
            <li>I loved this product and its the only one that works for me ...tried sally hansen, nads and bunch of others with poor results..</li>
            <li>I had high hope for these since the box said they work well even for short hairs.</li>
            <li>Occasionally a couple of hairs get left behind but rarely, and easy to just tweeze those out.  </li>
            <li>I do have coarse, thick hair, and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s part of the problem.</li>
            <li>It barely even stings, but that is because it barely pulls any hair out!  </li>
            <li>Leaves more hairs than it takes out, and leaves sticky wax behind.</li>
            <li>Of course, nothing beats going to the salon, but these are so much less expensive and truly do a great job.     </li>
            <li>I am Australian and recently moved to the States and am very surprised that you can&#x27;t buy them in a store here....</li>
            <li>I have to say that I used the same brand for sensitive skin (the blue packaging), and I did not have any problem with it.</li>
            <li>I used it so many ways, but every time I got the same poor results.</li>
            <li>Each strip left a LOT of hair behind, no matter how many times I waxed the same area.</li>

            <li> Each strip left a LOT of hair behind, no matter how many times I waxed the same area.</li>
            <li> It pulled out maybe 10 single hairs and left a thick, sticky, wax residue on my leg that didn&#x27;t even come off in a hot shower.</li>
            <li> After I applied the one with more even wax on the strip and ripped it off, half the wax was stuck to my legs and fingers, and all the hair left behind!</li>
            <li> Scrubbing was not a fun job and left my legs red and irritated.</li>
            <li> This was frequently not the case.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time</li>
            <li> And of course, after you have warmed the entire strip in your hands, and after you have used one of the sheets, the other sheet has cooled off.  </li>
            <li> Either all wax was on one sheet, or only a small section of wax was left on one of the sheets.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to overuse the strips though, a couple of times i had problems with the wax sticking to my leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these strips for roughly 3-4 years now and am heartbroken that they are no longer sold in my area.</li>
            <li> Only this product (with the green packaging) did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Only takes half the hair nads works better too bad its so messy.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the other wax strips and depilatories and none work as well as Veet.  </li>
            <li> But I have used other waxing kits before, and they did work on my legs, so this brand is suboptimal.</li>
            <li> I have tried using other Veet wax strips for the legs</li>
            <li> I have tried other products too but none worked as well as the ones from this brand.</li>
            <li> and then I read the directions VERY carefully.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands of wax strips(Nads, Sally Hanson, etc,)when I could no longer find this at local stores, and they either didn&#x27;t work at all or left a lot of hair behind.</li>
            <li> Apparently, when they say there are 20 wax strips, they mean that when you pull apart the *10* wax strips, there should be wax on both sheets.</li>
            <li> Since all the other reviews for this product are so glowing, I was surprised by how poorly it preformed, so</li>
            <li> I have tried many wax stripes over several years and this is the worst of all.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re afraid at first, try to wax your knee/upper calf area.</li>
            <li> Not recommended unless you have really thick hair and not too long.</li>
            <li> We also tried leaving the strip on a little longer, but then the wax pulls off the paper and sticks to your skin.     </li>
            <li> and it includes little wipes that cleans all that sticky wax left-overs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning to try these strips, heres a few pointers:    </li>
            <li> Pulling apart the sheets resulted in wax being unevenly shredded across the \\&quot;two wax strips.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> the wipes are messy and do not help.</li>
            <li> were all dried up.</li>
            <li> Nasty stickiness afterwards no matter how careful I was, but for the cheapness of the item and the lil patches of hair i wanted out it was ok.</li>
            <li> And I followed the directions VERY carefully!!</li>
            <li> No matter how concisely I followed the directions I got very poor results.</li>
            <li> They hardly removed any hair and left wax behind.</li>
            <li> Usually I use Surgi-Wax but couldn&#x27;t find the Bikini Wax Strips.</li>
            <li> I usually use this for my underarms.</li>
            <li> I usually put the strips in front of a space heater for a minute or two loosening the wax on the strips before pulling them apart and waxing.</li>
            <li> This usually does the trick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame they are hard to find in this part of the world, in France they are #1.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and have had lots of trouble finding wax strips that work for me, but for some reason I thought this was it.</li>
            <li> The area that is post painful to me is near my ankle.    </li>
            <li> Our local stores stopped selling Veet and when I tried to purchase it online what I recieved was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> SUPER DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I hated these things, not only did it leave wax on me the wipes that come with it</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have wasted money on this crap.</li>
            <li> This is useless.</li>
            <li> I have tried Sally Hanson (disappointed), Nads (disappointed), as well as a couple generic brand waxes.</li>
            <li> Worse yet is that my box didn&#x27;t have the wipes in it!</li>
            <li> It was winter and im thinking that the product being in the cold weather made it unproductive.</li>
            <li> too bad they don&#x27;t sell Veet in my area.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible!!</li>
            <li> Ugh I&#x27;m SO disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Pathetic and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Worst experience ever!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time, but I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding them recently, so I was definitely excited to be able to purchase them here.

            <li> It is a cheap alternative to going to the salon to get a wax job, but it will be more time consuming and i highly suggest reading the directions carefully. You can cut the peices to fit your needs and reuse them a few times. It&#x27;s too much of a hassle for me to do all the time, but it&#x27;s really good for a special occasion. It&#x27;s much easier to use than the wax you spread on yourself. Just be careful not to overuse the strips though, a couple of times i had problems with the wax sticking to my leg.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the other wax strips and depilatories and none work as well as Veet.  Clean removal of hair, fast and it lasts for weeks.  Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that great. Nasty stickiness afterwards no matter how careful I was, but for the cheapness of the item and the lil patches of hair i wanted out it was ok.</li>
            <li> The product is very good. I bought it for my wife, and helped her using it. It worked very well.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about spending money on yet another thing that seemed to good to be true.  However, for around $11, I purchased the larger pack of 40 leg strips.  I read reviews before hand, so I learned the KEY tip:  use a blow dryer to warm up the wax before you peel them apart!  The box says to warm it up by rubbing it between your hands, but that is definitely not enough head, plus it can get messy!  A quick once over with the blow dryer on low, pull them apart, and place where needed.  The thing is, you must follow the directions:  rub the wax toward the direction of the hair growth, and wait about 30 seconds before pulling it off.  Make sure to pull HARD and FAST not in an upward motion, but back as though you were shaving or pulling the strip up towards your knee.  i hope that makes sense!  Also, you can cut the larger strips with no hassle at all and do other areas, although it&#x27;s not recommended if you have sensitive skin, as when I did my upper lip, it hurt a lot more than my legs, and it was a bit more red.  All in all, this product is DEFINITELY an amazing buy IF you know how to wax correctly and don&#x27;t mind hurting yourself :) [[ASIN:B004T3KJN2 VEET Ready-To-Use Wax Strips Hair Remover - Face: 20 Count]]</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my legs for over 5 years and love it!! I tried other brands of wax strips(Nads, Sally Hanson, etc,)when I could no longer find this at local stores, and they either didn&#x27;t work at all or left a lot of hair behind. The Veet strips grab even the shortest hairs and the soothing wipes help with any irritation. If you need premade wax strips these are the ones to get!</li>
            <li> This product is great and the only ready wax strips that work for me. It&#x27;s a shame they are hard to find in this part of the world, in France they are #1.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible!! I was so excited at the thought of not having to shave, so I read lots of positive reviews and then went out and bought some for myself. I got them at Walgreens for $8. I let my hair grow to a proper length for waxing and then I read the directions VERY carefully. And I followed the directions VERY carefully!! These things suck. They hardly removed any hair and left wax behind. So I had to wipe the spots I waxed with those wipes and now my calves look like they have razorburn! Ugh I&#x27;m SO disappointed!! I tried all kinds of tricks to get these things to work. I warmed them up with my hair dryer for a few seconds instead of my hands to make sure that the wax was warm and that did nothing. I tried everything. No matter how concisely I followed the directions I got very poor results. DO NOT waste your money!! Total rip off.</li>
            <li> Apparently, when they say there are 20 wax strips, they mean that when you pull apart the *10* wax strips, there should be wax on both sheets. This was frequently not the case. Either all wax was on one sheet, or only a small section of wax was left on one of the sheets. And of course, after you have warmed the entire strip in your hands, and after you have used one of the sheets, the other sheet has cooled off.  That issue aside, the wax just didn&#x27;t work well on my legs. Each strip left a LOT of hair behind, no matter how many times I waxed the same area. I do have coarse, thick hair, and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s part of the problem. But I have used other waxing kits before, and they did work on my legs, so this brand is suboptimal. I tried heating a strip in the microwave as one reviewer suggested, and it made no difference. These wax strips just don&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> i am extremely pleased with my purchase, it is better than expected. Fast shipping, product in perfect condition, very good quality. would recommend.</li>
            <li> Only takes half the hair nads works better too bad its so messy. This product is easy to use and would probably work if u hadent shaved or waxed in forever.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have wasted money on this crap. This particular Veet wax strips is ineffective. I have tried using other Veet wax strips for the legs and they work well but not this one. This is useless.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times over the last couple of years.  However, the two boxes I purchased were defective and did not peel apart properly and stuck to my skin.  It took two to three times the number of strips to do the job.  I hope this was an isolated incident as I do enjoy the convenience of waxing at home.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and its the only one that works for me ...tried sally hansen, nads and bunch of others with poor results.. Im glad to find it here....</li>
            <li> I had high hope for these since the box said they work well even for short hairs. I tried them on both my bikini and legs, I also had my boyfriend try it on me as well (he has warmer hands, I thought perhaps I hadn&#x27;t warmed the strip well enough).     It left about 1/2 the hair on my legs and didn&#x27;t work at all on the bikini zone. We also tried leaving the strip on a little longer, but then the wax pulls off the paper and sticks to your skin.     The finishing wipes also don&#x27;t seem to take away the sticky residue. Since all the other reviews for this product are so glowing, I was surprised by how poorly it preformed, so perhaps the box I had was defective in some way. I just know that it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> Use these all the time.  Work great!  Easy to use and comes with soothing wipes, too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and I love it!  Very easy to use.  I usually cut the strips in half so that they are of a more manageable size and then use the hair dryer on them to get the wax nice and warm and melted.  I found that a far easier way than rubbing the strips as suggested in the directions.  Occasionally a couple of hairs get left behind but rarely, and easy to just tweeze those out.  Will definitely continue to use.      I am Australian and recently moved to the States and am very surprised that you can&#x27;t buy them in a store here.... but thankfully I can get them through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product because of all the good reviews, but it didn&#x27;t meet the hype. I have very thick curly hair and have had lots of trouble finding wax strips that work for me, but for some reason I thought this was it. It only removed about 60% of the hair from my underarms, and that was after going over them twice. I guess the search continues.</li>
            <li> This is the one of the bext ready to use wax strips I have used till now. One of my friends recommended it and I am very happy with it. Planning to order more.</li>
            <li> Strips are large and the wax grips so much better than Sally Hanson. Usually I use Surgi-Wax but couldn&#x27;t find the Bikini Wax Strips. Veet is definitely just as good.</li>
            <li> Excellent to resolve quickly some hair problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these strips for roughly 3-4 years now and am heartbroken that they are no longer sold in my area. I have tried Sally Hanson (disappointed), Nads (disappointed), as well as a couple generic brand waxes. Of course, nothing beats going to the salon, but these are so much less expensive and truly do a great job.     If you&#x27;re planning to try these strips, heres a few pointers:    *Always shower and exfoliate before waxing!!! I use a loofah on my legs 2 days in a row beforehand just in case    *It&#x27;s wax, so you will realize there are parts of your legs that are more sensitive than others. If you&#x27;re afraid at first, try to wax your knee/upper calf area. The area that is post painful to me is near my ankle.    I would truly recommend trying these.</li>
            <li> Our local stores stopped selling Veet and when I tried to purchase it online what I recieved was disappointing.  It was winter and im thinking that the product being in the cold weather made it unproductive.</li>
            <li> Works well for me! I usually use this for my underarms. I would definitely buy it again! I tried Sally Hansen, and it didn&#x27;t pull as much hair as Veet. too bad they don&#x27;t sell Veet in my area. Oh, works great for facial hair too.</li>
            <li> These wax strips work well once you use them several times and get the hang of it. I agree that the wax sticks to the body or the paper but I have found that if you heat the strips well before pulling them apart it works pretty well. I usually put the strips in front of a space heater for a minute or two loosening the wax on the strips before pulling them apart and waxing. This usually does the trick well and waxing is much more smoother with not much hassle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good, not TOO sticky like the cheap things you find at Walmart. Definitely easy to use and it includes little wipes that cleans all that sticky wax left-overs. It works really good once it&#x27;s really *melted* and works better on legs, than on private areas.</li>
            <li> Pathetic and disgusting. Got stuck to my legs and had to remove by putting my legs in hot water and then removing by knife. Worst experience ever! &gt;.&lt;</li>
            <li> The only pro to this product is how un-messy it is.  It barely even stings, but that is because it barely pulls any hair out!  I could only get one use out of each strip.  By the 2nd it didn&#x27;t pull out any hair.  There is no way you could do the job with one box.  Especially since on go over doesn&#x27;t get all the hair.  My hair was with-in the recommended length.  I followed the directions.  Oh, and the finishing wipes?  A joke!  I had to really work and scrub to get the remaining wax off and it left my hands and leg feeling so oily!  I will be continuing my search for a good waxing product.  This is no where near it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many wax stripes over several years and this is the worst of all.  I used it so many ways, but every time I got the same poor results. The wax sticks to everything but the wax paper itself, so the entire wax remains on your skin, after you pull the paper.   I have to say that I used the same brand for sensitive skin (the blue packaging), and I did not have any problem with it. Only this product (with the green packaging) did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Pulling apart the sheets resulted in wax being unevenly shredded across the \\&quot;two wax strips.\\&quot; After I applied the one with more even wax on the strip and ripped it off, half the wax was stuck to my legs and fingers, and all the hair left behind! Worse yet is that my box didn&#x27;t have the wipes in it! Scrubbing was not a fun job and left my legs red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly and it did not work. I tried it three separate times before I could get it to remove any hair, and it did not remove nearly as much as it should have. It pulled out maybe 10 single hairs and left a thick, sticky, wax residue on my leg that didn&#x27;t even come off in a hot shower. I had to SCRUB and SCRUB! Shaving is easier than this! Stay away from this product. You are better off using Nair or getting a professional waxing. SUPER DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Used this product for legs and underarm hair. Leaves more hairs than it takes out, and leaves sticky wax behind. the wipes are messy and do not help. For those of you who have had similar problems, i have found the best way to remove left over wax is by mixing some sugar and baby oil, gently scrubbing the wax off. The sugar removes the wax and the baby oil prevents irritation and soothes the skin.</li>
            <li> I hated these things, not only did it leave wax on me the wipes that come with it were all dried up. I threw the whole thing away after on use.</li>
            <li> This product does the job!  Saves me money on going to the salon for waxing.</li>
            <li> These strips are by far my favorite because I can remove 90% of the hair with only one strip. I have tried other products too but none worked as well as the ones from this brand.</li>
            <li> I did not like it because It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair in the selected area. you have to use at least two wax strips for this to happen, that would involve a lot of expenses, specially if you have fine hair. Not recommended unless you have really thick hair and not too long.</li>
