            <li> JUST WHAT WE WANTED!&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AGAIN, BRAD</li>
            <li> I returned the balance of the product with no difficulty. Felt gooey in my mouth and was difficult to clean out once the partial was removed. My dentist said this type of product often cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Best denture adhesive out there. Too bad it is in such short supply and so expensive at the moment.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy this size in the local stores anymore.  Full-size tubes are too big for my Wrangler pockets.</li>
            <li> For a friend, and she said it holds great.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use. And works great. I have a new partial and eating was becoming a problem. Not anymore :)</li>

            <li> This stuff is great and really holds partials in place for a long time.</li>
            <li> The is a pretty good product, but the adhesive does not last all day.  I find that I often have to reapply during the latter part of the day especially before dinnertime.  Because I have a hard time finding this product in my area, I ordered it from Amazon.  There are 12 tubes in the lot, but the tubes are half the size of what is sold in stores.</li>
            <li> Was why better then I expected to be, will buy again</li>
