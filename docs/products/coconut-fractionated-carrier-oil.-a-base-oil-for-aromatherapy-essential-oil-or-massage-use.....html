    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells awesome feels fresh</li>
            <li> My opthamologist suggested using coconut oil as a makeup remover. Well, I tried it, but it&#x27;s not working for me. No matter what I manage to get some in my eye and that does not feel good at all. So, now I use it as a skin moisturizer and a pre-shampoo hair conditioner. Skin - okay. Hair - makes it softer.</li>
            <li> Arrived leaking. Lid was not on well, probably lost at least half an ounce or more.</li>
            <li> Purchased to use with Essential Oils.  It meets my need.</li>
            <li> I love the fact this oil has no scent. It has many uses and I thought the price was reasonable. Many thanks.</li>
            <li> The lid is designed badly. It leaks all over the bottle when you use it. Other than that, it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> It absorbed really well into the skin but it produced an odd smell. It made the skin smell kind of like copper. I tried blending it with different essential oils but there was always an odd underlying smell.</li>
            <li> This is Great Coconut oil ,I use this at night on my face than I put a face cream over it ,in the morning my face is so soft and smooth with nice coloring I look more alert! I also use on my hands at night than put soft gloves on leaves my hands  soft .This Fractionated oil has no scent and is great for many uses .This last a while don&#x27;t need a whole lot ,love it and will order again.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Use it as carrier oil. But container is horrible for dispensing. Messy. Oil leaks out after closing when using the pop top. I&#x27;ve started transferring to a smaller container with an eye drop dispenser.  If not for that, it would have 5 stars from me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Essential Oils and chose the coconut carrier oil to mix with the essential oils. I have not have any issues using this oil. It is a decent size bottle and I am still using it nearly 5 months later. No issues here. Great price and generous quantity,</li>
            <li> I am brand new to essential oils. My order was processed and shipped quickly. The lid was taped shut to prevent spillage. I am very happy with my product.</li>
            <li> I recently have started using essential oils and I purchased this fractionated coconut oil in order to use it as a carrier oil for things like room sprays, insect sprays and just to apply oils to the skin with. It is perfect! Great quality and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This has worked great as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  It doesn&#x27;t have all of the health benefits of solid Coconut Oil, but is great at what it was designed to do.  It absorbs quickly, has very little scent, and will last a long time without going rancid.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in my diffuser. Maybe it&#x27;s me but, there wasn&#x27;t much smell and certainly not when I put it in my diffuser. I would not suggest this product or purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Smooth and easy to use!</li>
            <li> No scent what so ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a carrier oil with my essential oils. It goes on and feels so nice. My only complaint is that the oil leaks out from the cap threads down the sides of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The price is actually very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great essential oil.  I use Coconut Fractionated oil as a base for different essential oils to take care of my lymphedema after bilateral mastectomy.  Coconut oil is my favorite.  This one is organic and has no carcinogenics.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite carrier oil. It was packed safely so no leaking (which is what I worried about). I will buy again!</li>
            <li> The coconut essence  oil did not give or a strong coconut sent as I thought it would. As an example when I use lavender oil in my soaps, I only put a few drops in and it&#x27;s a nice strong lavender smell. This particular coconut oil did not have a strong sent to it at all, it was very vague.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this would have a strong coconut scent.  But it doesn&#x27;t have any hint of coconut smell.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am new to using Essential Oils and needed/wanted a carrier oil to use with mine. This was one of the best reviewed/affordable ones that I came across in my searches. The Coconut Oil is scentless &amp; non-greasy. It leaves your skin feeling soft &amp; smooth. So far, I am quite pleased with it and would recommend it. The 4 oz size bottle the perfect size for someone just getting into Essential Oils use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update - I&#x27;ve tried Sweet Almond Oil as a carrier oil since writing this review, but this Fractionated Coconut Oil is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The bottle says 4 fl. Oz but there is no way that is true. I was able to dump the entire contents of this bottle into a 3 ounce container.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain or write a bad review, (as I should read what I am purchasing). Thought I was purchasing the the fragrant oil not a base.</li>
            <li> Has NO scent! I was unaware &amp;#34;Fractionated&amp;#34; meant it was unscented.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just oil no scent of coconut</li>
            <li> The oil itself was service, but the packaging is awful. The oil leaked from the cap and, when it was accidently knocked over while shut, the bottle emptied itself entirely into my carpet.</li>
            <li> The oily is nice but has absolutely no scent at all.</li>
            <li> It ran all over inside the envelope and was a total mess when it got here. The top was not on tight enough even though it was taped down. The oil worked the tape loose and I ended up losing a lot of it. I want a refund but they want me to return it. That is not going to happen. It&#x27;s a greasy mess.</li>
