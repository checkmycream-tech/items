            <li> * say &amp;#34;For Normal and Dry Hair.&amp;#34; I had been using Garnier&#x27;s Daily Care shampoo, but it&#x27;s no longer available with Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a big difference in how fast my hair gets that greasy feeling.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ok was not impressed that it had the little plastic balls in it.  </li>

            <li> Use &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; and the price is less than both Walmart and Target, and you never need to worry about running low.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s dyed there hair or uses harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It also has some sort of pumice like crystals, not sure how that is supposed to help.</li>

            <li> Really does give your hair body.  Great in a pinch.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but I won&#x27;t be ordering the shampoo/condition again.  Will buy something different after these are gone.</li>
            <li> Second week of trying this. Produces lots of suds in my thick, curly hair and leaves it feeling clean and with good body. Hydra doesn&#x27;t leave the residue that Garnier Triple Nutrition shampoo left on my hair. Note: The bottle says &amp;#34;For Dry Hair.&amp;#34; It does *not* say &amp;#34;For Normal and Dry Hair.&amp;#34; I had been using Garnier&#x27;s Daily Care shampoo, but it&#x27;s no longer available with Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save. Hdra Recharge is a good substitute.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  I was a longtime Pantene user and felt like my hair was getting that greasy, weighted down feeling to quickly. This feels like it strips all the product out and really cleans well.  I have also noticed a big difference in how fast my hair gets that greasy feeling.  Definitely going to continue using this.</li>
            <li> Shampoo smells great. The only problem I had was that the bottle was leaking out shampoo. The little stick part that is usually there to stop and close the bottle was broken off. I guess that&#x27;s why I received it wrapped with a plastic bag. So my bottle doesn&#x27;t close which is a little annoying but I&#x27;ll receive a new shipment next month. Hopefully that bottle won&#x27;t be damaged.</li>
            <li> and Garnier supports TerraCycle! KUDOS!</li>
            <li> I started using this last fall. I was determined not to go through another winter with fly away hair. This shampoo and conditioner did the trick. No more electric head;-)</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s dyed there hair or uses harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells wonderful and cleans my scalp well. It works better with my curly than most shampoos and helps reduce frizz. It comes in a huge container that will probably last me at least a year at the rate I use shampoo.</li>
            <li> Lathers ok, cleans well, but I don&#x27;t see how it hydrates. Leaves hair squeaky clean, but I needed conditioner. Not the hydrating solution I&#x27;d hoped for.  It also has some sort of pumice like crystals, not sure how that is supposed to help.</li>
            <li> Pretty good value for the size and price. I like this stuff because I can have it in my bathroom and my girlfriend can use it too. I can&#x27;t say the same about the &amp;#34;Axe 2 and 1 Shampoo&amp;#34; that used to grace the corner of my shower and to quote my lady friend, &amp;#34;smells like a frathouse and removed every bit of life from my once supple and graceful locks of hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Keep this in your shower if you want women to possibly shower with you. Giggity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok was not impressed that it had the little plastic balls in it.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Use it for myself and the kids.  Smells and cleans great!</li>
            <li> Loved the way it cleaned my hair</li>
            <li> Have had nothing but satisfactory results from this shampoo.  Would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who needs to deal with dryness.</li>
            <li> Use this stuff on my hair every three months! It puts the moisture back in my hair!</li>
            <li> Product works well for me-dry curly hair- and for my daughter-normal straight long hair. I use the matching conditioner, sometimes adding it to my wet after shampoo hair resulting in large soft curls. My daughter&#x27;s long hair no longer has the splint-end look, has a soft cut line. We get these looks without special hair cuts. Amazon&#x27;s cost is the same as Target&#x27;s. Use &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; and the price is less than both Walmart and Target, and you never need to worry about running low.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Love how it feels and smells while I&#x27;m washing and after I rinse.</li>
            <li> Love all of FRUCTIS&#x27;s products.  I love how it cleans and smells.  I have used their products for over 10 to 15 years.</li>
            <li> I like how this shampoo makes my hair feel. It feels clean and nourished and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it cleans my hair without drying out too much.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy!  Great shampoo for dry hair.</li>
