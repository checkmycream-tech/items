            <li>Again, I love it!</li>
            <li>I decided I liked how it looked.</li>
            <li>The dryer styling is androgynous and I liked that.</li>
            <li>So far the hair dryer has worked great!  </li>
            <li>However, it appears that this is the latest fad in hair dryers, and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that looked suitable without ionization.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>but this FHD one is much better.</li>

            <li>This FHI dryer is SO MUCH BETTER -</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Looking at all the great reviews about this hair dryer, i decided to buy it to replace my older one.</li>
            <li>The weight and balance is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This was so worth the money!!</li>
            <li>T3 Pro was better than the cheap hair dryers I used before</li>
            <li>One of the biggest benefits that I did not expect is that even when the blow dryer is on its highest setting, the sound it makes is more like a whirl than a high-pitched scream.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels silky smooth after blow drying, even without using product.</li>
            <li>It was fast and I loved the way my hair felt after I was finished...</li>
            <li>The dryer dries my hair very quickly.  </li>
            <li>With T3 Pro you had to hold the cool shot botton, I like this much better.</li>
            <li>and it does have a lot of power and gets nice and hot</li>
            <li>It works fine, haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>AND it is light weight, easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>I KNOW THE ELECTRIC SOCKETS ARE FINE.</li>
            <li>The volume of air generated is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge improvement over the 30</li>
            <li>I am still not savvy, but this hair dryer has made a huge difference in the outcome.  </li>
            <li>I GUESS CHEAPLY MADE</li>
            <li>This is the first hair dryer of this type that I have purchased, and I absolutely love it.    </li>
            <li>And, most of the time I don&#x27;t need to use the flat iron afterwards because the texture is so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It also functions great, I can blow dry a faux hawk and it will stay without product.</li>
            <li>The cool shot botton does not need holding.</li>
            <li>I do like the cool air option to set my curls.</li>
            <li>My thumb accidentally hits the cool jet button often, if you want to split hairs.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and am now able to get the volume without all the frizz.</li>
            <li>cool.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought this blow dryer for my wife because I wanted her to have a good blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The unit produces a lot of heat, and it does so quickly.  </li>
            <li>The cord length is quite adequate.  </li>
            <li>Received this hair dryer yesterday in great condition, i tested the cool shot and all yesterday for less than 5 minutues.</li>
            <li>Also, as I mentioned before it does have a lot of power and gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>very thick, wavy hair &amp; this dryer is perfect</li>
            <li>However, when I want it  straight, it also leaves it shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>(as opposed to just hot &amp; cool on the Chi)</li>
            <li>The blowdryer provides a tremendous amount of air and heat, almost to the point of being too hot sometimes.  </li>
            <li>The temp control gives you the right amount of heat and air.    </li>
            <li>I love the long cord so that I can move around freely, if needed.  </li>
            <li>Also, it dries in half the time of a regular dryer - excellent.</li>
            <li>I have a long shag like hair cut and want it curly which this hair dryer nicely does.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and very quiet without that high pitched whine that many hair dryers have.   </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is FAST and HOT!</li>
            <li>For this kind of money, I really expected it to stay out of the landfill longer than a year.</li>
            <li>So after reading all the great reviews, I decided to try it, despite the smattering of negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>and I thought maybe I&#x27;d see more of a difference next summer when it&#x27;s humid out than I am seeing now.  </li>
            <li>However, you do need to keep moving it to avoid getting any one area too hot.</li>
            <li>Light and powerful yet very quiet.  </li>
            <li>It requires less drying time because it is so much more powerful and efficient.</li>
            <li>My hair is almost frizz-free after using this, dries fast.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair using this as opposed to the $18 dryer I had been using.</li>
            <li>I have medium length, straight hair.   </li>
            <li>, we really aren&#x27;t \\&quot;a bunch of</li>
            <li>The dryer meets my goal of reduced noise very well.</li>
            <li>The controls are straight forward once you take the time to look them over.  </li>
            <li>That is where I really noticed the differences.  </li>
            <li>My gf likes this dryer so much that when she moved in she threw hers out.</li>
            <li>me - AMAZON should be responsible for what they allow on their site.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t see that much improvement in the look or feel of my hair and believe me, I have hair that needs improvement</li>
            <li>Thank you so much,</li>
            <li>She would take almost an hour getting her hair ready and the whole house sounded like a screaming engine.</li>
            <li>have very curly hair</li>
            <li>Nowhere near silent, but not the screaming, screeching, hearing loss creating beast most of us have come to expect as the norm.  </li>
            <li>I accidentally lower the setting due to my fingers knocking into the somewhat ill-placed buttons while gripping the handle.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really dry my hair any faster nor does it make my hair look any better than my old $15.00 dryer.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super heavy, but isn&#x27;t light as a feather either.</li>
            <li>I quickly off the power plug and let the hair dryer cool down.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fine highlighted blonde with a bit of a natural kink/curl</li>
            <li>- I can get extra zzzz&#x27;s in the AM because it&#x27;s so quick.</li>
            <li>I was excited to stumble across this one after trying a couple from</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer for anyone with a \\&quot;high maintenance\\&quot; situation.  </li>
            <li>this little sucker can smooth out the unruliest of  hair,  and give fine limp hair great body  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair so much faster than my old school dryer.</li>
            <li>In short, it was worth the money</li>
            <li>No practical (reasonable weight/affordable) hair dryer is going to produce large volumes of hot air silently, but the noise is dramatically less than that of most hair dryers, including some that claim to be \\&quot;low</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great hairdryer and if you have only purchased drug store hairdryers in the past then i guarantee you that the FHI won&#x27;t dissapoint.    </li>
            <li>I LIVE IN A NEW HOME</li>
            <li>Just remember, if the dryer isn&#x27;t getting hot, check the blue button.    </li>
            <li>I had purchased a similar dryer for my daughter for Christmas at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>ONLY PROBLEM IS WHEN IT GETS REALLY HOT</li>
            <li>My hair stylist suggested I get the bigger (more expensive) model that she uses in the salon, but I feel like this has plenty of power for me, and my hair dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It *was* a great dryer -- mercifully quieter and less whiny, powerful, just as described -- but the heating element broke at 13 months, and now it&#x27;s just cold air, which doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>I had never heard of this brand before but generally always invest in blowdryers on the higher price range in order to get a commercial salon quality.  </li>
            <li>and a bit longer (with the nozzle on)than my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>(oops, did I say that out loud?)    </li>
            <li>I purchased this blow dryer nearly 8 months ago</li>
            <li>Cord is a little too long for my needs, better suited for hair stylists.</li>
            <li>The dryer has three options for heat: cold air, warm, and hot.</li>
            <li>What I am saying is that there is a high and low setting for the fan</li>
            <li>In short, I highly recommend this blowdryer.</li>
            <li>I really like that the cord is very long.  </li>
            <li>I do travel at least once a month, and it does take up a more room than my last folding dryer.     </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length very thick, very curly hair - yet at the same time, each strand of hair is fine.  </li>
            <li>I like a longish cord as much as the next person, but this one is just too long.</li>
            <li>I use the medium setting to set my curls with the diffuser and the time spent on my hair has pretty much been cut in half.     </li>
            <li>I have damaged color-treated hair and with this dryer it comes out so much smoother than a regular dryer - I don&#x27;t have to flat iron anymore, which will save me further damage.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy that it has a cold-push button, you don&#x27;t have to hold the button down like most blow dryers, just push to turn on cold, and push to turn off.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I cannot give the same enthusiastic reviews as others.  </li>
            <li>Only two negatives that I have is that the cord is super long, assuming that is because it is a salon based blow dryer; it is not very light weight.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that after a few months of using this blowdryer (approximately 3 times a week), I am thrilled with the blowdryer so far.  </li>
            <li>It seems that the motor mechanism simply isn&#x27;t needing to try to hard to get the same (or more) quantity of air through it than a conventional blow dryer.     </li>
            <li>In other words, since I dry my hair at least 4 times a week, it&#x27;s one of the most used appliances in my home.</li>
            <li>but it also turns down the heat even though you have a separate high, medium and low heat setting.  </li>

            <li> For this kind of money, I really expected it to stay out of the landfill longer than a year.</li>
            <li> So after reading all the great reviews, I decided to try it, despite the smattering of negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I thought maybe I&#x27;d see more of a difference next summer when it&#x27;s humid out than I am seeing now.  </li>
            <li> However, you do need to keep moving it to avoid getting any one area too hot.</li>
            <li> Light and powerful yet very quiet.  </li>
            <li> It requires less drying time because it is so much more powerful and efficient.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost frizz-free after using this, dries fast.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair using this as opposed to the $18 dryer I had been using.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, straight hair.   </li>
            <li> , we really aren&#x27;t \\&quot;a bunch of</li>
            <li> The dryer meets my goal of reduced noise very well.</li>
            <li> The controls are straight forward once you take the time to look them over.  </li>
            <li> That is where I really noticed the differences.  </li>
            <li> My gf likes this dryer so much that when she moved in she threw hers out.</li>
            <li> me - AMAZON should be responsible for what they allow on their site.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t see that much improvement in the look or feel of my hair and believe me, I have hair that needs improvement</li>
            <li> Thank you so much,</li>
            <li> She would take almost an hour getting her hair ready and the whole house sounded like a screaming engine.</li>
            <li> have very curly hair</li>
            <li> Nowhere near silent, but not the screaming, screeching, hearing loss creating beast most of us have come to expect as the norm.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally lower the setting due to my fingers knocking into the somewhat ill-placed buttons while gripping the handle.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really dry my hair any faster nor does it make my hair look any better than my old $15.00 dryer.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t super heavy, but isn&#x27;t light as a feather either.</li>
            <li> I quickly off the power plug and let the hair dryer cool down.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fine highlighted blonde with a bit of a natural kink/curl</li>
            <li> - I can get extra zzzz&#x27;s in the AM because it&#x27;s so quick.</li>
            <li> I was excited to stumble across this one after trying a couple from</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer for anyone with a \\&quot;high maintenance\\&quot; situation.  </li>
            <li> this little sucker can smooth out the unruliest of  hair,  and give fine limp hair great body  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair so much faster than my old school dryer.</li>
            <li> In short, it was worth the money</li>
            <li> No practical (reasonable weight/affordable) hair dryer is going to produce large volumes of hot air silently, but the noise is dramatically less than that of most hair dryers, including some that claim to be \\&quot;low</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great hairdryer and if you have only purchased drug store hairdryers in the past then i guarantee you that the FHI won&#x27;t dissapoint.    </li>
            <li> I LIVE IN A NEW HOME</li>
            <li> Just remember, if the dryer isn&#x27;t getting hot, check the blue button.    </li>
            <li> I had purchased a similar dryer for my daughter for Christmas at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> ONLY PROBLEM IS WHEN IT GETS REALLY HOT</li>
            <li> My hair stylist suggested I get the bigger (more expensive) model that she uses in the salon, but I feel like this has plenty of power for me, and my hair dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It *was* a great dryer -- mercifully quieter and less whiny, powerful, just as described -- but the heating element broke at 13 months, and now it&#x27;s just cold air, which doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> I had never heard of this brand before but generally always invest in blowdryers on the higher price range in order to get a commercial salon quality.  </li>
            <li> and a bit longer (with the nozzle on)than my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> (oops, did I say that out loud?)    </li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer nearly 8 months ago</li>
            <li> Cord is a little too long for my needs, better suited for hair stylists.</li>
            <li> The dryer has three options for heat: cold air, warm, and hot.</li>
            <li> What I am saying is that there is a high and low setting for the fan</li>
            <li> In short, I highly recommend this blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I really like that the cord is very long.  </li>
            <li> I do travel at least once a month, and it does take up a more room than my last folding dryer.     </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length very thick, very curly hair - yet at the same time, each strand of hair is fine.  </li>
            <li> I like a longish cord as much as the next person, but this one is just too long.</li>
            <li> I use the medium setting to set my curls with the diffuser and the time spent on my hair has pretty much been cut in half.     </li>
            <li> I have damaged color-treated hair and with this dryer it comes out so much smoother than a regular dryer - I don&#x27;t have to flat iron anymore, which will save me further damage.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy that it has a cold-push button, you don&#x27;t have to hold the button down like most blow dryers, just push to turn on cold, and push to turn off.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot give the same enthusiastic reviews as others.  </li>
            <li> Only two negatives that I have is that the cord is super long, assuming that is because it is a salon based blow dryer; it is not very light weight.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that after a few months of using this blowdryer (approximately 3 times a week), I am thrilled with the blowdryer so far.  </li>
            <li> It seems that the motor mechanism simply isn&#x27;t needing to try to hard to get the same (or more) quantity of air through it than a conventional blow dryer.     </li>
            <li> In other words, since I dry my hair at least 4 times a week, it&#x27;s one of the most used appliances in my home.</li>
            <li> but it also turns down the heat even though you have a separate high, medium and low heat setting.  </li>
            <li> If I ever find a low noise, high quality dryer that does not have this ill advised \\&quot;feature\\&quot; I will buy it and retire this dryer for travel and guest use, or perhaps give it to one of my more vexatious relatives whose skin needs a little aging.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews here, I decided to buy this dryer even though it was far more expensive than any other hair dryer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Unlike other user&#x27;s comment, it is not heavy, nor big at all.</li>
            <li> and it only takes minutes to dry anyway.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I wished I could change is the air output - it is too high and cannot be adjusted down without turning the heat down too.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair, used it roughly 3-4 minutes 4-5 days a week.  </li>
            <li> I want to qualify this review with the fact that I am not a professional hairstylist.</li>
            <li> With the amount of air that this blowdryer generates, it does take a somewhat shorter amount of time to fully dry my long hair.  </li>
            <li> Mine just gets dry.    </li>
            <li> and I can dry and straighten all of it in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have dry, wavy hair that&#x27;s about medium thickness.</li>
            <li> so I HAVE to blow dry it every day.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every day and the sometimes my hair can&#x27;t hold up to the heat.</li>
            <li> The Chi blowdryer is lighter and the air velocity is less but with the same heat.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I straighten my hair using a big barrel brush usually followed by a CHI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little foolish to take anti-oxidant vitamins and then regularly expose yourself to a stream of ionized air.  </li>
            <li> In a pinch, four minutes to go from a 8 or 9 to a 2 on the wet scale, although that involves no styling.</li>
            <li> So I need a lot of heat to dry my hair, but the heat required is very harsh on the overall health of my hair because of the fineness.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a little long</li>
            <li> Unlike every other hair dryer I have ever used, this is not a momentary \\&quot;push and release\\&quot; control.  </li>
            <li> So DISAPPOINTED with this product, had my hopes held high and end up with a short lifespan of only 1 DAY .</li>
            <li> I WISH THERE WAS A WAY WE COULD REALLY TELL IF THE ELECTRONICS WERE FAKE.</li>
            <li> I hate drying my hair, so even though it is pricey, I figured I would use it more.</li>
            <li> If I could have adjusted the air down without adjusting the heat I would have given this dryer a 5 rating.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer hasn&#x27;t changed my hair dramatically, but it cuts down on my time drying and softens my hair some.</li>
            <li> My previous blow dryer was T3 Pro and broke down after 18 months</li>
            <li> My hair dries in half the time.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a slight heavier  </li>
            <li> Forget all the ridiculous snake oil claims, misuse of technical language, made up gobblydegook, obfuscation and hype.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and really thick.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use my flat iron to tame everything - which is music to my hair stylist&#x27;s ears!!  </li>
            <li> Also, the dryer seems a little heavy</li>
            <li> The only thing which may trip you up is the blue \\&quot;cold air\\&quot; button.  </li>
            <li> I use this with a \\&quot;Thermal Round Brush with Nylon Bristles\\&quot; by Brushlab.</li>
            <li> Sort of heavy for me too.</li>
            <li> BUT a few days ago, the heat element went out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and after going to the hair cutter and having my hair blow dried</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy to hold either, although once in awhile</li>
            <li> I use a round brush and then usually straighten it.</li>
            <li> One star deducted for excessive quantities of snake oil.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money !</li>
            <li> IM NOT SURE.</li>
            <li> I used to spend 20+ bucks a month on wax/gel, now I don&#x27;t hardly use any.</li>
            <li> I have not had the product stop working nor had the cold problem that others talked about (although the latter could be because I had been warned in advance from other reviews about the cold shock button that had to be clicked on and off and therefore knew to do this).  </li>
            <li> dumb broads\\&quot;, so cut it out, and show some respect for your customers.]    </li>
            <li> On a sleepy morning, this can leave you wondering what in the heck is wrong with your expensive hair dryer, only to discover, to your chagrin, that the cold air button has been inadvertently engaged.  </li>
            <li> Previous review mentioned that the button control location is bad, but I have never mistakenly hit any button and haven&#x27;t had that problem.</li>
            <li> : when I received the hair dryer and started using it, I thought it was broken because it would blow cold air.</li>
            <li> I borrowed a friends expensive hair dryer while visiting</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> I hate to write a negative review, but I&#x27;d want you to tell me.</li>
            <li> You push it once to turn it to cold, and again to return it to heated mode.  </li>
            <li> Now the settings are cold, colder and coldest.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  My hair dries in half the time.  Hair is silky and shiny.  The only cons are ...it&#x27;s a slight heavier  and a bit longer (with the nozzle on)than my old hair dryer.  It will just take a bit of time to get used to. Overall I would recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Great product! My hair is long and really thick. My previous blow dryer was T3 Pro and broke down after 18 months and I sent it to the customer service. T3 Pro was better than the cheap hair dryers I used before but this FHD one is much better. I use this with a \\&quot;Thermal Round Brush with Nylon Bristles\\&quot; by Brushlab. My hair is almost frizz-free after using this, dries fast. The cool shot botton does not need holding. With T3 Pro you had to hold the cool shot botton, I like this much better.</li>
            <li> I hate to write a negative review, but I&#x27;d want you to tell me. It *was* a great dryer -- mercifully quieter and less whiny, powerful, just as described -- but the heating element broke at 13 months, and now it&#x27;s just cold air, which doesn&#x27;t do much.  For this kind of money, I really expected it to stay out of the landfill longer than a year. I have short hair, used it roughly 3-4 minutes 4-5 days a week.  I guess it&#x27;s back to the $20-$30 models that last longer.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews here, I decided to buy this dryer even though it was far more expensive than any other hair dryer I have ever had. It&#x27;s worth every penny. I have damaged color-treated hair and with this dryer it comes out so much smoother than a regular dryer - I don&#x27;t have to flat iron anymore, which will save me further damage. Also, it dries in half the time of a regular dryer - excellent.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair using this as opposed to the $18 dryer I had been using. It works fine, haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. I do like the cool air option to set my curls. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the cord length. I like a longish cord as much as the next person, but this one is just too long.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer that I have ever had.  The temp control gives you the right amount of heat and air.    It is comfortable to hold and very quiet without that high pitched whine that many hair dryers have.   I have a long shag like hair cut and want it curly which this hair dryer nicely does. However, when I want it  straight, it also leaves it shiny and smooth.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unlike other user&#x27;s comment, it is not heavy, nor big at all. It is just perfect, and working wonderfully. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference drying my hair.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I have very thin hair and it only takes minutes to dry anyway.  Sort of heavy for me too.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair so much faster than my old school dryer. I do my hair more often as a result. In a pinch, four minutes to go from a 8 or 9 to a 2 on the wet scale, although that involves no styling. I have medium length, straight hair.   My thumb accidentally hits the cool jet button often, if you want to split hairs. The button stays depressed until you click it again.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I want to qualify this review with the fact that I am not a professional hairstylist. I use it every day and just love it. The dryer has three options for heat: cold air, warm, and hot. Previous review mentioned that the button control location is bad, but I have never mistakenly hit any button and haven&#x27;t had that problem. I have very curly hair and am now able to get the volume without all the frizz. Highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Forget all the ridiculous snake oil claims, misuse of technical language, made up gobblydegook, obfuscation and hype.  It is a reflection of the condescending and demeaning attitude hair dryer manufacturers have towards their customers.  Techno-quackery aside, this hair dryer will not make your hair into radiant spun gold, or get you the lead role in the broadway rendition of \\&quot;Tangled\\&quot;. And \\&quot;FHI Nano-Fuzelon\\&quot; is best translated as \\&quot;these people will believe anything\\&quot;.  Well, I know horse cobbles when I see them.  [Note to manufacturers, we really aren&#x27;t \\&quot;a bunch of dumb broads\\&quot;, so cut it out, and show some respect for your customers.]    All of that said, I was looking for a quiet, solidly made hair dryer.  I did not want to purchase an ionizing hair dryer as ionized air ages your skin and damages cells.  It seems a little foolish to take anti-oxidant vitamins and then regularly expose yourself to a stream of ionized air.  However, it appears that this is the latest fad in hair dryers, and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that looked suitable without ionization.  My only hope is that the level of ionization produced by this unit is very low.  If I ever find a low noise, high quality dryer that does not have this ill advised \\&quot;feature\\&quot; I will buy it and retire this dryer for travel and guest use, or perhaps give it to one of my more vexatious relatives whose skin needs a little aging. (oops, did I say that out loud?)    The dryer meets my goal of reduced noise very well. No practical (reasonable weight/affordable) hair dryer is going to produce large volumes of hot air silently, but the noise is dramatically less than that of most hair dryers, including some that claim to be \\&quot;low noise\\&quot;.  Nowhere near silent, but not the screaming, screeching, hearing loss creating beast most of us have come to expect as the norm.  I don&#x27;t know why the Consumer Product Safety Commission allows hair dryers to be sold which will cost us our hearing, but they do.  I&#x27;m happy I found one that will not leave me deaf after years of use.    The unit produces a lot of heat, and it does so quickly.  The volume of air generated is more than adequate.  The controls are straight forward once you take the time to look them over.  The only thing which may trip you up is the blue \\&quot;cold air\\&quot; button.  Unlike every other hair dryer I have ever used, this is not a momentary \\&quot;push and release\\&quot; control.  You push it once to turn it to cold, and again to return it to heated mode.  On a sleepy morning, this can leave you wondering what in the heck is wrong with your expensive hair dryer, only to discover, to your chagrin, that the cold air button has been inadvertently engaged.  Just remember, if the dryer isn&#x27;t getting hot, check the blue button.    The weight and balance is pretty good.  The fit and finish is nice.  The cord length is quite adequate.  Overall I find it to be well made, and I see no reason why it won&#x27;t give me years of satisfactory use.  If it doesn&#x27;t, I will be sure to edit my review and let you know.    So, If you are looking for a quality hair dryer which will not damage your hearing, I think this one will be a good choice.  As for all of the magical smoke and mirrors claimed for it, well, let me know if your hair starts glowing angelically after you use it.  Mine just gets dry.    One star deducted for excessive quantities of snake oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of my hairdresser.  I had a very expensive \\&quot;Chi\\&quot; that only lasted 18 mos.  This FHI dryer is SO MUCH BETTER - it has 2 heat settings &amp; 1 cool.  (as opposed to just hot &amp; cool on the Chi) AND it is light weight, easy to handle.  I have very thick, wavy hair &amp; this dryer is perfect - I can get extra zzzz&#x27;s in the AM because it&#x27;s so quick.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairdryer ever!     The highest heat and air setting will probably straighten your curly hair just by blowdrying with your fingers.  I use the medium setting to set my curls with the diffuser and the time spent on my hair has pretty much been cut in half.     I was flipping through one of my Marie Claire&#x27;s and they had a comparison chart on some of the best hairdryers and all the testers picked the FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 as their No. 1 choice.       Overall, this is a great hairdryer and if you have only purchased drug store hairdryers in the past then i guarantee you that the FHI won&#x27;t dissapoint.    Happy Hair Days!</li>
            <li> I have been a stylist for 8 years, and work at a multicultural salon  this little sucker can smooth out the unruliest of  hair,  and give fine limp hair great body  we have 14 stylist and 11 of us have one, that should tell ya something  great buy and amazing product</li>
            <li> Looking at all the great reviews about this hair dryer, i decided to buy it to replace my older one. Received this hair dryer yesterday in great condition, i tested the cool shot and all yesterday for less than 5 minutues. However when i was blowdrying my hair today, i smell something burning and i was astonished to find white SMOKE coming out of the air filter. I quickly off the power plug and let the hair dryer cool down. I tried using it at noon again and it wasn&#x27;t working at all.   So DISAPPOINTED with this product, had my hopes held high and end up with a short lifespan of only 1 DAY . Wasted my money !</li>
            <li> This is a very good blowdryer.  I really like that the cord is very long.  My last dryer felt like I was tethered to the wall (ha ha).  The dryer dries my hair very quickly.  The only thing I wished I could change is the air output - it is too high and cannot be adjusted down without turning the heat down too.  What I am saying is that there is a high and low setting for the fan but it also turns down the heat even though you have a separate high, medium and low heat setting.  Also, the dryer seems a little heavy but it is not a deal breaker.  I used a Chi dryer after I purchased this dryer.  That is where I really noticed the differences.  The Chi blowdryer is lighter and the air velocity is less but with the same heat.  Lower air velocity keeps it from blowing your hair off your head (figuratively speaking of course) and enables you to get smoother, straighter hair.  My hair is a little long so I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference or not.  All in all, this is a very good dryer.  If I could have adjusted the air down without adjusting the heat I would have given this dryer a 5 rating.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer in November-great dryer, while it worked. It was fast and I loved the way my hair felt after I was finished...BUT a few days ago, the heat element went out. Now the settings are cold, colder and coldest. I would not recomment this product.</li>
            <li> Good price on a great dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and after going to the hair cutter and having my hair blow dried I decided I liked how it looked. The dryer styling is androgynous and I liked that. It also functions great, I can blow dry a faux hawk and it will stay without product. I used to spend 20+ bucks a month on wax/gel, now I don&#x27;t hardly use any. My gf likes this dryer so much that when she moved in she threw hers out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blowdryer because my last blowdryer of another brand started to die on me.  I had never heard of this brand before but generally always invest in blowdryers on the higher price range in order to get a commercial salon quality.  So after reading all the great reviews, I decided to try it, despite the smattering of negative reviews.  All I can say is that after a few months of using this blowdryer (approximately 3 times a week), I am thrilled with the blowdryer so far.  I have not had the product stop working nor had the cold problem that others talked about (although the latter could be because I had been warned in advance from other reviews about the cold shock button that had to be clicked on and off and therefore knew to do this).  The blowdryer provides a tremendous amount of air and heat, almost to the point of being too hot sometimes.  It&#x27;s not too heavy to hold either, although once in awhile I accidentally lower the setting due to my fingers knocking into the somewhat ill-placed buttons while gripping the handle.  With the amount of air that this blowdryer generates, it does take a somewhat shorter amount of time to fully dry my long hair.  In short, I highly recommend this blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer nearly 8 months ago and I love it. I have long, thick, curly hair and I can dry and straighten all of it in about 15 minutes. This is a huge improvement over the 30+ minutes it used to take using lesser hair dryers. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Purchase this product and within 6 months it TOTALLY STOPPED WORKING.  Amazon says I need to contact the seller, the seller says I need to contact the manufacturer; the manufacturer says AMAZON is not authorized to sell their product and they WILL NOT WARRANT IT.  Are you kidding me - AMAZON should be responsible for what they allow on their site.</li>
            <li> I have dry, wavy hair that&#x27;s about medium thickness. This hair dryer hasn&#x27;t changed my hair dramatically, but it cuts down on my time drying and softens my hair some. I hate drying my hair, so even though it is pricey, I figured I would use it more. In other words, since I dry my hair at least 4 times a week, it&#x27;s one of the most used appliances in my home. I use a round brush and then usually straighten it. I do travel at least once a month, and it does take up a more room than my last folding dryer.     Note: when I received the hair dryer and started using it, I thought it was broken because it would blow cold air. Then I realized the blue button was pushed out, which gives you a cold \\&quot;blast.\\&quot; Nice feature, but I sometimes hit it accidentally.</li>
            <li> Best dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned! Light and powerful yet very quiet.  I highly recommend it.  Cord is a little too long for my needs, better suited for hair stylists.</li>
            <li> This is the first hair dryer of this type that I have purchased, and I absolutely love it.    My hair stylist suggested I get the bigger (more expensive) model that she uses in the salon, but I feel like this has plenty of power for me, and my hair dries very quickly.  This is perfect for someone who is just getting used to blowing out their tresses every day, and great for those people who have become accustomed  to styling hair continuously.</li>
            <li> I borrowed a friends expensive hair dryer while visiting and it did wonders for my hair so I was determined to find a similar dryer that wasn&#x27;t $200.00  I was excited to stumble across this one after trying a couple from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply b/c most of the reviews were excellent.  Unfortunately I cannot give the same enthusiastic reviews as others.  Yes the hair dryer works okay and it does have a lot of power and gets nice and hot but it doesn&#x27;t really dry my hair any faster nor does it make my hair look any better than my old $15.00 dryer.  I decided to keep it as returning is a hassle and I thought maybe I&#x27;d see more of a difference next summer when it&#x27;s humid out than I am seeing now.  Also, as I mentioned before it does have a lot of power and gets very hot.  I&#x27;m only giving it three stars b/c I just don&#x27;t see that much improvement in the look or feel of my hair and believe me, I have hair that needs improvement, it&#x27;s fine highlighted blonde with a bit of a natural kink/curl so I HAVE to blow dry it every day.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much,This is good one,  I am very happy with my hair dryer and love it.will order again</li>
            <li> I had purchased a similar dryer for my daughter for Christmas at a much higher price.  I was happy with service, excellent product and tremendous value!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length very thick, very curly hair - yet at the same time, each strand of hair is fine.  So I need a lot of heat to dry my hair, but the heat required is very harsh on the overall health of my hair because of the fineness.  Plus, I straighten my hair using a big barrel brush usually followed by a CHI flat iron.  This hair dryer shortens the dry/style time from about 20 minutes to 15 minutes.  And, most of the time I don&#x27;t need to use the flat iron afterwards because the texture is so nice and smooth. Definitely notice fewer split ends by the time I go back to stylist for a cut.   I highly recommend this hair dryer for anyone with a \\&quot;high maintenance\\&quot; situation.  It generates a lot of heat, but is relatively quiet.  However, you do need to keep moving it to avoid getting any one area too hot.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this blow dryer for my wife because I wanted her to have a good blow dryer. She would take almost an hour getting her hair ready and the whole house sounded like a screaming engine. One of the biggest benefits that I did not expect is that even when the blow dryer is on its highest setting, the sound it makes is more like a whirl than a high-pitched scream. It seems that the motor mechanism simply isn&#x27;t needing to try to hard to get the same (or more) quantity of air through it than a conventional blow dryer.     In short, it was worth the money and I&#x27;d recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser and friend recommended this blow dryer. I blow dry my hair every day and the sometimes my hair can&#x27;t hold up to the heat. This blow dryer is FAST and HOT! I love the way my hair feels silky smooth after blow drying, even without using product. And the volume is AMAZING! I also enjoy that it has a cold-push button, you don&#x27;t have to hold the button down like most blow dryers, just push to turn on cold, and push to turn off. Only two negatives that I have is that the cord is super long, assuming that is because it is a salon based blow dryer; it is not very light weight. It isn&#x27;t super heavy, but isn&#x27;t light as a feather either.</li>
            <li> I was the first person to ever not believe that a higher end hair dryer could make one iota of difference - I was wrong.  I am not savvy when it comes to blow drying my hair and just thought my \\&quot;bad\\&quot; hair would just always be except when my hair stylist transformed it.  I am still not savvy, but this hair dryer has made a huge difference in the outcome.  I no longer have to use my flat iron to tame everything - which is music to my hair stylist&#x27;s ears!!  I love the long cord so that I can move around freely, if needed.  This was so worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd on that I have owned.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly hair and this is the only thing that works for my hair without damage.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BLOW DRYER! ONLY PROBLEM IS WHEN IT GETS REALLY HOT IT SHUTS OFF! I LIVE IN A NEW HOME SO I KNOW THE ELECTRIC SOCKETS ARE FINE. PERHAPS IT COULD BE A BOOTLEGGED PRODUCT, IM NOT SURE. I WISH THERE WAS A WAY WE COULD REALLY TELL IF THE ELECTRONICS WERE FAKE. THEY ARE ALL MADE IN CHINA I GUESS CHEAPLY MADE IN CHINA IS MORE OF A HAZARD!</li>
            <li> So far the hair dryer has worked great!  I&#x27;ll let you know in a year from now.&lt;br /&gt;Mayra&lt;br /&gt;Miami, FL</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my stylist. It requires less drying time because it is so much more powerful and efficient. Again, I love it!</li>
