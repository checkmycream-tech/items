            <li>Love this and all the colors</li>
            <li>I honestly LOVE these liners.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors and good price.</li>
            <li>They kind of look like they have been used because some of the liners weren&#x27;t full.</li>
            <li>but i will buy from a more credible source from now on.</li>
            <li>This is the most Fabulous brand for glitter eyeliner that I have found.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very bold.</li>
            <li>Love just the right amount of glitter, not overdone!</li>
            <li>Very Nice I like to play around with many different looks</li>
            <li>Value, quality, and overall beautiful.</li>
            <li>Especially my hairstylist.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this bundle and great deal.  </li>
            <li>I put them right on top of my NYX eyeliner to embellish the color.  </li>
            <li>they are pretty to look at though :)</li>
            <li>, IT&#x27;S FULL SIZE</li>
            <li>Many colours, many ways to create on different shades or styles on your make up.</li>
            <li>I love them and shipping was pretty fast as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>the variety of colors is fun.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some of them look open or used, it&#x27;s kind of upsetting</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of sparkle even on your lashes....</li>
            <li>Very happy with all of the different color variations and the entire transaction, the package arrived WWAAYYY before expected, and the tassels on the top of each individual glitter liner is such a cute touch!</li>
            <li>Some colours are similar but It&#x27;s okay .</li>
            <li>I love glitter liners and with this set you get a lot of different colors.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE THEY REALLY DO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.</li>
            <li>I got way more than what I expected.</li>
            <li>Very timely bought for Christmas gifts</li>
            <li>Where I live, I never found something like this which is exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li>A couple of them looked used and we&#x27;re not total full also</li>
            <li>Needs less &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; (or whatever) and more glitter...</li>
            <li>I give them to my daughter because I felt I was to old for so much glitter</li>
            <li>I know some people say it appears used on the brush, however it&#x27;s just some of the brushes have lost the define straight appearance, this can come from the weight of the glitter and when the brush was inserted to complete the closing of the bottles.  </li>
            <li>Works just as good as my urban decay metallic glitter eyeliner and for half the price!!</li>
            <li>It goes on as more clear &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; with a little bit of glitter in it.</li>
            <li>The colors were a little different than shown, but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>They came pretty quickly , although it seems something of the glitters have some missing in them</li>
            <li>I use these all the time, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the black writing on the label will come off on your hands which is easy enough to wash off.</li>
            <li>I like these sets, but the top is a little strange with the long black tassel I didn&#x27;t see in the advertisement photo.</li>
            <li>Some bottles looked less than half full.</li>
            <li>rarely now because they are just so hard to deal with.</li>

            <li> It is very long lasting and</li>
            <li> The latter is due to the pieces of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For example the two grays are similar but one has crystal in it and the other is just gray.</li>
            <li> ( I have tried a bunch of brands)  Larger glitter pieces and bolder colors than any other brand that I have tried.</li>

            <li> idk if its due to shipping or what.</li>
            <li> Every color of the rainbow (except red :/)</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other brand.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t peel off either like some other glitter liners I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the glitter brush is a little flimsy .  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I wear these EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> I have bought their stuff at Ulta &amp; it&#x27;s a little expensive,  so</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this item.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Due to the coloring of the bottles in the picture it made it seem like it was glitter liner in a color.... something... They are not. The glitter itself is bright... if you can get enough out of the container at any one point to see it. I use these when face painting... rarely now because they are just so hard to deal with. It goes on as more clear &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; with a little bit of glitter in it. Needs less &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; (or whatever) and more glitter... I ended up breaking the top off one bottle in order to use my paint brush in it to get anything worthwhile out... they are pretty to look at though :)</li>
            <li> The colors were a little different than shown, but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> I use these regularly. they give you glam without going over the top !!! Just the right amount of sparkle even on your lashes....</li>
            <li> I use these all the time, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the black writing on the label will come off on your hands which is easy enough to wash off. I would definately buy again</li>
            <li> Yes, it will cause some irritation if it gets into your eyes while applying or when you remove it at nice.  The latter is due to the pieces of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;I use these as an eyeliner.  It is very long lasting and the variety of colors is fun.</li>
            <li> Great price ! Love all the colors.. They don&#x27;t peel off either like some other glitter liners I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Love this liner.  Very easy to use and stays on. Love just the right amount of glitter, not overdone!</li>
            <li> I love using the glitters as liner with my eyeshadow, makes my eyes pop . Pretty colors and good price. My only complaint would be the glitter brush is a little flimsy .  They arrived within the estimated time... Would purchase again</li>
            <li> Ever since I tried one of their makeup I was hooked, all of the cosmetics are out of this world. I have bought their stuff at Ulta &amp; it&#x27;s a little expensive,  so went to their on line company &amp; bought some stuff they were shipper &amp; O.M.G. THE WAY THEY SEND YOUR THINGS IS AMAZING &amp; THEY ALWAYS GIVE YOU A GIFT WITH YOUR ORDER &amp; THEY ARE NOT SAMPLES, IT&#x27;S FULL SIZE THINGS, THEIR MAKEUP IT&#x27;S SO GOOD. BUT YOU CAN GET IT AT AMAZON. COM A LOT SHIPPER. I LOVE ORDERING FROM AMAZOM.COM BECAUSE THEY REALLY DO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using my husband&#x27;s account. This eyeliners are so beautiful if you like glitter. I give them to my daughter because I felt I was to old for so much glitter lol She loves them. They are beautiful colors in this set!</li>
            <li> They came pretty quickly , although it seems something of the glitters have some missing in them :/ idk if its due to shipping or what. they are nice products. Very happy I bought them</li>
            <li> GREAT DEAL. I will use these when I freelance! - beauty blogger</li>
            <li> YESSSSS I LOVEEEE THESE. I PUT THE ISH.. ON EVERYTHING. LOL</li>
            <li> I like these sets, but the top is a little strange with the long black tassel I didn&#x27;t see in the advertisement photo. I bought to put in gifts.</li>
            <li> Very happy with all of the different color variations and the entire transaction, the package arrived WWAAYYY before expected, and the tassels on the top of each individual glitter liner is such a cute touch!</li>
            <li> Every color of the rainbow (except red :/) but I love them!</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t show as well as I expected. No seals on product. Some bottles looked less than half full. Not very impressed with this item.</li>
            <li> Very excited about it!!! Many colours, many ways to create on different shades or styles on your make up. For me that I need to enrich my make up as a latin dancer and be shinny , with glitters and sparkling it was a perfect purchase!!! I can&#x27;t wait to use it. Some colours are similar but It&#x27;s okay . For example the two grays are similar but one has crystal in it and the other is just gray. Same with gold and green ones. All colours are beautiful and viber. Though I had the colour aqua twice for some reason and also some of them seemed to be used. This was a bit of disappointment but I don&#x27;t let it bother me cause I got way more than what I expected. Where I live, I never found something like this which is exactly what I wanted and needed. If you need glitters don&#x27;t think about it, just buy them !!</li>
            <li> Very Nice I like to play around with many different looks I like this I can pop glitter on top of my liner....</li>
            <li> Yummy and plentiful.  I know some people say it appears used on the brush, however it&#x27;s just some of the brushes have lost the define straight appearance, this can come from the weight of the glitter and when the brush was inserted to complete the closing of the bottles.  They are not defective.  I absolutely love all the colors and they are so rich!! I put them right on top of my NYX eyeliner to embellish the color.  Many compliments from men &amp; women.  Especially my hairstylist.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for this bundle and great deal.  Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I have 2 of the same glitters eyeliners by Urban Decay and you would get 1 for the price of 16!!! Can&#x27;t beat it and you definately cannot tell the difference.  I&#x27;m really loving NYX products more and more.  Value, quality, and overall beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very nice eyeliners. I love them and shipping was pretty fast as well.</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today and noticed that none of them were safely sealed. They kind of look like they have been used because some of the liners weren&#x27;t full. Like some of the liner was either used or taken out. I like them because its nyx and they work well but i will buy from a more credible source from now on. Some good deals are just too good to be true. Just beware of what your buying!!!!</li>
            <li> Love these..they are so glittery</li>
            <li> Works just as good as my urban decay metallic glitter eyeliner and for half the price!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Love this and all the colors</li>
            <li> Some of them look open or used, it&#x27;s kind of upsetting but they were a gift so no returns &#x3D;\</li>
            <li> beautiful . but the purple color is reduplicate . and there is no burgundy color</li>
            <li> A couple of them looked used and we&#x27;re not total full also none of them were still safety sealed.</li>
            <li> I honestly LOVE these liners. Amazing quality and the colors are very bright!(:</li>
            <li> This is absolutely perfect if u love glitter these are a must have you will not be disappointed the colors the quality u cant beat this price</li>

            <li> awesome set for an awesome price. I love glitter liners and with this set you get a lot of different colors. So happy that I found this. If you like glitter you must have these. And NYX is a great cosmetic brand.</li>
            <li> I wear these EVERYDAY! This is the most Fabulous brand for glitter eyeliner that I have found.( I have tried a bunch of brands)  Larger glitter pieces and bolder colors than any other brand that I have tried. I get compliments all the time regardless of the color that I&#x27;m using. I won&#x27;t use any other brand. The liquid in the same color as the glitter so it&#x27;s very bold. You only need to apply one coat. I love, love, love NYX brand glitter eyeliner! You will be amazed!</li>
