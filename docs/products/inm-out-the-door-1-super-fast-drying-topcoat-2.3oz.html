            <li>The  large 2oz</li>
            <li>I bought this product on a Monday and by Thursday it was in my hands and ready for me to use.</li>
            <li>ðŸ’… THANKS FOR READING</li>
            <li>It lasts much longer with it.</li>
            <li>I saw it was fast drying and</li>
            <li>because the name suits how fast it drys I will order again</li>
            <li>It is very shiny.  </li>
            <li>A real value for the price also.</li>
            <li>Fast drying.</li>
            <li>Not only does this product help your polish to dry quickly, but it is an amazing top coat that will help your manicure last and last.</li>
            <li>I havd tried other top coats over the years and ended up giving them to my daughter in law.</li>
            <li>i have been using it for years and it works better than all the other products in the market.</li>
            <li>There is no cracking or chipping so far and it has been 2 weeks and there is no shrinkage of nail polish as complaints have been made about other fast drying top coats.</li>
            <li>I am incredibly particular about my nails...</li>
            <li>Good enough volume to last for a long time.</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations are too high from Seche Vite?</li>
            <li>use the small bottle for regular occasions, and big bottle for the ones with stones and stickers that needs good seal quickly.</li>
            <li>It was just a regular clear nail polish nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>I really like this topcoat, however it does not dry as fast as advertised.</li>
            <li>Product does dry polish quickly.  </li>
            <li>a pretty big sizes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a CRAZY amount of product for a great price comparing to Seche Vite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely drys the polish in no time.</li>
            <li>thst I am always cleaning, my hands are always busy and in water.</li>
            <li>Painting many different designs and themes for holidays and everyday.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering again because the size is was much bigger than the one in the store that normally costs $6.99 and up.</li>
            <li>When it got to the point a couple of years ago that it became much more difficult to keep up the &#x27;fill&#x27; every two weeks, I decided to go natural and have the coating taken off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy student, so I don&#x27;t have the luxury time to do my nails and wait for them to dry!</li>
            <li>I have natural nails and this will keep my polish on for well over a week with out a single chip!</li>
            <li>but lately I&#x27;ve been getting little bubbles in my top coat.</li>

            <li> I have natural nails and this will keep my polish on for well over a week with out a single chip!</li>
            <li> but lately I&#x27;ve been getting little bubbles in my top coat.</li>
            <li> I never have to worry smudging my polish because all it needs is one or two coats of the &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; but even one coat is enough to dry the polish</li>
            <li> I normally purchase the small size at a local beauty supply store every couple months.  </li>
            <li> In Two minutes dry.....  </li>
            <li> but because the bottle is so large half way and it will be too thick to apply</li>
            <li> Waste of ten bucks.</li>
            <li> I buy because I mix my own colors often using out the door as the base to mixing those colors.</li>
            <li> watched youtube review on this one, bought it and extremely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical first.</li>
            <li> I had tried using it as both a base coat and top coat</li>
            <li> If I get a little smudge or a  tiny nick in my polish on the way home from the nail salon,  a thin coat of Out the Door evens it out and protects the color until I get my acrylic nails done again.  </li>
            <li> The secret is slowly rolling the nail polish bottles adding different polish colors as you fill it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually an OPI polish addict</li>
            <li> Usually, that is 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> She recommends that I put a very thin coat on daily over nail polish.  </li>
            <li> After about a year of growing my nails out and having them strengthened, I wanted to do something other than have natural nails, but I hated the chipped polish.</li>
            <li> Using a base coat, then polish followed by 2 coats of Out The Door kept the polish intact after activities that would normally chip the polish.</li>
            <li> Went over four layers of polish and still dried in mere minutes.  </li>
            <li> product itself, I seriously don&#x27;t think it gives me that crazy shine</li>
            <li> You could say I am a girl obsessed with nails and nail art...</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Everyone thinks my nails are gel... Or even fake!</li>
            <li> Leaves a shiny coat and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> My nails were weakened from the years of having the acrylic applied, but didn&#x27;t look as bad as I thought they would.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Work wonderfully. Completely drys the polish in no time. I paint my nails often so this large bottle is very useful</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a Monday and by Thursday it was in my hands and ready for me to use. I love love love this top coat better than Seche Vite. For some reason Seche Vite starts to shrink after i put it on. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good enough volume to last for a long time. Better than getting smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I really like this topcoat, however it does not dry as fast as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for a very long time. Painting many different designs and themes for holidays and everyday. I only use out the door .I do buy the northern lights as well. This top cost really helps to maintain my manicures. I have a 130lb shiloh shepherd and two cockateils in a huge cage thst I am always cleaning, my hands are always busy and in water. This top coat keeps my nails looking great . The  large 2oz + bottle I buy because I mix my own colors often using out the door as the base to mixing those colors.The secret is slowly rolling the nail polish bottles adding different polish colors as you fill it. Don&#x27;t shake or vigorously roll the bottles , that causes many air bubbles. If you don&#x27;t mix polishes, or make your own, this large bottle can thicken like all polishes can . If you didn&#x27;t know there is a nail polish thinner that comes in a 2oz and 4 oz bottles that are plastic and has a  flip top for squeezing the thinner. Or you can purchase the smaller size, use it then keep filling with the larger out the door bottle. I havd tried other top coats over the years and ended up giving them to my daughter in law. Everyone has a favorite , must have item, since I do my own nails this is one of  mine. ðŸ’… THANKS FOR READING, BYEðŸ’…</li>
            <li> Love this top  coat its amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Its a pretty big sizes and it lasts forever. My 2nd time re- prushing! Dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Was dying to receive this product since i had done some research on some of the fast drying top coats! My friend had also recommended it and said she has used it for years. I used it and it dries very quickly within a minute for me (live in NM). Leaves a shiny coat and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. There is no cracking or chipping so far and it has been 2 weeks and there is no shrinkage of nail polish as complaints have been made about other fast drying top coats.</li>
            <li> I do my nails every Sunday. Have posts on Facebook, Pintrest, Instagram, Tumblr. I have used this topcoat for a while. Is the only one I use. It is the best.</li>
            <li> Good price, great size was what I expected!!!! Will be ordering again because the size is was much bigger than the one in the store that normally costs $6.99 and up.</li>
            <li> The best  super fast drying ever ...... is true!!!!!  In Two minutes dry.....  The Shine, dry fast, the best .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was just a regular clear nail polish nothing special about it. Waste of ten bucks. The o lay good thing is that its a huge bottle but the nail polish just chipped off</li>
            <li> Excellent! I was a little skeptical first. But I works really good! I did my nails already a week ago and I have all my nails in very good condition!</li>
            <li> It is a an excellent fast drying topcoat that protects my polish. It lasts much longer with it. would recommend it.</li>
            <li> You could say I am a girl obsessed with nails and nail art... It is a hobby of mine. I am incredibly particular about my nails... To the point that I now do them myself.  When I was searching for a fast drying top coat... Google reviews brought me to this product.  I saw it was fast drying and people seemed to like it, so I gave it a try.  The best part about the product besides the fact that it dries very quickly is that it gives your polish a thick super glossy finish that makes your nails look like GLASS! I am OBSESSED with this stuff.  I have natural nails and this will keep my polish on for well over a week with out a single chip! Unreal. Everyone thinks my nails are gel... Or even fake! BUY BUY BUY. seriously best purchase EVER</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! Dries super quick and makes your polish last longer.</li>
            <li> One of the things that made me hesitate to take off the acrylic coating on my nails (which I had been getting for over 25 years) was the fact that the coating kept my polish intact. My nails always looked freshly done. When it got to the point a couple of years ago that it became much more difficult to keep up the &#x27;fill&#x27; every two weeks, I decided to go natural and have the coating taken off. Soaked my nails myself in acetone until the coating dissolved. My nails were weakened from the years of having the acrylic applied, but didn&#x27;t look as bad as I thought they would. But polish didn&#x27;t stay on. After about a year of growing my nails out and having them strengthened, I wanted to do something other than have natural nails, but I hated the chipped polish. One day one of my younger friends told me about Out the Door. She raved about it. So I read the reviews from Amazon (by the way, Amazon is my bible in terms of reviews) and decided to buy. It is PHENOMENAL!!!!</li>
            <li> this is the best topcoat and dries quickly</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It works perfect!  I read about it on pinterest and this is my second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered because it works so well.</li>
            <li> best top coat super fast dry! I never have to worry smudging my polish because all it needs is one or two coats of the &amp;#34;out the door&amp;#34; but even one coat is enough to dry the polish</li>
            <li> Out-the-door topcoat is very strong.  I&#x27;ve been getting manicures for years and this is what I suggested to my nail tech.  It is better than so many I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love love this nice size, great price, and it came super fast which it perfect. I this this because the name suits how fast it drys I will order again</li>
            <li> Not only does this product help your polish to dry quickly, but it is an amazing top coat that will help your manicure last and last. It is very shiny.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Always love this product and the amount for the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually an OPI polish addict but lately I&#x27;ve been getting little bubbles in my top coat. I tried this as a new top coat and was pleasantly surprised! No bubbles, goes on quick and adds a great top gloss!</li>
            <li> I used Seche-vite before, always worried about the toluene.&lt;br /&gt;I watched youtube review on this one, bought it and extremely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Fast drying and beautiful shine too without big 3.&lt;br /&gt;I use the small bottle for regular occasions, and big bottle for the ones with stones and stickers that needs good seal quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat for the amount of product and how fast it dries. It&#x27;s a CRAZY amount of product for a great price comparing to Seche Vite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself, I seriously don&#x27;t think it gives me that crazy shine I&#x27;m looking for. Maybe my expectations are too high from Seche Vite? I don&#x27;t know, I think I have used shinier drugstore topcoats. It gives a good enough amount of shine though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do love how I can do my nails at 11 at night, go to bed in a couple of minutes and see no smudges the next morning! I&#x27;m a busy student, so I don&#x27;t have the luxury time to do my nails and wait for them to dry!</li>
            <li> good but because the bottle is so large half way and it will be too thick to apply</li>
            <li> Product does dry polish quickly.  I had tried using it as both a base coat and top coat but that didn&#x27;t work, polish chipped.  Using a base coat, then polish followed by 2 coats of Out The Door kept the polish intact after activities that would normally chip the polish.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase the small size at a local beauty supply store every couple months.  Now I have three times the product at about 75% savings!!!  And I did not have to leave the house.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this topcoat.  Went over four layers of polish and still dried in mere minutes.  A real value for the price also.</li>
            <li> this product is great....i have been using it for years and it works better than all the other products in the market. it gives your manicure a great shine and it makes your color stay for at least 2 weeks without chipping. i have decided to take it with me to the salon next time i go for a professional manicure,since its much better than the product they use. i would recommend the smaller bottle as well just for the fact that you can throw it in your purse and take it with you. love this product !!!</li>
            <li> My manicurist uses Out The Door top coat.  She recommends that I put a very thin coat on daily over nail polish.  I&#x27;ve been able to stretch my manicured nails to 6 days without chips by doing this.  Fast drying.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a top coat that was not so watery and gave a good flow over the nail because I do a lot of design accents. This works great, dries super fast too. Wish there was an even larger bottle option.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my nails look like i just left the nail shop no yellowing either.</li>
            <li> If I get a little smudge or a  tiny nick in my polish on the way home from the nail salon,  a thin coat of Out the Door evens it out and protects the color until I get my acrylic nails done again.  Usually, that is 2-3 weeks.  This size is smaller than the one I used to buy at a beauty supply, but it&#x27;s perfect for home use.  The larger bottle would thicken up before I could use it all.  I don&#x27;t know why I never thought to buy it on Amazon before.</li>
