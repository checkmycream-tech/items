            <li> Love this product.  Keeps my skin looking great.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny. And it does what is says and it works fast. I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks now and I notice a complete difference in the area that was affected by dark spots. The dark spots are almost gone. I can say my skin hasn&#x27;t look this good in years. I just use a small amount and rub till it gone. I so glad I found the Eclos  line. I&#x27;m very happy with the results and can&#x27;t wait to see how young look my skin will continue to be in the future.</li>
            <li> My face was burned and this worked very well in fading the dark mark. I no longer have to cake on the foundation</li>
            <li> I love this brand. I have been using anti aging ointments and creams for 35 years. ECLOS brand is excellent. The spot remover doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I have been using it on my hands the spots are clearing and I am not even using it that often. Buy ECLOS products you won&#x27;t be regret it.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. I think it lightened my age spot but not enough.</li>
            <li> One of the few products I&#x27;ve tried that actually seems to work.</li>
            <li> I ordered once, thinking give it try. I tried and liked it. It didn&#x27;t vanish my age spot, but the natural aroma and the effect of smoothing skin was satisfactory. So I repeated the order, this time three of them. Appear antsy that was a mistake. One of them was clearly opened once, maybe even somebody used it and returned it. I didn&#x27;t like to use that particular product, so I lost money. I don&#x27;t know if I want to repeat again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and goes on smooth. Just haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet.</li>
            <li> This really works, seriously one age spot is just about gone.</li>
            <li> herbal fragrance, no grease, works overnight., i look bertter</li>
            <li> I Love this product, it seems to work, but the only thing I don&#x27;t like that much it&#x27;s the feeling on the skin , little sticky</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so so so very small. Find out what the active ingredient is and put it on yourself cuz this tiny thing won&#x27;t last very long. I do buy one ounce items for my skin but they are in the purest form. They are either serum or oil requiring one to two drops for your entire face and move on. A small bottle lasts months - at least.  This is way to small to do anything with - albeit good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Small bottle but I enjoy the quality of this product, consistency, my skin feels brighter, don&#x27;t expect a magic but I think works well for brighter and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> Made my face burn instantly. Ive used several of ECHOs products and liked them very much, but not this one. Tried it twice and both times it made my skin burn, turn red and break out. Wont be using again.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working without causing any skin problems.  Age spots on my face are fading after&lt;br /&gt;using about 6 weeks.</li>
