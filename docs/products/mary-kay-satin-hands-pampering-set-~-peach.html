            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This means using less moisturizer and having softer skin during the bitter cold winter months!</li>
            <li> Will buy again, my poor nursing hands are always being washed with soap and alcohol solution.</li>
            <li> not happy with this purchase or the place that I purchased it from needed this for the holiday could not return ended up keeping it for myself as two of the tubes were leaking when I recieved it.</li>
            <li> but I am afraid to use it.    </li>
            <li> Very disappointing at this time.    </li>

            <li> i just love using this product on my hands....it feels great and smells even better .</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet.  I received it as a gift and was surprised to see that the hand scrub and also the hand softner do not seem to be full items.  It seems to appear that the hand scrub is down 3/4 to one inch from the top of the bottle.  The hand softner when held up to a light is down at least an inch.    My concern is were these products used and are they sanitary?  The person who sent it to me loved it but I am afraid to use it.    Very disappointing at this time.    Tina McCann</li>
            <li> Use as directed it really made my hands feel much softer and they look much younger. These sixty year old hands now look like thirty year old hands. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a handlift!</li>
            <li> It does a great job in smoothing hands. I really like it, do not have to use it everyday, but when you feel they are too dry.</li>
            <li> I love this set for hands, veryyyy good product, came very fast and well packed. Nice smell and veryy soft skin!</li>
            <li> I love it, it leaves your hands feeling very soft. You can also use it for elbows and heels. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hands feel so soft after using it. Easy to use and it lasts a long time. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Will buy again, my poor nursing hands are always being washed with soap and alcohol solution. I have noticed a significant difference since I started using this product. Always have the cream and softener in my scrub pockets and apply after every hand washing. I use the scrub twice a day, morning and at bedtime. Product works great.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and at a good price. I was able to give this away as a gift and they loved it.</li>
            <li> I love all this products. It is really work. After it my hands is really soft and smell nice as a peach.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this three-piece set in the peach for a couple of weeks now, and I love it.  You start by using the softening cream, then add in the scrub.  Once you rinse that off, you apply the Satin Hands lotion, which sinks nicely in.  After this process, your hands really will feel silky soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Satin Hands lotion also isn&#x27;t greasy, and I&#x27;ve found that I can use it and use my laptop or phone soon afterwards, without it leaving a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes in a cute little bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really nice set that I will definitely re-purchase once I run out of the products!</li>
            <li> I love the satin hands pampering set.  I use it on my hands and feet about 1 time a week, or as needed.  This means using less moisturizer and having softer skin during the bitter cold winter months!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this as a gift to multiple people and it is always well received. Good for holidays, birthdays, etc....</li>
            <li> Great seller. Product arrived quickly and just as I expected. I would definitely recommend this product for smooth, soft hands.</li>
            <li> Love Satan Hands used this product for several years, works for me makes my hands feel real nice.</li>
