            <li>I used this in my own lotion.  </li>

            <li>It goes on easily and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair (on the ends mostly), in my oil-cleanse face wash and as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and it sure works.  </li>
            <li>I love Avocado oil...</li>
            <li>Brought it home and found out the top of the bottle is not on all the way.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it now in butters, like avocado butter or almond butter, for my hair twists styles.</li>

            <li>Light, absorbs quickly..leaves your skin nice and supple.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, and I use it anywhere that I can.</li>
            <li>Then I did another run through just to be sure, but</li>
            <li>It does not break you out plus makes skin healthy.</li>
            <li>Works even better if you apply it on the ends of your hair and leave it overnight.</li>
            <li>Wonderful oil, I prefer it to my regular regimen of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Love this for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I love this Avocado Oil as a face and body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact it&#x27;s not greasy .</li>
            <li>Good for many purposes as well as those purely cosmetic applications.</li>
            <li>Awesome even better than I expected</li>
            <li>This avocado oil has no smell is a golden color and moisturizes skin and hair amazingly.</li>
            <li>love that, nice not expensive.</li>
            <li>and I think this is a great way to naturally care for both.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is fine, but when I received the box from the post office, the bottom was soaked through with oil.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves one feeling better.  </li>
            <li>and this is great for a winter almost daily treatment.</li>
            <li>Sun blocker and make-up go on smoothly over it, if I want.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth against my skin.</li>
            <li>The shelf life so far seems to be good.</li>
            <li>They mixed well and smelled very nice with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this oil, because It is pure and It was a great price for such quality.</li>
            <li>Loved using it on my skin.. Didn&#x27;t like it on my hair, too oily for me,, but my niece loved it for her long soft hair</li>
            <li>, right?!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep my hands off my hair right now!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the lovely Lupita Nyongo for bringing it to my attention.</li>
            <li>You will smell a bit like cooking oil.. but only for a few minutes, it&#x27;s really moisturizing and great for your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all!!&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a nice little seal on the top, the bottle is actually a great size!</li>
            <li>Still early days to know the full results of the oil, mine and my daughters hair feels lovely and nourished.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more soon!</li>
            <li>I really liked the product for quality, I have not had any adverse reaction, but I just did not like is that it has little aroma, which is very important for me</li>
            <li>It stays in my bathroom cabinet and is still perfectly fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have had my first bottle for six months.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels smooth &amp; soft every time.</li>
            <li>First time using avocado oil</li>
            <li>This oil is the first thing that has worked on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time making it</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>and it came out stock straight!</li>
            <li>I went back to my usual moisturizer and am very happy that I did.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>Makes old skin so smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but the product seems to have worked just right.  </li>
            <li>I only wish that they would package it more so it wouldn&#x27;t move around as much and wind up leaking every where.</li>
            <li>I have been using Life-Flo Pure Avocado Oil since January 2013</li>
            <li>I am very please with the quality</li>
            <li>I use it to make body butters and creams and it makes them very nourishing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say my hair is 4A and relaxed (haven&#x27;t had a touchup in 3 months, really need to hit the salon).</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t need alot to go a long ways.  </li>
            <li>Love the avocado oil, use it on the whole body as a moisturizer, mix it with other oils to wash face with oils.</li>
            <li>Highly reviewed, works very well</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for my hair, but then started to apply it to my body.</li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;d make my hair heavy, REALLY greasy, and it&#x27;d take more work to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and I will buy this again.</li>
            <li>I already need to buy a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>I had no problem returning the item and a new one was shipped to me in a timely manner but the replacement bottle was also leaking.  </li>
            <li>This is my new heat</li>
            <li>I actually put the oil on first and put lotion or face cream on over it.</li>
            <li>Soaks in completely in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Oil has no smell--pure &amp; natural &amp; produced for using as a skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This oil is making my skin soft and seems to be improving texture and lines though</li>
            <li>I put it on after every shower and it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Sinks right into skin without feeling greasy  </li>
            <li>I use this oil on my skin and it is not particularly greasy feeling and soaks in very fast.  </li>
            <li>Less is more, as too much will leave your hair very heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve felt a major difference in my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this and as well as on my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my face everyday (makeup be gone!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money on creams and serums and here this was all along.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural - total winner!</li>
            <li>It absorbs fairly quickly, a little goes a long way, and my skin is super soft afterward.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li>usually use BB Super Gro when using a straightening comb on my hair.</li>
            <li>My high school granddaughter introduced me to this product - my skin was very dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my patches of dry skin are healing back to normal, even the redness is fading.  </li>
            <li>There is a small amount of vitamin E added to help it keep fresh</li>
            <li>I like it that it is NOT greasy after a few minutes and the softness of my skin is evident.</li>
            <li>I only lost a few ounces, but this shouldn&#x27;t have happened in the first place.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is much less greasy feeling than other oils - I have been using it for a body lotion too!  </li>

            <li> Love the avocado oil, use it on the whole body as a moisturizer, mix it with other oils to wash face with oils.</li>
            <li> Highly reviewed, works very well</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for my hair, but then started to apply it to my body.</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;d make my hair heavy, REALLY greasy, and it&#x27;d take more work to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I already need to buy a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> I had no problem returning the item and a new one was shipped to me in a timely manner but the replacement bottle was also leaking.  </li>
            <li> This is my new heat</li>
            <li> I actually put the oil on first and put lotion or face cream on over it.</li>
            <li> Soaks in completely in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Oil has no smell--pure &amp; natural &amp; produced for using as a skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This oil is making my skin soft and seems to be improving texture and lines though</li>
            <li> I put it on after every shower and it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Sinks right into skin without feeling greasy  </li>
            <li> I use this oil on my skin and it is not particularly greasy feeling and soaks in very fast.  </li>
            <li> Less is more, as too much will leave your hair very heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt a major difference in my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this and as well as on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my face everyday (makeup be gone!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on creams and serums and here this was all along.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural - total winner!</li>
            <li> It absorbs fairly quickly, a little goes a long way, and my skin is super soft afterward.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin</li>
            <li> usually use BB Super Gro when using a straightening comb on my hair.</li>
            <li> My high school granddaughter introduced me to this product - my skin was very dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my patches of dry skin are healing back to normal, even the redness is fading.  </li>
            <li> There is a small amount of vitamin E added to help it keep fresh</li>
            <li> I like it that it is NOT greasy after a few minutes and the softness of my skin is evident.</li>
            <li> I only lost a few ounces, but this shouldn&#x27;t have happened in the first place.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is much less greasy feeling than other oils - I have been using it for a body lotion too!  </li>
            <li> I enjoy how this makes my skin feel however, was a little disappointed that it did not have more of a scent.</li>
            <li> hair masks to repair over processed hair, moisturizer for my stretched ears, and a general moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Another great thing, I was scared my hair would burn or at the very least come out feeling stiff and hard, xD</li>
            <li> Use it on my hair in conjunction with my deep conditioner and after on dry hair in combination with olive oil and coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Despite the erm nappiness of my new growth, what usually takes me an hour to straighten, only took 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops and my face and neck feel soft and supple but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use it (along with some other oils) as a facial moisturizer and also in my hair as a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I tried her oil on my skin (a very little goes a long way) and my skin became soft and supple &amp;#34;without&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> This product was ordered to alleviate a dry skin problem.  </li>
            <li> pat dry, apply a tinted BB cream.  </li>
            <li> I do not have the time to sit around and wait for a product like this to dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry color treated, permanently straightened hair.</li>
            <li> my pores have never been so small, and my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> You need to have some fat in your diet for the vitamins that only break down and absorb vis fat.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very dry and it seems to be keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and skin</li>
            <li> Would recommend for very dry hair.</li>
            <li> It was only a little bit of oil and the bottle was still sealed and usable</li>
            <li> I only put a little oil on each part, ran the comb through once</li>
            <li> Just wet your hair and heat the oil a bit and leave on</li>
            <li> Hoping that after using it for awhile my skin will be less dry.</li>
            <li> one bottle managed to survive but the other leaked into the packaging!!really!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with other oils as a hair mask.</li>
            <li> Other things I use it for-</li>
            <li> i have terrible skin, and after one application, my skin felt smooth and soft already, just after one!!</li>
            <li> Hair feels weightless/not weighed down by grease.</li>
            <li> I used it with a few other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I also tried mixing with jamaican black castor oil.  </li>
            <li> Not as stiff as with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past I would mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li> a greasy feel in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> why sell a product (not cheap) and KNOW the customer is going to receive a leaky package...</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived on time but the bottle had broken open and the box was oil soaked.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my face, and with my sensitive skin, I think I would notice if there was anything wrong with the oil.</li>
            <li> I see other people have complained and yet it continues to arrive all leaky...</li>
            <li> I used very little of this product at a time, and still couldn&#x27;t get dressed for over an hour.</li>
            <li> No more dryness.  </li>
            <li> but this is not a good introduction (a leaky messy package) to your product or your company!</li>
            <li> This obviously sucks, but if you don&#x27;t have a man putting his nose in your hair, no one will even notice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out anywhere else from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> poor quality control</li>
            <li> Bad show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have had my first bottle for six months.  I use it on my hair (on the ends mostly), in my oil-cleanse face wash and as a moisturizer.  It stays in my bathroom cabinet and is still perfectly fresh.  There is a small amount of vitamin E added to help it keep fresh and it sure works.  I chose to buy this product again over the 100% avocado oils as I don&#x27;t want to deal with it going rancid and it has worked great for me all along!  I plan to use it in my homemade hand lotions this winter too.</li>
            <li> Great size for the price. I have dry skin and this is great for a winter almost daily treatment. Soaks in completely in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love Avocado oil...I use it for my hair and my skin.... It works great!!  I can put it on my face and not feel greasy.  I will put it on my hair at night and wash it out in the AM...</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, but when I received the box from the post office, the bottom was soaked through with oil. Brought it home and found out the top of the bottle is not on all the way. I only lost a few ounces, but this shouldn&#x27;t have happened in the first place. It should have had some sort of seal to prevent leaks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Life-Flo Pure Avocado Oil since January 2013 and it has done wonders for my hair &amp; skin. In the past I would mix it with other oils. I mostly use it now in butters, like avocado butter or almond butter, for my hair twists styles. It can also be used on top of a co-wash, then after a co-wash. My hair feels smooth &amp; soft every time.</li>
            <li> love that, nice not expensive. good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I used it to make my soaps. I am very please with the quality and I will buy it again. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Use it on my hair in conjunction with my deep conditioner and after on dry hair in combination with olive oil and coconut oil.  It has become a staple hair product</li>
            <li> Great oil absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have an order. I use it as a moisturizer for both my hair and body.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my hair and it seems to be working.  My hair is naturally very dry and it seems to be keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li> My high school granddaughter introduced me to this product - my skin was very dry.  &amp;#34;Try this grandma,&amp;#34; she said, &amp;#34;It cleared up my acne.  It is organic and the way it is processed all the emollients and healing properties are kept intact.&amp;#34;  I tried her oil on my skin (a very little goes a long way) and my skin became soft and supple &amp;#34;without&amp;#34; a greasy feel in just a few minutes.  So I ordered my own bottle.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my patches of dry skin are healing back to normal, even the redness is fading.  I like it that it is NOT greasy after a few minutes and the softness of my skin is evident.</li>
            <li> This avocado oil has no smell is a golden color and moisturizes skin and hair amazingly. Sinks right into skin without feeling greasy  and you don&#x27;t need alot. I will continue to buy this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this oil.  I already need to buy a new bottle.  So great for washing my face with the &#x27;oil cleansing method&#x27; my pores have never been so small, and my skin so soft.  It absorbs quickly and is much less greasy feeling than other oils - I have been using it for a body lotion too!  Can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
            <li> This product was ordered to alleviate a dry skin problem.  It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t need alot to go a long ways.  It absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves one feeling better.  It works.</li>
            <li> This smells delicious and is a beautiful deep gold. A nice consistency, not watery or  over processed. I recommend this seller, and will be buying oils from them for now on.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have avocado in your skincare regimen than add this to your cart now!  I slather this all over my body after each of my showers.  It&#x27;s AMAZING.  Keeps my skin moisturized until I shower next (which is 2-3 days sometimes).  It&#x27;s supposed to increase skin elasticity too.  Love this stuff and will probably use it forever.</li>
            <li> This is what I finally bought after trying commercial moisturizing bubble baths that DON&#x27;T work.  Highly reviewed, works very well I&#x27;m a ath, following guidelines, &amp; using between 1-2 oz. only--no more. Adding some relaxing oil essences (15-20 drops)/lavender or chamomile, for example, is a nice idea for a relaxing, moisturizing, delicious bath experience.  Oil has no smell--pure &amp; natural &amp; produced for using as a skin moisturizer.  Really pleased w/this&lt;br /&gt;Ur chase--it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> First time using avocado oil so I don&#x27;t have another brand to compare it to. Makes my hair nice and soft. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried to submit a form to complain about this packaging...I see other people have complained and yet it continues to arrive all leaky...one bottle managed to survive but the other leaked into the packaging!!really!&lt;br /&gt;I would like some sort of compensation for this...unbelievable,that others have said the same thing !? why sell a product (not cheap) and KNOW the customer is going to receive a leaky package...Bad show!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im have not used the product as it only arrived today but this is not a good introduction (a leaky messy package) to your product or your company!</li>
            <li> I purchase this oil for my skin and hair. I have yet to use it on my hair but my skin loves it. It absorbs fairly quickly, a little goes a long way, and my skin is super soft afterward. Just beware if you have dogs to not let them around this, as avocado is toxic to them.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use this on my face for OCM but I still have sunflower oil for that. This oil is making my skin soft and seems to be improving texture and lines though, so I imagine it would be wonderful on the face. I haven&#x27;t broken out anywhere else from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star only because the bottle, as others posted, does not ship well. I received my package and the box was soaked with oil that had leaked from the bottle. It was only a little bit of oil and the bottle was still sealed and usable so I decided to keep the bottle rather than returning it. I only wish that they would package it more so it wouldn&#x27;t move around as much and wind up leaking every where. The sunflower oil I have is the same size, type of bottle and by the same company and that did not leak in transit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the bath and in homemade hair masks for some extra hydration. It&#x27;s worked well on both hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, because It is pure and It was a great price for such quality. Definitely will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product for quality, I have not had any adverse reaction, but I just did not like is that it has little aroma, which is very important for me</li>
            <li> I use this for everything from hair to body. Avocado oil does it all. It has replaced my face wash and lotion.</li>
            <li> Still early days to know the full results of the oil, mine and my daughters hair feels lovely and nourished.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite oil. My skin just drinks it in. It is not oily and does not have a fragrance  Thanks to the lovely Lupita Nyongo for bringing it to my attention.</li>
            <li> Love this product as a night time moisturizer.  In the morning, I simply rinse my face, using no cleansers, pat dry, apply a tinted BB cream.  My BB tinted cream works wonderfully...better than ever...with this ritual.  This oil is the first thing that has worked on my skin.  No more dryness.  How great to know it has no chemicals, right?!</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived on time but the bottle had broken open and the box was oil soaked.  I had no problem returning the item and a new one was shipped to me in a timely manner but the replacement bottle was also leaking.  I received the bottle with just over 1/2 of it not spilled and as I use it for my business could not wait any longer to have the product as I was out.  I just used what could and will not order from here again.</li>
            <li> You will smell a bit like cooking oil.. but only for a few minutes, it&#x27;s really moisturizing and great for your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all!!&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a nice little seal on the top, the bottle is actually a great size! it&#x27;s huge!!&lt;br /&gt;Very good deal!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful price and quality for Avocado oil. This is a must purchase from this company and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this in my own lotion.  It was my first time making it so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but the product seems to have worked just right.  I used it with a few other ingredients.  They mixed well and smelled very nice with each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Love the avocado oil, use it on the whole body as a moisturizer, mix it with other oils to wash face with oils. Great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome even better than I expected</li>
            <li> Used it with my family shampoo. It was a pleasant surprise that this oil is certified to be edible. Tasted quite nice with salads.</li>
            <li> Great product for hair to get the frizz out!  Thank you so much!  I will be back for more soon!</li>
            <li> did not like the reaction in my scalp after using this avocado oil.  Too itchy. I also tried mixing with jamaican black castor oil.  Not good.</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> Perfect multi-purpose oil. I use it in combination with other oils as a hair mask. Also, another recipe is for skin treatment. Can be used also by itself.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Just a few drops and my face and neck feel soft and supple but not greasy.  Sun blocker and make-up go on smoothly over it, if I want.  I&#x27;ve spent so much money on creams and serums and here this was all along.  It can be used all over, including a bit on your hair and no, you don&#x27;t smell like guacamole ...</li>
            <li> This oil performs beautifully in my homemade products.  I use it to make body butters and creams and it makes them very nourishing.  I also use it on my hair as a deep conditioner.  This is great stuff!</li>
            <li> Good product, however, needs more care when being packaged for shipping. Oil bottled was not sealed, causing the oil to leak out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Have purchased it three times now.  I use it (along with some other oils) as a facial moisturizer and also in my hair as a leave-in conditioner.  I have very dry hair and skin and I think this is a great way to naturally care for both.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hair, but my skin loves it even more! Yay...An all-in-one body oil. Light, absorbs quickly..leaves your skin nice and supple.</li>
            <li> i have terrible skin, and after one application, my skin felt smooth and soft already, just after one!! great for skin and hair, you dont feel greasy and sticky at all, love this oil, use it for skin and hair, no scent which is great</li>
            <li> Did well in my homemade sunscreen</li>
            <li> I love this oil, and I use it anywhere that I can. I mainly use it for my hair, but then started to apply it to my body. Absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> I used this in a mixture with Castor Oil for the oil-cleansing method for my face. Other things I use it for- hair masks to repair over processed hair, moisturizer for my stretched ears, and a general moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased, I use this on my hair that is fine once every two weeks seem to work great, I just love it. Thank You</li>
            <li> Perfect ingredient for my homemade excema cream</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my skin and it is not particularly greasy feeling and soaks in very fast.  Hoping that after using it for awhile my skin will be less dry. I actually put the oil on first and put lotion or face cream on over it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great Value</li>
            <li> This is my new heat protector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Made my hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get hair straight.&lt;br /&gt;3. Hair came out soft.&lt;br /&gt;4. Hair feels weightless/not weighed down by grease. Not as stiff as with other products.&lt;br /&gt;5. Didn&#x27;t feel TOO greasy after straightening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use BB Super Gro when using a straightening comb on my hair. It&#x27;d have the same benefits BUT it&#x27;d make my hair heavy, REALLY greasy, and it&#x27;d take more work to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear, I can&#x27;t keep my hands off my hair right now! I&#x27;m 3/4 Afro A and 1/4 Puerto Rican. I&#x27;d say my hair is 4A and relaxed (haven&#x27;t had a touchup in 3 months, really need to hit the salon). Despite the erm nappiness of my new growth, what usually takes me an hour to straighten, only took 30 minutes. I have NO IDEA how! I only put a little oil on each part, ran the comb through once and it came out stock straight! Then I did another run through just to be sure, but my point, BUY THIS PRODUCT. It&#x27;s worth the price!!! Another great thing, I was scared my hair would burn or at the very least come out feeling stiff and hard, xD it didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells like omega 3 oil (fishy) when applying, and if i hold my hair against my nose, I can still smell it. This obviously sucks, but if you don&#x27;t have a man putting his nose in your hair, no one will even notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it&#x27;s a perfect hair care product.</li>
            <li> I added this oil to olive oil as a body moisturizer.  I put it on after every shower and it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This oil really is a great moisturizer. My scalp was starting to itch more than usual this past winter and i got this avocado oil and it helped me greatly! I do put an oil mixture i made in my hair too</li>
            <li> I use it in my cosmetics and use it as moisturiser body face both. It does not break you out plus makes skin healthy. I have normal to dry skin&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I used very little of this product at a time, and still couldn&#x27;t get dressed for over an hour. Even using the smallest amount possible I felt greasy and sticky as I sat around waiting. I do not have the time to sit around and wait for a product like this to dry. I went back to my usual moisturizer and am very happy that I did.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a skin moisturizer since my daughters have eczema. Works wonderfully! Calmed and soothed their skin instantly. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have dry color treated, permanently straightened hair. This works wonders for added moisture. I notice I don&#x27;t hear that &amp;#34;raking leaves&amp;#34; noise when I comb my hair after putting this in. Works even better if you apply it on the ends of your hair and leave it overnight. Less is more, as too much will leave your hair very heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face after showering. I can definitely see a reduction in my crows feet. Wonderful oil, I prefer it to my regular regimen of olive oil.</li>
            <li> Great as a hair conditioner.  Just wet your hair and heat the oil a bit and leave on 20 min-then shampoo out....Would recommend for very dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair and skin. I&#x27;ve felt a major difference in my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this and as well as on my skin.</li>
            <li> Restores moister to hormone deprived skin.  I have recommended it to several patients and they have all praised it.  I have been told it revived their sex lives.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Makes old skin so smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> sent it back came unopened and drenched the box it came in.  poor quality control</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my face everyday (makeup be gone!) and my face is not breaking out or acting like i am over-oiling it. Really great product and it&#x27;s natural - total winner!</li>
            <li> You need to have some fat in your diet for the vitamins that only break down and absorb vis fat. Make it good fats and your arteries will say thank you.</li>
            <li> Loved using it on my skin.. Didn&#x27;t like it on my hair, too oily for me,, but my niece loved it for her long soft hair</li>
            <li> bought this product to use to make homemade bath bombs! works great and has been wonderful for my winter skin! Softens and soothes!</li>
            <li> I have never purchased avocado oil before, but this seems to be a high quality product and it has a very good price. The shelf life so far seems to be good. I use this on my face, and with my sensitive skin, I think I would notice if there was anything wrong with the oil. Highly recommend and I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Good for many purposes as well as those purely cosmetic applications.</li>
            <li> I love this Avocado Oil as a face and body lotion.  It goes on easily and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Oh god. This oil is heavenly . I use it as a carrier oil or by itself. It&#x27;s so smooth against my skin. I love the fact it&#x27;s not greasy . Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a wonderful price. I will be buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> I enjoy how this makes my skin feel however, was a little disappointed that it did not have more of a scent.</li>
