            <li>Also, it is quick and effective at treating in-grown hairs and great for prevention!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I found it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;ll work better for you than it did for me!</li>
            <li>i wish there were more in the bottle for this price!</li>
            <li>It is really amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even remember how I found out about this product to be honest with you</li>
            <li>Good shaving practices are more effective.</li>
            <li>Nice minty/alkaline feel on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Tend Skin worked for about three weeks wonderfully, then began to really burn my skin.</li>
            <li>so maybe that&#x27;s why its not as effective..</li>
            <li>Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>but this is much much better.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers of this product are whining about the price.</li>
            <li>He uses it after shaving and most nights.</li>
            <li>Both do the job, I would say the Min solution is more drying</li>
            <li>I have been waxing for many years</li>
            <li>but it sure is better than this</li>
            <li>I love the roll-on feature of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My skin not only LOOKS good, but it also feels good.</li>
            <li>Overall good product, does what it claims!</li>
            <li>The roller ball makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Tend Skin used to be the best hands down</li>
            <li>It does have a nice scent and it does not have much of a sting.</li>
            <li>everything otc available at stores.</li>
            <li>Im literally bump free, my girlfriends my friends have all noticed.</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic for preventing ingrown hairs and razor bumps in the bikini area.</li>
            <li>Use the MNYS2 right after shaving and also 2 more times a day every day to start, until skin clears.  </li>
            <li>+ After the initial sting, it leaves a nice tingly feeling :)  + Also available is a refill bottle and use that to refill the roller ball applicator (it&#x27;s a bit cheaper per oz.)    </li>
            <li>Shave against-yes, against-the direction of hair growth for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I love that you can purchase the refill bottle for economic refills.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the applicator is handy to use and creates no mess</li>
            <li>I;ve tried everything magic shave, tend skin, bump free pretty much</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that this product will work great on razor bumps which is the most common cause of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>The product works, and I am grateful to be free from razor bumps for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly as it is supposed to...keeps the hairs out from skin!  </li>
            <li>After the MNYS2 dries apply baby oil, also 2 more times a day every day to start until skin clear.</li>
            <li>Its defiantly worth its price.</li>
            <li>however, it&#x27;s totally worth it because it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>and WOW he looked so much better.  </li>
            <li>so i kept trying it for about about two weeks both at night and right after my shave.</li>
            <li>I had read other reviews that really said this was the best go-to for ingrown hairs, especially pubic hair.</li>
            <li>Do note that at first it did sting a bit but that stops after a couple days use.    </li>
            <li>As someone who has been plagued with razor bumps for over a decade, I was amazed to discover that this was the first product to truly eliminate them.  </li>
            <li>once it dries it is pretty well gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been several dermatologists and tried numerous creams and remedies, all of which have not been successful.</li>
            <li>I already bought 2 more; wish they had them in bigger bottles!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, also use PFB vanish.</li>
            <li>Ive tried so many different ingrown hair products</li>
            <li>And it gets rid of them really fast-</li>
            <li>but the end result is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>I really thought this wiuld be the product for me</li>
            <li>For me, the onlly solution is to pluck them out when they are ready.</li>
            <li>So when i tried this product, i was very hesitant.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>However, I took a chance with this solution based off of the other reviews and I am glad that I did.   </li>
            <li>I do not know exactly what the science is behind the product, but the good reviews on here hold up.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My regimen now is to use an inexpensive shaving cream for sensitive skin and a GOOD more expensive razor,  and designate it for shaving in that area only.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a solid product worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this was the least effective</li>
            <li>Especially in the areas on my face that are super sensitive which are my neck and my chin.</li>
            <li>(After skin clears use both right after shaving and once daily as well on days you do not shave.)</li>
            <li>If you have tried everything and given up on finding anything that works, TRY MIN NEW YORK SOLUTIONS2.</li>
            <li>but nothings worked like The Min New York Solution2.</li>
            <li>This is definitely better than any other topical treatments I&#x27;ve used (hydrocortisone worked well too</li>
            <li>As a guy who shaves frequently, I would always get ingrown hairs on my neck after shaving--but not anymore!  </li>
            <li>I thought this was the exact same product</li>
            <li>The only drawbacks are the price (it is a bit pricey) and a quick stinging (that of alcohol on an open cut).  </li>
            <li>Look no further, it may be on the expensive side but the benefits greatly outweigh the costs.</li>
            <li>and WOW does it work.  </li>
            <li>I have been washing my face and using goold old fashioned Vaseline.</li>
            <li>Also, i have really sensitive skin, so maybe thats the problem here.</li>
            <li>It was so frustrating and unnattractive, and I have tried every kind of over the counter cream and medication I could think of over the years.  </li>
            <li>Right off the bat it seemed to make my razor burn even worse and more red and tender.</li>
            <li>Also if you have razor bumps give it ONE day and you will see a major difference!</li>
            <li>it goes on very easy, but it stinks at first</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much as Tend</li>
            <li>What I have discovered is that ingrown hairs really like dry skin.</li>
            <li>I guess, if you have dark thick hair this product will work better on smaller body parts.</li>
            <li>product has a nice minty smell and you can definitely feel a slight burn if there is any broken skin.</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s no need for a long review here.  </li>
            <li> Does dry skin out a lot, just fyi.</li>
            <li> I am a male who likes to keep things groomed down there - and I do shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black male who&#x27;s being struggling with ingrown hairs on my bearded area for years.</li>
            <li> but it was a little different.</li>
            <li> The product helped me to become a daily shaver after I had trouble with burns and bumps.  </li>
            <li> They also say they saw a big difference after a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful after reading reviews of how well it helped other people&#x27;s razor burns.</li>
            <li> Other than that, im not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> &quot; He&#x27;s been using it for a few months now after every shave and has absolutely no ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> when im sitting down and sweating and this product also has prevented that too.</li>
            <li> This has slowed down the amount of ingrown hairs I have and makes pulling out the ones that do exist easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I say immediately I mean the second you finish shaving.</li>
            <li> I see &lt;10% less ingrown hairs, not what others have said about having a waxed look at all.</li>
            <li> If you compare the ingredients of this to Tendskin, this has less ingredients</li>
            <li> but this is definitely less messy).</li>
            <li> and it burns a little.  </li>
            <li> it keeps the bumps away and down!</li>
            <li> after a few days of application of this stuff...</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought 6 and gave a few of them as gifts to my brothers.  </li>
            <li> I think a lot of the product goes to waste on the ball and the lid..</li>
            <li> and it smells pretty bad as well.</li>
            <li> I have thick brown hair and while this keeps the redness down</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with ingrown hairs and severe irritation when shaving my bikini area, which actually left me unable to wear swimsuits without a cover up anyway.  </li>
            <li> No more ingrown hairs and no more irritation.</li>
            <li> , that is no more.</li>
            <li> No more razor bumps, burns or ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> The smell isnt bad and doesnt last very long-</li>
            <li> Now, a lot of people would say that&#x27;s common sense</li>
            <li> Only down side is it does sting a bit, which is expected, and it smells terrible</li>
            <li> I have always had really bad razor burn and tried different ways to reduce it</li>
            <li> Or if not, your razor burn will be worse then if you did not use it.....</li>
            <li> As a woman, this is obviously frustrating.</li>
            <li> Just left me frustrated!</li>
            <li> Maybe someday ill find something that helps with my razor burn!</li>
            <li> He gets painful razor bumps all the time...</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was that ever stupid.</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit, nothing horrible though.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with ingrown hairs and severe irritation when shaving my bikini area, which actually left me unable to wear swimsuits without a cover up anyway.  It was so frustrating and unnattractive, and I have tried every kind of over the counter cream and medication I could think of over the years.  I saw this product on Amazon last year but hesitated because of the price. Was that ever stupid. I finally ordered the product this year and WOW does it work.  This is a God send.  No more ingrown hairs and no more irritation. NONE. And I shave that area daily now.  With the roller ball you do not use a lot of the product so it lasts quite a long time.  Do note that at first it did sting a bit but that stops after a couple days use.    My regimen now is to use an inexpensive shaving cream for sensitive skin and a GOOD more expensive razor,  and designate it for shaving in that area only. Shave against-yes, against-the direction of hair growth for a clean shave. Use the MNYS2 right after shaving and also 2 more times a day every day to start, until skin clears.  After the MNYS2 dries apply baby oil, also 2 more times a day every day to start until skin clear. (After skin clears use both right after shaving and once daily as well on days you do not shave.) Also, when showering every day use a round bath scrubbie with body wash to gently wash the area in all directions to exfoliate and inhibit ingrown hairs as well.</li>
            <li> As someone who has been plagued with razor bumps for over a decade, I was amazed to discover that this was the first product to truly eliminate them.  After using this product, I noticed its effects almost overnight!  There&#x27;s no need for a long review here.  The product works, and I am grateful to be free from razor bumps for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I have used Tend Skin for about 6 years now but since finding this, that is no more. Tend Skin used to be the best hands down but this is much much better. I don&#x27;t even remember how I found out about this product to be honest with you but I&#x27;m glad I found it! It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as much as Tend Skin did and it keeps the bumps away and down! Also if you have razor bumps give it ONE day and you will see a major difference! Just try it. I can&#x27;t see how anyone would regret it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!  If you have tried everything and given up on finding anything that works, TRY MIN NEW YORK SOLUTIONS2. It works fantastically. Period.The smell isnt bad and doesnt last very long- once it dries it is pretty well gone. My skin not only LOOKS good, but it also feels good. This is a MUST for the bikini area!</li>
            <li> I have had razor bump problems for a while. The hair on my face just grows in different directions.  However, I took a chance with this solution based off of the other reviews and I am glad that I did.   It works rolls on like some ol&#x27; school deodorant.  You can actually feel it working.  The only thing that I would recommend is that you use it the day you shave and the day after as well.  Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews that really said this was the best go-to for ingrown hairs, especially pubic hair. I am a male who likes to keep things groomed down there - and I do shave. I have thick brown hair and while this keeps the redness down and I would say overall I see &lt;10% less ingrown hairs, not what others have said about having a waxed look at all. Good shaving practices are more effective. It does have a nice scent and it does not have much of a sting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from ingrown hairs for years(bikini area and underarms). I&#x27;ve been several dermatologists and tried numerous creams and remedies, all of which have not been successful. My current dermatologist now admits that only laser hair removal will remedy my situation. So I figured I&#x27;d give this stuff a try until I can afford the laser removal. While it does not stop the bumps from coming, it has definitely reduced the amount that shows up after shaving/waxing. And it gets rid of them really fast- w/n days! This is definitely better than any other topical treatments I&#x27;ve used (hydrocortisone worked well too but this is definitely less messy). It does sting a bit, nothing horrible though. I put it on immediately after hair removal and a day or two after that. Does dry skin out a lot, just fyi.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers of this product are whining about the price. Well they agreed to pay the price before they purchased the product.  Go figure.  The product is excellent.  I do not know exactly what the science is behind the product, but the good reviews on here hold up.  The product helped me to become a daily shaver after I had trouble with burns and bumps.  Nice minty/alkaline feel on the skin.  Bravo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually give it 4.5 stars.  As a guy who shaves frequently, I would always get ingrown hairs on my neck after shaving--but not anymore!  This product does exactly as it is supposed to...keeps the hairs out from skin!  The only drawbacks are the price (it is a bit pricey) and a quick stinging (that of alcohol on an open cut).  Here&#x27;s my breakdown:    Pros:  + Effective!  + After the initial sting, it leaves a nice tingly feeling :)  + Also available is a refill bottle and use that to refill the roller ball applicator (it&#x27;s a bit cheaper per oz.)    Cons:  - Price  - Stinging immediately after application    Overall good product, does what it claims!</li>
            <li> Initially, I bought this solution to help me with ingrown hair after using epilator, the result - didn&#x27;t help at all so I gave it to my husband since he was complaining about ingrown hairs on his neck. A week later he said and I quote: \\&quot;It was a best gift you ever gave me\\&quot; He&#x27;s been using it for a few months now after every shave and has absolutely no ingrown hairs. I gave it another try and now I&#x27;m using it on my underarms, it works wonders! No more razor bumps, burns or ingrown hair. I guess, if you have dark thick hair this product will work better on smaller body parts. I already bought 2 more; wish they had them in bigger bottles!</li>
            <li> I had a product similar to this at one time, it worked wonders. I thought this was the exact same product but it was a little different. However the product works well, the only suggestion I have is to put it immediately on after shaving. Now, a lot of people would say that&#x27;s common sense but when I say immediately I mean the second you finish shaving. Or if not, your razor burn will be worse then if you did not use it.....Otherwise, a solid product worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product does not stand up to it apposing duties It does not do what it is suppose to do</li>
            <li> I get this stuff for my boyfriend. He&#x27;s been using it for about a year now he has had great results. He ran out for a couple weeks and you could definitely tell. He uses it after shaving and most nights. It starts working immediately and almost erases the red bumps and irritation. Plus prevents about 90% of ingrowns. Only down side is it does sting a bit, which is expected, and it smells terrible but I definitely recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I have always had really bad razor burn and tried different ways to reduce it but nothings worked like The Min New York Solution2. It does have a bit of a sting to it once you put it on but the end result is very pleasing. I not only get razor burn after I shave but my skin will get irrated in the summer when im sitting down and sweating and this product also has prevented that too. Its defiantly worth its price.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this. I was hopeful after reading reviews of how well it helped other people&#x27;s razor burns. For me, it did nothing. No bump reduction, no redness eliminator. Maybe it&#x27;ll work better for you than it did for me!</li>
            <li> It worked for a while then it had no effect. I really thought this wiuld be the product for me but it was definitely not! Guess I&#x27;ll try tend skin</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my boyfriend. He gets painful razor bumps all the time...after a few days of application of this stuff...he&#x27;s happy no pain or irritation and smooth neck! Thank you! Will defiantly order again soon</li>
            <li> I am a woman and I purchased this because I had begun to get ingrown hairs under my chin. As a woman, this is obviously frustrating. The bottom line is that this product will work great on razor bumps which is the most common cause of ingrown hairs. Razor bumps weren&#x27;t my issue. The hairs just freakin&#x27; came ot of nowhere! For me, the onlly solution is to pluck them out when they are ready. What I have discovered is that ingrown hairs really like dry skin. I have been washing my face and using goold old fashioned Vaseline. This has slowed down the amount of ingrown hairs I have and makes pulling out the ones that do exist easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a nice minty smell and you can definitely feel a slight burn if there is any broken skin. It feels like it would be great for razor bumps bbut does not prevent the growth of ingrown hairs, which was my reason for its purchase.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, also use PFB vanish. Both do the job, I would say the Min solution is more drying so if you prefer that go with Min, if not go with the PFB.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black male who&#x27;s being struggling with ingrown hairs on my bearded area for years. I;ve tried everything magic shave, tend skin, bump free pretty much everything otc available at stores. I&#x27;ve even been to dermatologists and been prescribed antibiotics and prescription creams. I&#x27;ve used every different razor electric or manual you can think of. NOTHING compares to this. I received the product about two a week ago. Im literally bump free, my girlfriends my friends have all noticed. If you&#x27;re like me and struggled with this for years. Look no further, it may be on the expensive side but the benefits greatly outweigh the costs. This product is a god send.</li>
            <li> So i have tried both this product and tend skin, and had mixed results. Tend Skin worked for about three weeks wonderfully, then began to really burn my skin. Especially in the areas on my face that are super sensitive which are my neck and my chin. So when i tried this product, i was very hesitant. Right off the bat it seemed to make my razor burn even worse and more red and tender. I hoped that i possibly just needed to get used to solution 2 so i kept trying it for about about two weeks both at night and right after my shave. It never worked. Just left me frustrated! Also, i have really sensitive skin, so maybe thats the problem here. A waste of money for me though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing i did like was the roll on application of it. Makes applying the product very simple. Other than that, im not a fan of this product. Maybe someday ill find something that helps with my razor burn! Hope this helps! The search continues..........</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only solution I&#x27;ve found that actually works.  I&#x27;ve used a lot but this one nails it.  I bought 6 and gave a few of them as gifts to my brothers.  They also say they saw a big difference after a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> this is the best post-wax treatment to prevent ingrown hairs in the bikini area, or anywhere else.  it goes on very easy, but it stinks at first and it burns a little.  however, it&#x27;s totally worth it because it works like a charm.  and if you have any ingrown hairs already, it dries them out and heals them within 1-2 days.    the only drawback is the size.  i wish there were more in the bottle for this price!</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for many years and I always had problems with ingrown hair. I have been using Min Solution 2 for several weeks and I am very pleased with the result. The irritation of the skin and the ingrown hair have reduced by about 80%. I will continue using this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for Afro-American friend with bumps on his face from ingrown hairs.  Saw him a week later and WOW he looked so much better.  It is really amazing results.  This stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;He washed his face with sulfur soap in morning and applied Solution 2 with Q-Tips. Then washed with sulfur soap at bedtime and applied Tend Skin with Q-tips at night.  The results speak for themselves.  Good product...good results.</li>
            <li> After using the product for maybe 4 or 5 days, the ingrown hair that has been bothering me for weeks finally got close enough to the surface for me to pick it out! I have no idea how this works, but it does! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with that product. It work awesome. Will buy that again!  all my in- grow hair disappeared. A+</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think anything could, but it actually reduces redness and bumps by about 90%, I don&#x27;t know what I did without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Ive tried so many different ingrown hair products and I have to say this was the least effective and it smells pretty bad as well. It actually does nothing, I applied it regularly for a while and nothing changed. If you compare the ingredients of this to Tendskin, this has less ingredients so maybe that&#x27;s why its not as effective..??&lt;br /&gt;Tendskin isnt the miracle that I had hoped for either but it sure is better than this and I&#x27;m sticking to it.&lt;br /&gt;Although the applicator is handy to use and creates no mess I think a lot of the product goes to waste on the ball and the lid..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and it is fantastic for preventing ingrown hairs and razor bumps in the bikini area. The roller ball makes it easy to use. I love that you can purchase the refill bottle for economic refills.</li>
            <li> I love the roll-on feature of this stuff.  It&#x27;s so much easier and less wasteful than using cotton pads that other razor bump treatments require.  Also, it is quick and effective at treating in-grown hairs and great for prevention!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I use epilator to remove hair on legs and I do not shave. I bought this product to just solve the ingrown hair problem, but it doesn&#x27;t work well. Disappointed.</li>
