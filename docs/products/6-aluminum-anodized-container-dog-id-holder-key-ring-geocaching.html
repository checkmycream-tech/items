            <li>if they don&#x27;t unscrew for him, it&#x27;s a good testimonial.  </li>

            <li>loved all the colors.</li>
            <li>The items were good quality.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It has a good o-ring seal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these fobs have came into good use.</li>
            <li>Needed something handy to carry them around, and this was a great option.  </li>
            <li>good, uses a good seal.</li>
            <li>and they are a good quality and value.  </li>
            <li>The shell is a fairly thin-walled vessle with a mini plastic capped vile inside.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>They are a good buy.</li>
            <li>A great item for geocachers and a really nice price.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was remarkably good.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Some of the \\&quot;O\\&quot; rings aren&#x27;t as good as others, but it serves its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nephew loved them so had to give him one.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with these</li>
            <li>nicely made and good design.  </li>
            <li>You could hide many items inside!</li>
            <li>However, i am beyond pleased with these!</li>
            <li>And if it does happen to break, well, I&#x27;ve got 5 more. :P</li>
            <li>The price was amazing for the set.</li>
            <li>-Amazing bargain for price.  </li>
            <li>As I said, for the price these are simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>when batteries are out - and you need them handy - this seems to be be the answer.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this set of six pill holders so my wife and I would have a handy place to store some emergency cash.  </li>
            <li>This comes in handy while out and about.</li>
            <li>Nice that there&#x27;s a color selection.</li>
            <li>and will probably hold up nicely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a nice product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Nice, sturdy aircraft grade aluminum, too.</li>
            <li>nice idea.</li>
            <li>This is a nice deal for what it is.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, the tubes are still very nice just if you attach it to a collar be sure to do it securely!</li>
            <li>I originally was searching for another use; however found this to be a great item.  </li>
            <li>Need to carry full strength aspirin and saw this set of waterproof (I checked) pill holders at a great price.</li>
            <li>these are handy but not the most well-manufactured.  </li>
            <li>Great product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Size is suitable for keychain.</li>
            <li>I think that chapstick size would be good because you could fit four pills</li>
            <li>Everyone in my family got their own color and no fighting because there were so many to chose from.</li>
            <li>Luckily I haven&#x27;t needed it yet, but it&#x27;s nice to know I have a cash backup!</li>
            <li>It does take some finesse to get a bill to fit, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s easy!!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li>very light and water proof.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are very light weight aluminum and the treading is ok for what they are.  </li>
            <li>They may not be as good as genuine \\&quot;bison\\&quot; tubes, but when you can get 6 for the price of one \\&quot;bison\\&quot; tube, they will work just fine.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t put pills in it for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably give one more away and keep 3 to myself.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful item for mediation management with several sizes.  </li>
            <li>I will order more when the time is needed.</li>
            <li>are many uses for these.</li>
            <li>love them.</li>
            <li>They are a better quality</li>
            <li>then what I have bought in stores for more money for just one.</li>
            <li>People love them.</li>
            <li>Place two bills on top of each other.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought these.          </li>
            <li>I wish there were more pictures and measurements though.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this inexpensive package of what cachers call bison tubes.</li>
            <li>Whatever you use them for, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find they work well.</li>
            <li>Some camo colors or matte finishes would make them even better.</li>
            <li>Most of the time, I would rather something a bit more subdued</li>
            <li>the product description indicates, these containers can be used for many purposes.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need that many, or don&#x27;t have a dog, you can always use them as zipper pulls, or give them away.</li>
            <li>Okay if your medication is of &amp;#34;small size;.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need all 6, but was glad I bought the set.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.    </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll find many uses for the others.  </li>
            <li>At $5.95 for six this is a great buy; at $5.95 each - not so much.  </li>
            <li>They ALMOST fit!  </li>
            <li>These are the perfect size, not too big.</li>
            <li>I have shared them all with friends during this healthy heart month.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Cheap cost, sturdy and nice colors.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a rubber gasket between the screw top and the bottom so these will stay waterproof.</li>
            <li>so they have a lot more room.  </li>
            <li>I am sure we will still use them.</li>
            <li>Others seem to be OK.</li>
            <li>After using these, I will probably order more.  </li>
            <li>However they are OK for many uses.  </li>
            <li>I pre-filled each one with my &amp;#34;emergency rations&amp;#34; of pills (the ones I might need if I have more severe pain that day) and snap one onto my work lanyard each day.</li>
            <li>hold shut wonderfully; have never had one accidentally open.</li>
            <li>Most of the items were scratched and made improperly.</li>
            <li>also I wanted to be able to carry emergency money with me</li>
            <li>This is a lot better than depending upon ziplock bags when you&#x27;re going mobile.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a pretty good</li>
            <li>Good for your purse, first aid kit, or anything you take with you on the go.</li>
            <li>These pill holders are pretty good.</li>
            <li>For the price its a good buy and the colors are cute, my kids swooped up on them fast.</li>
            <li>These were perfect, and shipped faster than expected.</li>
            <li>but they were cheap and cute, and still are.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve come in pretty handy on many an occasion.  </li>
            <li>I carry two Tylenol gel-caps in 1 container, I wrap them with a bit of plastic wrap to keep them somewhat protected and so far this has worked great.  </li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t fit many medications.  </li>
            <li>Cool product!</li>
            <li>Not bad, but one of the pill holders keeps opening and the pills fall out!  </li>
            <li>Easy to place in trees  are on a fence.</li>
            <li>threads squeal a bit, goes away easily with some WD-40&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can easily slip a piece of paper with temporary contact info (campsite number, car/trailer license plate, friend or family member&#x27;s address and phone, as well as the dates we will be at that location).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can easily get two (2) US dollar sized bills in it without the vial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this way, no one can easily read my address just by looking .......&lt;</li>
            <li>The color is easily scratched off and over time, all of the keychains are silver.</li>
            <li>the lid breaks easily</li>
            <li>The coating on the containers flakes off and scratches easy.  </li>
            <li>The colors make recognition easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and quite sturdy.</li>
            <li>Works fine without the liner.  </li>
            <li>All 6 were fine</li>
            <li>, didn&#x27;t find any shavings, all threads were fine.</li>
            <li>We used these for Geocaching logs and all of these worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I was impressed when I saw this lot of six bison tubes for less than a dollar piece.</li>
            <li>They worked out just fine.</li>
            <li>They work just fine.</li>
            <li>and I think they will work just fine for me.</li>
            <li>They have not been placed yet, but seem to be fine for their intended use.  </li>
            <li>Mine were all fine.</li>
            <li>They are not the $8 each style, but have done just fine for our use.  </li>
            <li>These little containers are perfect for storing pills.</li>
            <li>Perfect little keychain cases.</li>
            <li>Great price on them, especially when they are ordered with something else so you can get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Not even a tylenol will fit.</li>
            <li>you can fit in it.</li>
            <li>o-rings are genuinely waterproof</li>
            <li>Four (4) PowerOne #10 batteries can fit in the plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>will fit a rolled up $20 bill to keep on your key-chain for no-wallet emergencies.</li>
            <li>but sometimes you do have to hide a micro these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the Obsession of Geocaching.    </li>
            <li>It can fit about 4-5 medium sized pills in it.</li>
            <li>My meds wouldn&#x27;t fit in it..</li>
            <li>I paid a cheap price for these.</li>
            <li>I wrote to customer service about this and today received a response that suggested that I could purchase another set of capsules in order to get another silver one (which has not affected our dog&#x27;s fur) and they would ship them for free.  </li>
            <li>The vial won&#x27;t even fit one pill.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of uses for the bottles, a bill or two will fit inside if you fold them well.</li>
            <li>Definitely cheap</li>
            <li>Free shipping is a bonus.</li>
            <li>I did find that 1 caplet (elongated) aspirin will fit in it.  </li>
            <li>The extras I put on the kids&#x27; bags and filled with allergy meds just in case.</li>
            <li>These are very compact, nice if you need to take a pill with a meal</li>
            <li>I took them all out, as even my smallest pills don&#x27;t fit in there.</li>
            <li>Had to cut advil in two to fit inside.  </li>
            <li>I could fit four pills instead of 2.  </li>
            <li>If you remove the plastic vial, you can easily fit 2.  </li>
            <li>THese are useful for many things.</li>
            <li>to the dimensions (all in inches) since this was the most important deciding factor for me, I thought it was worth adding here for everyone</li>
            <li>I find these to be very useful.</li>
            <li>It could be very useful.  </li>
            <li>Fit well on keychain, not too bulky and was worried that folded bill would be hard to fit in, but fits perfect.  </li>
            <li>They are perfect for hiding in small areas and claim to be waterproofed.</li>
            <li>After seeing all the reviews about how small it was i thought it would be perfect for cat tags.</li>
            <li>I found these containers &amp; thought \\&quot;There&#x27;s got to be something cool &amp; crafty</li>
            <li>I had originally wanted to buy a cash-stash version of this device.  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, but if you wanted to be more discreet, the silver would blend in with your keys and not be too noticeable.</li>
            <li>This concept of this product is excellent, however, it is just too small.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with them so far.</li>
            <li>At first I was very excited to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>For extra fun, you can mix &amp; match the tops and bottoms for great color combinations.</li>
            <li>These are good quality, but I actually bought them to take on vacation hoping I could fit money in them.  </li>
            <li>And the fun colors make it easy to find.</li>
            <li>they are tiny, but did find a good use..</li>
            <li>Good price, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the reasonable price for them</li>
            <li>I found this to be true and just cleaned them out with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product, I just wish that they were cheaper.</li>
            <li>top screws on and off fine; no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>Extremely lightweight, great for emergency situations where you need your medication, aspirin, or whatever else</li>
            <li>cracked quickly.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected and definately a great product.  </li>
            <li>But overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>They are smaller than you might expect, I was able to fit two full sized pills inside with no room for anything else.</li>
            <li>They make great mini caches with their water tight seals.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and they were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The little plastic bottle insert is great because it keep the pills from getting too banged around.  </li>
            <li>I still think they&#x27;re great little capsules</li>
            <li>These are some great little containers.</li>
            <li>These are good, cheap, little containers.</li>
            <li>They are also cheaply made with the little plastic caps that don&#x27;t seem to provide a good seal.</li>
            <li>what I will do with these) will be great for carrying a day&#x27;s dose of meds and vitamins that I take, but I would not put it on my keychain, as it might be too heavy or cumbersome.</li>
            <li>These sounded good at the time, but I never really found a use for them.  </li>
            <li>The downside with this of course is the smaller volume available for pills.&lt;br /&gt;The metal fob has a O-ring on the top to help keep air and water out of the inside as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can take the vial out and then there is a bit more room in the container, still not sure what it would be good for, besides being pretty.</li>
            <li>The inner container is also nice.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what quality was going to be, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Very nice little pill holders if you need to carry pills with you.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a great product - just be aware that you can&#x27;t fit a whole lot in this little capsule.</li>
            <li>Good threads on the main capsule and solid connection to the key-chain loop.  </li>
            <li>i was looking for, and priced right.</li>
            <li>the price was right and they are water proof</li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>Inside diameter is just right, and it holds 4 tablets.  </li>
            <li>These water tight containers make great geocaches or would be good for anything else that needs to be water tight.</li>
            <li>have the bill facing you right side up --&amp;#62</li>
            <li>It took some work to find the right folding to make it work.</li>
            <li>just the right size for a 20.00 bill for emergency or advil.</li>
            <li>We threw all of them out right away and bought a plastic one from the grocery store.</li>
            <li>Though it was nice of them to offer, I won&#x27;t bother with either the partial or the full refund.  </li>
            <li>Though it was nice of them to offer, I won&#x27;t bother with either the partial or the full refund.  </li>
            <li>Great little keychains!  </li>
            <li>Its great for keeping a large bill hidden away in any bag for that &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34</li>
            <li>/&gt;-A US bill fits easily inside after being folded lengthwise and rolled, two will fit if you&#x27;re determined.&lt;br /&gt;-Without the inner vial, a couple gelcaps or</li>
            <li>They are not big, more like the size of your finger, but adequate to get the job done and keep the critters out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>handy but make sure you only have smaller tablets or items to carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>They are quite small and didn&#x27;t work for that, but they are great for their intended use (pill holder).</li>
            <li>but these are great for small geocaches.</li>
            <li>Great for putting I car or bag and hold small things well.</li>
            <li>Construction was not bad, though it is a very lightweight, inexpensive item.</li>
            <li>And the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li>Not over the top upset, just a little bummed since my favorite color is purple.</li>
            <li>Liked the price for a &amp;#34;6 pack&amp;#34; of these containers, even though I really wanted only 3 (will donate the others during a meet &amp; greet).</li>
            <li>Perfect for storing anything small you need to take on the road - They each have a little glass vile inside that makes adding and removing products easy, and the top is slightly magnified to stick to the top, so there is no rattling inside.</li>
            <li>I recieved my order very fast and without any problems.  </li>
            <li>We like these very much.  </li>
            <li>Nice little pill bottles the plastic bottle inside is small but the outside one works great and for the price they are worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>The description is exact.</li>
            <li>The items were exactly as promised, thanks for helping to spread the rage of geocaching!</li>
            <li>The liner is nice, but he needed to remove it in order for even small pills to fit.  </li>
            <li>In the case that I may lose one off my key chain, I love have 5 spare.</li>
            <li>These seem a bit on the cheap side, but so far they do the job as advertised.  </li>
            <li>They arrived exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>they are very convienent they are really worth the money.</li>
            <li>set comes in various colors so can be shared, or if you have more than one medication, you can color code them.</li>
            <li>However i rated them as 4 stars because they are exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>have now ordered these containers several times and I keep coming back for more as I place more hides.  </li>
            <li>Product description was exactly as it came.</li>
            <li>This case protects them from damage pretty well and at about a buck a piece you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li>my purposes, it needed only one small modification to be perfect.  </li>
            <li>so I was really glad to have this on my key chain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m awaiting further response from customer service and will update this when I hear more.  </li>
            <li>Smaller vial inside to small for my use, but the outer canister will be perfect as a geocache container.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re better machined and don&#x27;t need the inner vial</li>
            <li>It has a case on the inside so my only option was to take out the case to make more room for my capsule.</li>
            <li>I had not planned to use the vial and knew from experience that the outer tubes seal pretty well</li>
            <li>I did read a review that they sometimes have metal shaving in them when you first receive them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Cannister would be better without smaller plastic insert on the inside.  </li>
            <li>Came exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li>This item is suitable for such a purpose, however I highly recommend purchasing it from here.</li>
            <li>I have to take a thyroid pill every day and filled several of these with 5 days worth of pills.</li>
            <li>My one reservation is that they seem easy to cross thread when putting them together.  </li>
            <li>To easily tell them apart , the containers come in six different colors.  </li>
            <li>So, by placing 1 pill in the capsule, and another in the cap, then screwing them together, these pill holders easily hold 2 standard size liquid or gel caps.  </li>
            <li>I easily attached it to the inner zipper in my purse.</li>
            <li>The jump rings were a bit large for our needs</li>
            <li>So without the inside vial I had no difficulty storing two large Ibuprofen 800 mg tablets inside.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re nice and water tight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m fine with the size, and would rather carry two of them on my keys than 1 big bulky</li>
            <li>Still though, getting 6 of these for a lower price than 1 good quality one is hard to pass.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can fit in the pill bottle is a 81mg asprin.</li>
            <li>With several colors, I got \\&quot;my\\&quot; colors and shared the rest with family and friends that enjoy the features of this item.  </li>
            <li>but you can only fit max 3 pills.  </li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t gentle with his keys, so</li>
            <li>This was much cheaper than buying the $6 dollar cash stash.</li>
            <li>Recommend this product for any and all Geocachers that like to make Cachers really hunt for the prize.</li>
            <li>Finally I gave them away as cheap pranks to friends.</li>
            <li>They were really grateful and plan to start buying them to give to others who lose a pet.</li>
            <li>I roll up a strip of paper about an inch wide and insert it into the top of the aluminum housing before screwing the housing shut.  </li>
            <li>The metal seems to be holding up very well.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and</li>
            <li>really does hold money, but i wouldn&#x27;t put a $50 or $100 in these -</li>
            <li>So mission accomplished using these at 1/2 the cost and getting (6) vs (1).</li>
            <li>These pill holders work very well for taking Meds on the go.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these pill holders to use as a device to carry my important medical information.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I just carry two in my pocket which isn&#x27;t really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not certain if that is safe</li>
            <li>This item isn&#x27;t prefect, but it certainly does it&#x27;s job decently.  </li>
            <li>It would work for many other meds though (blood pressure, migraine, baby ASA etc depending on the size/type of the pill).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now if there&#x27;s ever any kind of emergency I&#x27;ve got at least 5 days of my medicine on me pretty much at all times.</li>
            <li>There is a key hook on the pill tubes and inside of each tube is a super tiny clear glass vile with a screw top.</li>
            <li>Coloration is nice, haven&#x27;t owned them long enough to know if the coloring will fade or not.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought they were a bit big for my purpose, but I actually prefer the size now as I can quickly tell if the bottom&#x27;s deattached - I keep the extras in the trailer so I can replace a lost one quickly while traveling.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even fit a single large pill in it.  </li>
            <li>all, not a bad buy if you want to throw some meds in these and put them in various places (car, keychain, edc bag).</li>
            <li>After two weeks of carrying it on my keychain it hasn&#x27;t worked loose and seems fine.</li>
            <li>a few of mine have the threads to the lid not cut well, easy to cross-threat, and easy to come apart if not properly cinched to the o-ring.  </li>
            <li>Fold this piece in half (top to bottom)&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>I ended up returning these and buying a half dozen of the vials from CVS - admittedly, that cost a chunk more.</li>
            <li>These are decent quality and have a rubber o-ring.</li>
            <li>I am able to hold nine aleve in each one, 5 of my bigger vitamins, and a lot of my smaller ones.</li>
            <li>I had a wooden pill case that these replace, the top of the wood key was always coming undone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;inside depth of main body &#x3D; 1.107</li>
            <li>Bonus was the plastic pill holder key chain actually holds more pills.</li>
            <li>problem is they are not very sturdy or strong.</li>
            <li>Yes I made sure that is was tight when I screwed it together.</li>
            <li>I probably had too high expectations for them, given the price, but there you go.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Handy on car keys, mail box keys and any other key ring.  </li>
            <li>The little bottles are cute and seemingly weatherproof.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance that my tiny hearing aid batteries would fit this, inside the little plastic bottle (and if not they would certainly fit in the aluminum container without the plastic</li>
            <li>Old age requires more pills than the average pharmacy.</li>
            <li>i always forget to take my allergy pills a few miles down the road after leaving home so these help out greatly.</li>
            <li>The key ring makes it easy to hang the container in various places.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually going to go right now and order another set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not on a ton of prescription medication, but other than nitro, I don&#x27;t know what would fit in there.</li>
            <li>These are a great little travel item - and much cheaper than the other similar products out there.</li>
            <li>Other pills can fit without the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Nice assortment and solid little pill cases.</li>
            <li>all of the colors shown, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>The single daily med and the allery capsule could fit, but the Advil was too large.</li>
            <li>nice little pill holders water tight and easy to carry around just put one on my key ring</li>
            <li>The aluminum housing is easily spray painted, but I wish they were sold in matte black.  </li>
            <li>The pills have to be pretty small to fit.</li>
            <li>I love these little holders!</li>
            <li>I only have 4 left, from the grand total of 12 that I had.</li>
            <li>How dare they take a simple item like this that market it for that purpose and charge so much for it!</li>
            <li>Colors were consistent over entire tube (colors look just like the picture).</li>
            <li>I love the idea around the pill holder but it only holds one baby aspirin, next time i&#x27;ll chose the larger one.</li>
            <li>It has a big enough space for a bill rolled up, but make sure that the bill doesn&#x27;t get lodged into the back of the case.  </li>
            <li>These holders are exactly what I needed for my pills -- I have stashed them in various places in case</li>
            <li>I have small pills that will easily fit inside, but they are a bit large for my cats.</li>
            <li>They are light being plastic and will accommodate small pills easily, but not large ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;these are worth the cost but too small to be really useful...</li>
            <li>The pill holders are perfect for holding a small item, mine have a little extra cash in them stashed in different places, my car glove box, backpack etc.</li>
            <li>However, if you ignore the small pill case and just put the pill into the key fob, then it should be able to hold a little more</li>
            <li>Bluntly, the man is essentially a human entropy field and he brings decay to pretty much everything he touches - that these things have survived years of his daily use speaks volumes to how well they are made.</li>
            <li>I forget to take my pills, as well as carry one on my keychain (see True Utility TU45 Stainless Steel Key Ring System Key Organizer by the same company).  </li>
            <li>the clear pill capsule doesn&#x27;t seem large enough for alot of pills today.</li>
            <li>A little smaller than I thought but works great to hold 4 hearing aid batteries on my keychains or a few aspirin or tylenol.</li>
            <li>If you have other medications, you may be limited in fitting them in.</li>
            <li>the clear container(that is inside the color tube)screw</li>
            <li>It is clear and has a screw cap, I think it would be used to store liquids.</li>
            <li>and if I can&#x27;t get another silver one I think I&#x27;ll try painting one of the colored ones with clear nail polish to see if that solves the problem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try the clear nail polish solution and leave it at that.ible.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try the clear nail polish solution and leave it at that.</li>
            <li>They come with a clear, tubular insert that I took out and use separately for nano caches.</li>
            <li>a few tablets would fit inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the old barrel ID containers for my dogs on camping and/or day trips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested these at home for about 3 weeks now, and the 1 yr old dog unscrewed hers about 1-1/2 weeks in</li>
            <li>use mine to contain lactase pills for my lactose intolerance, and since they&#x27;re in capsules anyway, I discard the vial and just use the pill holder directly.  </li>
            <li>Unfortuately these were just too tiny to hold much at all.</li>
            <li>Were surprised to find an enclosed plastic bottle inside the cylinders, which will help keep the pills waterproof.</li>
            <li>What I had really wanted was to either acquire another silver capsule or buy a second order that would be all silver capsules.  </li>
            <li>threading on the bottle is very coarse and the lid doesn&#x27;t really stay on well&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I chose four stars because more consideration in the design could&#x27;ve been given to the inside diameter size with respect to common pill sizes.  </li>
            <li>The tiny plastic vial inside is useable for only very small pills such as Claritin, I was able to fit 7 pills inside it.</li>
            <li>The only weird bit is a small container I found in each holder -- it&#x27;s about a centimeter-long vial with a screw top, which I&#x27;d love to use to ensure double water protection, but the only thing I can imagine fitting in there is a grain of rice.  </li>
            <li>They are tiny, but as other reviewers have stated, the glass tube can be removed to make more room for larger tablets.</li>
            <li>The outer case can easily hold 6 small (#312, brown) batteries.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Inconspicuous and easy to tolerate on a small keyring.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These appear to be great little pill holders, but I didn&#x27;t quite put together how small the actual plastic pill holder inside the metal canister is.</li>
            <li>I also found that it easily takes a carefully folded single US bill</li>
            <li>Decent construction overall</li>
            <li>The plastic inside might not last as long, but I personally rarely use the plastic tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One day later and Amazon customer service has offered me either a partial refund of $1.19 or the option of returning the capsules for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I typed out all of the details on the computer, printed it, cut it to a small size then rolled it up and screwed the top back on.</li>
            <li>There is fair amount of wasted space because it is just a bit to small.  </li>
            <li>make sure you spin them tight or they will come loose.</li>
            <li>The keychains are pretty cheap and will hold most pills if you take out the useless small holder inside the keychain.</li>
            <li>When I move to another temporary location, I simply pull out the old info and slip in new info.    </li>
            <li>While the bill fit in the blue color, it did not for some reason in the black one which was the one I intended to use.</li>
            <li>A little bigger would be great, but the only bigger one I have found was about 4 times larger making too big to be on a key chain.  </li>
            <li>However, I generally like them so far</li>
            <li>Like this it holds three normal size capsules -- while the vial would only hold one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read the reviews, I did and I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any Advil/aleve in pill form, but I don&#x27;t think they will fit as they are a little bigger then</li>
            <li>After looking at it a bit I noticed that the threads are not very tight together</li>
            <li>In other, it&#x27;s doing exactly the job I needed it for.</li>
            <li>However, with the exact same dimensions, this six pack of pill holders was the same price and allowed me to share my cash-stashing idea with 5 friends for the same price.  </li>
            <li>They are smaller than I first thought, big enough to hold 2 Advil liquid jells without the sealing case inside.</li>
            <li>Use a small piece of plastic bag so that it&#x27;s easy to take the money out later.</li>
            <li>The price was right, but the quality was less than desired.  </li>
            <li>Hence, due to it&#x27;s immense versatility and fun colors, I give this item a 5/5.</li>
            <li>The main cylinder has a diameter of 0.5 inches, length is 1.5 inches long.  </li>
            <li>I keep two of these canisters on my edc keychain, one I&#x27;ve managed (with some trial and error) a $20 bill (in the green one :]), and the medicine in the other.  </li>
            <li>I expected these to be super cheap thin metal and was suprised that is wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>These are a useful size, once you take out the little vial that comes inside them.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-They retain their color pretty well, a few dings and scratches but the body of the color remains vibrant after constant use on my keys</li>
            <li>Not much room for more than two capsules or three-four small pills.</li>
            <li>Inside is a second clear plastic container with a screw on cover.  </li>
            <li>It has become clear that neither of these is possible.  </li>
            <li>Key chains like this go for nearly $5 apiece in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the bottom part came unscrewed.</li>
            <li>It can barely hold one capsule.</li>
            <li>I used the extra tubes to attach Ibuprofen tablets to my backpack and our Geo Caching bag for unexpected headaches.</li>
            <li>they work for that but barely.  </li>
            <li>Very useful to cary small items on a daily basis (like medication)</li>
            <li>Do be sure to wash these containers thoroughly before use, and use a q-tip or something to rub around inside them, as they contained some manufacturing residue upon receipt (loose metal shavings and some unknown dark grayish powder).  </li>
            <li>The capsules themselves seem to be pretty water tight and tighten up well.  </li>
            <li>I bought small, medium, and large containers: the small ones would work well for carrying very small pills (nitroglycerine tablets); I use the medium one to carry my 2 p.m. dose of metformin; the large ones (to be honest, I haven&#x27;t figured out yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;The inner capsule WILL NOT hold an aleve jell cap, but will hold 3 Zyrtec as they are smaller and not round.  </li>
            <li>They are frequently hung in outdoor areas and thus far I have not found one that leaked and caused the log inside to be wet.</li>
            <li>I leave an object behind and they open the pill holder, they will have my contact information and be able to get in touch with me.</li>
            <li>The secret to keeping the top on is to attach it to the key chain via a swivel hook or clasp --- that way the pill holder will rotate and not separate.</li>
            <li>Other reviews give enough details of these and they do what they say, with enough room for some pills, more obviously if you take out the little glass vial in each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They even come with a nifty little inner bottle, though not much can fit in them.</li>
            <li>Previous purchases of this product [se small pill/id holder keychain (set of 6)] have been better than satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clear container is only big enough to hold a medium sized pill or capsule, so it may not meet your needs.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made of colorful aluminum, and have a small plastic vile inside to keep what ever is put inside waterproof.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what else they&#x27;d be useful for.  </li>
            <li>What I was missing was the fact that the cap was hollow and nearly fit an entire pill itself.  </li>
            <li>Probably would be a bit large for any dog weighing less than about 25 pounds</li>
            <li>As for the product it self the silver outside is still cute &amp; looks to do the job but will be too small for a fish oil pill must less two.</li>
            <li>Inside the aluminum outer housing is a tiny, plastic container which is too small to be useful</li>
            <li>the other hand, if you need to carry a small medicine cabinet with you on you keys, they&#x27;ll be just fine for that.  </li>
            <li>These are REALLY small, and if you are planning on using it for pills, beware that they will most likely not fit inside the plastic capsule, not even an aspirin.  </li>
            <li>Dump the small vial insert; too small for an average size capsule pill (tried one, it got stuck); but the metal case is good for one capsule size pill.  </li>
            <li>; make a fold from the top long way 1/2 way down, do the same for the bottom folding up --&amp;#62; now you have a long rectangular folded bill that should be less than the actual length of the container (check it and make adjustments accordingly)</li>
            <li>; fit the tight roll in the cap, then insert the bill with the cap into the container (screw it down).  Waalaa!</li>
            <li>A dab of Loctite on the threads ensures that my little stash will not come loose until that pivotal moment when I need to pay for a cab ride home, or pay for a round of drinks</li>
            <li>The inner clear container is kinda useless in my opinion, but can easily be discarded.</li>
            <li>Within these containers you can secure currency, medication, or other small items.  </li>
            <li>Also it came with a little plastic or glass container that is on the inside which i threw out it takes up too much room.</li>

            <li> if they don&#x27;t unscrew for him, it&#x27;s a good testimonial.  </li>
            <li> great seller, Nice Geocaching Bison Tubes.</li>
            <li> loved all the colors.</li>
            <li> The items were good quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It has a good o-ring seal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these fobs have came into good use.</li>
            <li> Needed something handy to carry them around, and this was a great option.  </li>
            <li> good, uses a good seal.</li>
            <li> and they are a good quality and value.  </li>
            <li> The shell is a fairly thin-walled vessle with a mini plastic capped vile inside.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> They are a good buy.</li>
            <li> A great item for geocachers and a really nice price.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was remarkably good.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Some of the \\&quot;O\\&quot; rings aren&#x27;t as good as others, but it serves its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nephew loved them so had to give him one.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with these</li>
            <li> nicely made and good design.  </li>
            <li> You could hide many items inside!</li>
            <li> However, i am beyond pleased with these!</li>
            <li> And if it does happen to break, well, I&#x27;ve got 5 more. :P</li>
            <li> The price was amazing for the set.</li>
            <li> -Amazing bargain for price.  </li>
            <li> As I said, for the price these are simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> when batteries are out - and you need them handy - this seems to be be the answer.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this set of six pill holders so my wife and I would have a handy place to store some emergency cash.  </li>
            <li> This comes in handy while out and about.</li>
            <li> Nice that there&#x27;s a color selection.</li>
            <li> and will probably hold up nicely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a nice product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a nice product.  </li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy aircraft grade aluminum, too.</li>
            <li> nice idea.</li>
            <li> This is a nice deal for what it is.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, the tubes are still very nice just if you attach it to a collar be sure to do it securely!</li>
            <li> I originally was searching for another use; however found this to be a great item.  </li>
            <li> Need to carry full strength aspirin and saw this set of waterproof (I checked) pill holders at a great price.</li>
            <li> these are handy but not the most well-manufactured.  </li>
            <li> Great product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Size is suitable for keychain.</li>
            <li> I think that chapstick size would be good because you could fit four pills</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family got their own color and no fighting because there were so many to chose from.</li>
            <li> Luckily I haven&#x27;t needed it yet, but it&#x27;s nice to know I have a cash backup!</li>
            <li> It does take some finesse to get a bill to fit, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s easy!!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li> very light and water proof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are very light weight aluminum and the treading is ok for what they are.  </li>
            <li> They may not be as good as genuine \\&quot;bison\\&quot; tubes, but when you can get 6 for the price of one \\&quot;bison\\&quot; tube, they will work just fine.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t put pills in it for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably give one more away and keep 3 to myself.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item for mediation management with several sizes.  </li>
            <li> I will order more when the time is needed.</li>
            <li> are many uses for these.</li>
            <li> love them.</li>
            <li> They are a better quality</li>
            <li> then what I have bought in stores for more money for just one.</li>
            <li> People love them.</li>
            <li> Place two bills on top of each other.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought these.          </li>
            <li> I wish there were more pictures and measurements though.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this inexpensive package of what cachers call bison tubes.</li>
            <li> Whatever you use them for, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find they work well.</li>
            <li> Some camo colors or matte finishes would make them even better.</li>
            <li> Most of the time, I would rather something a bit more subdued</li>
            <li> the product description indicates, these containers can be used for many purposes.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need that many, or don&#x27;t have a dog, you can always use them as zipper pulls, or give them away.</li>
            <li> Okay if your medication is of &amp;#34;small size;.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need all 6, but was glad I bought the set.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.    </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll find many uses for the others.  </li>
            <li> At $5.95 for six this is a great buy; at $5.95 each - not so much.  </li>
            <li> They ALMOST fit!  </li>
            <li> These are the perfect size, not too big.</li>
            <li> I have shared them all with friends during this healthy heart month.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> Cheap cost, sturdy and nice colors.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a rubber gasket between the screw top and the bottom so these will stay waterproof.</li>
            <li> so they have a lot more room.  </li>
            <li> I am sure we will still use them.</li>
            <li> Others seem to be OK.</li>
            <li> After using these, I will probably order more.  </li>
            <li> However they are OK for many uses.  </li>
            <li> I pre-filled each one with my &amp;#34;emergency rations&amp;#34; of pills (the ones I might need if I have more severe pain that day) and snap one onto my work lanyard each day.</li>
            <li> hold shut wonderfully; have never had one accidentally open.</li>
            <li> Most of the items were scratched and made improperly.</li>
            <li> also I wanted to be able to carry emergency money with me</li>
            <li> This is a lot better than depending upon ziplock bags when you&#x27;re going mobile.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a pretty good</li>
            <li> Good for your purse, first aid kit, or anything you take with you on the go.</li>
            <li> These pill holders are pretty good.</li>
            <li> For the price its a good buy and the colors are cute, my kids swooped up on them fast.</li>
            <li> These were perfect, and shipped faster than expected.</li>
            <li> but they were cheap and cute, and still are.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve come in pretty handy on many an occasion.  </li>
            <li> I carry two Tylenol gel-caps in 1 container, I wrap them with a bit of plastic wrap to keep them somewhat protected and so far this has worked great.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t fit many medications.  </li>
            <li> Cool product!</li>
            <li> Not bad, but one of the pill holders keeps opening and the pills fall out!  </li>
            <li> Easy to place in trees  are on a fence.</li>
            <li> threads squeal a bit, goes away easily with some WD-40&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can easily slip a piece of paper with temporary contact info (campsite number, car/trailer license plate, friend or family member&#x27;s address and phone, as well as the dates we will be at that location).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can easily get two (2) US dollar sized bills in it without the vial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this way, no one can easily read my address just by looking .......&lt;</li>
            <li> The color is easily scratched off and over time, all of the keychains are silver.</li>
            <li> the lid breaks easily</li>
            <li> The coating on the containers flakes off and scratches easy.  </li>
            <li> The colors make recognition easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and quite sturdy.</li>
            <li> Works fine without the liner.  </li>
            <li> All 6 were fine</li>
            <li> , didn&#x27;t find any shavings, all threads were fine.</li>
            <li> We used these for Geocaching logs and all of these worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I was impressed when I saw this lot of six bison tubes for less than a dollar piece.</li>
            <li> They worked out just fine.</li>
            <li> They work just fine.</li>
            <li> and I think they will work just fine for me.</li>
            <li> They have not been placed yet, but seem to be fine for their intended use.  </li>
            <li> Mine were all fine.</li>
            <li> They are not the $8 each style, but have done just fine for our use.  </li>
            <li> These little containers are perfect for storing pills.</li>
            <li> Perfect little keychain cases.</li>
            <li> Great price on them, especially when they are ordered with something else so you can get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Not even a tylenol will fit.</li>
            <li> you can fit in it.</li>
            <li> o-rings are genuinely waterproof</li>
            <li> Four (4) PowerOne #10 batteries can fit in the plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> will fit a rolled up $20 bill to keep on your key-chain for no-wallet emergencies.</li>
            <li> but sometimes you do have to hide a micro these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the Obsession of Geocaching.    </li>
            <li> It can fit about 4-5 medium sized pills in it.</li>
            <li> My meds wouldn&#x27;t fit in it..</li>
            <li> I paid a cheap price for these.</li>
            <li> I wrote to customer service about this and today received a response that suggested that I could purchase another set of capsules in order to get another silver one (which has not affected our dog&#x27;s fur) and they would ship them for free.  </li>
            <li> The vial won&#x27;t even fit one pill.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of uses for the bottles, a bill or two will fit inside if you fold them well.</li>
            <li> Definitely cheap</li>
            <li> Free shipping is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I did find that 1 caplet (elongated) aspirin will fit in it.  </li>
            <li> The extras I put on the kids&#x27; bags and filled with allergy meds just in case.</li>
            <li> These are very compact, nice if you need to take a pill with a meal</li>
            <li> I took them all out, as even my smallest pills don&#x27;t fit in there.</li>
            <li> Had to cut advil in two to fit inside.  </li>
            <li> I could fit four pills instead of 2.  </li>
            <li> If you remove the plastic vial, you can easily fit 2.  </li>
            <li> THese are useful for many things.</li>
            <li> to the dimensions (all in inches) since this was the most important deciding factor for me, I thought it was worth adding here for everyone</li>
            <li> I find these to be very useful.</li>
            <li> It could be very useful.  </li>
            <li> Fit well on keychain, not too bulky and was worried that folded bill would be hard to fit in, but fits perfect.  </li>
            <li> They are perfect for hiding in small areas and claim to be waterproofed.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the reviews about how small it was i thought it would be perfect for cat tags.</li>
            <li> I found these containers &amp; thought \\&quot;There&#x27;s got to be something cool &amp; crafty</li>
            <li> I had originally wanted to buy a cash-stash version of this device.  </li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, but if you wanted to be more discreet, the silver would blend in with your keys and not be too noticeable.</li>
            <li> This concept of this product is excellent, however, it is just too small.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with them so far.</li>
            <li> At first I was very excited to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> For extra fun, you can mix &amp; match the tops and bottoms for great color combinations.</li>
            <li> These are good quality, but I actually bought them to take on vacation hoping I could fit money in them.  </li>
            <li> And the fun colors make it easy to find.</li>
            <li> they are tiny, but did find a good use..</li>
            <li> Good price, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the reasonable price for them</li>
            <li> I found this to be true and just cleaned them out with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product, I just wish that they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> top screws on and off fine; no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> Extremely lightweight, great for emergency situations where you need your medication, aspirin, or whatever else</li>
            <li> cracked quickly.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected and definately a great product.  </li>
            <li> But overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than you might expect, I was able to fit two full sized pills inside with no room for anything else.</li>
            <li> They make great mini caches with their water tight seals.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and they were shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> The little plastic bottle insert is great because it keep the pills from getting too banged around.  </li>
            <li> I still think they&#x27;re great little capsules</li>
            <li> These are some great little containers.</li>
            <li> These are good, cheap, little containers.</li>
            <li> They are also cheaply made with the little plastic caps that don&#x27;t seem to provide a good seal.</li>
            <li> what I will do with these) will be great for carrying a day&#x27;s dose of meds and vitamins that I take, but I would not put it on my keychain, as it might be too heavy or cumbersome.</li>
            <li> These sounded good at the time, but I never really found a use for them.  </li>
            <li> The downside with this of course is the smaller volume available for pills.&lt;br /&gt;The metal fob has a O-ring on the top to help keep air and water out of the inside as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can take the vial out and then there is a bit more room in the container, still not sure what it would be good for, besides being pretty.</li>
            <li> The inner container is also nice.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what quality was going to be, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Very nice little pill holders if you need to carry pills with you.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a great product - just be aware that you can&#x27;t fit a whole lot in this little capsule.</li>
            <li> Good threads on the main capsule and solid connection to the key-chain loop.  </li>
            <li> i was looking for, and priced right.</li>
            <li> the price was right and they are water proof</li>
            <li> I was right.</li>
            <li> Inside diameter is just right, and it holds 4 tablets.  </li>
            <li> These water tight containers make great geocaches or would be good for anything else that needs to be water tight.</li>
            <li> have the bill facing you right side up --&amp;#62</li>
            <li> It took some work to find the right folding to make it work.</li>
            <li> just the right size for a 20.00 bill for emergency or advil.</li>
            <li> We threw all of them out right away and bought a plastic one from the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Though it was nice of them to offer, I won&#x27;t bother with either the partial or the full refund.  </li>
            <li> Though it was nice of them to offer, I won&#x27;t bother with either the partial or the full refund.  </li>
            <li> Great little keychains!  </li>
            <li> Its great for keeping a large bill hidden away in any bag for that &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A US bill fits easily inside after being folded lengthwise and rolled, two will fit if you&#x27;re determined.&lt;br /&gt;-Without the inner vial, a couple gelcaps or</li>
            <li> They are not big, more like the size of your finger, but adequate to get the job done and keep the critters out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> handy but make sure you only have smaller tablets or items to carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> They are quite small and didn&#x27;t work for that, but they are great for their intended use (pill holder).</li>
            <li> but these are great for small geocaches.</li>
            <li> Great for putting I car or bag and hold small things well.</li>
            <li> Construction was not bad, though it is a very lightweight, inexpensive item.</li>
            <li> And the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li> Not over the top upset, just a little bummed since my favorite color is purple.</li>
            <li> Liked the price for a &amp;#34;6 pack&amp;#34; of these containers, even though I really wanted only 3 (will donate the others during a meet &amp; greet).</li>
            <li> Perfect for storing anything small you need to take on the road - They each have a little glass vile inside that makes adding and removing products easy, and the top is slightly magnified to stick to the top, so there is no rattling inside.</li>
            <li> I recieved my order very fast and without any problems.  </li>
            <li> We like these very much.  </li>
            <li> Nice little pill bottles the plastic bottle inside is small but the outside one works great and for the price they are worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> The description is exact.</li>
            <li> The items were exactly as promised, thanks for helping to spread the rage of geocaching!</li>
            <li> The liner is nice, but he needed to remove it in order for even small pills to fit.  </li>
            <li> In the case that I may lose one off my key chain, I love have 5 spare.</li>
            <li> These seem a bit on the cheap side, but so far they do the job as advertised.  </li>
            <li> They arrived exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> they are very convienent they are really worth the money.</li>
            <li> set comes in various colors so can be shared, or if you have more than one medication, you can color code them.</li>
            <li> However i rated them as 4 stars because they are exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> have now ordered these containers several times and I keep coming back for more as I place more hides.  </li>
            <li> Product description was exactly as it came.</li>
            <li> This case protects them from damage pretty well and at about a buck a piece you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> my purposes, it needed only one small modification to be perfect.  </li>
            <li> so I was really glad to have this on my key chain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m awaiting further response from customer service and will update this when I hear more.  </li>
            <li> Smaller vial inside to small for my use, but the outer canister will be perfect as a geocache container.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re better machined and don&#x27;t need the inner vial</li>
            <li> It has a case on the inside so my only option was to take out the case to make more room for my capsule.</li>
            <li> I had not planned to use the vial and knew from experience that the outer tubes seal pretty well</li>
            <li> I did read a review that they sometimes have metal shaving in them when you first receive them.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Cannister would be better without smaller plastic insert on the inside.  </li>
            <li> Came exactly as shown.  </li>
            <li> This item is suitable for such a purpose, however I highly recommend purchasing it from here.</li>
            <li> I have to take a thyroid pill every day and filled several of these with 5 days worth of pills.</li>
            <li> My one reservation is that they seem easy to cross thread when putting them together.  </li>
            <li> To easily tell them apart , the containers come in six different colors.  </li>
            <li> So, by placing 1 pill in the capsule, and another in the cap, then screwing them together, these pill holders easily hold 2 standard size liquid or gel caps.  </li>
            <li> I easily attached it to the inner zipper in my purse.</li>
            <li> The jump rings were a bit large for our needs</li>
            <li> So without the inside vial I had no difficulty storing two large Ibuprofen 800 mg tablets inside.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re nice and water tight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m fine with the size, and would rather carry two of them on my keys than 1 big bulky</li>
            <li> Still though, getting 6 of these for a lower price than 1 good quality one is hard to pass.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can fit in the pill bottle is a 81mg asprin.</li>
            <li> With several colors, I got \\&quot;my\\&quot; colors and shared the rest with family and friends that enjoy the features of this item.  </li>
            <li> but you can only fit max 3 pills.  </li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t gentle with his keys, so</li>
            <li> This was much cheaper than buying the $6 dollar cash stash.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product for any and all Geocachers that like to make Cachers really hunt for the prize.</li>
            <li> Finally I gave them away as cheap pranks to friends.</li>
            <li> They were really grateful and plan to start buying them to give to others who lose a pet.</li>
            <li> I roll up a strip of paper about an inch wide and insert it into the top of the aluminum housing before screwing the housing shut.  </li>
            <li> The metal seems to be holding up very well.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and</li>
            <li> really does hold money, but i wouldn&#x27;t put a $50 or $100 in these -</li>
            <li> So mission accomplished using these at 1/2 the cost and getting (6) vs (1).</li>
            <li> These pill holders work very well for taking Meds on the go.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these pill holders to use as a device to carry my important medical information.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and I just carry two in my pocket which isn&#x27;t really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not certain if that is safe</li>
            <li> This item isn&#x27;t prefect, but it certainly does it&#x27;s job decently.  </li>
            <li> It would work for many other meds though (blood pressure, migraine, baby ASA etc depending on the size/type of the pill).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now if there&#x27;s ever any kind of emergency I&#x27;ve got at least 5 days of my medicine on me pretty much at all times.</li>
            <li> There is a key hook on the pill tubes and inside of each tube is a super tiny clear glass vile with a screw top.</li>
            <li> Coloration is nice, haven&#x27;t owned them long enough to know if the coloring will fade or not.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought they were a bit big for my purpose, but I actually prefer the size now as I can quickly tell if the bottom&#x27;s deattached - I keep the extras in the trailer so I can replace a lost one quickly while traveling.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even fit a single large pill in it.  </li>
            <li> all, not a bad buy if you want to throw some meds in these and put them in various places (car, keychain, edc bag).</li>
            <li> After two weeks of carrying it on my keychain it hasn&#x27;t worked loose and seems fine.</li>
            <li> a few of mine have the threads to the lid not cut well, easy to cross-threat, and easy to come apart if not properly cinched to the o-ring.  </li>
            <li> Fold this piece in half (top to bottom)&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning these and buying a half dozen of the vials from CVS - admittedly, that cost a chunk more.</li>
            <li> These are decent quality and have a rubber o-ring.</li>
            <li> I am able to hold nine aleve in each one, 5 of my bigger vitamins, and a lot of my smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I had a wooden pill case that these replace, the top of the wood key was always coming undone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;inside depth of main body &#x3D; 1.107</li>
            <li> Bonus was the plastic pill holder key chain actually holds more pills.</li>
            <li> problem is they are not very sturdy or strong.</li>
            <li> Yes I made sure that is was tight when I screwed it together.</li>
            <li> I probably had too high expectations for them, given the price, but there you go.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Handy on car keys, mail box keys and any other key ring.  </li>
            <li> The little bottles are cute and seemingly weatherproof.  </li>
            <li> I took a chance that my tiny hearing aid batteries would fit this, inside the little plastic bottle (and if not they would certainly fit in the aluminum container without the plastic</li>
            <li> Old age requires more pills than the average pharmacy.</li>
            <li> i always forget to take my allergy pills a few miles down the road after leaving home so these help out greatly.</li>
            <li> The key ring makes it easy to hang the container in various places.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going to go right now and order another set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not on a ton of prescription medication, but other than nitro, I don&#x27;t know what would fit in there.</li>
            <li> These are a great little travel item - and much cheaper than the other similar products out there.</li>
            <li> Other pills can fit without the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Nice assortment and solid little pill cases.</li>
            <li> all of the colors shown, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> The single daily med and the allery capsule could fit, but the Advil was too large.</li>
            <li> nice little pill holders water tight and easy to carry around just put one on my key ring</li>
            <li> The aluminum housing is easily spray painted, but I wish they were sold in matte black.  </li>
            <li> The pills have to be pretty small to fit.</li>
            <li> I love these little holders!</li>
            <li> I only have 4 left, from the grand total of 12 that I had.</li>
            <li> How dare they take a simple item like this that market it for that purpose and charge so much for it!</li>
            <li> Colors were consistent over entire tube (colors look just like the picture).</li>
            <li> I love the idea around the pill holder but it only holds one baby aspirin, next time i&#x27;ll chose the larger one.</li>
            <li> It has a big enough space for a bill rolled up, but make sure that the bill doesn&#x27;t get lodged into the back of the case.  </li>
            <li> These holders are exactly what I needed for my pills -- I have stashed them in various places in case</li>
            <li> I have small pills that will easily fit inside, but they are a bit large for my cats.</li>
            <li> They are light being plastic and will accommodate small pills easily, but not large ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;these are worth the cost but too small to be really useful...</li>
            <li> The pill holders are perfect for holding a small item, mine have a little extra cash in them stashed in different places, my car glove box, backpack etc.</li>
            <li> However, if you ignore the small pill case and just put the pill into the key fob, then it should be able to hold a little more</li>
            <li> Bluntly, the man is essentially a human entropy field and he brings decay to pretty much everything he touches - that these things have survived years of his daily use speaks volumes to how well they are made.</li>
            <li> I forget to take my pills, as well as carry one on my keychain (see True Utility TU45 Stainless Steel Key Ring System Key Organizer by the same company).  </li>
            <li> the clear pill capsule doesn&#x27;t seem large enough for alot of pills today.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought but works great to hold 4 hearing aid batteries on my keychains or a few aspirin or tylenol.</li>
            <li> If you have other medications, you may be limited in fitting them in.</li>
            <li> the clear container(that is inside the color tube)screw</li>
            <li> It is clear and has a screw cap, I think it would be used to store liquids.</li>
            <li> and if I can&#x27;t get another silver one I think I&#x27;ll try painting one of the colored ones with clear nail polish to see if that solves the problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try the clear nail polish solution and leave it at that.ible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try the clear nail polish solution and leave it at that.</li>
            <li> They come with a clear, tubular insert that I took out and use separately for nano caches.</li>
            <li> a few tablets would fit inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the old barrel ID containers for my dogs on camping and/or day trips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested these at home for about 3 weeks now, and the 1 yr old dog unscrewed hers about 1-1/2 weeks in</li>
            <li> use mine to contain lactase pills for my lactose intolerance, and since they&#x27;re in capsules anyway, I discard the vial and just use the pill holder directly.  </li>
            <li> Unfortuately these were just too tiny to hold much at all.</li>
            <li> Were surprised to find an enclosed plastic bottle inside the cylinders, which will help keep the pills waterproof.</li>
            <li> What I had really wanted was to either acquire another silver capsule or buy a second order that would be all silver capsules.  </li>
            <li> threading on the bottle is very coarse and the lid doesn&#x27;t really stay on well&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I chose four stars because more consideration in the design could&#x27;ve been given to the inside diameter size with respect to common pill sizes.  </li>
            <li> The tiny plastic vial inside is useable for only very small pills such as Claritin, I was able to fit 7 pills inside it.</li>
            <li> The only weird bit is a small container I found in each holder -- it&#x27;s about a centimeter-long vial with a screw top, which I&#x27;d love to use to ensure double water protection, but the only thing I can imagine fitting in there is a grain of rice.  </li>
            <li> They are tiny, but as other reviewers have stated, the glass tube can be removed to make more room for larger tablets.</li>
            <li> The outer case can easily hold 6 small (#312, brown) batteries.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Inconspicuous and easy to tolerate on a small keyring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These appear to be great little pill holders, but I didn&#x27;t quite put together how small the actual plastic pill holder inside the metal canister is.</li>
            <li> I also found that it easily takes a carefully folded single US bill</li>
            <li> Decent construction overall</li>
            <li> The plastic inside might not last as long, but I personally rarely use the plastic tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One day later and Amazon customer service has offered me either a partial refund of $1.19 or the option of returning the capsules for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I typed out all of the details on the computer, printed it, cut it to a small size then rolled it up and screwed the top back on.</li>
            <li> There is fair amount of wasted space because it is just a bit to small.  </li>
            <li> make sure you spin them tight or they will come loose.</li>
            <li> The keychains are pretty cheap and will hold most pills if you take out the useless small holder inside the keychain.</li>
            <li> When I move to another temporary location, I simply pull out the old info and slip in new info.    </li>
            <li> While the bill fit in the blue color, it did not for some reason in the black one which was the one I intended to use.</li>
            <li> A little bigger would be great, but the only bigger one I have found was about 4 times larger making too big to be on a key chain.  </li>
            <li> However, I generally like them so far</li>
            <li> Like this it holds three normal size capsules -- while the vial would only hold one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, I did and I got exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any Advil/aleve in pill form, but I don&#x27;t think they will fit as they are a little bigger then</li>
            <li> After looking at it a bit I noticed that the threads are not very tight together</li>
            <li> In other, it&#x27;s doing exactly the job I needed it for.</li>
            <li> However, with the exact same dimensions, this six pack of pill holders was the same price and allowed me to share my cash-stashing idea with 5 friends for the same price.  </li>
            <li> They are smaller than I first thought, big enough to hold 2 Advil liquid jells without the sealing case inside.</li>
            <li> Use a small piece of plastic bag so that it&#x27;s easy to take the money out later.</li>
            <li> The price was right, but the quality was less than desired.  </li>
            <li> Hence, due to it&#x27;s immense versatility and fun colors, I give this item a 5/5.</li>
            <li> The main cylinder has a diameter of 0.5 inches, length is 1.5 inches long.  </li>
            <li> I keep two of these canisters on my edc keychain, one I&#x27;ve managed (with some trial and error) a $20 bill (in the green one :]), and the medicine in the other.  </li>
            <li> I expected these to be super cheap thin metal and was suprised that is wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These are a useful size, once you take out the little vial that comes inside them.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-They retain their color pretty well, a few dings and scratches but the body of the color remains vibrant after constant use on my keys</li>
            <li> Not much room for more than two capsules or three-four small pills.</li>
            <li> Inside is a second clear plastic container with a screw on cover.  </li>
            <li> It has become clear that neither of these is possible.  </li>
            <li> Key chains like this go for nearly $5 apiece in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the bottom part came unscrewed.</li>
            <li> It can barely hold one capsule.</li>
            <li> I used the extra tubes to attach Ibuprofen tablets to my backpack and our Geo Caching bag for unexpected headaches.</li>
            <li> they work for that but barely.  </li>
            <li> Very useful to cary small items on a daily basis (like medication)</li>
            <li> Do be sure to wash these containers thoroughly before use, and use a q-tip or something to rub around inside them, as they contained some manufacturing residue upon receipt (loose metal shavings and some unknown dark grayish powder).  </li>
            <li> The capsules themselves seem to be pretty water tight and tighten up well.  </li>
            <li> I bought small, medium, and large containers: the small ones would work well for carrying very small pills (nitroglycerine tablets); I use the medium one to carry my 2 p.m. dose of metformin; the large ones (to be honest, I haven&#x27;t figured out yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;The inner capsule WILL NOT hold an aleve jell cap, but will hold 3 Zyrtec as they are smaller and not round.  </li>
            <li> They are frequently hung in outdoor areas and thus far I have not found one that leaked and caused the log inside to be wet.</li>
            <li> I leave an object behind and they open the pill holder, they will have my contact information and be able to get in touch with me.</li>
            <li> The secret to keeping the top on is to attach it to the key chain via a swivel hook or clasp --- that way the pill holder will rotate and not separate.</li>
            <li> Other reviews give enough details of these and they do what they say, with enough room for some pills, more obviously if you take out the little glass vial in each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They even come with a nifty little inner bottle, though not much can fit in them.</li>
            <li> Previous purchases of this product [se small pill/id holder keychain (set of 6)] have been better than satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clear container is only big enough to hold a medium sized pill or capsule, so it may not meet your needs.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made of colorful aluminum, and have a small plastic vile inside to keep what ever is put inside waterproof.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else they&#x27;d be useful for.  </li>
            <li> What I was missing was the fact that the cap was hollow and nearly fit an entire pill itself.  </li>
            <li> Probably would be a bit large for any dog weighing less than about 25 pounds</li>
            <li> As for the product it self the silver outside is still cute &amp; looks to do the job but will be too small for a fish oil pill must less two.</li>
            <li> Inside the aluminum outer housing is a tiny, plastic container which is too small to be useful</li>
            <li> the other hand, if you need to carry a small medicine cabinet with you on you keys, they&#x27;ll be just fine for that.  </li>
            <li> These are REALLY small, and if you are planning on using it for pills, beware that they will most likely not fit inside the plastic capsule, not even an aspirin.  </li>
            <li> Dump the small vial insert; too small for an average size capsule pill (tried one, it got stuck); but the metal case is good for one capsule size pill.  </li>
            <li> ; make a fold from the top long way 1/2 way down, do the same for the bottom folding up --&amp;#62; now you have a long rectangular folded bill that should be less than the actual length of the container (check it and make adjustments accordingly)</li>
            <li> ; fit the tight roll in the cap, then insert the bill with the cap into the container (screw it down).  Waalaa!</li>
            <li> A dab of Loctite on the threads ensures that my little stash will not come loose until that pivotal moment when I need to pay for a cab ride home, or pay for a round of drinks</li>
            <li> The inner clear container is kinda useless in my opinion, but can easily be discarded.</li>
            <li> Within these containers you can secure currency, medication, or other small items.  </li>
            <li> Also it came with a little plastic or glass container that is on the inside which i threw out it takes up too much room.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of scale, you could only fit two old-style Contact cold remedy capsules stacked on top of each other, and that&#x27;s extending into the cap - inside the raw aluminium shell.</li>
            <li> They come with a little bottle inside that is so small nothing can fit in them.</li>
            <li> I suppose you could fit a few very tiny pills but am not sure.</li>
            <li> The metal outer shell holds a small glass case with a stainless steel cap.  </li>
            <li> They are just too small to do much with.</li>
            <li> They will definitely last me a long long time and for I&#x27;m intending, they will need to last even longer than that!</li>
            <li> If you over tighten them the little o-rings do have a habit of &#x27;popping&#x27; out/off, however you can make the top screw on and stay rather tight by just being careful and few should have any problems with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oring around lid looks like it will last a while and keep the inside dry.</li>
            <li> o-rings are low quality and start to dry rot with in a</li>
            <li> Only very small pills (aspirin, for instance) would fit inside the small glass tube but the glass tube is removable and you can use just the metal shell to hold larger pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I give 4 stars instead of 5 only because of limited size.  </li>
            <li> I use one for a single American bill and another for a pair of foam earplugs.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I know it has the measurements listed in the ad, but I clearly was not able to properly translate how tiny that would be.</li>
            <li> They have a tiny little bottle inside and the outer casing has a soft seal that makes it totally airtight and stay closed.</li>
            <li> Each one comes with a little clear plastic vial that can hold something the size of about 1 Tylenol gelcap.</li>
            <li> These work at least, but they are not of very high quality</li>
            <li> I will use a bit of crazy glue when traveling just to be safe.    </li>
            <li> My daughter said the vial inside the metal container looked like something to hide illegal substances, and indeed I don&#x27;t know of any pill that would actually fit in there.</li>
            <li> Initially, I thought these capsules can only hold 1 average size pill.  </li>
            <li> It still provides what I wanted to do, but even those did not fit inside the plastic insert tube, so I just put them directly in the metal tube.</li>
            <li> Hope it stays on their collars since they play rough outside...</li>
            <li> These are way bigger than I expected &amp; want them to be.</li>
            <li> One given as a gift did come apart, but the circumstances are not clear.</li>
            <li> The main thing is they are less than half the size of the medium size pill holder and are convenient.  </li>
            <li> the small internal plastic container will protect some smaller pills but not big aspirin-sized ones.  </li>
            <li> Bought these to use as geocaches since they were similar to other containers I have seen.  </li>
            <li> The bottle inside the metal container (about 8mm inside diameter, 22mm deep) is plastic and can be removed for other uses.  </li>
            <li> I have them in my survival kit and my pocket, they have gone threw the wash and still kept my pills dry.</li>
            <li> These have a container inside for the log that helps keep it dry.</li>
            <li> There is a rubber gasket between the parts of the metal housing which serves to keep a log placed inside the container dry.  </li>
            <li> Two of the six tubes had such poor threads that they slip if you tighten them too much.</li>
            <li> A few days after that the same thing happened to the one on my key ring.</li>
            <li> Just want you to be aware that if you want to use these as I have, at least the black ones - without modification - will stain your dog&#x27;s fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item description says \\&quot;Assorted Colors (Red, Blue, Green, Black, Purple &amp; Silver)\\&quot; but items only came in silver?</li>
            <li> Each one has a small clear plastic vial inside.</li>
            <li> Which I feel is completely heartless and shady.</li>
            <li> When anything brushes against the side of the case, the O-ring rolls out and the lid becomes loose in its threads.</li>
            <li> that would guarantee i&#x27;d loose them.</li>
            <li> and if it is bumped it wiggles loose.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something small enough to be on one&#x27;s key chain.  </li>
            <li> Fold in half (left to right)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Fold in half again (left to right)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> They are water-proof which is terrific in the rainy Santa Cruz area where I have them hidden.</li>
            <li> Each of these small key chains has a tiny plastic bottle (1 x 3/8ths inch) inside</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is too small for most of our medications.  </li>
            <li> As containers similar to these are already listed at Amazon as pill containers, perhaps that is why these small, well constructed, rounded cylindrical containers are curiously described here as dog ID holders, key rings, and for use in geocatching.  </li>
            <li> Keeps water out, after a couple rough times with it the seals get loose and let in water.</li>
            <li> No issues with closing tightly, although one of the rubber seals is a bit too big and slips over bottom when you close it.</li>
            <li> Each key chain seals up tight, and is made of lightweight aluminum (I think).  </li>
            <li> Especially if you have to crank it tight.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re concerned about which colors you might get (red, silver, black, green, blue and purple).</li>
            <li> I say \\&quot;not perfect\\&quot; because as a pill holder, it&#x27;s very limited in the size of pills it can hold.  </li>
            <li> I needed a size just a little bit bigger</li>
            <li> Make a little hook out of a paperclip to wrap the money around and make it easier to pull it out, and no one would ever know that you&#x27;ve got some extra cash stashed away.</li>
            <li> If your pill is even a LITTLE larger than that, look for something else.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend going to CVS and buying the little keychain vials they sell.  </li>
            <li> One actually arrived that way, so I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll hold up in the field.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have added a few ibuprofens to one and carry that around.</li>
            <li> They arrived way before expected.</li>
            <li> They did not get wet on the inside over a period of time.</li>
            <li> If you only need a few pills and don&#x27;t want to walk around with a battery sized pill holder in your pocket</li>
            <li> : A few months later, I have given away all but one of my extras.</li>
            <li> Ordered via Amazon and arrived roughly 2 weeks or so before the promised date by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Since this is our sole intended use for the capsules, it would mean that I&#x27;d be paying $5.95 each for two silver capsules as I expect the other colors will do the same as the black one did.  </li>
            <li> They work well for holding two US bills, folded length-wise and rolled tightly, for those moments when you may need a little extra cash.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I don&#x27;t have anything against them other that I don&#x27;t know what someone would use them for besides Geocaching.</li>
            <li> , the other dog still has his intact.  </li>
            <li> They do seem rather small, the tip of a Q-tip is slightly smaller than the hole for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will hide them along my travels for other cachers to find.  </li>
            <li> They come 6 in a package, which makes them extremely cost-effective.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to use one for my medical history, but it was just too small.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are as described.</li>
            <li> Other than that - for</li>
            <li> It comes with an inner small plastic bottle...</li>
            <li> Pretty much useless for what I need.</li>
            <li> but I could only get 1 bill folded as small as I could</li>
            <li> the inner tube is too small to hold anything but powder.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 Stars is because they are a bit too small to hold 2 average size pills.  </li>
            <li> , I read in other reviews that the integrity or quality may have gone down since then.</li>
            <li> Also, at least for the product I received, the inner vial is made of plastic and not glass as stated in some other reviews.</li>
            <li> : We used the silver capsule for one of our dogs and the black one for the other.  </li>
            <li> I keep one on my key chain and it hardly takes up any space.</li>
            <li> Have enough to always have at least one with me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth my time or effort.  </li>
            <li> These little pill cases are definitely waterproof and with the small canister inside each one they are air tight.</li>
            <li> Unless you are carrying a single small pain killer, sub-lingual nitro, or alternative \\&quot;powders\\&quot; .</li>
            <li> These are very small and only hold about 1-2 pills in capsule form.</li>
            <li> The inner vial is very small</li>
            <li> I lost half of the container and my pills.</li>
            <li> Less than a dollar each for these containers.  </li>
            <li> Fold previous fold up 1/4.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> and so I spray paint the containers black.  </li>
            <li> It stripped the threads on the black one.</li>
            <li> the bottom half just fell off and the advil went everywhere.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I got 2 black, 2 green and 2 silver instead of</li>
            <li> /&gt;They screw fairly tight and have a rubber o-ring.  </li>
            <li> I keep this on my keychain with a $20 bill tightly wound inside of it.</li>
            <li> --&amp;#62; roll it tight (like a bed roll)</li>
            <li> The too I keep my emergency meds in have remained tight and watertight.</li>
            <li> i have cranked it as tightly as I can and have also put a little piece of cotton ball in it to keep the contents from going all over if it is dropped again.</li>
            <li> After a few days we discovered that the black capsule was staining our dog&#x27;s fur.  </li>
            <li> I took out the little plastic insert to meet my needs for size requirements.  </li>
            <li> These little aluminum capsules are supposed to have a bottle inside them.</li>
            <li> Each container holds a little vial that I use to keep three pills in:</li>
            <li> Was a little worried after reading reviews that I&#x27;d end up with containers that had tops stripped out.</li>
            <li> Even came with little containers inside these.</li>
            <li> The Inside Diameter of the case (without the little insert) is .402 inches or 10.23mm.  </li>
            <li> These come with a little plastic vial inside to store a tablet or capsule in, but I just removed that so I can store a bill inside.</li>
            <li> manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for something that seemed a little sturdier than what these turned out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I somehow was not expecting this little plastic sleeve that you could probably put 3-4 baby aspirin in it.</li>
            <li> If they were supposed to come with little vials inside</li>
            <li> I was little bummed about</li>
            <li> If they had made it just a little be longer and a little</li>
            <li> and I I would recommend these to anyone needing a little pill holder/emergency money holder/stash.</li>
            <li> For $6 I&#x27;d say that they&#x27;re a little overpriced for what they are, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Without the plastic, you got room for a few aspirins.</li>
            <li> The bottle was missing in two of the ones we received.  </li>
            <li> Have given a few out as gifts with bill in them.  </li>
            <li> A few times I went to pay for something and forgot my wallet</li>
            <li> The purchase was a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> o-rings are too thin and the capsule isn&#x27;t machined to properly utilize the o-ring&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or a few strawberry seeds, in case of an apocalyptic event or something.  </li>
            <li> I believe it would hold two Advil liquid gel caps, three Tylenol caplets, or maybe three or four of the round tablet size pills.</li>
            <li> It holds about five round advil tablets.</li>
            <li> definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> this is a set of 6 for half the price!  </li>
            <li> others have said it is SMALL, I knew this going into the purchase process from the other reviews, but I just wanted to show how small it</li>
            <li> This makes carrying the little nuisances wherever you go;  no more leaving them in the vehicle.  </li>
            <li> the little tubes inside are to small for any pill I can think of.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure why they have the little plastic inside.</li>
            <li> Still closes tightly!</li>
            <li> It was too small and broke within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I needed to keep just a few small pills on my keychain for emergencies.</li>
            <li> Without the vial, the inside fits four medium pills and seals very tight.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about these, they cost me less than one dollar each</li>
            <li> It is not water proof and very little water resistant.</li>
            <li> In retrospect it is a small compact design that&#x27;s meant to be added to your keychain, bailout bag, or day pack.</li>
            <li> This one is to carry meds on the sly -- small Rx pill.  </li>
            <li> I got these to carry small hearing aid batteries.  </li>
            <li> They contain a small plastic vial, presumably to protect the contents from rubbing against the aluminum</li>
            <li> I dont usually like micro caches</li>
            <li> I bought the small pill/id holder as a cash stash and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> I just take a small piece of paper and write our contact info and pets name on it....</li>
            <li> The interior bottles are almost too small to hold anything.</li>
            <li> They were too small, just in case you were wondering.</li>
            <li> I was too small.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what a dog would need to carry around with him.  </li>
            <li> With the small plastic vile, it might hold one or two baby aspirin, w/o the plastic vile, it might hold two Advil.</li>
            <li> Small for the pocket</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Can be small depending on your use</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do with them</li>
            <li> The plastic inner vial is kinda useless for this purpose</li>
            <li> I am a noob prepper, not sure what I was going to use these for</li>
            <li> The inner vial is so small as to be nearly useless.  </li>
            <li> I saw somewhere that a company was selling small containers that were made esp for wrapping up one bill (whatever amount) and storing it on a keychain for about $10 or so...</li>
            <li> I am not sure what to use that for...</li>
            <li> but I just removed the small plastic bottle inside and roll up a $20 bill and clip it to my keys.  </li>
            <li> The vials were too small to be used for just about anything.</li>
            <li> The small one could be used for carrying small safety pins or hair pins for emergencies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a small vial within the holder that I put the pills in.</li>
            <li> They are so small that I can&#x27;t think of anything they could be used for.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the plastic insert because it is way to small.  </li>
            <li> These do have some small metal shavings inside them, which is why I recommend using some type of plastic covering around any pills.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite understand what the small container inside of it is for.  </li>
            <li> They are really small.</li>
            <li> A lot of things in my travel bags get banged around and small item fall</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this shipment, received 12/2012 shows a serious degeneration of quality: smaller, threads rough cut, poor alloy quality, tinting absent on interior, thinner walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How sad.  </li>
            <li> however you do have to be careful with tightening because the threading is not perfect.</li>
            <li> I have to carry Nitro Glycerin pills and they are a bit delicate.  </li>
            <li> I also think it could have had lid with some safety feature like is found on common pill bottles.</li>
            <li> I had bought one of the expensive bill safes that Amazon carries, which come with a winder, but found that I got 6 of these for the price of 1 of the other.</li>
            <li> The inside plastic sleeve is too small to hold any pills I have around the house!</li>
            <li> After a few days the dogs came back inside and the ID tubes were not on their collars:( They must&#x27;ve pulled them off since they do wander in the woods a lot.</li>
            <li> The thread does seem a little questionable though.</li>
            <li> The little plastic vials that are included in each capsule seem useless to me.  </li>
            <li> was a little disappointed..</li>
            <li> The plastic cilinder that it comes with though, to me is almost useless; so I took it out.</li>
            <li> The product came with a creepy warning that \\&quot;This Product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still sorry I bought these Barbie-sized containers.</li>
            <li> The plastic isn&#x27;t very thin, I couldn&#x27;t crush it by squeezing with my fingers.</li>
            <li> Each pill holder had a tag with a CA state warning that the materials used to make the product may cause cancer and/or some other horrible diseases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not going to tighten them like crazy.</li>
            <li> &#x27;ll feel bad.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> All of these were horrible.</li>

            <li> they are tiny, but did find a good use.. it held some of my nephews ashes for people that wanted some.</li>
            <li> The pills have to be pretty small to fit. I wanted to carry a 250mg aspirin after reading an article suggesting that. But I had to settle for putting 4, 82mg low-dose aspirins in. It still provides what I wanted to do, but even those did not fit inside the plastic insert tube, so I just put them directly in the metal tube. If you have other medications, you may be limited in fitting them in.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can fit in the pill bottle is a 81mg asprin. Not even a tylenol will fit. I was hoping they would be a bit bigger. I took the pill bottle out and using them for $ carriers.</li>
            <li> Easy to place in trees  are on a fence. I carry them in my geo mobile,</li>
            <li> I used one for about a week and it fell apart.  I lost half of the container and my pills.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than you might expect, I was able to fit two full sized pills inside with no room for anything else. In retrospect it is a small compact design that&#x27;s meant to be added to your keychain, bailout bag, or day pack. Extremely lightweight, great for emergency situations where you need your medication, aspirin, or whatever else you can fit in it. Coloration is nice, haven&#x27;t owned them long enough to know if the coloring will fade or not. For the price, it&#x27;s a great product - just be aware that you can&#x27;t fit a whole lot in this little capsule.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie this isn&#x27;t the size I needed. I needed a size just a little bit bigger and I bought 2 packs, but I am not gonna return them. The description is exact. The plastic cilinder that it comes with though, to me is almost useless; so I took it out. You can&#x27;t put pills in it for sure. I can put BC Powder in it but that&#x27;s about it. Without the plastic, you got room for a few aspirins. Everyone likes them though. I only have 4 left, from the grand total of 12 that I had. I&#x27;ll probably give one more away and keep 3 to myself. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> These appear to be great little pill holders, but I didn&#x27;t quite put together how small the actual plastic pill holder inside the metal canister is. I&#x27;m not on a ton of prescription medication, but other than nitro, I don&#x27;t know what would fit in there.</li>
            <li> I bought these bison tubes to use them as Geocaches. They are perfect for hiding in small areas and claim to be waterproofed. However, a couple did get water in them which may have resulted from people not screwing on the caps all the way. Other than that, I don&#x27;t have anything against them other that I don&#x27;t know what someone would use them for besides Geocaching.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item for mediation management with several sizes.  This one is to carry meds on the sly -- small Rx pill.  I originally was searching for another use; however found this to be a great item.  With several colors, I got \\&quot;my\\&quot; colors and shared the rest with family and friends that enjoy the features of this item.  I took out the little plastic insert to meet my needs for size requirements.  I will order more when the time is needed.</li>
            <li> The items were exactly as promised, thanks for helping to spread the rage of geocaching!</li>
            <li> These little aluminum capsules are supposed to have a bottle inside them. The bottle was missing in two of the ones we received.  No big deal as the bottles are not needed for our use, but Ithought I would warn potential buyers.    The kids loved the colors. And you cannot beat the price. The pill containers at the local drug store were $4 EACH!</li>
            <li> Nice little pill bottles the plastic bottle inside is small but the outside one works great and for the price they are worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and great price. Good number of containers. Inner pill container too!</li>
            <li> They are great but if you are wanting it for your pills like tylenol for example you might want to buy the bigger size.  I bought it thinking it may be big enough but you can only fit max 3 pills.  Also it came with a little plastic or glass container that is on the inside which i threw out it takes up too much room.</li>
            <li> I got these to carry small hearing aid batteries.  Perfect.  Dump the small vial insert; too small for an average size capsule pill (tried one, it got stuck); but the metal case is good for one capsule size pill.  The outer case can easily hold 6 small (#312, brown) batteries.  Case top screws on and off fine; no problems so far.  Bright colors.  Handy on car keys, mail box keys and any other key ring.  when batteries are out - and you need them handy - this seems to be be the answer.  Just was i was looking for, and priced right.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The o-rings are genuinely waterproof&lt;br /&gt;-They retain their color pretty well, a few dings and scratches but the body of the color remains vibrant after constant use on my keys&lt;br /&gt;-Inconspicuous and easy to tolerate on a small keyring.&lt;br /&gt;-A US bill fits easily inside after being folded lengthwise and rolled, two will fit if you&#x27;re determined.&lt;br /&gt;-Without the inner vial, a couple gelcaps or a few tablets would fit inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The threads squeal a bit, goes away easily with some WD-40&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other:&lt;br /&gt;-The inner vial is not necessary for waterproofing, since the threads are iffy and the o-ring does that job already. It really only decreases the inner volume of the tube, so I pitched mine and just use the naked tube. Also, at least for the product I received, the inner vial is made of plastic and not glass as stated in some other reviews.</li>
            <li> I took a chance that my tiny hearing aid batteries would fit this, inside the little plastic bottle (and if not they would certainly fit in the aluminum container without the plastic bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked!  Four (4) PowerOne #10 batteries can fit in the plastic bottle. This makes carrying the little nuisances wherever you go;  no more leaving them in the vehicle.  And with the set of 6 I can gift one to each of a couple friends who are in the same boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly larger batteries can go into the container without putting the plastic bottle in.  And if they are larger than that, simply get the slightly larger medium size.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something small enough to be on one&#x27;s key chain.  These are great for that.  They seal well and don&#x27;t unscrew.  My husband isn&#x27;t gentle with his keys, so if they don&#x27;t unscrew for him, it&#x27;s a good testimonial.  The liner is nice, but he needed to remove it in order for even small pills to fit.  Works fine without the liner.  A little bigger would be great, but the only bigger one I have found was about 4 times larger making too big to be on a key chain.  I give 4 stars instead of 5 only because of limited size.  The price was amazing for the set.</li>
            <li> these are a great addition to any camping or survival pack, you can use them for medicine or spices to cook with.there are many uses for these.</li>
            <li> Old age requires more pills than the average pharmacy.</li>
            <li> WAY cheaper than Perfect Memorials! Perfect Memorials markets this item as cremation jewelery and gouges their customer on the price (24.99 for ONE cylinder). Which I feel is completely heartless and shady. Also lets not forget the fact that they are PILL HOLDERS. How dare they take a simple item like this that market it for that purpose and charge so much for it! This item is suitable for such a purpose, however I highly recommend purchasing it from here. Don&#x27;t get shamelessly gouged by that indifferent company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the old barrel ID containers for my dogs on camping and/or day trips.  I found these and decided to take a chance on them.  They work great.    I can easily slip a piece of paper with temporary contact info (campsite number, car/trailer license plate, friend or family member&#x27;s address and phone, as well as the dates we will be at that location).  The dogs&#x27; regular tags have my permanent info (phone number, the dog&#x27;s name, and REWARD).  When I move to another temporary location, I simply pull out the old info and slip in new info.    I&#x27;ve tested these at home for about 3 weeks now, and the 1 yr old dog unscrewed hers about 1-1/2 weeks in, the other dog still has his intact.  I will use a bit of crazy glue when traveling just to be safe.    At first, I thought they were a bit big for my purpose, but I actually prefer the size now as I can quickly tell if the bottom&#x27;s deattached - I keep the extras in the trailer so I can replace a lost one quickly while traveling.</li>
            <li> I have an onion/garlic allergy which antacid seems to help, so I bought a set of these to carry antacid tablets with me to have when we eat out. I have one on my keychain and one on each coat that I wear. They&#x27;re even color coordinated with the coats!  They&#x27;d also be great for aspirin, ibuprofin, etc.  For extra fun, you can mix &amp; match the tops and bottoms for great color combinations.</li>
            <li> love them. screw has great seal.</li>
            <li> I expected these to be super cheap thin metal and was suprised that is wasn&#x27;t. They are a better quality then what I have bought in stores for more money for just one. In the case that I may lose one off my key chain, I love have 5 spare. Great idea and great item.</li>
            <li> One of these is always on my key-chain which is a core part of my EDC.  Within these containers you can secure currency, medication, or other small items.  Others (singles) are sold for the same price, wit this item I got a set of 6 for $6.  Great value.</li>
            <li> these are handy but not the most well-manufactured.  a few of mine have the threads to the lid not cut well, easy to cross-threat, and easy to come apart if not properly cinched to the o-ring.  the small internal plastic container will protect some smaller pills but not big aspirin-sized ones.  will fit a rolled up $20 bill to keep on your key-chain for no-wallet emergencies.</li>
            <li> nice little pill holders water tight and easy to carry around just put one on my key ring and I always have a dose when needed</li>
            <li> These seem a bit on the cheap side, but so far they do the job as advertised.  The pack includes all six colors, so great deal for the price.  They contain a small plastic vial, presumably to protect the contents from rubbing against the aluminum casing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use mine to contain lactase pills for my lactose intolerance, and since they&#x27;re in capsules anyway, I discard the vial and just use the pill holder directly.  Like this it holds three normal size capsules -- while the vial would only hold one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They screw fairly tight and have a rubber o-ring.  I don&#x27;t expect it to hold up well, but since I got six for the price I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;ll bother me.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected and definately a great product.  You could hide many items inside!</li>
            <li> Bought these to use as geocaches since they were similar to other containers I have seen.  They arrived exactly as advertised.  My one reservation is that they seem easy to cross thread when putting them together.  One actually arrived that way, so I&#x27;m not sure how long they&#x27;ll hold up in the field.</li>
            <li> the price was right and they are water proof I have them in my survival kit and my pocket, they have gone threw the wash and still kept my pills dry. I did need to put a piece of cotton in with them to prevent the pills turning to powder</li>
            <li> The price was right, but the quality was less than desired.  Two of the six tubes had such poor threads that they slip if you tighten them too much.</li>
            <li> I dont usually like micro caches but sometimes you do have to hide a micro these fit the bill. These have a container inside for the log that helps keep it dry.</li>
            <li> -Amazing bargain for price.  Less than a dollar each for these containers.  Fit well on keychain, not too bulky and was worried that folded bill would be hard to fit in, but fits perfect.  Pill container i have not used, but once again for the price cannot beat.  Have given a few out as gifts with bill in them.  People love them.</li>
            <li> Just got them to put money in when I go on a trip soon. All 6 were fine, didn&#x27;t find any shavings, all threads were fine. Colors were consistent over entire tube (colors look just like the picture). The vial inside was plastic with an aluminum cap. The plastic isn&#x27;t very thin, I couldn&#x27;t crush it by squeezing with my fingers. They do seem rather small, the tip of a Q-tip is slightly smaller than the hole for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about these, they cost me less than one dollar each so it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily get two (2) US dollar sized bills in it without the vial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I did it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Place two bills on top of each other.&lt;br /&gt;2. Fold in half (left to right)&lt;br /&gt;3. Fold in half again (left to right)&lt;br /&gt;4. Fold 1/4 of bottom to middle (bottom to top)&lt;br /&gt;5. Fold previous fold up 1/4.&lt;br /&gt;6. Fold remaining 1/4. (You should now have it about 1in x 1/2in )&lt;br /&gt;7. Fold this piece in half (top to bottom)&lt;br /&gt;8. Open the tube and place the bills in the cap.&lt;br /&gt;9. Place cap and bills into larger part of the tube and screw on.</li>
            <li> I bought the small pill/id holder as a cash stash and it does the job.  I gave one to my kids and they seemed to like it.  They asked where I got them.  This was much cheaper than buying the $6 dollar cash stash.</li>
            <li> great seller, Nice Geocaching Bison Tubes. Recommend this product for any and all Geocachers that like to make Cachers really hunt for the prize. Enjoy the Obsession of Geocaching.    Russell  aka RADDBUS</li>
            <li> For my friends to put  asprin in and save in case of heart attacks. Something they can carry in there purse and takes up no space. They are made great.</li>
            <li> I have 4 dogs who need ID tags so I saw this on here and figured I&#x27;d try it out.....these are great! I just take a small piece of paper and write our contact info and pets name on it....then fold it and place it inside the clear container(that is inside the color tube)screw the caps on and I&#x27;m done! Hope it stays on their collars since they play rough outside...I&#x27;m glad I bought these.          *UPDATE* After a few days the dogs came back inside and the ID tubes were not on their collars:( They must&#x27;ve pulled them off since they do wander in the woods a lot. Oh well, the tubes are still very nice just if you attach it to a collar be sure to do it securely!</li>
            <li> these keychains came just in time to be stocking stuffers for my family and friends. they are very convienent they are really worth the money. i have yet to have noticed a problem with them. loved all the colors. i would reccommend these keychains.</li>
            <li> I recieved my order very fast and without any problems.  The items were good quality.</li>
            <li> Somehow I thought that these would be somewhat bigger in overall size.  Yea, I was fooled.  Finally I gave them away as cheap pranks to friends.</li>
            <li> These were perfect, and shipped faster than expected. Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I have one on each keychain....I always have extra pills!</li>
            <li> I bought this to give one to my Father-in-Law, who loves it. It&#x27;s sized for smaller medications and if you have something that needs extra protection, there is a glass container/liner that optionally fits inside (like for nitro I presume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes in various colors so can be shared, or if you have more than one medication, you can color code them. Personally, I have added a few ibuprofens to one and carry that around. It would work for many other meds though (blood pressure, migraine, baby ASA etc depending on the size/type of the pill).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very handy but make sure you only have smaller tablets or items to carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I was planning to use these two ways; as a key chain pill holder, and as a tag holder for my cats. After seeing all the reviews about how small it was i thought it would be perfect for cat tags. I have small pills that will easily fit inside, but they are a bit large for my cats. I am still debating whether or not i will be returning them. However i rated them as 4 stars because they are exactly as advertized. I wish there were more pictures and measurements though.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for holding ashes. I lost a pet and these were perfect. They are extremely solid. They have a tiny little bottle inside and the outer casing has a soft seal that makes it totally airtight and stay closed. I gave the extras to the vet. They were really grateful and plan to start buying them to give to others who lose a pet. Similar products which are designed for ashes are monumentally more expensive. Go for these.</li>
            <li> These are great pocket containers for pills.  The inside of the metal container is about 11mm in diameter, 27mm deep.  It has a good o-ring seal.  The bottle inside the metal container (about 8mm inside diameter, 22mm deep) is plastic and can be removed for other uses.  Do be sure to wash these containers thoroughly before use, and use a q-tip or something to rub around inside them, as they contained some manufacturing residue upon receipt (loose metal shavings and some unknown dark grayish powder).  I&#x27;d have given these five stars if they didn&#x27;t have the residue.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this inexpensive package of what cachers call bison tubes. They are water-proof which is terrific in the rainy Santa Cruz area where I have them hidden. I have told others of this great deal and will continue to purchase them here. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I found these containers &amp; thought \\&quot;There&#x27;s got to be something cool &amp; crafty I can do with them.\\&quot; I was right. My \\&quot;TBT Carriers\\&quot; are selling like hotcakes.  The variety of colors is excellent, &amp; the containers are sturdy, lightweight, &amp; work great!  Whatever you use them for, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find they work well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set of six pill holders so my wife and I would have a handy place to store some emergency cash.  These things do the trick.  Make a little hook out of a paperclip to wrap the money around and make it easier to pull it out, and no one would ever know that you&#x27;ve got some extra cash stashed away.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, I did and I got exactly what I expected. The interior bottles are almost too small to hold anything. I ended up throwing them away. The pill holders are perfect for holding a small item, mine have a little extra cash in them stashed in different places, my car glove box, backpack etc.</li>
            <li> Bought these to put earplugs in for my band. They were too small, just in case you were wondering. Returned and I&#x27;m buying something bigger.</li>
            <li> Pros...Great price and you get a set.    Cons...the clear pill capsule doesn&#x27;t seem large enough for alot of pills today. #2. I like to put money in mine in case I need it or if someone&#x27;s in a jam and asked for spare change but each one without the pill capsule will hold 1 bill at once so I keep a $5 bill instead of a couple of dollars like I was planning to hold.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with either of the mini tubes however you do have to be careful with tightening because the threading is not perfect. Still though, getting 6 of these for a lower price than 1 good quality one is hard to pass.</li>
            <li> This item isn&#x27;t prefect, but it certainly does it&#x27;s job decently.  I say \\&quot;not perfect\\&quot; because as a pill holder, it&#x27;s very limited in the size of pills it can hold.  If you try to put a pill into the mini pill case located in the key fob, don&#x27;t expect to put in anything larger than an Advil (if even that).  However, if you ignore the small pill case and just put the pill into the key fob, then it should be able to hold a little more pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, you don&#x27;t have to use it strictly for pills.  I use it to place in items such as rolled up cash, flint, matches, paperclips, etc.  Whatever you want to EDC in a compact, semi water resistant case, this will do the job.  Hence, due to it&#x27;s immense versatility and fun colors, I give this item a 5/5.</li>
            <li> These are good quality, but I actually bought them to take on vacation hoping I could fit money in them.  They are quite small and didn&#x27;t work for that, but they are great for their intended use (pill holder).</li>
            <li> Purchased these tubes to be used as geocaches.  They make great mini caches with their water tight seals.  Some camo colors or matte finishes would make them even better.</li>
            <li> Each container holds a little vial that I use to keep three pills in: one Benadryl, one aspirin, and one anti-nausea pill. This comes in handy while out and about.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for carrying Excedrine tablets, and it&#x27;s perfect for that.  Inside diameter is just right, and it holds 4 tablets.  An o-ring makes it watertight and the aluminum construction should last almost forever.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried after reading reviews that I&#x27;d end up with containers that had tops stripped out. However, i am beyond pleased with these! They arrived way before expected. No issues with closing tightly, although one of the rubber seals is a bit too big and slips over bottom when you close it. Still closes tightly! Also, I had no idea that there were even smaller containers inside!!! Awesome!</li>
            <li> These little containers are perfect for storing pills. It can fit about 4-5 medium sized pills in it. I like to attach them on my keys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should note that they do have another container in them, which I take out. It is clear and has a screw cap, I think it would be used to store liquids.</li>
            <li> These sounded good at the time, but I never really found a use for them.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered them</li>
            <li> I have been using these pill holders as geocaching containers and for that purpose they are very good.  Inside the aluminum outer housing is a tiny, plastic container which is too small to be useful and so I have discarded them and used the aluminum housing for the hide.  I roll up a strip of paper about an inch wide and insert it into the top of the aluminum housing before screwing the housing shut.  There is a rubber gasket between the parts of the metal housing which serves to keep a log placed inside the container dry.  The key ring makes it easy to hang the container in various places.  Or you can glue a magnet to the key ring so that it can hang from something metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The containers that I have received have been assorted, bright colors.  Most of the time, I would rather something a bit more subdued and so I spray paint the containers black.  The aluminum housing is easily spray painted, but I wish they were sold in matte black.  That would be my only gripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now ordered these containers several times and I keep coming back for more as I place more hides.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> These are way bigger than I expected &amp; want them to be. But a great value. Nice that there&#x27;s a color selection.</li>
            <li> Perfect little keychain cases. They even come with a nifty little inner bottle, though not much can fit in them. Nonetheless very nice. I use two on my keys - one with spare advils and one with a multivitamin in case I forget to take one with my breakfast!</li>
            <li> These are a great little travel item - and much cheaper than the other similar products out there. These are decent quality and have a rubber o-ring.</li>
            <li> Pills have to be carried in the prescription bottles now, so keeping these on your key ring dont work that well anymore, but these are great for small geocaches.</li>
            <li> I love the idea around the pill holder but it only holds one baby aspirin, next time i&#x27;ll chose the larger one.</li>
            <li> I carry one or two of these (depending on finances) with my keys.  They work well for holding two US bills, folded length-wise and rolled tightly, for those moments when you may need a little extra cash.  Decent construction overall and you can&#x27;t really beat the price; I purchased a few dozen to give away as gifts and found only a couple pieces with cosmetic blemishes.  Everyone seems to enjoy having them to hold their \\&quot;secret stash\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought this for a friend who will be travelling to Africa.  So we put a bill in it so that she can use it in case of emergency.  It has a big enough space for a bill rolled up, but make sure that the bill doesn&#x27;t get lodged into the back of the case.  Use a small piece of plastic bag so that it&#x27;s easy to take the money out later.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to hold a dose of my medication on my keychain and it works perfectly.  The metal outer shell holds a small glass case with a stainless steel cap.  Only very small pills (aspirin, for instance) would fit inside the small glass tube but the glass tube is removable and you can use just the metal shell to hold larger pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have found is that the metal case tends to come unscrewed over time.  I have gotten in to the habit of checking it every so often and I have yet to have it come apart.</li>
            <li> I was too small.  My meds wouldn&#x27;t fit in it.. was a little disappointed..</li>
            <li> Product description was exactly as it came. No surprises or anything like that. Even came with little containers inside these. Perfect for geocaching.</li>
            <li> Not much room for more than two capsules or three-four small pills. If you need a place for an emergency type med this is sufficient but beware the moisture can still get to your meds.</li>
            <li> I use these NOT for pills.  I put my address labels inside and affixed them to a variety of items I take with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this way, no one can easily read my address just by looking .......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if I leave an object behind and they open the pill holder, they will have my contact information and be able to get in touch with me.</li>
            <li> We used these for Geocaching logs and all of these worked just fine. They did not get wet on the inside over a period of time.</li>
            <li> The little bottles are cute and seemingly weatherproof.  I will hide them along my travels for other cachers to find.  They are not big, more like the size of your finger, but adequate to get the job done and keep the critters out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to any Geocacher.</li>
            <li> These are a useful size, once you take out the little vial that comes inside them.  They come 6 in a package, which makes them extremely cost-effective.</li>
            <li> These water tight containers make great geocaches or would be good for anything else that needs to be water tight.</li>
            <li> As containers similar to these are already listed at Amazon as pill containers, perhaps that is why these small, well constructed, rounded cylindrical containers are curiously described here as dog ID holders, key rings, and for use in geocatching.  Not sure what a dog would need to carry around with him.  Geocatching yes, but only something tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these containers are made of aluminum, and have a threaded cover, with a rubber seal ring.  Inside is a second clear plastic container with a screw on cover.  The clear container is only big enough to hold a medium sized pill or capsule, so it may not meet your needs.  The main cylinder has a diameter of 0.5 inches, length is 1.5 inches long.  Total length with the keyring is 2.1 inches, and it weights almost nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the product description indicates, these containers can be used for many purposes.  To easily tell them apart , the containers come in six different colors.  The price at Amazon varies, but five dollars for six containers is an excellent price.  If you don&#x27;t need that many, or don&#x27;t have a dog, you can always use them as zipper pulls, or give them away.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of these prior to a trip. They&#x27;re made of colorful aluminum, and have a small plastic vile inside to keep what ever is put inside waterproof. Unfortuately these were just too tiny to hold much at all. With the small plastic vile, it might hold one or two baby aspirin, w/o the plastic vile, it might hold two Advil. I had hoped to use one for my medical history, but it was just too small. I can see where this would be great for geocaching though.</li>
            <li> This was quite the bargain. I use them for geocaching. They are perfect for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Very nice little pill holders if you need to carry pills with you.  Small for the pocket but big enough to carry enough pills.  The little plastic bottle insert is great because it keep the pills from getting too banged around.  I have to carry Nitro Glycerin pills and they are a bit delicate.  This case protects them from damage pretty well and at about a buck a piece you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> I bought this to carry some daily medication, an allergy tablet, and maybe a couple Advils. The single daily med and the allery capsule could fit, but the Advil was too large. Oh well. The canisters are about the size of the eraser end of a pencil.  Each metal canister contains a waterproof plastic container which I ended up throwing away. Construction was not bad, though it is a very lightweight, inexpensive item. After two weeks of carrying it on my keychain it hasn&#x27;t worked loose and seems fine. In other, it&#x27;s doing exactly the job I needed it for.</li>
            <li> This is one of those really brilliant things i never knew I needed.  Its great for keeping a large bill hidden away in any bag for that &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; event.  Luckily I haven&#x27;t needed it yet, but it&#x27;s nice to know I have a cash backup!</li>
            <li> As pill fob go, these are definitely smaller.&lt;br /&gt;The photos attached show a baby aspirin and naproxen as examples on size.&lt;br /&gt;Included is a inner container to help keep your pills waterproof and air-tight. The downside with this of course is the smaller volume available for pills.&lt;br /&gt;The metal fob has a O-ring on the top to help keep air and water out of the inside as well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these fobs have came into good use. The metal seems to be holding up very well. The plastic inside might not last as long, but I personally rarely use the plastic tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Value vs price is excellent&lt;br /&gt;- Option to use inner plastic tube for extra water and air protection&lt;br /&gt;- Fob holds up to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Can be small depending on your use</li>
            <li> Okay if your medication is of &amp;#34;small size;.</li>
            <li> Great product and worth every penny. There is a key hook on the pill tubes and inside of each tube is a super tiny clear glass vile with a screw top. Not sure what to do with them I took them out. So actually there are 12 containers.</li>
            <li> All of these were horrible. Great idea for it though. It was too small and broke within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I had originally wanted to buy a cash-stash version of this device.  However, with the exact same dimensions, this six pack of pill holders was the same price and allowed me to share my cash-stashing idea with 5 friends for the same price.  Geocachers will find the same value and usefulness in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my purposes, it needed only one small modification to be perfect.  A dab of Loctite on the threads ensures that my little stash will not come loose until that pivotal moment when I need to pay for a cab ride home, or pay for a round of drinks unexpectedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you need to carry a small medicine cabinet with you on you keys, they&#x27;ll be just fine for that.  If you take anything bigger than a baby aspirin, you&#x27;ll need to ditch the inner glass tubes though.</li>
            <li> Key chains like this go for nearly $5 apiece in retail stores.  I didn&#x27;t need all 6, but was glad I bought the set.  Each of these small key chains has a tiny plastic bottle (1 x 3/8ths inch) inside - you can use this with or without the plastic bottle.  Each key chain seals up tight, and is made of lightweight aluminum (I think).  Very useful to cary small items on a daily basis (like medication) - I use it to carry rolled up currency so I&#x27;m never caught out with no cash &#x27;cause I left my wallet at home.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use these for Geocaching since they are water proof and come with a ring.</li>
            <li> The groove for the O-ring is not deep enough. When anything brushes against the side of the case, the O-ring rolls out and the lid becomes loose in its threads. Aside from that it&#x27;s okay.    Rick blog totalbaloney.com</li>
            <li> I paid a cheap price for these. I couldnt use the container thats inside, I just had taken it out. I use these to put in thyrosafe pills and gave one to each family member to always have on them. I had the red one on my keychain. Apparently the bottom part came unscrewed. I have an extra one, thank goodness. For the price its a good buy and the colors are cute, my kids swooped up on them fast.</li>
            <li> I got these for my father and he&#x27;s used them on his keychains for years. He uses them for emergency money and as waterproof containers for pills and such. Bluntly, the man is essentially a human entropy field and he brings decay to pretty much everything he touches - that these things have survived years of his daily use speaks volumes to how well they are made.</li>
            <li> I keep this on my keychain with a $20 bill tightly wound inside of it. A few times I went to pay for something and forgot my wallet so I was really glad to have this on my key chain.</li>
            <li> These things are tiny which is just what I was looking for for geocaching.  I&#x27;m not sure what else they&#x27;d be useful for.  I suppose you could fit a few very tiny pills but am not sure.</li>
            <li> We like these very much.  Were surprised to find an enclosed plastic bottle inside the cylinders, which will help keep the pills waterproof.</li>
            <li> Works great, no issues or problems at all.  These are very small and only hold about 1-2 pills in capsule form.</li>
            <li> Ordered these as ID capsules for our dogs - removed the inner vial and put a slip of paper in them with their name, our name, address and phone number.  We only needed 2 but I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll find many uses for the others.  Probably would be a bit large for any dog weighing less than about 25 pounds but they&#x27;re perfect for us.  The jump rings were a bit large for our needs but we just replaced them with smaller jump rings.  Very attractive colors and will probably hold up nicely.  It was an excellent purchase for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updating my review: We used the silver capsule for one of our dogs and the black one for the other.  After a few days we discovered that the black capsule was staining our dog&#x27;s fur.  I wrote to customer service about this and today received a response that suggested that I could purchase another set of capsules in order to get another silver one (which has not affected our dog&#x27;s fur) and they would ship them for free.  Since this is our sole intended use for the capsules, it would mean that I&#x27;d be paying $5.95 each for two silver capsules as I expect the other colors will do the same as the black one did.  At $5.95 for six this is a great buy; at $5.95 each - not so much.  I&#x27;m awaiting further response from customer service and will update this when I hear more.  I still think they&#x27;re great little capsules and if I can&#x27;t get another silver one I think I&#x27;ll try painting one of the colored ones with clear nail polish to see if that solves the problem.  Just want you to be aware that if you want to use these as I have, at least the black ones - without modification - will stain your dog&#x27;s fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second update: One day later and Amazon customer service has offered me either a partial refund of $1.19 or the option of returning the capsules for a full refund.  What I had really wanted was to either acquire another silver capsule or buy a second order that would be all silver capsules.  It has become clear that neither of these is possible.  Though it was nice of them to offer, I won&#x27;t bother with either the partial or the full refund.  I gave it my best shot and so did they.  It&#x27;s still a nice product.  I&#x27;ll try the clear nail polish solution and leave it at that.ible.  Though it was nice of them to offer, I won&#x27;t bother with either the partial or the full refund.

            <li> Good threads on the main capsule and solid connection to the key-chain loop.  I use one for a single American bill and another for a pair of foam earplugs.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> I was impressed when I saw this lot of six bison tubes for less than a dollar piece. I bought them to use as geocaches and they are working out fantastically.  Now I can carry around a spare cache with me at all times.  They come with o-rings so they&#x27;re nice and water tight.  The plastic inner vial is kinda useless for this purpose but I am saving them in case I come up with an idea for them.  The lids of these tubes hold a 3/4\\&quot; micro geocache log perfectly. Also, I received each of the six colors depicted in the photo in case you&#x27;re concerned about which colors you might get (red, silver, black, green, blue and purple).</li>
            <li> Item description says \\&quot;Assorted Colors (Red, Blue, Green, Black, Purple &amp; Silver)\\&quot; but items only came in silver? Other than that they are as described. No big deal for me, but that is why I gave it a 4 start rather than 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3FGIU8E4H49NY]]As others have said it is SMALL, I knew this going into the purchase process from the other reviews, but I just wanted to show how small it is.&lt;br /&gt;The inner capsule WILL NOT hold an aleve jell cap, but will hold 3 Zyrtec as they are smaller and not round.  The inner WILL also hold 1 Tylenol Gelcap.&lt;br /&gt;The outer capsule WILL HOLD 1 aleve jell cap.  I didn&#x27;t have any Advil/aleve in pill form, but I don&#x27;t think they will fit as they are a little bigger then Zyrtec.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fine with the size, and would rather carry two of them on my keys than 1 big bulky one.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to carry big pills, or several, this is not the container for you.</li>
            <li> Other reviews give enough details of these and they do what they say, with enough room for some pills, more obviously if you take out the little glass vial in each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is they are not very sturdy or strong. I probably had too high expectations for them, given the price, but there you go.</li>
            <li> I bought these not for pills but for another purpose. They worked out just fine. The price is right and they were shipped quickly. I&#x27;m actually going to go right now and order another set.</li>
            <li> These bottles are great! I keep one on my key chain and it hardly takes up any space. Each one has a small clear plastic vial inside. Without the vial, the inside fits four medium pills and seals very tight. The vial won&#x27;t even fit one pill. There are a lot of uses for the bottles, a bill or two will fit inside if you fold them well. Good price, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use as mini Geocaches. They work just fine. Oring around lid looks like it will last a while and keep the inside dry. Smaller vial inside to small for my use, but the outer canister will be perfect as a geocache container.</li>
            <li> great product, great price! I bought these for geocaching. they work great!</li>
            <li> I get headaches once in a while, so I always keep some medicine with me.  Needed something handy to carry them around, and this was a great option.  The set of 6 let me keep some in my car while having others on my key chain.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 Stars is because they are a bit too small to hold 2 average size pills.  I ended up needing to clip 2 to my keys so I can have 2 pills avail.  I could have bought a bigger version of this, but they seemed to be much larger than what I needed it for.  Maybe I should have indeed gone with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE***  I&#x27;ll admit, I&#x27;m no engineer.  Initially, I thought these capsules can only hold 1 average size pill.  What I was missing was the fact that the cap was hollow and nearly fit an entire pill itself.  So, by placing 1 pill in the capsule, and another in the cap, then screwing them together, these pill holders easily hold 2 standard size liquid or gel caps.  Definitely a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I am a noob prepper, not sure what I was going to use these for but they were cheap and cute, and still are. They are just too small to do much with. My daughter said the vial inside the metal container looked like something to hide illegal substances, and indeed I don&#x27;t know of any pill that would actually fit in there. Can take the vial out and then there is a bit more room in the container, still not sure what it would be good for, besides being pretty. I will update when I figure out what to do with them.</li>
            <li> The inner vial is very small but I will use the tube without the vial; the finish seems to be anodized aluminium.  I will wash before use and I think they will work just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely cheap but you get what you pay for. Looks great when it arrives but one day in your pocket and it looks beat-up. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Need to carry full strength aspirin and saw this set of waterproof (I checked) pill holders at a great price. Have enough to always have at least one with me. Free shipping is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I bought these to put some horse pills I have to take.  They ALMOST fit!  I ended up splitting the pills and wrapping them in tissue paper and putting them in the cases.  The Inside Diameter of the case (without the little insert) is .402 inches or 10.23mm.  If your pill is even a LITTLE larger than that, look for something else.  Other than that - for the $$ - these are great!</li>
            <li> I bought these as stash spots for currency. I had bought one of the expensive bill safes that Amazon carries, which come with a winder, but found that I got 6 of these for the price of 1 of the other. These come with a little plastic vial inside to store a tablet or capsule in, but I just removed that so I can store a bill inside. Nice, sturdy aircraft grade aluminum, too. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The product came with a creepy warning that \\&quot;This Product May Contain Substances Known to the State of California to Cause Cancer and/or Reproductive Toxicity.\\&quot;  As a result, I don&#x27;t want to use this product for storing medications, and I wish Amazon had posted a warning notice with the product description.  The purchase was a waste of time and money.  I have also uploaded a photo of the warning label.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size, not too big. I have shared them all with friends during this healthy heart month.</li>
            <li> good, uses a good seal. nice idea. wish it was smaller so it doesn&#x27;t look big on the key chain. I attached it to the inside of my backpack.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what you see. Keeps water out, after a couple rough times with it the seals get loose and let in water.</li>
            <li> I have been using these tubes to hide geocaches and they are great for that. The inner container is also nice.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect size for your pocket.  They will hold from 3 - 6 pills depending upon size.  The main thing is they are less than half the size of the medium size pill holder and are convenient.  They come with a plastic inner sleeve that I removed to accommodate larger pills.  If you only need a few pills and don&#x27;t want to walk around with a battery sized pill holder in your pocket these will fill the bill.</li>
            <li> These are REALLY small, and if you are planning on using it for pills, beware that they will most likely not fit inside the plastic capsule, not even an aspirin.  I did find that 1 caplet (elongated) aspirin will fit in it.  Other pills can fit without the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Good construction and great value.</li>
            <li> The keychains are pretty cheap and will hold most pills if you take out the useless small holder inside the keychain. The color is easily scratched off and over time, all of the keychains are silver.</li>
            <li> really does hold money, but i wouldn&#x27;t put a $50 or $100 in these - that would guarantee i&#x27;d loose them.</li>
            <li> Love these. They&#x27;re great for carrying meds around on a keychain or lanyard if you have one that&lt;br /&gt;if you forget to take you&#x27;ll feel bad. Cheap cost, sturdy and nice colors.</li>
            <li> Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small and durable with no worries. I keep two on my keychain; one for cash in a pinch and one for any pills I may need through the day(holds about two medium sized pills).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No gripes with me.</li>
            <li> I needed to keep just a few small pills on my keychain for emergencies. I&#x27;d seen something similar to these at the drugstore but they were bigger and clunkier than what I needed. The colors are pretty, but if you wanted to be more discreet, the silver would blend in with your keys and not be too noticeable. I would have been happy paying this price for one so having six is a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: A few months later, I have given away all but one of my extras. Every time someone sees it on my keychain, they want one.</li>
            <li> These work at least, but they are not of very high quality manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for something that seemed a little sturdier than what these turned out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;complaints:&lt;br /&gt;The o-rings are low quality and start to dry rot with in a year&lt;br /&gt;The o-rings are too thin and the capsule isn&#x27;t machined to properly utilize the o-ring&lt;br /&gt;The result is when you twist the lid on tightly enough the o-ring is shoved out of the gap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic bottle inside the capsule is of very low quality.&lt;br /&gt;The threading on the bottle is very coarse and the lid doesn&#x27;t really stay on well&lt;br /&gt;and the lid breaks easily</li>
            <li> I recently put together bug out bags for each member of the family and an extra one in each car. I have to take a thyroid pill every day and filled several of these with 5 days worth of pills. I put one on each car bag, one on my keychain and one on my bug out bag in the house. Now if there&#x27;s ever any kind of emergency I&#x27;ve got at least 5 days of my medicine on me pretty much at all times. The extras I put on the kids&#x27; bags and filled with allergy meds just in case. They are smaller than I thought they would be, and there&#x27;s a smaller plastic container that goes inside the metal holder. There&#x27;s a rubber gasket between the screw top and the bottom so these will stay waterproof.</li>
            <li> Essential piece of geocaching equipment if you want to hide a micro-sized container. Liked the price for a &amp;#34;6 pack&amp;#34; of these containers, even though I really wanted only 3 (will donate the others during a meet &amp; greet). Ordered via Amazon and arrived roughly 2 weeks or so before the promised date by the manufacturer. Multiple colors as well.</li>
            <li> These are very compact, nice if you need to take a pill with a meal and you are going out to dinner. Or to keep a dose of pain reliever for an emergency. There is the actual container for bigger pills, or a smaller container that fits in the bigger container, for tiny pills. Comes with a loop that you can hook onto a keychain or whatever works for you.</li>
            <li> These are some great little containers. I received all silver one in the mail, and that is the reason I give it a 4 out of 5. I was hoping for some variety but these will work great. I plan on using them as Geocache containers!</li>
            <li> Great little keychains!  It does take some finesse to get a bill to fit, but once you figure it out, it&#x27;s easy!!</li>
            <li> The coating on the containers flakes off and scratches easy.  The inner vial is so small as to be nearly useless.  You can&#x27;t even fit a single large pill in it.  Definitely recommend going to CVS and buying the little keychain vials they sell.  They&#x27;re better machined and don&#x27;t need the inner vial so they have a lot more room.  I ended up returning these and buying a half dozen of the vials from CVS - admittedly, that cost a chunk more.</li>
            <li> Previous purchases of this product [se small pill/id holder keychain (set of 6)] have been better than satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this shipment, received 12/2012 shows a serious degeneration of quality: smaller, threads rough cut, poor alloy quality, tinting absent on interior, thinner walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How sad.  I am returning.</li>
            <li> Bought these and they are a good quality and value.  Wasn&#x27;t sure what quality was going to be, but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> These holders are exactly what I needed for my pills -- I have stashed them in various places in case I forget to take my pills, as well as carry one on my keychain (see True Utility TU45 Stainless Steel Key Ring System Key Organizer by the same company).  The only weird bit is a small container I found in each holder -- it&#x27;s about a centimeter-long vial with a screw top, which I&#x27;d love to use to ensure double water protection, but the only thing I can imagine fitting in there is a grain of rice.  Or a few strawberry seeds, in case of an apocalyptic event or something.  I took them all out, as even my smallest pills don&#x27;t fit in there.</li>
            <li> I saw somewhere that a company was selling small containers that were made esp for wrapping up one bill (whatever amount) and storing it on a keychain for about $10 or so... this is a set of 6 for half the price!  It comes with an inner small plastic bottle... I am not sure what to use that for... but I just removed the small plastic bottle inside and roll up a $20 bill and clip it to my keys.  Worked so well I gave one to each of my kids and my wife!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will share with you how to fold the bill of your choosing... have the bill facing you right side up --&amp;#62; make a fold from the top long way 1/2 way down, do the same for the bottom folding up --&amp;#62; now you have a long rectangular folded bill that should be less than the actual length of the container (check it and make adjustments accordingly) --&amp;#62; roll it tight (like a bed roll) --&amp;#62; fit the tight roll in the cap, then insert the bill with the cap into the container (screw it down).  Waalaa!</li>
            <li> nicely made and good design.  Unfortunately it is too small for most of our medications.  I am sure we will still use them.</li>
            <li> I bought this to store a $100 bill for emergencies should I need it. It took some work to find the right folding to make it work. While the bill fit in the blue color, it did not for some reason in the black one which was the one I intended to use. It stripped the threads on the black one. There is a product out there strictly for dollar bills but it cost $14. So mission accomplished using these at 1/2 the cost and getting (6) vs (1).</li>
            <li> This concept of this product is excellent, however, it is just too small. It can barely hold one capsule. It has a case on the inside so my only option was to take out the case to make more room for my capsule. I am not certain if that is safe but it was the only thing I can think of doing.</li>
            <li> These are good, cheap, little containers. One given as a gift did come apart, but the circumstances are not clear. The too I keep my emergency meds in have remained tight and watertight.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but one of the pill holders keeps opening and the pills fall out!  Others seem to be OK.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of scale, you could only fit two old-style Contact cold remedy capsules stacked on top of each other, and that&#x27;s extending into the cap - inside the raw aluminium shell. The shell is a fairly thin-walled vessle with a mini plastic capped vile inside. I somehow was not expecting this little plastic sleeve that you could probably put 3-4 baby aspirin in it. Pretty much useless for what I need. Unless you are carrying a single small pain killer, sub-lingual nitro, or alternative \\&quot;powders\\&quot; . This is not something I would recommend to someone who needs an \\&quot;emergency kit\\&quot; of multiple critical meds. Yes, I know it has the measurements listed in the ad, but I clearly was not able to properly translate how tiny that would be. I&#x27;m still sorry I bought these Barbie-sized containers. I need something twice this size.</li>
            <li> These are always great to have laying around.  They&#x27;ve come in pretty handy on many an occasion.  It&#x27;s got to be a geocacher requirement!</li>
            <li> These pill holders work very well for taking Meds on the go.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had, was lost the screw on part at the Post Office once.  The Postmaster found it and put it in our PO Box.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pill holders to use as a device to carry my important medical information. I typed out all of the details on the computer, printed it, cut it to a small size then rolled it up and screwed the top back on. The secret to keeping the top on is to attach it to the key chain via a swivel hook or clasp --- that way the pill holder will rotate and not separate. My only complaint is that I got 2 black, 2 green and 2 silver instead of all of the colors shown, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> My Kids said I got them drug vials when they found the glass containers inside. The vials were too small to be used for just about anything. They got quite a chuckle, but.... they wound up using the larger ones that were purchased for them PRN. I also bought these a year ago so, I read in other reviews that the integrity or quality may have gone down since then.</li>
            <li> I bought small, medium, and large containers: the small ones would work well for carrying very small pills (nitroglycerine tablets); I use the medium one to carry my 2 p.m. dose of metformin; the large ones (to be honest, I haven&#x27;t figured out yet what I will do with these) will be great for carrying a day&#x27;s dose of meds and vitamins that I take, but I would not put it on my keychain, as it might be too heavy or cumbersome. The small one could be used for carrying small safety pins or hair pins for emergencies.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought but works great to hold 4 hearing aid batteries on my keychains or a few aspirin or tylenol.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Watertight an sturdy.</li>
            <li> I find these to be very useful. I am able to hold nine aleve in each one, 5 of my bigger vitamins, and a lot of my smaller ones. The thread does seem a little questionable though. I&#x27;m just not going to tighten them like crazy. If they were supposed to come with little vials inside I did not receive any, which I&#x27;m not upset about since I wasn&#x27;t going to use them anyway. One this I was little bummed about is that instead of a purple one I got a gold one in it&#x27;s place. Not over the top upset, just a little bummed since my favorite color is purple. But overall a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I have seen these containers before while Geo Caching. They are frequently hung in outdoor areas and thus far I have not found one that leaked and caused the log inside to be wet. I ordered them because I wanted to have some spare containers for pills and emergency cash in my purse. I was pleased with the reasonable price for them and I had no problems with the quality of the product. The tiny plastic vial inside is useable for only very small pills such as Claritin, I was able to fit 7 pills inside it. It could possibly hold baby aspirin or nitroglycerin. I had not planned to use the vial and knew from experience that the outer tubes seal pretty well and they include a rubber O-ring that keeps moisture out. So without the inside vial I had no difficulty storing two large Ibuprofen 800 mg tablets inside. I believe it would hold two Advil liquid gel caps, three Tylenol caplets, or maybe three or four of the round tablet size pills. I also found that it easily takes a carefully folded single US bill so it&#x27;s perfect for storing a spare $20 or whatever you feel you might need to have. I easily attached it to the inner zipper in my purse. I used the extra tubes to attach Ibuprofen tablets to my backpack and our Geo Caching bag for unexpected headaches. I am very pleased with them so far.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone. They are perfect! I have handed some out to friends and family. The inner clear container is kinda useless in my opinion, but can easily be discarded.</li>
            <li> I got this to hold my emergency medications, which are tiny pills, so I intentionally got the smallest size. It&#x27;s got a small vial within the holder that I put the pills in. It&#x27;s great! Waterproof. It&#x27;s been on my keyring for months and hasn&#x27;t showed any sign of wear and tear. And if it does happen to break, well, I&#x27;ve got 5 more. :P Great price! Good product.</li>
            <li> These containers were purchased to be used in the hobby of geocaching.  They have not been placed yet, but seem to be fine for their intended use.  They may not be as good as genuine \\&quot;bison\\&quot; tubes, but when you can get 6 for the price of one \\&quot;bison\\&quot; tube, they will work just fine.  After using these, I will probably order more.  Great price on them, especially when they are ordered with something else so you can get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Needed for a rush project for kids to do. Ordered different colors and was sent all silver instead. When trying to do an exchange only options was to return for refund which what I didn&#x27;t want or have the time for. No customer satisfaction or compensation here. As for the product it self the silver outside is still cute &amp; looks to do the job but will be too small for a fish oil pill must less two.</li>
            <li> Item as described. These holders work perfectly for everything from money to pills. Great bang for your buck with the purchase of the 6 pack.</li>
            <li> Mine were all fine. They are tiny, but as other reviewers have stated, the glass tube can be removed to make more room for larger tablets. They are a good buy. The size is perfect with the glass tube for some of my pills, and with the glass tube removed, for others. The colors make recognition easy.</li>
            <li> A great item for geocachers and a really nice price.  They are not the $8 each style, but have done just fine for our use.  You could, also, use these for carrying medication or whatever....  Shipping was remarkably good.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> make sure you spin them tight or they will come loose. besides that they work great. i always forget to take my allergy pills a few miles down the road after leaving home so these help out greatly. does the job...</li>
            <li> Yes, they are just pill holders but the colors are nice! They will definitely last me a long long time and for I&#x27;m intending, they will need to last even longer than that!</li>
            <li> I was expecting to receive various colors of these when I ordered them.  When they arrived, I had gotten all silver (no big deal)which I actually prefer over the colors they showed in the product picture.  The little plastic vials that are included in each capsule seem useless to me.  They are so small that I can&#x27;t think of anything they could be used for.  They are also cheaply made with the little plastic caps that don&#x27;t seem to provide a good seal. The capsules themselves seem to be pretty water tight and tighten up well.  The size is perfect for pills, I don&#x27;t have any problem fitting five ibuprofen tablets in one.  I did read a review that they sometimes have metal shaving in them when you first receive them.  I found this to be true and just cleaned them out with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, not a bad buy if you want to throw some meds in these and put them in various places (car, keychain, edc bag).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to hide these buggers! These will be triky for people to find I can tell! Cool product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Size is suitable for keychain. The inside plastic sleeve is too small to hold any pills I have around the house! Still water-proof without it.</li>
            <li> I got these to use on a keychain with medicine. They come with a little bottle inside that is so small nothing can fit in them. Do not buy if this is ur intended use.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment and solid little pill cases. They are smaller than I first thought, big enough to hold 2 Advil liquid jells without the sealing case inside. These little pill cases are definitely waterproof and with the small canister inside each one they are air tight.</li>
            <li> Geocachers call these bison tubes</li>
            <li> Cannister would be better without smaller plastic insert on the inside.  Had to cut advil in two to fit inside.  Can&#x27;t argue about price/quality/quantity though.</li>
            <li> This is a nice deal for what it is.  Came exactly as shown.  No surprises. Colors are great for organizing.</li>
            <li> I like to take all kinds of pills and I can&#x27;t be without them, I got these and I hide pills all over town, Now I can go for walks and still have my pills.</li>
            <li> Perfect for storing anything small you need to take on the road - They each have a little glass vile inside that makes adding and removing products easy, and the top is slightly magnified to stick to the top, so there is no rattling inside. And the colors are very vibrant! Good for your purse, first aid kit, or anything you take with you on the go.</li>
            <li> Ordered these items because of the 6 colors.  I got 2 red and 4 silver in a padded envelope.  They seem like leftovers to me.  I would return them but it&#x27;s not worth my time or effort.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great for putting I car or bag and hold small things well. Easy to use and quite sturdy. Good product.</li>
            <li> I could not tell the size of the pill holders.  However they are OK for many uses.  They are light being plastic and will accommodate small pills easily, but not large ones.</li>
            <li> These keychains are perfect for hiding goecaches. They come with a clear, tubular insert that I took out and use separately for nano caches. They are well made and the perfect size for hiding in tree branches or hooked/secured to structures. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I had a wooden pill case that these replace, the top of the wood key was always coming undone.  So far the rubber gasket has kept these closed, I have not had a problem.</li>
            <li> I chose four stars because more consideration in the design could&#x27;ve been given to the inside diameter size with respect to common pill sizes.  If they had made it just a little be longer and a little larger diameter I could fit four pills instead of 2.  There is fair amount of wasted space because it is just a bit to small.  I don&#x27;t use the plastic insert because it is way to small.  I wrap my pills (pepto bismal) in a bit of suran wrap.  I think that chapstick size would be good because you could fit four pills and this is a size that people are used to having in their pockets.  I also think it could have had lid with some safety feature like is found on common pill bottles. However, I generally like them so far and I just carry two in my pocket which isn&#x27;t really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the dimensions (all in inches) since this was the most important deciding factor for me, I thought it was worth adding here for everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;metal body without the lid on :&lt;br /&gt;outer diameter &#x3D; 0.526&lt;br /&gt;inner diameter &#x3D; 0.470&lt;br /&gt;inside depth of main body &#x3D; 1.107&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dimensions of the metal lid:&lt;br /&gt;outer diameter of lid at thread &#x3D; inner diameter of body &#x3D; 0.470&lt;br /&gt;inner diameter &#x3D; 0.427&lt;br /&gt;inside depth of lid &#x3D; 0.442&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall dimensions of metal holder assembled:&lt;br /&gt;length &#x3D; 1.75&lt;br /&gt;diameter &#x3D; 0.526&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic holder:&lt;br /&gt;inner diameter &#x3D; 0.308&lt;br /&gt;depth &#x3D; 0.960</li>
            <li> great for geocaching!!</li>
            <li> At first I was very excited to purchase this item. My wife and I both get headaches and it seems we never have anything with us to take when we need to. So I bought this to put some advil in and carry on our key rings. It holds about five round advil tablets. A couple days later my wife was walking through the store and the bottom half just fell off and the advil went everywhere. Yes I made sure that is was tight when I screwed it together. A few days after that the same thing happened to the one on my key ring. After looking at it a bit I noticed that the threads are not very tight together and if it is bumped it wiggles loose. i have cranked it as tightly as I can and have also put a little piece of cotton ball in it to keep the contents from going all over if it is dropped again. It is not water proof and very little water resistant. Especially if you have to crank it tight.</li>
            <li> I love these little holders! I pre-filled each one with my &amp;#34;emergency rations&amp;#34; of pills (the ones I might need if I have more severe pain that day) and snap one onto my work lanyard each day. After a while, I just used the purple one, as my pill consumption went down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They hold shut wonderfully; have never had one accidentally open. And the fun colors make it easy to find.</li>
            <li> As I said, for the price these are simply amazing.  Each one comes with a little clear plastic vial that can hold something the size of about 1 Tylenol gelcap. If you remove the plastic vial, you can easily fit 2.  I carry two Tylenol gel-caps in 1 container, I wrap them with a bit of plastic wrap to keep them somewhat protected and so far this has worked great.  I keep two of these canisters on my edc keychain, one I&#x27;ve managed (with some trial and error) a $20 bill (in the green one :]), and the medicine in the other.  These do have some small metal shavings inside them, which is why I recommend using some type of plastic covering around any pills.  If you over tighten them the little o-rings do have a habit of &#x27;popping&#x27; out/off, however you can make the top screw on and stay rather tight by just being careful and few should have any problems with this.&lt;br /&gt;These are very light weight aluminum and the treading is ok for what they are.  I have noticed that over time the paint does seem to chip off a bit, but not to the point of it being a big issue or enough to lose a star.  I am very satisfied with these and I I would recommend these to anyone needing a little pill holder/emergency money holder/stash.</li>
            <li> just the right size for a 20.00 bill for emergency or advil. very light and water proof. Comes in all colors.</li>
            <li> Each pill holder had a tag with a CA state warning that the materials used to make the product may cause cancer and/or some other horrible diseases. We threw all of them out right away and bought a plastic one from the grocery store. Bonus was the plastic pill holder key chain actually holds more pills.</li>
            <li> I have given it as a gift to several of my friends.  It could be very useful.  I don&#x27;t quite understand what the small container inside of it is for.  It wouldn&#x27;t fit many medications.  Without the internal container, the entire unit could be smaller.</li>
            <li> Low durability o-rings. cracked quickly.</li>
            <li> Its smaller and I have thought but it works well for my husband, who is the reason I bought them.</li>
            <li> These pill holders are pretty good. For $6 I&#x27;d say that they&#x27;re a little overpriced for what they are, but they get the job done. I use mine to hold iodine tablets for water purification. They are sealed by a rubber o-ring to keep out water and debris. What isn&#x27;t mentioned in the product description is that inside each of these pill tubes is a smaller pill tube. The smaller one is about an inch tall and can hold 8 iodine tablets. Overall it&#x27;s a good product, I just wish that they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. Most of the items were scratched and made improperly. It was as if No inspection was done of the product. definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I found these while searching for some way of carrying meds with me everywhere I go.  they work for that but barely.  They are really small. the little tubes inside are to small for any pill I can think of.  if you want to carry tylenol or ibuprofen then look somewhere else.  also I wanted to be able to carry emergency money with me but I could only get 1 bill folded as small as I could and it still wouldn&#x27;t close...&lt;br /&gt;these are worth the cost but too small to be really useful...</li>
            <li> I use these for my dogs. To keep a note of our contact details on them. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Mine came in all silver. Some of the \\&quot;O\\&quot; rings aren&#x27;t as good as others, but it serves its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why they have the little plastic inside. It doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any added value. It limits the size of pill or anything else you put in there and adds another layer of things to open in order to get what you want out of there. I think I have tossed all the inside plastic things out for each one I am using.</li>
            <li> The outer container is the only practical place to store pills- the inner tube is too small to hold anything but powder.  But even then, it only holds about 500 mg of sugar which I&#x27;ve tested.</li>
            <li> I now carry two Aspirin on my key ring.  Gave others to friends at Church.  Now we are all protected.</li>
            <li> They are tiny, but still hold a couple pills or geocache log.  My nephew loved them so had to give him one.</li>
            <li> THese are useful for many things. Everyone in my family got their own color and no fighting because there were so many to chose from.</li>
            <li> This is a lot better than depending upon ziplock bags when you&#x27;re going mobile. A lot of things in my travel bags get banged around and small item fall ot get lost in the bottom. Also, when bags start wearing holes (before you have time to replace them), things</li>
