            <li>I am truly thrilled to have my Conair Tc700 Ceramic 3/4 inch Curling iron.  </li>
            <li>This was a nice addition to my curling iron collection..</li>
            <li>Both came out nice.</li>
            <li>Very happy so far with this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and produces a good curl that lasts.  </li>
            <li>Love that I can curl my hair anywhere.</li>
            <li>We have since ordered two more (just in case they also disappear from availability).  </li>
            <li>Its better than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Why don&#x27;t more folks know about this?  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d have electricity all the time.  </li>
            <li>So, I took a chance and it made it through even the most stringent airport security.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to carry around and so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to curl up my hair while chatting wth the driver during my 45 minute commute.</li>
            <li>I bought this to take on an across country train trip where an electric outlet wasn&#x27;t easy to get to.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than an electric - and heats up faster - love it!</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT curling iron, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>But, it is great to touch up her hair after ball games and such before heading out with the friends.</li>
            <li>The barrel is smaller than I imagined but works great.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t compare it to a regular size curling iron, but this compact iron makes it great for touch-ups or travel.</li>
            <li>I do like the size of curls, the light weight of unit and color.</li>
            <li>It really works well and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>First, I was pleased to see the color and appearance of the iron was so sleek</li>
            <li>and then when I actually used it, delighted with the operation and ease to quickly change my hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>Heated up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>works really well for touchups...love it!!</li>
            <li>My last Conair cordless lasted more than 10 years!</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and pretty hot</li>
            <li>It also heats up fast and surprisingly has enough heat!</li>
            <li>Gets hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>They lay in your cosmetic drawer, handy, don&#x27;t have to go looking for them, no hooking them up to electricity, and the little propane tanks one uses can be found easily in drugstores, WalMart, Target, etc.</li>
            <li>I mainly use mine for touching up my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love these, this is my fourth one, having overused and burned up three before.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first one in Shreveport, La over 30 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It also provides higher heat than the Braun units did.  </li>
            <li>Gets really hot...</li>
            <li>I have noticed it does not click on the first time and often need to click 4-5 times to get it going.</li>
            <li>First one lasted 25 years.  </li>
            <li>I like this iron better than the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It says it gets 360 degrees, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my plug in conair curling iron.</li>
            <li>My wife for years enjoyed using the Braun cordless curling irons even though they were not very reliable.  </li>
            <li>We ordered one of these and so far it seems much more reliable and the cartridges last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast &amp; doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I read reviews on several cordless irons and was hoping this would be half as good as the one I purchased 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>gets hot fast and is ez to use - like the short barrel.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to get limp, so this works very well for my hair type.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tested it out twice.</li>
            <li>It just will not heat high enough to curl, and I do not believe it faulty.  </li>
            <li>It is as expected and a very reasonable value.</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron because of the reviews but when it arrived I found it to be too small and cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>the only reason i had to buy a new curling iron is that Braun stopped making the refill cartridges.</li>
            <li>As I explained to her, it is not a do your whole head and expect it to last the entire night type of curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gone on the plane with it, so I&#x27;m not sure how true its claim of \\&quot;one curling iron and one butane cartridge allowed\\&quot; is.</li>
            <li>I tried 2 other models by Conair that I would not waste my money on, but this one really does get hot enough to curl even \\&quot;hard to curl\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li>although finding good reliable info on what was and wasn&#x27;t acceptable in carry-ons was almost impossible).  </li>
            <li>I work in the Beauty industry and needed a curling iron for \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot; where I would not have access to power, and this little number really does the trick.  </li>

            <li> I have long hair and it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought this since it said it could be taken on flights and some of the other similar products didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Thus, I have been using Conair for the past several years and only recently discovered this model.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Conair Curling Iron to use in my 5th wheel when I dry camp.  </li>
            <li> I spent 2 weeks in India and 2 weeks in Thailand last year, and this little beauty performed like a champ.  </li>
            <li> Received product faster than expected.</li>
            <li> My first 8 to 10 curling irons were Braun (1\\&quot;), however, the wick would burn out after 6 - 12 months and eventually they became difficult to locate.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it got a little hotter.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this little curler to work so well.</li>
            <li> Its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> then with looser curls it might not matter that it didn&#x27;t get as hot and wouldn&#x27;t look as bad.</li>
            <li> In the past month, I&#x27;ve taken this curling iron to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and to Greece.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work well for me at all :/</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong was the description said it came with a carrying case.  </li>
            <li> Unable to know how log one butane will last.  </li>
            <li> its a massive piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper.  </li>
            <li> Does not stay lit, I am very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these, this is my fourth one, having overused and burned up three before.  I especially like the one for traveling, a mini to this one and in a traveling case.  I bought my first one in Shreveport, La over 30 years ago.  They lay in your cosmetic drawer, handy, don&#x27;t have to go looking for them, no hooking them up to electricity, and the little propane tanks one uses can be found easily in drugstores, WalMart, Target, etc.</li>
            <li> This a great product for the girls on the go. Love that I can curl my hair anywhere.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT curling iron, especially for the price.  I work in the Beauty industry and needed a curling iron for \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot; where I would not have access to power, and this little number really does the trick.  Heats up very quickly and pretty hot I might add.  I tried 2 other models by Conair that I would not waste my money on, but this one really does get hot enough to curl even \\&quot;hard to curl\\&quot; hair.  Gets a thumbs up in my book!  Will be great for traveling as well!</li>
            <li> Just wish it got a little hotter. But it is awesome for travelling / commuting. Easy to curl up my hair while chatting wth the driver during my 45 minute commute. Much better use of my time than fb!</li>
            <li> My wife for years enjoyed using the Braun cordless curling irons even though they were not very reliable.  They have now disappeared from the market.  We ordered one of these and so far it seems much more reliable and the cartridges last much longer.  It also provides higher heat than the Braun units did.  We have since ordered two more (just in case they also disappear from availability).  We&#x27;ll leave one at our son&#x27;s house on the other side of the country since we&#x27;ve had a TSA agent refuse to allow one on the plane even though the rules clearly allow a single unit.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on several cordless irons and was hoping this would be half as good as the one I purchased 20 years ago. Its not! It just will not heat high enough to curl, and I do not believe it faulty.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  Its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> In the past month, I&#x27;ve taken this curling iron to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and to Greece.  It is absolutely amazing!  Heats up quickly, perfect temperature, and easy to transport.  No issues whatsoever with airport screening.</li>
            <li> I bought this since it said it could be taken on flights and some of the other similar products didn&#x27;t. Where we are going won&#x27;t have electricity, so I figured it would be nice to have this for touch-ups. So far I&#x27;ve tested it out twice. It says it gets 360 degrees, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my plug in conair curling iron. I also wish it had a bigger barrel, then with looser curls it might not matter that it didn&#x27;t get as hot and wouldn&#x27;t look as bad. It just doesn&#x27;t work well for me at all :/</li>
            <li> This curling iron is a great touch up curling iron to carry in my daughters bag!  As I explained to her, it is not a do your whole head and expect it to last the entire night type of curling iron.  But, it is great to touch up her hair after ball games and such before heading out with the friends.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS! its a massive piece of crap. I had the BRAUN independent for 15 years. the only reason i had to buy a new curling iron is that Braun stopped making the refill cartridges.</li>
            <li> This curling iron worked great while camping.  Heated up quickly.  Very lightweight and easy to travel with.  The only thing wrong was the description said it came with a carrying case.  It does not.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron because of the reviews but when it arrived I found it to be too small and cheaply made.  Anyway, I didn&#x27;t like it so I was planning on returning it.  But, Amazon will not accept returns on toxic/flammable items - that means butane.  I am stuck with an item I don&#x27;t want and out some cash.</li>
            <li> This puppy works great! I take it traveling and it&#x27;s so convenient to use. You get great curl from it and charger lasts quite a while. Recommend</li>
            <li> This is perfect for throwing in my gym bag.  Its better than I thought it would be.  Heats up fast &amp; doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.  Makes beautiful curls.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and produces a good curl that lasts.  I have fine hair that tends to get limp, so this works very well for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Used this for our European trips. It worked well without having to bring a transformer. Size is compact for packing. Good for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> Does not stay lit, I am very disappointed with this product. I have used these curling irons before and&lt;br /&gt;have been please with their performance.</li>
            <li> works really well for touchups...love it!!</li>
            <li> I am truly thrilled to have my Conair Tc700 Ceramic 3/4 inch Curling iron.  First, I was pleased to see the color and appearance of the iron was so sleek and then when I actually used it, delighted with the operation and ease to quickly change my hairstyle.  I purchased this one at Amazon and was even happier when I saw the price.  I have been using gas cartridge cordless curling irons for over 19 years.  My first 8 to 10 curling irons were Braun (1\\&quot;), however, the wick would burn out after 6 - 12 months and eventually they became difficult to locate.  Thus, I have been using Conair for the past several years and only recently discovered this model.  Very nice!</li>
            <li> I got this because of the convenience. The barrel is smaller than I imagined but works great. It also heats up fast and surprisingly has enough heat! It&#x27;s so easy to carry around and so easy to use! You can&#x27;t compare it to a regular size curling iron, but this compact iron makes it great for touch-ups or travel. I haven&#x27;t gone on the plane with it, so I&#x27;m not sure how true its claim of \\&quot;one curling iron and one butane cartridge allowed\\&quot; is. This was a nice addition to my curling iron collection..and I would definitely bring it next time I travel.</li>
            <li> Butane curlers are my favorite!  gets hot fast and is ez to use - like the short barrel.  Much easier to use than an electric - and heats up faster - love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Gets really hot...</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GIFT TO MY NIECE AND SHE LOVES THIS CURLING IRON</li>
            <li> Received product faster than expected. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this little curler to work so well. It works just as good as my plug-in wand curler. I have long hair and it still gets the job done. I used the clamp of it and also used it as a wand curler... Both came out nice. Highly recommend! Will be using this at Coachella while roughin it in a tent for 4 days!</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on an across country train trip where an electric outlet wasn&#x27;t easy to get to.  Heats up in a couple of minutes and works great and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> On the go this is great</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! Lightweight and easy to use. I mainly use mine for touching up my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t more folks know about this?  It&#x27;s great.  Gets hot quickly.  You can carry it anywhere without the bother of cords or electrical outlets.</li>
            <li> Very happy so far with this curling iron. Bought it for travel purposes and it comes with a cover to meet TSA regulations. Heats up quickly. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Conair Curling Iron to use in my 5th wheel when I dry camp.  It really works well and is very easy to use.  I&#x27;ve found it to be dependable and I would recommend this product.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Happy to get for replacement! Cheaper than the butain.</li>
            <li> It does the job.  Unable to know how log one butane will last.  It is as expected and a very reasonable value.</li>
            <li> I do like the size of curls, the light weight of unit and color. I have noticed it does not click on the first time and often need to click 4-5 times to get it going. Best to pause in-between trying to start it. Perhaps this is a safety feature. Hope it last! My last Conair cordless lasted more than 10 years!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  First one lasted 25 years.  I spent 2 weeks in India and 2 weeks in Thailand last year, and this little beauty performed like a champ.  I wasn&#x27;t just unsure about the electrical conversion..I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d have electricity all the time.  No worries with this!  I even carried it on the plane (although finding good reliable info on what was and wasn&#x27;t acceptable in carry-ons was almost impossible).  So, I took a chance and it made it through even the most stringent airport security.  It&#x27;s great for camping too!</li>
            <li> I like this iron better than the flat iron.  It seems to get hotter.  It&#x27;s great for travel and camping when there is not electricity.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use overseas but the curling iron didn&#x27;t have a cover for the barrel even though it was advertised on the package.  When I tried to get a return slip from Amazon, it wouldn&#x27;t let me return it because it was &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34;.  Not a happy camper.  Waste of money.</li>
