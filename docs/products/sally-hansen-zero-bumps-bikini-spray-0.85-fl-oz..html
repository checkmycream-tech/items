            <li>This is wonderful!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>wonderful product - though youhave to use day and night.</li>
            <li>It did not work, nor did it smell very good</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>I am so glad someone took the time to create a product that smells wonderfully AND helps with bikini bumps.</li>
            <li>So I thought all was good..</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the product, and will probably buy another one once I run out!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Loved the light scent to it and the way it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>My skin gets irritated really easily almost everytime I shave, but my skin has never been smoother!</li>
            <li>Cheap and works better than anything I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to buy 2</li>
            <li>Always wanted something better than a cream to put on.</li>
            <li>IF ANYTHING MAKES YOUR SKIN MORE IRRITATED.</li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>But I still prefer another brand of bikini gel that works better.</li>
            <li>It works great and really calms my skin.  </li>
            <li>Now I just use Shea butter which works better</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, isn&#x27;t sticky, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;ve gotten out, I then spray this twice at the top, and rub it where I know I feel the most irritation.</li>
            <li>I love spoiling my lady parts with only the best.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, and it&#x27;s convenient to use because of the packaging.</li>
            <li>and I was fine for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I knew it had to be from this spray because the rest of my body, which didn&#x27;t come in contact with this spray, is totally fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try to have the freedom of being able to shave without bumps.</li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is amazing, so if you&#x27;re partnered, he or she will thank you later! : )</li>
            <li>After 24 hours I started developing a bright red, super itchy rash on my bikini area.</li>
            <li>Along with other reviewers, I experienced a burning sensation upon application.</li>
            <li>So now instead of having a smooth bikini area, I have large patches of bright red patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin unbelievably smooth and really does help reduce razor bumps, itchyness, and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>so not the most economical if you shave frequently.</li>
            <li>It does not last more than 3-5 seconds, however that is troubling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sadly, I do wish this came in a larger size, as this tube only lasted me a good month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a while (when I remember lol) and I definitely have LESS bumps.</li>
            <li>But after my experience I really had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying an epilator, I was searching for a solution so prevent razor bumps.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It worked at first, then the bumps came right back after awhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually not sure how it works, which is kind of embarrassing, but it soothes my irritable skin, so it may work for you.</li>
            <li>With this spray it closes all the open cuts that your razor gives you and only leaves you with a lovely finished</li>
            <li>but I highly suggest that you do a swatch test to confirm before you use it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love this little spray.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering for nearly from irritated skin caused by shaving, which produced unsightly and very itchy razor bumps.</li>
            <li>so normally I shave</li>
            <li>I do not believe the alcohol content shouldn&#x27;t be so high in a product designed to be used in a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li>I soak the entire area right after I shave</li>
            <li>I feel like this is the start of a new addiction</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so no matter what razor I use, I always get bumps</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t consider myself having sensitive skin</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to tell you that my skin is really sensitive, and with this spray it doesn&#x27;t cause any rashes or leave me with any burning or tingling sensations.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After this supply is out, I will return to my natural witch hazel and coconut oil application.</li>
            <li>, I bought this a few months ago, and am still using the same container I originally purchased.</li>
            <li>I have to use this every time I shave to keep from getting red bumps as I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It stings a little at first, but dissipates.</li>

            <li> I have to use this every time I shave to keep from getting red bumps as I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It stings a little at first, but dissipates.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it runs out to fast.  </li>
            <li> I will continue buying this as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that grows fast</li>
            <li> As others have said, this works extremely well to eliminate razor bumps and pain following shaving.  </li>
            <li> Do not use on sensitive skin it burns :/</li>
            <li> A spritz or two goes a long way, however do be careful about application.</li>
            <li> I spray a little on my fingers and spread it around so that it will last longer.</li>
            <li> So when I initially got this product I thought that it wasn&#x27;t going to work and that it was going to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I take feminine hygiene very seriously and this really helps appearance of bumps after shaving.</li>
            <li> noticed that the typical little buggers called bumps never came back again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But with this stuff I can dry shave if I want with no lotion or shaving gel and keep shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> Use it every time I shave, and seems to keep the razor burn down to a minimum...</li>
            <li> I shave once a week because as a woman, I cannot stand hair down there at all.</li>
            <li> It also slowed down hair growth</li>
            <li> and then I have to wait a few days for irritation to go down before I can shave again</li>
            <li> Now, I apply a small amount very carefully using my fingertips.</li>
            <li> and once I was out of the shower, I dried myself and used this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can get messy.</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of $10.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a small amount of time a few months</li>
            <li> It is, however, a small container</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re still there, not sure if its the spray</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for anyone who has problems with getting a bad case of bikini bumps after shaving.</li>
            <li> This spray has made it possible for me to shave without unsightly (and uncomfortable!)</li>
            <li> and I have never experienced any allergic reactions like this in the past from beauty and skin products.</li>
            <li> Bought this after a recommendation of a few YouTube beauty people and was skeptical but it works well and helps with bumps</li>
            <li> , I stupidly decided to go &amp;#34;bare&amp;#34; and completely shaved myself.</li>
            <li> I may feel the occasional sting once spraying, but it is not too bad, because I will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> I WAS SO WRONG.</li>

            <li> As others have said, this works extremely well to eliminate razor bumps and pain following shaving.  It is, however, a small container so not the most economical if you shave frequently.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin unbelievably smooth and really does help reduce razor bumps, itchyness, and ingrown hairs. The only thing I have used on bikini area that works.</li>
            <li> Bought this after a recommendation of a few YouTube beauty people and was skeptical but it works well and helps with bumps</li>
            <li> This spray has made it possible for me to shave without unsightly (and uncomfortable!) bumps. I have been suffering for nearly from irritated skin caused by shaving, which produced unsightly and very itchy razor bumps. My nickname became Itchy Legs. This stuff works, even on my legs, which can also get bumps (although it is not indicated for this purpose, so I&#x27;m using it off-label). I&#x27;m actually not sure how it works, which is kind of embarrassing, but it soothes my irritable skin, so it may work for you. It&#x27;s worth a try to have the freedom of being able to shave without bumps.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works for me!  I put it on immediately after shaving and it stops the itching.</li>
            <li> OMG this thing smells like Hawaii I kid you not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a small amount of time a few months, I stupidly decided to go &amp;#34;bare&amp;#34; and completely shaved myself. I used a gel and once I was out of the shower, I dried myself and used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the typical little buggers called bumps never came back again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I do wish this came in a larger size, as this tube only lasted me a good month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone who has problems with getting a bad case of bikini bumps after shaving. Just make sure to buy 2 so you have enough to last you.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! Always wanted something better than a cream to put on.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF DOES NOT WORK AND IF ANYTHING MAKES YOUR SKIN MORE IRRITATED. Do not use on sensitive skin it burns :/</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so no matter what razor I use, I always get bumps and/or razor burn. I bought this hoping to eliminate these unattractive bumps. It did not work, nor did it smell very good and it burned when I put it on. I will not be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> It just came in yesterday and I used it once this morning. It worked basically instantly! No bumps, no burn, nothing! My skin gets irritated really easily almost everytime I shave, but my skin has never been smoother! I feel like this is the start of a new addiction and I&#x27;m going to be buying a lotttt of this stuff in the future. Now I can wear a bathing suit without being self-conscious or having to wear cover ups!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I never write reviews. But after my experience I really had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying an epilator, I was searching for a solution so prevent razor bumps. I found this spray online and after reading the reviews I thought to give it a try. So after epliating I sprayed this on my bikini line and I was fine for 24 hours. So I thought all was good.. I WAS SO WRONG. After 24 hours I started developing a bright red, super itchy rash on my bikini area. I knew it had to be from this spray because the rest of my body, which didn&#x27;t come in contact with this spray, is totally fine. So now instead of having a smooth bikini area, I have large patches of bright red patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t consider myself having sensitive skin and I have never experienced any allergic reactions like this in the past from beauty and skin products. This spray might end up working wonders for you but I highly suggest that you do a swatch test to confirm before you use it. Don&#x27;t end up like me googling ways to help treat this breakout.. I may need to go see a dermatologist if this doesn&#x27;t start healing by tomorrow.</li>
            <li> So when I initially got this product I thought that it wasn&#x27;t going to work and that it was going to be a waste of money. After using it for a couple of times I come to find that this product works like a charm. Ever since I started shaving in my bakini area and spraying after I no longer have razor bumps. With this spray it closes all the open cuts that your razor gives you and only leaves you with a lovely finished product.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to tell you that my skin is really sensitive, and with this spray it doesn&#x27;t cause any rashes or leave me with any burning or tingling sensations. I fell in love with the product, and will probably buy another one once I run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while (when I remember lol) and I definitely have LESS bumps. but they&#x27;re still there, not sure if its the spray or because I don&#x27;t use it every time I shave.</li>
            <li> Cheap and works better than anything I have ever tried! Use it every time I shave, and seems to keep the razor burn down to a minimum...</li>
            <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of the lidocaine products out there. It smells pretty good, and it&#x27;s convenient to use because of the packaging. But I still prefer another brand of bikini gel that works better.</li>
            <li> I have to use this every time I shave to keep from getting red bumps as I have extremely sensitive skin.  It works great and really calms my skin.  It does prevent bumps.  My only complaint is that it runs out to fast.  I spray a little on my fingers and spread it around so that it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I think it does the job. Can get messy. Has never irritated me.</li>
            <li> It worked at first, then the bumps came right back after awhile. Now I just use Shea butter which works better</li>
            <li> Works! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epilator on my bikini line for a while now, and despite exfoliation, I still have issues with redness and bumps. I started using this a couple of weeks ago and I&#x27;m impressed. I use it each time after I epilate. It stings a little at first, but dissipates. It absorbs well, isn&#x27;t sticky, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> It smoothes the skin, and deals with my skin condition! wonderful product - though youhave to use day and night.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon (got it from CVS) but wish I hadn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t done anything to get rid of my red bumps. Definitely a waste of $10.</li>
            <li> I shave once a week because as a woman, I cannot stand hair down there at all. After I shave, I exfoliate, while still in the shower. Once I&#x27;ve gotten out, I then spray this twice at the top, and rub it where I know I feel the most irritation. The vanilla scent is amazing, so if you&#x27;re partnered, he or she will thank you later! : ) I will continue buying this as long as they sell it. I love spoiling my lady parts with only the best. I take feminine hygiene very seriously and this really helps appearance of bumps after shaving. I may feel the occasional sting once spraying, but it is not too bad, because I will keep buying it! Even shaving once a week, I bought this a few months ago, and am still using the same container I originally purchased. I am so glad someone took the time to create a product that smells wonderfully AND helps with bikini bumps. High-five to them! I hope Sally Hansen never stops selling this. Ever.</li>
            <li> Love this little spray. It works very well. I had no issues after I used it. Loved the light scent to it and the way it made my skin feel. I have sensitive skin but it all it did was help me instead of cause additional problems.</li>
            <li> Along with other reviewers, I experienced a burning sensation upon application. It does not last more than 3-5 seconds, however that is troubling. I do not believe the alcohol content shouldn&#x27;t be so high in a product designed to be used in a very sensitive area. A spritz or two goes a long way, however do be careful about application. Now, I apply a small amount very carefully using my fingertips. After this supply is out, I will return to my natural witch hazel and coconut oil application.</li>
            <li> I soak the entire area right after I shave and there&#x27;s never any irritation or bumps. I have thick hair that grows fast so normally I shave and then I have to wait a few days for irritation to go down before I can shave again but by that time a lot of hair is already back and I feel gross. But with this stuff I can dry shave if I want with no lotion or shaving gel and keep shaving everyday. It also slowed down hair growth so I wasn&#x27;t all prickly in the morning. It smells great and I can feel the second I spray it on my pores opening. I swear by this stuff! Love it!</li>
