            <li>Great product even tho</li>
            <li>Great material.</li>
            <li>but this should work great.</li>
            <li>Great coverage.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Bought 4 of these they fit perfect.</li>
            <li>Keeps my ears warm.</li>
            <li>Nice I bough it to wear to work to keep my head warm nice</li>
            <li>I love wearing this while I run errands..it gets the hair out of my face and its cute!</li>
            <li>best invention for moms that have a busy life and no time.</li>
            <li>Great quality super cute</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>so it fits much more bunched up</li>
            <li>Cheap and tacky!  </li>
            <li>I really liked this headband when i first got it, but the headband isn&#x27;t stitched into place to hold shape.</li>
            <li>It would probably fit a child but the description states that it is a woman&#x27;s headband.</li>
            <li>lol will definitely be buying again</li>
            <li>Cheaply made as well.</li>
            <li>and  they&#x27;re too big for most folks!  </li>
            <li>Love it came early too.</li>
            <li>My sister loved it and loves wearing it just wish I didn&#x27;t get black.</li>
            <li>To tight and did not look good on</li>
            <li>When I took it off, the headband untwisted and I can&#x27;t figure out how to get it exactly as it first was.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Will be used more to wash my face than going out in public.</li>
            <li>Cute, but too tight to wear comfortably, I imagine as these headbands are made in Asia, they are intended for much more petite women like Asian shoes and clothes seem to be.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used too many of these headbands, so I am not sure how it is supposed to fit.</li>
            <li>Too large for my head.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay put very well.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a whole package and only received 1 in the mail.</li>
            <li>I got the black and it fits ok but the fabric is pretty much spandex, not great for appearance.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft and silky, I bought this headband since I cut my hair short</li>

            <li> Like the wide band.</li>
            <li> due to the shipping time i was to get a refund of $1.00 never saw it.</li>
            <li> I have an average size head and it took all of my might to get this thing on my head...</li>
            <li> Too tight o the head.</li>
            <li> so it is so tight it just slides off your head .</li>
            <li> if you use bobby pins to hold it in place it is so tight it cant be worn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too tight and give my daughter a head ache</li>
            <li> so tight it was making me see spots...</li>
            <li> I have a little head</li>
            <li> Although it looks like the picture it did not fit at all.</li>
            <li> Not stretchy and very tight on my head</li>
            <li> Too small for my head.  </li>
            <li> Totally uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> For a very small head. :-(</li>
            <li> Soo ugly nothing like the picture very disappointed</li>
            <li> AWFUL!  </li>

            <li> Too small for my head.  I don&#x27;t think I have a particularly giant head...</li>
            <li> Great quality super cute</li>
            <li> My sister loved it and loves wearing it just wish I didn&#x27;t get black.</li>
            <li> I really liked this headband when i first got it, but the headband isn&#x27;t stitched into place to hold shape. When I took it off, the headband untwisted and I can&#x27;t figure out how to get it exactly as it first was. Oh well. For the price, it&#x27;s okay. The extra stitching would have made it a 5-star review.</li>
            <li> To tight and did not look good on</li>
            <li> Although it looks like the picture it did not fit at all. It would probably fit a child but the description states that it is a woman&#x27;s headband.</li>
            <li> Love it came early too.</li>
            <li> For a very small head. :-(</li>
            <li> Great product even tho I lost it lol will definitely be buying again</li>
            <li> Too tight o the head. I haven&#x27;t used too many of these headbands, so I am not sure how it is supposed to fit. But because its too small, my hair rides up the back and it presses on my head to much. Totally uncomfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Great material. Keeps my ears warm. I loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice I bough it to wear to work to keep my head warm nice</li>
            <li> Bought 4 of these they fit perfect. Love the colors.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and silky, I bought this headband since I cut my hair short and I often go on motorcycle rides with my boyfriend &amp; I cannot keep a cap on. I have a little head but this should work great.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a whole package and only received 1 in the mail. And I only received one black one</li>
            <li> I really like it! Planning on purchasing all colors!</li>
            <li> I got the black and it fits ok but the fabric is pretty much spandex, not great for appearance.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to fan out the way it is in the picture so it fits much more bunched up, not what I was looking for.  Doesn&#x27;t stay put very well.  Will be used more to wash my face than going out in public.</li>
            <li> Not how it is pictured. Cheaply made as well. Save yourself the time and frustration, Go with a different brand!</li>
            <li> Not stretchy and very tight on my head</li>
            <li> Too large for my head.</li>
            <li> no elastic so it is so tight it just slides off your head . if you use bobby pins to hold it in place it is so tight it cant be worn. shipping took forever .. due to the shipping time i was to get a refund of $1.00 never saw it.</li>
            <li> Just came in the mail today. Very Nice!</li>
            <li> Soo ugly nothing like the picture very disappointed</li>
            <li> AWFUL!  These don&#x27;t work and  they&#x27;re too big for most folks!  Cheap and tacky!  Don&#x27;t bother and the wait is 4 - 6 weeks for their arrival.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too tight and give my daughter a head ache</li>
            <li> Cute, but too tight to wear comfortably, I imagine as these headbands are made in Asia, they are intended for much more petite women like Asian shoes and clothes seem to be.</li>
            <li> UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR BRAIN SQUEEZED OUT DO NOT BUY THESE. I have an average size head and it took all of my might to get this thing on my head... so tight it was making me see spots... I do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great coverage. Like the wide band.</li>
            <li> best invention for moms that have a busy life and no time. I love wearing this while I run errands..it gets the hair out of my face and its cute!</li>
