            <li>so I bought it here online, and it is exactly what I remember from over 12 years ago!!!</li>
            <li>I love this hot tools iron!!   </li>
            <li>other than that, awesome product.</li>
            <li>however, everything other than the smell is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>it was a free shipping item.</li>
            <li>It is well built, maintains heat and does a fabulous job....</li>
            <li>well worth it at that price!</li>
            <li>kind of fun but quite frizzy even with anti-frizz, got it for my three-year-old, it is cute on her, but not for an adult</li>
            <li>We have soo much fun doing our hair together!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my girlfriend because of the good reviews but when I received the package, it wasn&#x27;t the same item as pictured.</li>
            <li>I have very straight fine hair</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and polite seller.</li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The product came exactly as it was listed by the seller; brand-new condition.</li>
            <li>Worked great for what she needed even with thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have a hot tools curling iron.</li>
            <li>The tempeture stays consistent.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>i have never been able to find a triple barrel that gets hott enough to keep my hair wavy, with this one my curls stay for 2 days!</li>
            <li>Overall,  Cute look that you can wear anywhere, but be ready to spend some time.</li>
            <li>More like crimp than loose waves</li>
            <li>The waves are nice, but a little frizzy.</li>
            <li>This one heats up fast and evenly, and crimps well.</li>
            <li>I went to test it today but didn&#x27;t want to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>It gives you a really cute look, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty specific product that would only be used on special occasions.</li>
            <li>That is high praise from a thirteen year old girl.</li>
            <li>it has a very strong and weird smell when i first used it.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>I tried Relvon and it barely got hot and it didn&#x27;t gave me a deep wave.</li>
            <li>giveseasily gives you the right look, fun and with body without e&lt;br /&gt;Working so hard.  </li>
            <li>It warms up fast and it takes me only 5 minutes to do my hair (middle length).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of time consuming, especially if you have long and/or thick hair.</li>
            <li>So I tested it in  a few spots and the waves are really pretty.</li>

            <li> I have long hair so the wave wasn&#x27;t big enough for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I do my straightener - use my other hand to hold it steady and to push the clamp tightly.</li>
            <li> She says it doesn&#x27;t take too long to use and gives the similar appearance as braiding wet hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and very long&lt;</li>
            <li> She wanted a wide crimper.</li>
            <li> The one that I received was also Hot Tools, however it was a different and less expensive model.</li>
            <li> I looked into purchasing other wavers.</li>
            <li> The waver does not close all the way unless there is only a thin layer of hair.  </li>
            <li> I attempted it a few times and now, it&#x27;s just sitting in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> but she has hardly used it.</li>
            <li> Just need common sense to operate.</li>
            <li> If you have frizzy hair then it will give you somewhat of a frizz but nothing serious.</li>
            <li> i have crazy thick hair and looong   </li>
            <li> I find this tool difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> They where quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it!</li>

            <li> I like the way this makes my hair wavey but it does make it frizzy.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy that I bought this Waver! It gives you a really cute look, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday. It&#x27;s kind of time consuming, especially if you have long and/or thick hair. I recently got my hair thinned out, and that makes it a lot easier.    Overall,  Cute look that you can wear anywhere, but be ready to spend some time. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love this hot tools iron!!   its great i have crazy thick hair and looong   it works great!! and my hair looks so cute!!   fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I find this tool difficult to use.  There is no place on the end to use a second hand.  The waver does not close all the way unless there is only a thin layer of hair.  I would like to handle it like I do my straightener - use my other hand to hold it steady and to push the clamp tightly.</li>
            <li> The product came exactly as it was listed by the seller; brand-new condition. It works great and I received it in a timely manner. I would purchase something from this seller again anytime. Thank you!</li>
            <li> love the size of the waves but i wouldnt recommend this on hair with no product in it. it will totally make it frizzy. other than that, awesome product. well worth it at that price!</li>
            <li> kind of fun but quite frizzy even with anti-frizz, got it for my three-year-old, it is cute on her, but not for an adult</li>
            <li> I have very straight fine hair and this didnt do the trick. I tried it with products in and without products and saw no difference. I attempted it a few times and now, it&#x27;s just sitting in my bathroom. Not for me.</li>
            <li> I like this one, it is a good brand, it works well on my hair. The waves are nice, but a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a gift for a friend and she loved it. Worked great for what she needed even with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair so the wave wasn&#x27;t big enough for what I wanted. I ended up buying another one. With larger barrel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good. It warms up fast and it takes me only 5 minutes to do my hair (middle length). In addition, I ordered it on Friday and got it on Monday eve throug it was a free shipping item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!! We have soo much fun doing our hair together! I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it!</li>
            <li> This is a great tool...I find it is the only thing I can do to maintain any type of hairstyle in this Florida heat and humidity.  It is well built, maintains heat and does a fabulous job....</li>
            <li> I have a hot tools curling iron. I wanted a waver. Since I am happy with results of the iron; I decided to get the 3 barrel waver. It heats up quickly and gives me beautiful waves. I tried Relvon and it barely got hot and it didn&#x27;t gave me a deep wave. The tempeture stays consistent. I looked into purchasing other wavers. They where quite expensive. This rocks for the cost and effectiveness. Quick shipping and polite seller.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted. I can&#x27;t find this brand or style in a store anywhere. so I bought it here online, and it is exactly what I remember from over 12 years ago!!!</li>
            <li> She wanted a wide crimper. This one heats up fast and evenly, and crimps well. That is high praise from a thirteen year old girl.</li>
            <li> Great product! I would recommend this to anyone who like the wave look. It&#x27;s fun and very easy to use. If you have frizzy hair then it will give you somewhat of a frizz but nothing serious. Not something I would use daily but for those days you want something different I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for reviews for a waver like this and I am so glad I purchased this one. I went to test it today but didn&#x27;t want to do my whole head. So I tested it in  a few spots and the waves are really pretty. My hair is thick and very long&lt;br /&gt;(about 21 inches at the shortest point) and I stilh have no problem keeping the wave in, I didn&#x27;t even have to hold it to my hair that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome.</li>
            <li> Works great. Simple to use. And great quality. Just need common sense to operate.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because of the good reviews but when I received the package, it wasn&#x27;t the same item as pictured. The one that I received was also Hot Tools, however it was a different and less expensive model. Very disappointing.</li>
