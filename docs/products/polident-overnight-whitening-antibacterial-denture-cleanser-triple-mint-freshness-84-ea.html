            <li>Great job!</li>
            <li>This is the best cleaner I have found since wearing dentures for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned over the years that the best ways to alleviate the night-guard from cracking and staining was to soak it every DAY in Polident.</li>
            <li>The Polident Overnight is the best at removing coffee stains.  </li>
            <li>Happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff works as it should will buy again</li>
            <li>L love these tablets for cleaning my dentures over night, they are the best cleanser I have used for my dentures</li>
            <li>I have always used this product and the results are consistently good.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Now I just drop a tablet into a container of warm water with the night-guard every morning and close the lid.</li>
            <li>What I can say at this point is that my dentures come out looking very clean and bright.  </li>
            <li>great fresh smell even after washing thoroughly</li>
            <li>There is not much to say except that Ithink this is the best denture cleaner on the market, and I was happy to see it was available on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I drink lots of coffee, so that&#x27;s very important.  </li>
            <li>In this way I get the most of the cleanser and prevent the risk of allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I like these much more than what I was using before</li>
            <li>What more can be said.</li>
            <li>Polident denture cleaner is much better</li>
            <li>Use this for my husband&#x27;s removable denture.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from any whitening, I use this for some degree of sanitizing &amp; freshening.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a lot more bubbles than another well-known brand that I tried.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands and varieties of denture cleansers.  </li>
            <li>it is easy and gets it very clean.</li>
            <li>After a good 5-6 hour soak, my appliance gets much cleaner than it does when I use the non-overnight cleaners.</li>
            <li>Cleans dentures well and leaves them nice and fresh in the morning</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my mouth guard and love it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if they really clean any better</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, convenient and easy to store.  </li>
            <li>If you have dentures, you need to keep them clean.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my mouthguard.</li>
            <li>but they seem to have more action when dropping them into the wall.</li>
            <li>At night, I simply rinse it out with warm water so that it&#x27;s pliable for insertion.</li>
            <li>Polident makes that process so much easier than fumbling with the nigh-guard as I attempt to brush it clean.</li>
            <li>Funny to rate denture cleaner as 5 star.</li>
            <li>The flexible dentures remain very clean, so I brush it only from time to time, thus reducing wear.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It seems to work very well</li>
            <li>I bought them to clean my upper denture and bottom partial and they do that just fine.</li>
            <li>For those of you who have dentures spend a few pennies more and get this.</li>
            <li>He has tried many others, and this is the only one that cleans as expected.</li>
            <li>Hard really to rate this since I cannot smell how well the minty flavor works on my own breath, but the tables are easily removed from their pouch and dissolve instantly in the water I put in the denture bath, a seafoam green one I had bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My partial comes out fresh and ready to go, no other brushing required.</li>
            <li>I left myself two days short of tablets which is easily avoidable by placing an order when I start the last sheet.</li>
            <li>I really hope it will indeed whiten them, as I&#x27;m concerned that they do look yellow.  </li>

            <li> There is not much to say except that Ithink this is the best denture cleaner on the market, and I was happy to see it was available on Amazon.com.  I couldn&#x27;t get out of the house, and it was delivered in two days, so it worked out well.  It&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> If you have dentures, you need to keep them clean. I&#x27;m lazy. Just put the dentures in their little \\&quot;box,\\&quot; and let them soak overnight. Great job!</li>
            <li> The flexible dentures remain very clean, so I brush it only from time to time, thus reducing wear. After all night in it, I do always use a bit of soap with the rinsing water to avoid the eventual effect of chemical components, as I read reports of allergic reactions in some people. In this way I get the most of the cleanser and prevent the risk of allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I use this for my retainer, which I wear at night (not that it matters, I know). After a good 5-6 hour soak, my appliance gets much cleaner than it does when I use the non-overnight cleaners. Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my mouth guard and love it. it is easy and gets it very clean. Been using for years.</li>
            <li> I like these much more than what I was using before don&#x27;t know if they really clean any better but they seem to have more action when dropping them into the wall.</li>
            <li> Funny to rate denture cleaner as 5 star. I use it to clean my mouthguard. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually cleaner, but it &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; a lot cleaner when I use Polident than with other brands. If I ever do have dentures, Polident will be my choice.</li>
            <li> This continues to be a reliable product for my husbands dentures. He has tried many others, and this is the only one that cleans as expected.</li>
            <li> Works well. What more can be said. Cleans dentures well and leaves them nice and fresh in the morning</li>
            <li> I have always used this product and the results are consistently good. I wished the price was a bit cheaper. This is why I did not give it five stars.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleaner I have found since wearing dentures for over 15 years. Don&#x27;t use anything else. They even have this for smokers which I used to be.</li>
            <li> Wearing a night-guard, to prevent me from grinding my teeth every night, also means maintaining the custom-made, expensive night-guard. I&#x27;ve learned over the years that the best ways to alleviate the night-guard from cracking and staining was to soak it every DAY in Polident. Not only does it need to be kept moist so it won&#x27;t crack and break apart, it needs to be cleaned on a regular basis. Polident makes that process so much easier than fumbling with the nigh-guard as I attempt to brush it clean. Now I just drop a tablet into a container of warm water with the night-guard every morning and close the lid. At night, I simply rinse it out with warm water so that it&#x27;s pliable for insertion. I&#x27;ve extended the life of my night-guard by a minimum of 6 months using this simple process.</li>
            <li> Polident denture cleaner is much better that another named brand that I used before.  I shall never go back.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received and started using this nightly, but it does seem to be working.  What I can say at this point is that my dentures come out looking very clean and bright.  I really hope it will indeed whiten them, as I&#x27;m concerned that they do look yellow.  So we&#x27;ll see.  It seems to work very well and I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> I have used the option of Polident for years now, but never in a 84 count!  The largest multiple I ever found was thirty-six!</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for almost a year.  It is easy to use, convenient and easy to store.  The price is lower than our local grocer&#x27;s.  We continue to reorder from Amazon.  A seller you can trust and it has never been out of stock.</li>
            <li> Use this for my husband&#x27;s removable denture.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from any whitening, I use this for some degree of sanitizing &amp; freshening.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a lot more bubbles than another well-known brand that I tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands and varieties of denture cleansers.  The Polident Overnight is the best at removing coffee stains.  I drink lots of coffee, so that&#x27;s very important.  My partial comes out fresh and ready to go, no other brushing required.</li>
            <li> great fresh smell even after washing thoroughly</li>
            <li> Hard really to rate this since I cannot smell how well the minty flavor works on my own breath, but the tables are easily removed from their pouch and dissolve instantly in the water I put in the denture bath, a seafoam green one I had bought from Amazon. I take my teeth out at night, put them in the bath with water, then drop in a tablet. Next morning I take them out and put them in. I have not been using them long enough to judge them for their whiteness but that is not why I bought them. I bought them to clean my upper denture and bottom partial and they do that just fine. I will not be ordering anything else though I will reorder sooner than I did this time so I have an overlap. I left myself two days short of tablets which is easily avoidable by placing an order when I start the last sheet. 84 tablets are a big number but I wish Polident would put 90 in for closer to a 3-month supply than 84 is.</li>
