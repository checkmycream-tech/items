            <li>Glad to see it online!!</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Costco carried the Protective Moisturizer which had a good SPF sun-block.</li>
            <li>Excellent service; I had not been able to find the Kirkland Revitalizing Face Serum on the shelves at Costco any more, so was delighted to be able to buy it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>This amazing serum just soaks into your skin...</li>

            <li>This is great item which I want everybody give a try to see my word are true.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>

            <li>my daughter now comes to my cosmetic area and uses this looks like I will order one for her also. :-)))</li>
            <li>Please send some more.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I wear this in the morning and also at night, :)</li>
            <li>I love the product, but it is too pricey for the amount of serum in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Hope it is still available when I need more.</li>
            <li>I opened it up and there is about 1 teaspoon serum, if that much,in the huge container.</li>
            <li>It goes on well, not greasy and feels light on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs easily and is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent for aging, drying skin; and the price is much lower than similar products sold by high end cosmetic companies.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you notice is how smoothly the product applies.</li>
            <li>I am new to this brand of face serum and am extremely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I used to use Olay&#x27;s Facial lotion - which I always assumed with great, but even as a 25yo male - my skin was still breaking out.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth andakes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen nothing positive.</li>
            <li>Not to mention - this is super cheap, considering that it&#x27;s (partially) Boughese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>thanks Emily</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>Very smoothing textire</li>
            <li>This is a very deceptive packaging, so beware.</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s all fragrance-free -- the Night Cream (not this product in particular) does smell a bit like gasoline.</li>
            <li>It is an integral part of my daily routine for smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who cares about their skin care.</li>
            <li>My skin just loves this serum - it soaks it up immediately and makes my skin so soft without a trace of an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and use Kirkland&#x27;s Revitalizing Face Serum after cleansing and before moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and still love it after trying several other brands.</li>
            <li>It has been very soothing during the winter weather when the skin tends to dry out.</li>
            <li>The old container actually had the 1.7 fl oz in it.</li>
            <li>It is also so much &#x27;lighter&#x27; than some other products that advertise moisture help.</li>
            <li>I had a facial recently and the operator couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin was.</li>

            <li> I used to buy this at our Costco until they stopped selling it! It is so smooth andakes your skin feel so soft. I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> love this  product costco sold then stopped ??? my daughter now comes to my cosmetic area and uses this looks like I will order one for her also. :-)))</li>

            <li> really nice this product</li>
            <li> Awesome need more!! Please send some more. Im almost out already....let me know how much...charge it to pay pal..thanks Emily</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t find it any longer.</li>
            <li> The best product ever. It really works.  Why was it  and other Borghese products discontinued  at Costco?  Please bring them back.</li>
            <li> I always purchased this in my local Costco store, until it was unavailable. Glad to see it online!! Hope it is still available when I need more.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this to try based on (1) Borghese&#x27;s name (2) It was on sale. I&#x27;ve finished using the bottle and I&#x27;ve seen nothing positive. It has no fragrance so it smells like gasoline when you put it on. The bottle is poorly designed as I&#x27;m sure there is still at least half of the serum still left but I can&#x27;t get it out. I am switching back to Olay Regenerist, which actually make my skin look luminous and shrink my pores.</li>
            <li> My mom actually introduced this brand-merged product line to me four months ago. I used to use Olay&#x27;s Facial lotion - which I always assumed with great, but even as a 25yo male - my skin was still breaking out. I&#x27;ve changed diet, stress, exercise, etc --- but still had mediocre skin. However, I then switched to this Boughese Kirkland product line (using Revitalizing Face Serum, Eye Serum, Day lotion, and Night cream) and immediately stopped breaking out. My skin&#x27;s the best it&#x27;s ever been and I highly recommend this product. Not to mention - this is super cheap, considering that it&#x27;s (partially) Boughese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note, though it&#x27;s all fragrance-free -- the Night Cream (not this product in particular) does smell a bit like gasoline. However, I&#x27;m happy with my skin and don&#x27;t mind putting up with the Night Cream&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for a great price ..Loved it. Have to use it for couple of weeks to see.</li>
            <li> This amazing serum just soaks into your skin... I have been using this product for several years and still love it after trying several other brands. I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> This is great item which I want everybody give a try to see my word are true. I will recommend this item to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice is how smoothly the product applies. It is also so much &#x27;lighter&#x27; than some other products that advertise moisture help. It has been very soothing during the winter weather when the skin tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> Very smoothing textire</li>
            <li> I was sorry to see Costco stop carrying this product as I find it works quite well.  I would continue to purchase it.  It goes on well, not greasy and feels light on the skin.  I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for aging, drying skin; and the price is much lower than similar products sold by high end cosmetic companies.  I used to get it at Costco, but they no longer sell it.</li>
            <li> Careful. This is not the same product that I bought for years from Costco for about $20. Costco carried the Protective Moisturizer which had a good SPF sun-block. This Face Serum is not this product and does not have a sun-block, which I consider essential for a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and use Kirkland&#x27;s Revitalizing Face Serum after cleansing and before moisturizing. It is an integral part of my daily routine for smooth, soft skin. I highly recommend this product to anyone who cares about their skin care.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!! Like silk on your face......A must product for any woman!!!!!!! I wear this in the morning and also at night, :)</li>
            <li> I am new to this brand of face serum and am extremely satisfied with it. I have noticed improvement in my skin after just a few weeks of using it. It is light and absorbs easily and is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product  since they started  carrying this line. The packaging has changed and there is not the actual 1.7 fl oz in this bottle that they claim. The actual bottle weight may be 1.7 oz. I opened it up and there is about 1 teaspoon serum, if that much,in the huge container. I am very disappointed in that it only last maybe 1 month if you use it as recommended. The old container actually had the 1.7 fl oz in it. It probably lasted 6 months. This is a very deceptive packaging, so beware. I love the product, but it is too pricey for the amount of serum in the bottle.</li>
