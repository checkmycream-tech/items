            <li>I would strongly recommend this product to anyone that love their gray hair and want to show it off in grand style!  </li>
            <li>It is more like a clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Will try to find out if safe to use without staining anything.</li>
            <li>So glad to find this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this combination.  </li>
            <li>It brings great shine to salt and pepper hair and makes the gray appear very silvery.</li>
            <li>Was so glad to see that Psntene had a product for gray hair as I&#x27;d never seen one in the stores.</li>

            <li>GOOD SHAMPOO - COLORING MAKES MY GREY HAIR LOOK GOOD.  </li>
            <li>Husband liked this very much.</li>
            <li>My hair is frizzy and fine and dries easily.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t think I used alot of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The conditioner works great with that grey hair that has a mind of its own, the shampoo is good but just doesn&#x27;t get all the brassisness out , does pretty good but found the Crew Classic Grey does a better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner go hand in hand to get the true effect you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li>Glad I can still get this somewhere - my mom really likes this.</li>
            <li>Prior to the use of this shampoo my hair was in good condition.  </li>
            <li>This one is better than most, especially since my hair has no &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; tinge after once weekly use.</li>
            <li>I love how it keeps my hair soft and keeps the silver color true.  </li>
            <li>Yet... It is kind of purple and wonder if it will stain my white spoteless shower.</li>
            <li>I have grey hair and it often needs a bit of a boost to make sure the grey is bright and not yellowing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and easy to style.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine pewter and soft.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find these products in local stores....</li>
            <li>I think this will help prevent any yellowish buildup over time, but it is not something safe for me to use daily.</li>
            <li>Now only if it moisturized more.</li>
            <li>After two days of use I could tell that it effectively cleaned other products from my hair, however, in the end</li>
            <li>My hair feels so clean and soft, but the curls did not come out.  </li>
            <li>I love panteen silver but not when the bottle was open on the plastic and almost 1/2 was spilled , the inside of the plastic they were in was purple and very slimy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, so I&#x27;m happy I can buy it on Amazon, even though the price is way too high.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for some time I really like it</li>
            <li>It really makes no difference whether it&#x27;s for gray or not.</li>
            <li>Really like this combo.</li>
            <li>maybe I used too much?  </li>
            <li>Keeps my salt and pepper hair soft, shiny, and yellow free.</li>
            <li>It also leaves hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I resorted to only using the shampoo once a week and using my other more moisturizing products the rest of the time.  </li>
            <li>When I had silver/white hair it kept my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Not sold in any stores near me</li>
            <li>Brightens silver, white or gray hair, leaves hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li>Using it now to help fade the hair dye back to my natural white.</li>

            <li> Love these products!!  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Brightens silver, white or gray hair, leaves hair soft and manageable.  I have not been able to find these products in local stores....hope it is not discontinued....</li>
            <li> My hair dresser suggested I use a shampoo for my graying hair.  I was so glad that I found Pantene Silver Expressions!  It is expensive but worth every penny.  The shampoo and conditioner go hand in hand to get the true effect you&#x27;re looking for.  I would strongly recommend this product to anyone that love their gray hair and want to show it off in grand style!  I surely do!</li>

            <li> GOOD SHAMPOO - COLORING MAKES MY GREY HAIR LOOK GOOD.  ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products over the years. This one is better than most, especially since my hair has no &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; tinge after once weekly use.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair and it often needs a bit of a boost to make sure the grey is bright and not yellowing.  This is a good shampoo and brand for that.</li>
            <li> I love panteen silver but not when the bottle was open on the plastic and almost 1/2 was spilled , the inside of the plastic they were in was purple and very slimy. Not a happy person right now,</li>
            <li> I did not try it ... Yet... It is kind of purple and wonder if it will stain my white spoteless shower. Will try to find out if safe to use without staining anything.</li>
            <li> Always used this product  but could not find it anywhere.Thought I would try to find it  on-line.I was really happy to see that it,it was still&lt;br /&gt;being  made.I have silver hair and it is hard to find a product that really helps.I have used this product for a lot of years.</li>
            <li> product as described, works well</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time I really like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with it.  It really makes no difference whether it&#x27;s for gray or not.</li>
            <li> very good product, I will re-order.</li>
            <li> Makes gray hair sparkle and look silver. A very good product.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this shampoo. Just can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore. When I had silver/white hair it kept my hair soft and shiny. Using it now to help fade the hair dye back to my natural white. I highly recommend to anyone who has dull gray or yellowed white hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for Pantene silver expressions for a long time.  Not sold in any stores near me so I was very happy to find it online.  I love how it keeps my hair soft and keeps the silver color true.  Other shampoos dull the gray/silver color and make it all washed out.</li>

            <li> I love this combination.  They discontinued the silver expressions line a year or so ago, and I am so happy that they are making it again.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, so I&#x27;m happy I can buy it on Amazon, even though the price is way too high.  I wish the price would come down, but I want to encourage the Pantene company to please keep making this.  It&#x27;s the best silver shampoo I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and easy to style.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! It brings great shine to salt and pepper hair and makes the gray appear very silvery. It also leaves hair feeling very soft.</li>

            <li> Glad I can still get this somewhere - my mom really likes this. Bummer that its so much more expensive than regular pantene flavors though.</li>
            <li> Really like this combo. Was so glad to see that Psntene had a product for gray hair as I&#x27;d never seen one in the stores. So I&#x27;ll be buying these from Amazon in the future!</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair very dry and brittle.  My hair is normal to dry.  Prior to the use of this shampoo my hair was in good condition.  I would not purchase this product again.  I am not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Wonderfull i love this model</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair dryer than regular shampoos and conditioners, but it does brighten the gray. That part is nice, because some of these products turn the gray sort of steel colored. This is more silver. Now only if it moisturized more. Sigh.... maybe I&#x27;ll mix Fekai Glossing conditioner together with this.</li>
            <li> I used this the day after I got it.  My hair feels so clean and soft, but the curls did not come out.  (I have a perm.)  My hair is white.  This product will keep it white and from turning that yellow tone that some of us get as we age.  I am so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
            <li> conditioner seemed to leave my hair kinda stiff.  maybe I used too much?  I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t think I used alot of the conditioner. noticed the conditioner had a thick-type substance when poured from the bottle.  maybe I should shake it more before use.  don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shampoo seems nice.</li>
            <li> Keeps my salt and pepper hair soft, shiny, and yellow free.</li>
