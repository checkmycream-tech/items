            <li>It looks good on my daughter.</li>
            <li>I like them a lot they make yours gorgeous</li>
            <li>This stuff works just a good as the 30$ stuff dose</li>
            <li>All in all good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried younique and LOVED it, but $30 for mascara is nuts.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>For the most part this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great price :)</li>
            <li>However, just like everyone else has stated, the tubes with the fiber lashes did not have very many lashes in them.</li>
            <li>im in love with this!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Angel mask mascara is better!</li>
            <li>Have had this product before love it!  </li>
            <li>But better!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I just applied it today for the first time and have already RE-ORDERED 2 more sets !!!!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>and I am absolutely in love!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This works pretty good but not as good as I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li>We both agree that they are amazing.</li>
            <li>I lmao</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what I did before these.</li>
            <li>Did my own before and after pictures, too.  </li>
            <li>this is how you keep the fibers out of your eyes and it still is effective.  </li>
            <li>Over if you play around with it and get familiar with the product it seems to work great</li>
            <li>Great alternative to unique 3D fiber lash mascara</li>
            <li>I loved reading the reviews, they sounded almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Awesome for every day but not as full as eye lash extension for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>quick ship great product</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look great but dries out quickly...</li>
            <li>very easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The company also resolved an issue quickly and very courteously.  </li>
            <li>Love it,it&#x27;s amazing...</li>
            <li>the leopard print tube is fantastic the purple tube is good too</li>
            <li>Just as good as any of the leading competitors for so much cheaper!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t grow lashes easily, so it works for me when I don&#x27;t want to put glue all over the place with the  falsies-lol!</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful, however the fibers don&#x27;t come out on the bristles very often</li>
            <li>Removes easily with warm water and soap.</li>
            <li>Love it 💛  </li>
            <li>I  absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>love this even came in too cute cases to carry awsome price</li>
            <li>i love this mascara</li>
            <li>it is my all time favorite</li>
            <li>If you wear contacts I don&#x27;t believe you will be able to wear these.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the look of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I love these mascaras.</li>
            <li>I most definetly will not be using anything else.</li>
            <li>i love this product and the price is even better</li>
            <li>love this fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>So exiting to be trying this!! :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it .</li>
            <li>I do love this.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I&#x27;d have given it more stars.</li>
            <li>Love the product, price, prime and love that you get two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t wanna spend any money water works:)</li>
            <li>I am glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok if you can deal with that</li>
            <li>Ok, ladies, stop looking elsewhere and don&#x27;t you dare spend $30+ on 3d mascara, you know the one I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li>Think of it as photoshop for your eyes! :-)</li>
            <li>Omg I absolutely love this fiber mascara</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this mascara..  </li>
            <li>i really love it.</li>
            <li>I suggested to use her favorite mascara with this so it doesn&#x27;t look so flaky and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this...</li>
            <li>The purple one works better has more fibers .</li>
            <li>Enjoying trying to feel it out</li>
            <li>LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you do the gel, then the fibers, then the gel again.</li>
            <li>Really glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li>I apply it twice to each lash and it lasts well all day :)</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t get this again though because i found benefits roller mascara works better than both of these.</li>
            <li>:) I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to work this</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I truly love this easy to apply and remove product.</li>
            <li>Now I have large gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li>and it washes right off when you&#x27;re done for the day!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more but VERY worth it.</li>
            <li>They are easy to remove just wiped off with make up wipes.</li>
            <li>You can easily brush away any remnants that fall, even throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and to remove</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan, it falls off easily and it gets in my eyes, I end up looking like my eyelashes are shedding</li>
            <li>EASY to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>they say it does and the fiber lashes are like fine pieces of fur they just fall all day</li>
            <li>and she seemed to light it.</li>
            <li>Great product, just need instructions in English.....</li>
            <li>The packaging is cheap and this is not a 3D set at all.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, and now I am going to order extras.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do!!</li>
            <li>It is super easy to apply and it comes with instructions with how to apply as well.</li>
            <li>I was originally excited about this product couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>when I seen that, that alone is well worth 4 stars!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this</li>
            <li>There is a small learning curve but after that, wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>Looks great on and makes her eye lashes long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but I would still rather put on the falsies for special occasions.</li>
            <li>This product works great, don&#x27;t be discouraged if you don&#x27;t like the application at first, once you learn how to properly apply you achieve gray results and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is true there are fibers that flake off, and during application you may get a fiber in your eye here and there.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use your own mascara as first and last coat to prevent any flaking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also super OCD and can&#x27;t stand clumps so</li>
            <li>WOW, I was pleasantly surprised how great this product is.  </li>
            <li>It does lengthen quickly and makes them fuller, but somewhat clumpy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way easy to just get a lot in your eyes super fast.</li>
            <li>This mascara gives you gorgeous and long eyelashes effortlessly!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says!  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be a buying more!</li>
            <li>Since the fibers are so fine and tiny and there&#x27;s so many of them</li>
            <li>do you ladies think it&#x27;s worth the money?</li>
            <li>but I was already pleased with my natural length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about spider eye effect.</li>
            <li>They are ok, but I&#x27;ve used other ones that work much better.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the products were good.</li>
            <li>But right on the brush part of my mascara, dip, apply.</li>
            <li>Nothing got in my eyes, This product absolutely positively rocks!</li>
            <li>I am sure most have heard of &amp;#34;Younique,&amp;#34; but this brand has been compared to its product - and noticing that Younique is about $40 for one set, and this is half the price for two</li>
            <li>I always had super short eyelashes and most mascaras</li>
            <li>: For better results I still apply 1 coat of my regular mascara very first.</li>
            <li>i feel like the mascara part could be a little better, but i LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Now I just keep my eyes super squinted the whole time applying which I feel is also beneficial to the fact I&#x27;m not raising my eyebrows and applying which pulls the skin causing wrinkles sooner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I havent been able to wear make up in a whole week so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural looking and easy to take off.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good, only used once so far</li>
            <li>It really extends my lashes!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the blue &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; set.</li>
            <li>but my regular mascara works better.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know what goes on first??</li>
            <li>every time I use my regular mascara I have to put just a drop of any contact solution or 👉eye drops👈 since they are more travel size.</li>
            <li>I used to just use water for actually a couple years till I discovered the drops instead which works better</li>
            <li>This mascara really works wonders!</li>
            <li>But no, these lashes are not fake, they&#x27;re all mine, just... enhanced.</li>
            <li>As a make up artist and esthetician, I am always looking for something that not only I love, but can share with clients.  </li>
            <li>This is good for everyday use</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t wear it regularly, but maybe if it&#x27;s not a hot day, I&#x27;ll wear it for a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;The most durable and easy to remove is still Lash Injection.</li>
            <li>Add as many coats as you want until they&#x27;re unbelievably long.</li>
            <li>This is my new mascara!!</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Can get clumpy if you put too much fibers.</li>
            <li>They really make your eyes POP.</li>
            <li>Works very well for the price I&#x27;ve paid</li>
            <li>and I had irritation the whole time I wore it.</li>
            <li>The picture where you see my whole nose</li>
            <li>I guess $8 isn&#x27;t much to lose.</li>
            <li>It was very feathery</li>
            <li>Fast delivery...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>my eyelashes are so much longer.  </li>
            <li>Great product but poor customer service</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like the mascara really did anything for my lashes.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast..</li>
            <li>They seemed to run out fast.</li>
            <li>Really make your eyelashes look long and full!</li>
            <li>I was going to get a different brand that was quite a bit more, but I wanted to try something similar first.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to apply, just need to be careful and patient, all of about 2 minutes start to finish.  </li>
            <li>but until this came in and i have found this to be much better then the more expensive one.</li>
            <li>Product was decent.</li>
            <li>This stuff is actually better than the more expensive brand being advertised on Facebook.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I experienced out of this world amaaaaazingly long lashes, but they dis give me some length and lots of fullness/volume.</li>
            <li>The purple tube was nice though, my eyelashes looked long and natural, but it&#x27;s weird because I read the opposite, most people seemed to like the leopard one better.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is a small price to pay for lashes that certainly look fuller and more defined.</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical about the product at first after I tried it the first time</li>
            <li>For all of the complaints:If anyone isn&#x27;t getting length then apply a coat as you normally do,then squint and apply a coat on just the tips.</li>
            <li>Excelent product, my lashes look super long.  </li>
            <li>but the are really cheap and works just like the more expensive stuff</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve only used the LA306 so far, but i think this pack is totally worth buying</li>
            <li>I was only able to use it one time and then it was empty?</li>
            <li>Too long ship time but worth the wait</li>
            <li>I did that my first two times on the same eye.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this mascara to anyone that wants their eyes to pop!</li>
            <li>Yes, my eyelashes are long but it just isn&#x27;t worth the irritation it causes.</li>
            <li>One of the clear containers of mascara didn&#x27;t have anything in it.</li>
            <li>After a bit of practice and SEVERAL you tube videos I got the whole &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>Takes some getting use to as far as putting it on your lashes.</li>
            <li>It was late and the product was ok will not record again</li>
            <li>I also wear cat-eye/winged eyeliner, and the boldness of the liner can outshine my natural lashes.</li>
            <li>My 70-yr old eyelashes need a lot of help, and this does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Both work about the same if you already have eye lashes, they really enhance them.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my 16 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>well so i am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I already have fairly long eyelashes, but they never look full enough for me.</li>
            <li>fake extension mascara to look good.</li>
            <li>other than it doesnt make your eye lashes as thick its good</li>
            <li>I say causes irritation due to the fibers not for any other reason I love these mascaras</li>
            <li>The formulas are pretty much the same, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try something less pricey.</li>
            <li>Bought Alpha because I didn&#x27;t wanna spend 30+ on another brand, tried it out for the first time the other day</li>
            <li>I also use my standard mascara after words to kind of break my eyelashes up a little because they can slightly clump together.</li>
            <li>Buy a name brand product from a local store instead so you can easily return it for a refund if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li>it comes with two sets however the leopard print fiber mascara had barely any fibers in it  </li>
            <li>They get all over your face, and more irritating is in your eyes.</li>
            <li>Love it if you can not deal with false or indivual lashes</li>
            <li>Definitely not an item you can keep just for special occasions as it will probably be dried up by the time you wanna use it a third or 4th time.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, arrived exactly as expected!!!</li>
            <li>not long</li>
            <li>My lashes look so long &amp; natural</li>
            <li>False eyelashes are just more clean and dramatic at the same time.</li>
            <li>the natural fiber tubes when you apply them, fall all over your face and into your eyes and quite honestly do not make my eyelashes look much longer at all.</li>

            <li> I love this, it works and it is the best fiber mascara I have purchased!</li>
            <li> oh my god i&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> It looks good on my daughter.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot they make yours gorgeous</li>
            <li> This stuff works just a good as the 30$ stuff dose</li>
            <li> All in all good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried younique and LOVED it, but $30 for mascara is nuts.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> For the most part this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great price :)</li>
            <li> However, just like everyone else has stated, the tubes with the fiber lashes did not have very many lashes in them.</li>
            <li> im in love with this!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Angel mask mascara is better!</li>
            <li> Have had this product before love it!  </li>
            <li> But better!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I just applied it today for the first time and have already RE-ORDERED 2 more sets !!!!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> and I am absolutely in love!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This works pretty good but not as good as I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li> We both agree that they are amazing.</li>
            <li> I lmao</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what I did before these.</li>
            <li> Did my own before and after pictures, too.  </li>
            <li> this is how you keep the fibers out of your eyes and it still is effective.  </li>
            <li> Over if you play around with it and get familiar with the product it seems to work great</li>
            <li> Great alternative to unique 3D fiber lash mascara</li>
            <li> I loved reading the reviews, they sounded almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Awesome for every day but not as full as eye lash extension for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> quick ship great product</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look great but dries out quickly...</li>
            <li> very easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The company also resolved an issue quickly and very courteously.  </li>
            <li> Love it,it&#x27;s amazing...</li>
            <li> the leopard print tube is fantastic the purple tube is good too</li>
            <li> Just as good as any of the leading competitors for so much cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grow lashes easily, so it works for me when I don&#x27;t want to put glue all over the place with the  falsies-lol!</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful, however the fibers don&#x27;t come out on the bristles very often</li>
            <li> Removes easily with warm water and soap.</li>
            <li> Love it 💛  </li>
            <li> I  absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> love this even came in too cute cases to carry awsome price</li>
            <li> i love this mascara</li>
            <li> it is my all time favorite</li>
            <li> If you wear contacts I don&#x27;t believe you will be able to wear these.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the look of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love these mascaras.</li>
            <li> I most definetly will not be using anything else.</li>
            <li> i love this product and the price is even better</li>
            <li> love this fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> So exiting to be trying this!! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it .</li>
            <li> I do love this.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise I&#x27;d have given it more stars.</li>
            <li> Love the product, price, prime and love that you get two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t wanna spend any money water works:)</li>
            <li> I am glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok if you can deal with that</li>
            <li> Ok, ladies, stop looking elsewhere and don&#x27;t you dare spend $30+ on 3d mascara, you know the one I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> Think of it as photoshop for your eyes! :-)</li>
            <li> Omg I absolutely love this fiber mascara</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara..  </li>
            <li> i really love it.</li>
            <li> I suggested to use her favorite mascara with this so it doesn&#x27;t look so flaky and clumpy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this...</li>
            <li> The purple one works better has more fibers .</li>
            <li> Enjoying trying to feel it out</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> Just be sure you do the gel, then the fibers, then the gel again.</li>
            <li> Really glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I apply it twice to each lash and it lasts well all day :)</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t get this again though because i found benefits roller mascara works better than both of these.</li>
            <li> :) I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to work this</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I truly love this easy to apply and remove product.</li>
            <li> Now I have large gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li> and it washes right off when you&#x27;re done for the day!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more but VERY worth it.</li>
            <li> They are easy to remove just wiped off with make up wipes.</li>
            <li> You can easily brush away any remnants that fall, even throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and to remove</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan, it falls off easily and it gets in my eyes, I end up looking like my eyelashes are shedding</li>
            <li> EASY to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> they say it does and the fiber lashes are like fine pieces of fur they just fall all day</li>
            <li> and she seemed to light it.</li>
            <li> Great product, just need instructions in English.....</li>
            <li> The packaging is cheap and this is not a 3D set at all.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, and now I am going to order extras.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do!!</li>
            <li> It is super easy to apply and it comes with instructions with how to apply as well.</li>
            <li> I was originally excited about this product couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> when I seen that, that alone is well worth 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this</li>
            <li> There is a small learning curve but after that, wonderful results.  </li>
            <li> Looks great on and makes her eye lashes long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but I would still rather put on the falsies for special occasions.</li>
            <li> This product works great, don&#x27;t be discouraged if you don&#x27;t like the application at first, once you learn how to properly apply you achieve gray results and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is true there are fibers that flake off, and during application you may get a fiber in your eye here and there.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use your own mascara as first and last coat to prevent any flaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also super OCD and can&#x27;t stand clumps so</li>
            <li> WOW, I was pleasantly surprised how great this product is.  </li>
            <li> It does lengthen quickly and makes them fuller, but somewhat clumpy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way easy to just get a lot in your eyes super fast.</li>
            <li> This mascara gives you gorgeous and long eyelashes effortlessly!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says!  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be a buying more!</li>
            <li> Since the fibers are so fine and tiny and there&#x27;s so many of them</li>
            <li> do you ladies think it&#x27;s worth the money?</li>
            <li> but I was already pleased with my natural length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about spider eye effect.</li>
            <li> They are ok, but I&#x27;ve used other ones that work much better.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the products were good.</li>
            <li> But right on the brush part of my mascara, dip, apply.</li>
            <li> Nothing got in my eyes, This product absolutely positively rocks!</li>
            <li> I am sure most have heard of &amp;#34;Younique,&amp;#34; but this brand has been compared to its product - and noticing that Younique is about $40 for one set, and this is half the price for two</li>
            <li> I always had super short eyelashes and most mascaras</li>
            <li> : For better results I still apply 1 coat of my regular mascara very first.</li>
            <li> i feel like the mascara part could be a little better, but i LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Now I just keep my eyes super squinted the whole time applying which I feel is also beneficial to the fact I&#x27;m not raising my eyebrows and applying which pulls the skin causing wrinkles sooner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I havent been able to wear make up in a whole week so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so natural looking and easy to take off.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good, only used once so far</li>
            <li> It really extends my lashes!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the blue &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; set.</li>
            <li> but my regular mascara works better.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know what goes on first??</li>
            <li> every time I use my regular mascara I have to put just a drop of any contact solution or 👉eye drops👈 since they are more travel size.</li>
            <li> I used to just use water for actually a couple years till I discovered the drops instead which works better</li>
            <li> This mascara really works wonders!</li>
            <li> But no, these lashes are not fake, they&#x27;re all mine, just... enhanced.</li>
            <li> As a make up artist and esthetician, I am always looking for something that not only I love, but can share with clients.  </li>
            <li> This is good for everyday use</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wear it regularly, but maybe if it&#x27;s not a hot day, I&#x27;ll wear it for a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;The most durable and easy to remove is still Lash Injection.</li>
            <li> Add as many coats as you want until they&#x27;re unbelievably long.</li>
            <li> This is my new mascara!!</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Can get clumpy if you put too much fibers.</li>
            <li> They really make your eyes POP.</li>
            <li> Works very well for the price I&#x27;ve paid</li>
            <li> and I had irritation the whole time I wore it.</li>
            <li> The picture where you see my whole nose</li>
            <li> I guess $8 isn&#x27;t much to lose.</li>
            <li> It was very feathery</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are so much longer.  </li>
            <li> Great product but poor customer service</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like the mascara really did anything for my lashes.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast..</li>
            <li> They seemed to run out fast.</li>
            <li> Really make your eyelashes look long and full!</li>
            <li> I was going to get a different brand that was quite a bit more, but I wanted to try something similar first.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to apply, just need to be careful and patient, all of about 2 minutes start to finish.  </li>
            <li> but until this came in and i have found this to be much better then the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Product was decent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is actually better than the more expensive brand being advertised on Facebook.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I experienced out of this world amaaaaazingly long lashes, but they dis give me some length and lots of fullness/volume.</li>
            <li> The purple tube was nice though, my eyelashes looked long and natural, but it&#x27;s weird because I read the opposite, most people seemed to like the leopard one better.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a small price to pay for lashes that certainly look fuller and more defined.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about the product at first after I tried it the first time</li>
            <li> For all of the complaints:If anyone isn&#x27;t getting length then apply a coat as you normally do,then squint and apply a coat on just the tips.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, my lashes look super long.  </li>
            <li> but the are really cheap and works just like the more expensive stuff</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve only used the LA306 so far, but i think this pack is totally worth buying</li>
            <li> I was only able to use it one time and then it was empty?</li>
            <li> Too long ship time but worth the wait</li>
            <li> I did that my first two times on the same eye.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this mascara to anyone that wants their eyes to pop!</li>
            <li> Yes, my eyelashes are long but it just isn&#x27;t worth the irritation it causes.</li>
            <li> One of the clear containers of mascara didn&#x27;t have anything in it.</li>
            <li> After a bit of practice and SEVERAL you tube videos I got the whole &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> Takes some getting use to as far as putting it on your lashes.</li>
            <li> It was late and the product was ok will not record again</li>
            <li> I also wear cat-eye/winged eyeliner, and the boldness of the liner can outshine my natural lashes.</li>
            <li> My 70-yr old eyelashes need a lot of help, and this does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Both work about the same if you already have eye lashes, they really enhance them.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 16 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> well so i am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I already have fairly long eyelashes, but they never look full enough for me.</li>
            <li> fake extension mascara to look good.</li>
            <li> other than it doesnt make your eye lashes as thick its good</li>
            <li> I say causes irritation due to the fibers not for any other reason I love these mascaras</li>
            <li> The formulas are pretty much the same, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try something less pricey.</li>
            <li> Bought Alpha because I didn&#x27;t wanna spend 30+ on another brand, tried it out for the first time the other day</li>
            <li> I also use my standard mascara after words to kind of break my eyelashes up a little because they can slightly clump together.</li>
            <li> Buy a name brand product from a local store instead so you can easily return it for a refund if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> it comes with two sets however the leopard print fiber mascara had barely any fibers in it  </li>
            <li> They get all over your face, and more irritating is in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Love it if you can not deal with false or indivual lashes</li>
            <li> Definitely not an item you can keep just for special occasions as it will probably be dried up by the time you wanna use it a third or 4th time.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, arrived exactly as expected!!!</li>
            <li> not long</li>
            <li> My lashes look so long &amp; natural</li>
            <li> False eyelashes are just more clean and dramatic at the same time.</li>
            <li> the natural fiber tubes when you apply them, fall all over your face and into your eyes and quite honestly do not make my eyelashes look much longer at all.</li>
            <li> It is hard trying to figure out what goes first with 4 mascara tubes</li>
            <li> I really like the purple pink tube, but the leopard tube wasn&#x27;t working for me, it made my eyelashes look clumpy and uneven.</li>
            <li> I already have long eyelashes and this does make them look a little more dramatic...</li>
            <li> , the second one of my friends saw my eyes they were so shocked at how good they looked with little product used.</li>
            <li> Carefully apply the gel (larger tube)</li>
            <li> I wish that I had not waited so long</li>
            <li> When I finally got it in the mail both of the fibers were empty.</li>
            <li> it makes my lashes look twice as long as they are.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t really make my lashes thick and long but when applied, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> it does what its suppose to do my problem is the containers were dry as dirt</li>
            <li> The mascara I received were dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand wearing it because all date crumbles into my eyes and my eyes by the end of the day are red and itchy, not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You can get double for a less cost.</li>
            <li> Also, when I received the products, both brushes were very dry.</li>
            <li> The other one is with my everyday mascara (both are by themselves, no other mascara or product added)</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> The only cons are the fibers are a bit messy and can get clumpy.</li>
            <li> It was just okay……one of the tubes were completely empty.  </li>
            <li> Some of the fibers do fall onto the skin, but you have to be careful when putting them on, apart from that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the fiber lashes I found out after using this a few times.</li>
            <li> The color is as expected.</li>
            <li> I had dry black flakes all over my face all day and night.</li>
            <li> I have short and spare lashes due to chemo, so this was not very effective for me.</li>
            <li> Will never purchase this or any other products ever again.</li>
            <li> Took a long time for shipping and when it got here the gel is all dried up.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t even need to get the other.</li>
            <li> I kept the leopard set and gave the other to a friend.</li>
            <li> works just as well if not better than some of the larger name brands.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> you must be careful putting on!</li>
            <li> and I had just forgotten to put the lash on the other eye this morning.</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken when I received it wasting a whole tube of mascara due to it being dried out.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> it was a product for my eyes, also when I opened the mascara the tube was EMPTY  and dried out</li>
            <li> They are not large clumps, just little black &amp;#34;hairs.&amp;#34; Reapply some gel if you feel the fibers are flaking, as that is what seals them on.</li>
            <li> Any fibers that are falling, fall down onto the mirror, not in your eye</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend these products and the price is ridiculous $7.80</li>
            <li> Comparing it to the highly expensive Moonstruck by Younique 3D false fiber lashes, it really is the same product.</li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s not a clean application.</li>
            <li> like within 6 weeks or less just using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Little fibers fall into my eyes all day and cause irritation.</li>
            <li> For what you pay it does extend your lashes,just can be a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> The fibers chaffe off a little.</li>
            <li> Does make your eyelashes look thicker and a little longer.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with flakes seemingly getting in my eyes.</li>
            <li> However, my sister had to trouble with it, so I&#x27;&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I use that for everyday</li>
            <li> Flakes all over found it rather messy.</li>
            <li> dried out by the time I received them</li>
            <li> what a mess it is on your eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I did my other eye and seriously, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> the little brush parts get all over you!</li>
            <li> I mean like took over a month and a half to come in</li>
            <li> once i switched to this i had no more isued.</li>
            <li> not sure it was the flakes.</li>
            <li> Unless im applying it wrong, my lashes aren&#x27;t any longer than when I use the regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that was about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are supposed to be or not.</li>
            <li> In addition to waiting for it for over a month.... not satisfied at all</li>
            <li> I love the look of false lashes but hated the feeling of them on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Did not come with hard shell case.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what my wife said..</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes thick  </li>
            <li> and before it dries slowly apply the fiber.</li>
            <li> It is not as bad if I put a coat of regular mascara on after applying the fibers, but still gets into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not good...</li>
            <li> EXPECTING the worst (eye irritation, black flecks on my face, clumpy look) but at 50 years old my lashes are getting thinner by the day...</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> but when it did the wands were broken.</li>
            <li> I was confused with how to use ths product despite the directions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like false lashes because of the heaviness and the fakeness of the look, but this takes care of that problem.</li>
            <li> False eyelashes are a pain with glue, and as they start to wear off reapplication leaves my eyelashes feeling gunky and I would rather not have to deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with 2 sets of the transplanting gel &amp; the false fibers.</li>
            <li> They both thought they were false</li>
            <li> and it does looks false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> False advertising, it says 2 mascara sets</li>
            <li> i think mine may have been a bad one because the tube was too tight around the fiber lash wand.</li>
            <li> This product sucks!!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I have ever used No matter about the gel over the mascara the tiny hairs would still fall in my eyes that is why I returned it</li>
            <li> I had people think they where fake.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?</li>
            <li> anyone has considered 3D fiber mascara, order a brand like this before reaching for the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> and it feels weird.</li>
            <li> I used my lash primer and usual mascara as a base and than did three coats of the transplanting gel and two coats of the fibers.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t even have mascara on them just the little bottle with nothing on it !!!!!</li>
            <li> Very SLOW shipping!!</li>
            <li> Every time I use this, I just get fibers in my eyes, it is very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t impossible to get off your lashes.</li>
            <li> so I was very disappointed its unfortunate......</li>
            <li> Really disappointed asf</li>
            <li> This product makes my lashes look a bit longer, but am disappointed that the fibers end up underneath my eyes and cause eye irritation.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> you are not supposed to make your strokes with the fiber from the base.</li>
            <li> and I had the WORST headache all day because the fiber crap continued to fall into my eyes.</li>
            <li> The product had a very bad odor and it didn&#x27;t stay on my eyes well within 20 mins of application if was sprinkled on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> The 3D fiber lash work horrible</li>
            <li> but it is awful.</li>
            <li> Fibers irratated my eyes needed to go to the hospital to get them washed out worst product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible!</li>
            <li> Very poor!!!!</li>
            <li> the worst mascara ever!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it 💛  but it hurts when the fibers get in your eye and shipping took forever I mean like took over a month and a half to come in but the are really cheap and works just like the more expensive stuff plus it comes with two different fiber lashes</li>
            <li> Works great. Awesome for every day but not as full as eye lash extension for a special occasion. They are easy to remove just wiped off with make up wipes.</li>
            <li> I was originally excited about this product couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. when I received the product the package was ripped open that concerned me being it was a product for my eyes, also when I opened the mascara the tube was EMPTY  and dried out so I was very disappointed its unfortunate......</li>
            <li> I  absolutely love this product.  I use to dislike putting mascara on.  I truly love this easy to apply and remove product.</li>
            <li> The fibers go in ur eyes.  Not good...</li>
            <li> Totally worth it! For $8 and you get a two pack you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Product was as expected. Works well with regular mascara. I have not had any irritation issues with using this product.</li>
            <li> Love it,it&#x27;s amazing...</li>
            <li> love this even came in too cute cases to carry awsome price</li>
            <li> i love this mascara it is my all time favorite</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  It really extends my lashes!  I will use this and reorder again and again.  I don&#x27;t like false lashes because of the heaviness and the fakeness of the look, but this takes care of that problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this...the fibers get on my face n in my eyes..</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I have ever used No matter about the gel over the mascara the tiny hairs would still fall in my eyes that is why I returned it</li>
            <li> The instructions were in chinese.... I&#x27;m American..</li>
            <li> After a bit of practice and SEVERAL you tube videos I got the whole &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;...fake extension mascara to look good. Make sure you use your own mascara as first and last coat to prevent any flaking.</li>
            <li> My mom bought these and she seemed to light it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the blue &amp;#34;cashmere&amp;#34; set. but i dont like the leopard set at all. i think mine may have been a bad one because the tube was too tight around the fiber lash wand. i never got any fibers out.</li>
            <li> I say causes irritation due to the fibers not for any other reason I love these mascaras</li>
            <li> If you wear contacts I don&#x27;t believe you will be able to wear these. The particles will get in your eye by the end of the day. Otherwise it does what it says it will do which make your lashes longer.</li>
            <li> i feel like the mascara part could be a little better, but i LOVE this product. i didn&#x27;t tell anyone i was wearing it, the second one of my friends saw my eyes they were so shocked at how good they looked with little product used.</li>
            <li> Would never order again.....what a mess it is on your eyelashes!</li>
            <li> these products took forever to ship to me! the natural fiber tubes when you apply them, fall all over your face and into your eyes and quite honestly do not make my eyelashes look much longer at all. I can&#x27;t stand wearing it because all date crumbles into my eyes and my eyes by the end of the day are red and itchy, not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes thick  not long I really like it and  you will too</li>
            <li> Did not come with hard shell case. I did receive both sets of fiber mascara. Takes some getting use to as far as putting it on your lashes. Can get clumpy if you put too much fibers. Over if you play around with it and get familiar with the product it seems to work great I am satisfied with the look of my lashes.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase. Not only did it take forever to get here but when it did the wands were broken. The product had a very bad odor and it didn&#x27;t stay on my eyes well within 20 mins of application if was sprinkled on my cheeks. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra to purchase younique 3D fiber lashes. It&#x27;s a bit more but VERY worth it. Will never purchase this or any other products ever again.</li>
            <li> Love it if you can not deal with false or indivual lashes this is perfect it gives you the look of longer lashes with out all the drama of putting them on or watching them fall off I have very short lashes and this is now a staple product for me</li>
            <li> They are ok, but I&#x27;ve used other ones that work much better. I dont care for the brushes or the gel comparably.</li>
            <li> It was late and the product was ok will not record again</li>
            <li> I love these mascaras. They really make your eyes POP.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, my lashes look super long.  Very satisfied with the results.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Took forever to get here, instructions aren&#x27;t in English. Did anyone else notice that the shippers name is Ding Dong Feng? I lmao when I seen that, that alone is well worth 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I do not recommend these. They ripped me off but they were very kind to refund me my money without any problems.</li>
            <li> Works very well for the price I&#x27;ve paid</li>
            <li> My daughters like it.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Really make your eyelashes look long and full!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I was kind of skeptical about the product at first after I tried it the first time I most definetly will not be using anything else. It let&#x27;s your lashes stand. I had people think they where fake.</li>
            <li> Took a long time for shipping and when it got here the gel is all dried up.</li>
            <li> Great product, just need instructions in English.....</li>
            <li> i used to use the youniqe brand until i noticed irritation from the product. once i switched to this i had no more isued. i love this product and the price is even better</li>
            <li> The 3D fiber lash work horrible they don&#x27;t even have mascara on them just the little bottle with nothing on it !!!!! Really disappointed asf</li>
            <li> did not like it at all !</li>
            <li> im in love with this! I purchased it and while waiting for it to come in my friend gave me the younique 3d fiver lash set i used but until this came in and i have found this to be much better then the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is freaking amazing! I was going to get a different brand that was quite a bit more, but I wanted to try something similar first. Now I don&#x27;t even need to get the other. This stuff is awesome and my lashes look fabulous every day! It comes with two sets, so four tubes total. I kept the leopard set and gave the other to a friend. We both agree that they are amazing. I honestly don&#x27;t know what I did before these. I cannot go back to regular mascara now. Make sure you read the directions for the best results. I also use my standard mascara after words to kind of break my eyelashes up a little because they can slightly clump together. I recommend this to everyone and will continue to purchase for my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Shopping took forever as would any product being shipped over seas. I was so excited to get this but it is awful. It does nothing for me. Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong? I don&#x27;t know but my regular mascara works better. The fibers fell in my eye and I had irritation the whole time I wore it. I hate it. The picture where you see my whole nose, that&#x27;s with the leopard tube of fiber lashes. The other one is with my everyday mascara (both are by themselves, no other mascara or product added) I just don&#x27;t like this. I guess $8 isn&#x27;t much to lose.</li>
            <li> For the price is very good</li>
            <li> other than it doesnt make your eye lashes as thick its good</li>
            <li> This product makes my lashes look a bit longer, but am disappointed that the fibers end up underneath my eyes and cause eye irritation.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with flakes seemingly getting in my eyes. However, my sister had to trouble with it, so I&#x27;&#x27;m not sure it was the flakes.</li>
            <li> The fiber lashes definitely make your lashes look longer and fuller, but those tiny fibers get EVERYWHERE! They get all over your face, and more irritating is in your eyes. I constantly have red, itchy, irritable eyes while wearing this mascara. It is not as bad if I put a coat of regular mascara on after applying the fibers, but still gets into my eyes.</li>
            <li> love this fiber lash mascara. has two tubes one for the transfer gel and one for the fiber lashes. very easy to apply and lasts all day. works just as well if not better than some of the larger name brands.</li>
            <li> do you ladies think it&#x27;s worth the money?</li>
            <li> Love this product! The only cons are the fibers are a bit messy and can get clumpy. For the most part this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken when I received it wasting a whole tube of mascara due to it being dried out.  Angel mask mascara is better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not exactly what I was expecting. Unless im applying it wrong, my lashes aren&#x27;t any longer than when I use the regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Too long ship time but worth the wait</li>
            <li> Fibers irratated my eyes needed to go to the hospital to get them washed out worst product ever invented</li>
            <li> Do not Buy. The packaging is cheap and this is not a 3D set at all. You get what you pay for! I would give it zero ratings</li>
            <li> My instructions aren&#x27;t in English and I don&#x27;t know what goes on first??</li>
            <li> So exiting to be trying this!! :)</li>
            <li> Have had this product before love it!  Will continue to buy from seller</li>
            <li> fibers get everywhere and did not make my lashes longer or fuller</li>
            <li> It was just okay……one of the tubes were completely empty.  Not sure what that was about.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be the fibers fall in ur eyes</li>
            <li> Works great, love it!!!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to falsies after this product</li>
            <li> Do NOT purchase this item!  It was very feathery and I didn&#x27;t want the fiber strands to get into my eyes.  Buy a name brand product from a local store instead so you can easily return it for a refund if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> The makeup came damaged and one without transferring gel.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it .</li>
            <li> I do love this.  I only wish the brushes made it easier to apply.  Otherwise I&#x27;d have given it more stars.</li>
            <li> Love the product, price, prime and love that you get two.&lt;br /&gt;Surprised I haven&#x27;t seen or heard ANYONE give any warning, no matter the brand but the step 2 fibers wand (leopard print one) you must be careful putting on! Since the fibers are so fine and tiny and there&#x27;s so many of them it&#x27;s way easy to just get a lot in your eyes super fast. I did that my first two times on the same eye. Which made it all red and watery for like an hour since it takes some time getting all the tiny fibers out. Now I just keep my eyes super squinted the whole time applying which I feel is also beneficial to the fact I&#x27;m not raising my eyebrows and applying which pulls the skin causing wrinkles sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: For better results I still apply 1 coat of my regular mascara very first. I feel like it makes the 3D mascara not look as clumpy. I&#x27;m also super OCD and can&#x27;t stand clumps so every time I use my regular mascara I have to put just a drop of any contact solution or 👉eye drops👈 since they are more travel size. But right on the brush part of my mascara, dip, apply. Works wonders! ..I used to just use water for actually a couple years till I discovered the drops instead which works better I think but if you don&#x27;t wanna spend any money water works:)</li>
            <li> They took forever to arrive and it doesn&#x27;t work they say it does and the fiber lashes are like fine pieces of fur they just fall all day</li>
            <li> Fast delivery... Excellent product</li>
            <li> Product was decent. Easier to remove than regular mascara, however the effect isn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I already have fairly long eyelashes, but they never look full enough for me. I also wear cat-eye/winged eyeliner, and the boldness of the liner can outshine my natural lashes. False eyelashes are a pain with glue, and as they start to wear off reapplication leaves my eyelashes feeling gunky and I would rather not have to deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started looking into 3D mascara. I am sure most have heard of &amp;#34;Younique,&amp;#34; but this brand has been compared to its product - and noticing that Younique is about $40 for one set, and this is half the price for two, I knew I wanted to give this one a chance. I am glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true there are fibers that flake off, and during application you may get a fiber in your eye here and there. Don&#x27;t rush! Carefully apply the gel (larger tube) and before it dries slowly apply the fiber. You can easily brush away any remnants that fall, even throughout the day. They are not large clumps, just little black &amp;#34;hairs.&amp;#34; Reapply some gel if you feel the fibers are flaking, as that is what seals them on. This is a small price to pay for lashes that certainly look fuller and more defined. They don&#x27;t add length except to my bottom lashes (which is awesome!) but I was already pleased with my natural length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has considered 3D fiber mascara, order a brand like this before reaching for the expensive ones. The formulas are pretty much the same, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try something less pricey.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful, however the fibers don&#x27;t come out on the bristles very often</li>
            <li> This mascara really works wonders! It comes with 2 sets of the transplanting gel &amp; the false fibers. It is super easy to apply and it comes with instructions with how to apply as well. It is really a great product. Comparing it to the highly expensive Moonstruck by Younique 3D false fiber lashes, it really is the same product. You can get double for a less cost. I definitely recommend this mascara to anyone that wants their eyes to pop!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; portion fell into my eyes and I had the WORST headache all day because the fiber crap continued to fall into my eyes. I will NEVER buy this stuff again.</li>
            <li> Wasnt impressed. The fibers shed all day and get in my eyes. Also they don&#x27;t look longer, but they do indeed look fuller I have to say. Not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> This product works great, don&#x27;t be discouraged if you don&#x27;t like the application at first, once you learn how to properly apply you achieve gray results and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good but not as good as I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor spend the extra money for younique brand...I&#x27;ve  used it and thought I&#x27;d save some $ this flakes and burns and clumps works ok if you can deal with that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product, It is no different than regular mascara.  I wish that I had not waited so long and I would have .returned it .</li>
            <li> It looks good on my daughter. And having 2 sets was also great.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot they make yours gorgeous</li>
            <li> I loved reading the reviews, they sounded almost too good to be true. But after trying it several times and even trying the &amp;#34;no flake&amp;#34; tips, I had to stop using it all together. I had dry black flakes all over my face all day and night. No matter what I tried, nothing seemed to reduce the shedding. Also, when I received the products, both brushes were very dry. I&#x27;m not sure if they are supposed to be or not.</li>
            <li> The instructions were not in English. It is hard trying to figure out what goes first with 4 mascara tubes and they are not numbered.</li>
            <li> My 70-yr old eyelashes need a lot of help, and this does the trick.  There is flaking--but I will cope.  Remember how the movie stars used to look into their compacts on the hour?  I must learn to do that, too.</li>
            <li> Ok, ladies, stop looking elsewhere and don&#x27;t you dare spend $30+ on 3d mascara, you know the one I&#x27;m talking about. This here is IT! Got it today and did one eye, then asked a couple of coworkers how it looked. They both thought they were false and I had just forgotten to put the lash on the other eye this morning. Ha! That would be kinda like wearing two different shoes, yes, been there. But no, these lashes are not fake, they&#x27;re all mine, just... enhanced. Think of it as photoshop for your eyes! :-) I did my other eye and seriously, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I did not encounter any problems in the application. Nothing got in my eyes, This product absolutely positively rocks!</li>
            <li> I will buy this one again. it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Save your money! You definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says!  Easy to apply and to remove and it does looks false eyelashes. But better!</li>
            <li> Love this! I wear it all the time. It&#x27;s super quick and easy to apply. It does flake when your putting on the fibers but not only one of two fibers fall on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, and now I am going to order extras.</li>
            <li> Try this product its wonderful, I love it!👍👍👍</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I always had super short eyelashes and most mascaras never work but this is amazing! And you get 2 sets with this Im so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Omg I absolutely love this fiber mascara the leopard print tube is fantastic the purple tube is good too I use that for everyday the leopard is night out!! Definitely recommend these products and the price is ridiculous $7.80 OMG I paid 4xs that for Dior show! Definitely buying again!!</li>
            <li> I have used only the leopard print mascara, It does lengthen and thicken my lashes however, I noticed about an hour later there were a bunch of tiny fibers above and under my eyed. It&#x27;s a bit of a pain. That is the only drawback.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Not enough fiber for second time</li>
            <li> it does what its suppose to do my problem is the containers were dry as dirt i only got 3 uses out of 4 containers so it makes me think this product has been sitting for a while the bristles were dty as molasses</li>
            <li> caused me a eye infection and scratched cornea. 2 hospital visits later, and referral to an eye specialists! I havent been able to wear make up in a whole week so far. was so dissapointed and instructions are not in english!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara..  As a make up artist and esthetician, I am always looking for something that not only I love, but can share with clients.  This product is fantastic!!!  There is a small learning curve but after that, wonderful results.  The company also resolved an issue quickly and very courteously.  Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> i really love it. u can see the diference.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. The mascara I received were dry. I gave them to my daughter. I suggested to use her favorite mascara with this so it doesn&#x27;t look so flaky and clumpy.</li>
            <li> It does the job just that fifibers are clump and chunks</li>
            <li> Just as good as any of the leading competitors for so much cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> I love this, it works and it is the best fiber mascara I have purchased!</li>
            <li> False advertising, it says 2 mascara sets but I only received one set.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t change my eye lash length at all or fullness. Clumpy eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this... Understand I bought this EXPECTING the worst (eye irritation, black flecks on my face, clumpy look) but at 50 years old my lashes are getting thinner by the day...WOW, I was pleasantly surprised how great this product is.  It was so easy to apply, just need to be careful and patient, all of about 2 minutes start to finish.  I just applied it today for the first time and have already RE-ORDERED 2 more sets !!!!  Yes, it&#x27;s THAT awesome.  Did my own before and after pictures, too.  HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan, it falls off easily and it gets in my eyes, I end up looking like my eyelashes are shedding and it feels weird.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It&#x27;s so natural looking and easy to take off.  Some of the fibers do fall onto the skin, but you have to be careful when putting them on, apart from that I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price.  Check out my pic, I did one eye to show the difference.</li>
            <li> My eyes did not look like the picture at all.  I have short and spare lashes due to chemo, so this was not very effective for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff works just a good as the 30$ stuff dose</li>
            <li> Little fibers fall into my eyes all day and cause irritation. Yes, my eyelashes are long but it just isn&#x27;t worth the irritation it causes.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to unique 3D fiber lash mascara</li>
            <li> I like these because I got 2 for the price of 1-lol! Both work about the same if you already have eye lashes, they really enhance them. I don&#x27;t grow lashes easily, so it works for me when I don&#x27;t want to put glue all over the place with the  falsies-lol!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 16 year old daughter.  She has used it everyday since opening and absolutely loves it.  Looks great on and makes her eye lashes long.</li>
            <li> This mascara gives you gorgeous and long eyelashes effortlessly! I will continue to purchase this! It&#x27;s a great deal and you get two sets...</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! EASY to apply and remove. For all of the complaints:If anyone isn&#x27;t getting length then apply a coat as you normally do,then squint and apply a coat on just the tips. It helps to touch the applicator to your lashes,then close your eye. Add as many coats as you want until they&#x27;re unbelievably long. To avoid fibers falling off,finish with a gel coat. To remove,simply wet,wait one minute,and wipe..no raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> The delivery took forever, but i just received this &amp; oh my god i&#x27;m loving it! My lashes look so long &amp; natural, I&#x27;ve only used the LA306 so far, but i think this pack is totally worth buying &amp; they&#x27;re not too exspensive either! Which is awesome! (:</li>
            <li> This product sucks!! Very SLOW shipping!! When I finally got it in the mail both of the fibers were empty. Nothing to be found. And when I tried using the fiber brush itself the little brush parts get all over you! It&#x27;s horrible! I do not recommend this at all! Save your money for something better!!</li>
            <li> Bought Alpha because I didn&#x27;t wanna spend 30+ on another brand, tried it out for the first time the other day and I am absolutely in love! Will definitely be a buying more!</li>
            <li> Great product got both on time! The purple one works better has more fibers . found the leopard print product runny</li>
            <li> had to wait a while to get these but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, only used once so far</li>
            <li> Every time I use this, I just get fibers in my eyes, it is very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> For what you pay it does extend your lashes,just can be a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> Enjoying trying to feel it out</li>
            <li> Its ok..not great. The fibers chaffe off a little.</li>
            <li> It does lengthen quickly and makes them fuller, but somewhat clumpy. I also think that as the day wore on the fibers flaked off a bit into my eyes until I needed to just go wash my face. I won&#x27;t wear it regularly, but maybe if it&#x27;s not a hot day, I&#x27;ll wear it for a special occasion.&lt;br /&gt;The most durable and easy to remove is still Lash Injection. I can cry in it, swim in it, sweat in it and it doesn&#x27;t budge, smear or melt. Removes easily with warm water and soap.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!! This is my new mascara!! Shipping was very fast, arrived exactly as expected!!!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! LOVE this mascara. This is the mascara to end all searching for me. I will continue to purchase this when I get low. LOVE IT!!!! Just be sure you do the gel, then the fibers, then the gel again. FLAWLESS and it washes right off when you&#x27;re done for the day!! It isn&#x27;t impossible to get off your lashes. Seriously, LOVE this mascara!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Flakes all over found it rather messy.</li>
            <li> I was confused with how to use ths product despite the directions.  However I put it on the way I think and my eyelashes are so much longer.  I get loads of complements.  Really glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. Does make your eyelashes look thicker and a little longer. I already have long eyelashes and this does make them look a little more dramatic... however it&#x27;s not a clean application. False eyelashes are just more clean and dramatic at the same time. This is good for everyday use but I would still rather put on the falsies for special occasions. Would have gave a 3 1/2 but there was no option. All in all good product. Great price :)</li>
            <li> Very poor!!!! Doesn&#x27;t not work at all! It is out of date! Also, one of my items was not correct at all!!! I will never order this again!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t lengthen lashes</li>
            <li> Great product but poor customer service</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the easiest way to apply the fibers and NOt get them in your eye is to set a hand held mirror on the bathroom counter. Looking over the mirror, apply your transplanting gel and then your fibers. Any fibers that are falling, fall down onto the mirror, not in your eye</li>
            <li> The price is great it comes with two sets however the leopard print fiber mascara had barely any fibers in it  I was only able to use it one time and then it was empty? The rest of the 3-D Set had plenty of gel and fiber and it works great I would advise watching a YouTube video on how to put this on because I have read a lot of reviews about how the fibers get in your eyes however I have not had that problem because if you put it on properly that Will not happen you are not supposed to make your strokes with the fiber from the base. You start about midway from your lash and stroke up this is how you keep the fibers out of your eyes and it still is effective.  The only reason I would not buy this set again from this company is because I got gypped on one of the mascaras where there was not any fibers in the tube except enough for a one time use and for this reason only I am giving it a lower rating.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all like described. And one cheetah print fiber gel has no fibers in it. In addition to waiting for it for over a month.... not satisfied at all</li>
            <li> I love it! it makes my lashes look twice as long as they are. I apply it twice to each lash and it lasts well all day :)</li>
            <li> One of the clear containers of mascara didn&#x27;t have anything in it. It&#x27;s just a wand with no liquid. I don&#x27;t feel like the mascara really did anything for my lashes.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.. At least that&#x27;s what my wife said.. Hahahah.. Great price.. Shipped fast..</li>
            <li> its a great product and i would recommend to al my friends and family!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the fiber lashes I found out after using this a few times. I just feel like a piece is going to fall into my eye. It also doesn&#x27;t really make my lashes thick and long but when applied, it lasts all day. The color is as expected.</li>
            <li> dried out by the time I received them</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and if you get the fibers in your eyes, well your screwed for the day. Not crazy about spider eye effect.</li>
            <li> I really like the purple pink tube, but the leopard tube wasn&#x27;t working for me, it made my eyelashes look clumpy and uneven. The purple tube was nice though, my eyelashes looked long and natural, but it&#x27;s weird because I read the opposite, most people seemed to like the leopard one better. I guess it&#x27;s all how you perfer your lashes. I probably wouldn&#x27;t get this again though because i found benefits roller mascara works better than both of these.</li>
            <li> I love the look of false lashes but hated the feeling of them on my eyes. This product(with practice) gave me the desired effect i was looking for. I used my lash primer and usual mascara as a base and than did three coats of the transplanting gel and two coats of the fibers. Now I have large gorgeous lashes. :) I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to work this well so i am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This stuff is actually better than the more expensive brand being advertised on Facebook.</li>
            <li> quick ship great product</li>
            <li> I am truly impressed. I had bought a product that was more than twice as expensive and it is in the cabinet and I am using this instead. Plus I got a bonus set so I am in heaven and plan on buying these for stocking stuffers. Do not worry or think about buying those at the drug store or department store, save it money and buy these instead.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look great but dries out quickly... like within 6 weeks or less just using it a few times.  Definitely not an item you can keep just for special occasions as it will probably be dried up by the time you wanna use it a third or 4th time.</li>
            <li> The products were as advertised. However, just like everyone else has stated, the tubes with the fiber lashes did not have very many lashes in them. They seemed to run out fast. Other than that, the products were good. I&#x27;m not sure if I experienced out of this world amaaaaazingly long lashes, but they dis give me some length and lots of fullness/volume.</li>
            <li> Works great if u use the 2 together.</li>
            <li> I would like to start off by saying that the mascara was sent kinda dry…and I didn&#x27;t see any change and i noticed a lot of flakes from the mascara! the worst mascara ever!!</li>
            <li> 100% just as good as Younique! I&#x27;ve tried younique and LOVED it, but $30 for mascara is nuts. This stuff in in every way, Just like it. Will buy from again!</li>
