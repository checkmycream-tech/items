            <li>They are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to find something new and different to add to my wish list.  </li>

            <li> The only thing I did not like was that the part that dangles tends to get stuck on your hair and if you pull hard enough the dangly thing will come off</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy</li>
            <li> These are the cutest little nail charms, I just wear one at a time, and get tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i can&#x60;t, they have no curve and do not fit the nail.</li>
            <li> but some of them came broken</li>
            <li> but for everyday you&#x27;re gonna hate trying to wash your hair not to mention if you&#x27;re one of those hair twirlers who touch their hair all the time.</li>

Tan preciosos y a buen precio, y el diseno no es tan comun con respeto a que queria un diseno con una cadenita pero que fuera super chulo y esto si que es!  Cintas hermosas con un diseno de Corazon con un diamante, pintura violeta clara y diamantes brillosas.  Que mas puedo pedir?  Definitivamente planeo usarlas en varios disenos de unas y me encantaria comprarlas otra vez.  :D</li>
            <li> for the price, size is good but not exactly as pictured. One is darker than the rest.</li>
            <li> I have found anything made form the Alloy material doesn&#x27;t stick well on nail it slides and take for ever to hold on to I will no longer be purchasing Alloy made materials for nails</li>
            <li> These are the cutest little nail charms, I just wear one at a time, and get tons of compliments! I have given so many out to my friends, I need to buy me some more ; )</li>

            <li> I love them more in my hand pic didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t see the details very pretty</li>
            <li> Very cute, exactly like shown in the pictures.  The only thing one has to remember is to becareful not to get it caught on clothes, hair etc. but other than that they work great for me, they look real pretty on the nails without having to creat a hole in your nail just to have a dangle.</li>
            <li> Great for occasions (weddings, Easter and b&#x27;days, etc.) but for everyday you&#x27;re gonna hate trying to wash your hair not to mention if you&#x27;re one of those hair twirlers who touch their hair all the time. Good luck with that!</li>

            <li> These bows are super cute i love the dangle in them. They got here very fast like in 2 weeks or less. I will order again when i run out of them.,! Thankz</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping!!! Bows are very cute and was looking foward to wearing them. Unfortunately i can&#x60;t, they have no curve and do not fit the nail.</li>
            <li> Nail charm to big.  I can not use my nail.</li>

            <li> good product....at great price .....they are great for the nails .......</li>
            <li> Bigger than what I thought. Almost to big for nail art. But very cute. Would be great if just a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I decided to get these charms because the lady that did my nails wanted to charge be $5 for a pair of charms and i thought it was a bit pricey. I glad I bought these charms because they are amazing. These charms will definitely make your nails stand out. The quality is great they are sturdy and do not become rusted when they get wet. The only thing I did not like was that the part that dangles tends to get stuck on your hair and if you pull hard enough the dangly thing will come off</li>

            <li> I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  I could not find anything like this in my area anywhere.  These gems have been the most requested out of all the gems that I ordered and I will soon run out.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; up their nail art at an affordable price.  I received my items very quickly and am very happy with them. They are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to find something new and different to add to my wish list.  I am so happy....</li>

            <li> I APOLOGIZE FOR THE PREVIOUS REVIEW, I DID RECEIVE THIS ITEM NICELY WRAPPED AND AS BEAUTIFULLY DESCRIBED IN PICTURE, THANK YOU! ITS REALLY PRETTY, WILL PURCHASE FROM AGAIN AND RECOMMEND THIS BUYER!</li>
            <li> They are too cute but should be called phone rhinestones because they are way to heavy even for acrylic nails an they are not curved to fit the nail . So basically you will look like a clown if you wore these.</li>
            <li> Just as described! I use acrylic to glue them on to nails to get a stronger hold on my clients! Very cute!</li>
            <li> fast shipping and perfect i don&#x27;t know how anyone could complain! it is 3d nail art it is suppose to raise off the nail. much prettier than picture</li>
            <li> good quality... i like it, but when using, be careful, do not only use glue!!! they don&#x27;t stay with nail glue only!!!</li>
