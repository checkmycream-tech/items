            <li>My husband has even commented a couple times about how good it&#x27;s looking.</li>
            <li>I am using it with the AHA+ (which is replacing another glycolic acid product), and I&#x27;m so impressed with both products I&#x27;ll be switching over to use the full line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This container is great, as it has a locking top.</li>
            <li>In my opinion YOU WONT FIND anything better than this online !</li>
            <li>I was considering Accutane until on a whim I tried the Acne.org Treatment that came as a sample when I ordered the amazing Acne.org cleanser.  </li>
            <li>cuz i get it for free from my insurance, it works as good as the bp</li>
            <li>The product arrived in the right time, great packaging and all</li>
            <li>The formulation is a very light gel which spreads easily and dries nicely.  </li>
            <li>I followed the regimen and the results were incredible: Within two weeks, my skin was completely clear!  </li>
            <li>and my skin is looking better and better each day.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m drinking 4 bottles of water a day and my acne and scars are getting better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes time to make things better.</li>
            <li>MUCH better results.</li>
            <li>So beware, this 2.5% itches way more than the 10%!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I order too many bottles.</li>
            <li>Now my face is produces more oil than before.</li>
            <li>Love this product from Acne.org.</li>
            <li>I started to exfoliate which is against the instructions, and my skin has gotten better.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it clears the spot s on my face</li>
            <li>and then cuz I love cheese</li>
            <li>I have been using this treatment since 2009, and it has changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li>(it also stained so many of my shirts!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I believe it is working even better than anything I&#x27;ve done before</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he also likes looking at me and seeing a</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he also likes looking at me and seeing a</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally clean skin!</li>
            <li>The pump is flimsy and easily breaks.</li>
            <li>I had accutane treatment years ago and need a strong moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause acne and</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap and it works</li>
            <li>But this benzoyl peroxide is cheap, it works and it will help you control your acne.</li>
            <li>Very useful</li>
            <li>this coupled with the aha+ at night are a very powerful regimen for clearing and controlling acne.</li>
            <li>Makeup glides over it with no problem; I have used it under powder, loose mineral, liquid, and cream-to-powder foundations and the results were beautiful each and every time.  </li>
            <li>You can mix it with the lotion for a rich</li>
            <li>But, with time, ull be clean for ever.</li>
            <li>clean after 4 month of treatment.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best BP product currently on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Proactive has only 1 good product I like and its the sulfur mask.</li>
            <li>It has no fragrance whatsoever (to the reviewer who said it smelled of Cinnamon: the old formula of the Acne.org moisturizer did have that kind of fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It did a good job of keeping new acne from forming, but it really didnt get rid of my existing acne (my chin).  </li>
            <li>I use this once daily for several months now with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>so sometimes I get some mild burning if I put it too close to my eyes</li>
            <li>also made the mistake of not applying a moisturizer on my face because it is super drying.</li>
            <li>If you need to choose a BP product for any acne, mild to severe, this is the one.</li>
            <li>stuff lasts forever and makes your skin very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Anyway this is how i found success with it.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the re-arranging.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth the money and lasts for</li>
            <li>and he knows how much better I feel about myself when my face is clear.</li>
            <li>and he knows how much better I feel about myself when my face is clear.</li>
            <li>Amazing product to get rid of acne but works well in synergy (Cleanser + BP + moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem : does not clear all my blackheads after 6 month of treatment (but pimples and whiteheads OK).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use 2 full pumps and put it all over my whole face.</li>
            <li>So whenever I travel, I turn the top and wrap a little plastic around the pump to make sure no leakage could happen.</li>
            <li>This is just a part of my OWN system i have developed in helping me get clear skin for once.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Dan!</li>
            <li>I get just enough to be able to coat my thighs and butt with a slippery coat that dries in just a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff instantly  gets rid of acne</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent and use a lot.  </li>
            <li>The key is use A LOT, twice a day, and make sure it dries before you put on your clothes</li>
            <li>Enduring the discomfort in that short time frame has enabled me to confidently show my mug to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are a user of Neutrogena On-the-Spot BP cream, this is a much better buy for the same % of BP.  </li>
            <li>Well, I ran out of my most recent bottle and wondered if perhaps I could manage without it by now.  </li>
            <li>pretty complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>and I can eat pretty much whatever I want within reason</li>
            <li>For the first time, my face cleared up really well.</li>
            <li>( there are certain foods that break me out like bacon and cheese, I have cheese every now</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very thick lotion that has not caused any acne for me and does a great job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I apply it to my face, chest, shoulders, and back and have seen a huge reduction in acne.  </li>
            <li>in a while when I really want to treat my skin</li>
            <li>This really controllerd my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my friend that introduced me to this.</li>
            <li>and it is a gentle gel/lotion formula that leaves no shine or residue.  </li>
            <li>but after hours of applying it I noticed my whole face itch and flushed</li>
            <li>: I for one believe that $36 is too much money for any 16oz bottle and think that they are still somewhat ripping us off though.  </li>
            <li>This is really a con to this review.  </li>
            <li>I really  want these to come off.</li>
            <li>, I just watch how much I have and</li>
            <li>and then if I eat too much fat, I just go to the dermatologists</li>
            <li>My face absolutely went nuts.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this, but nnnoope..</li>
            <li>My clear face was pretty well maintained despite this.</li>
            <li>The big bottle lasts me about 2-3 months which is really cool since I don&#x27;t have to worry about it running out soon.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely better than any other Benzoyl Peroxide product on the market!</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin like other BP formulations did, and I love the large, pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>My face is definitely clearer now that I am using the Acne.org treatment, I can use as much as I need without drying out my face and having the large bottle is very convenient.</li>
            <li>It took me around 1.5-2 weeks before everything looked normal.</li>
            <li>Most of these products didn&#x27;t work at all and the few that did were temporary fixes that my skin became immune to and stopped working.</li>
            <li>Most of these products didn&#x27;t work at all and the few that did were temporary fixes that my skin became immune to and stopped working.</li>
            <li>At first it worked pretty well, it dried up my skin a lot the first 2 weeks, but my skin did get used to it.  </li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t order a new bottle.</li>
            <li>My face is very clear just using nightly.</li>
            <li>I do not usually make reviews and i purchase a lot at amazon, but i had to do this one for the sake of who is buying this product.</li>
            <li>Only thing is if you stop using it, acne flares up again, but it does keep the cysts away when used consistently.</li>
            <li>This is truly the only product that works consistently.</li>
            <li>This is truly the only product that works consistently.</li>
            <li>However with this regimen, I&#x27;m always 98% clear</li>
            <li>again, my face is CLEAR.</li>
            <li>My skin is EXTREMELY sensitive though</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and have been battling acne since I was 10.  </li>
            <li>Mine is almost completely gone</li>
            <li>My skin is no longer soft but it feels rubbery.</li>
            <li>tried using natural products, the caveman regimen, everything you can think of .</li>
            <li>This took about 3 bottles(3 months) to completely get rid of all the acne on my chest.  </li>
            <li>I found it works just as well, it leaves a white film when the lotion dries unlike Acne.org lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me</li>
            <li>When you first start using a topical treatment, it&#x27;s going to make your face flake, and turn red.</li>
            <li>I had acne all throughout high school and using the Acne.org regimen, it finally cleared.</li>
            <li>But after a couple months back using this treatment, my face is so clear.</li>
            <li>But after a couple months back using this treatment, my face is so clear.</li>
            <li>I can see the difference in my skin using the amount recommended by the acne.org website, and I won&#x27;t worry about skimping to stretch out the bottle with the larger one (self-psychology in action).  </li>
            <li>The only thing that controls my adult acne.</li>
            <li>The first month it was super flakey, the second it was red and raw, and now I feel I have spent my life&#x27;s savings on yet another gimmick.</li>
            <li>Best of all, my skin is clear and calm; other BP&#x27;s left me red, peely and miserable.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really have any dryness or other problems when using it.  </li>
            <li>Other than that is seems very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the amount of treatment (1-2 pumps of product) does take a while to dry completely even in dry air, so I&#x27;ve started doing this first thing in the morning to ensure it&#x27;s dry before putting on make up.  </li>
            <li>began using this a few years ago and followed the 3step regimen perfectly at first.</li>
            <li>Mine is hormonal, the cystic kind that is deep and painful and highly noticeable and leaves</li>
            <li>Works as well as my usual 5-10%, though it does require a few more applications to have the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This stuff leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> and I can eat pretty much whatever I want within reason</li>
            <li> For the first time, my face cleared up really well.</li>
            <li> ( there are certain foods that break me out like bacon and cheese, I have cheese every now</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very thick lotion that has not caused any acne for me and does a great job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to my face, chest, shoulders, and back and have seen a huge reduction in acne.  </li>
            <li> in a while when I really want to treat my skin</li>
            <li> This really controllerd my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my friend that introduced me to this.</li>
            <li> and it is a gentle gel/lotion formula that leaves no shine or residue.  </li>
            <li> but after hours of applying it I noticed my whole face itch and flushed</li>
            <li> : I for one believe that $36 is too much money for any 16oz bottle and think that they are still somewhat ripping us off though.  </li>
            <li> This is really a con to this review.  </li>
            <li> I really  want these to come off.</li>
            <li> , I just watch how much I have and</li>
            <li> and then if I eat too much fat, I just go to the dermatologists</li>
            <li> My face absolutely went nuts.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this, but nnnoope..</li>
            <li> My clear face was pretty well maintained despite this.</li>
            <li> The big bottle lasts me about 2-3 months which is really cool since I don&#x27;t have to worry about it running out soon.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely better than any other Benzoyl Peroxide product on the market!</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin like other BP formulations did, and I love the large, pump bottle.  </li>
            <li> My face is definitely clearer now that I am using the Acne.org treatment, I can use as much as I need without drying out my face and having the large bottle is very convenient.</li>
            <li> It took me around 1.5-2 weeks before everything looked normal.</li>
            <li> Most of these products didn&#x27;t work at all and the few that did were temporary fixes that my skin became immune to and stopped working.</li>
            <li> Most of these products didn&#x27;t work at all and the few that did were temporary fixes that my skin became immune to and stopped working.</li>
            <li> At first it worked pretty well, it dried up my skin a lot the first 2 weeks, but my skin did get used to it.  </li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t order a new bottle.</li>
            <li> My face is very clear just using nightly.</li>
            <li> I do not usually make reviews and i purchase a lot at amazon, but i had to do this one for the sake of who is buying this product.</li>
            <li> Only thing is if you stop using it, acne flares up again, but it does keep the cysts away when used consistently.</li>
            <li> This is truly the only product that works consistently.</li>
            <li> This is truly the only product that works consistently.</li>
            <li> However with this regimen, I&#x27;m always 98% clear</li>
            <li> again, my face is CLEAR.</li>
            <li> My skin is EXTREMELY sensitive though</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and have been battling acne since I was 10.  </li>
            <li> Mine is almost completely gone</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer soft but it feels rubbery.</li>
            <li> tried using natural products, the caveman regimen, everything you can think of .</li>
            <li> This took about 3 bottles(3 months) to completely get rid of all the acne on my chest.  </li>
            <li> I found it works just as well, it leaves a white film when the lotion dries unlike Acne.org lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me</li>
            <li> When you first start using a topical treatment, it&#x27;s going to make your face flake, and turn red.</li>
            <li> I had acne all throughout high school and using the Acne.org regimen, it finally cleared.</li>
            <li> But after a couple months back using this treatment, my face is so clear.</li>
            <li> But after a couple months back using this treatment, my face is so clear.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in my skin using the amount recommended by the acne.org website, and I won&#x27;t worry about skimping to stretch out the bottle with the larger one (self-psychology in action).  </li>
            <li> The only thing that controls my adult acne.</li>
            <li> The first month it was super flakey, the second it was red and raw, and now I feel I have spent my life&#x27;s savings on yet another gimmick.</li>
            <li> Best of all, my skin is clear and calm; other BP&#x27;s left me red, peely and miserable.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really have any dryness or other problems when using it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that is seems very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the amount of treatment (1-2 pumps of product) does take a while to dry completely even in dry air, so I&#x27;ve started doing this first thing in the morning to ensure it&#x27;s dry before putting on make up.  </li>
            <li> began using this a few years ago and followed the 3step regimen perfectly at first.</li>
            <li> Mine is hormonal, the cystic kind that is deep and painful and highly noticeable and leaves</li>
            <li> Works as well as my usual 5-10%, though it does require a few more applications to have the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will use a salicylic acid toner first to wipe and exfoliate the dead skins off, apply  this lotion let it dry and then apply a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much i put bp on my face it doesnt dry as much as previously.</li>
            <li> and i applied only a little on my face and washed off immediately because since it is a new product for me i needed to test it.</li>
            <li> Twice a day, use about 3 pumps to cover the center area of my chest and wait and let it dry completely.  </li>
            <li> The formulation is gentle on my skin and seems less drying than other versions I have tried.</li>
            <li> Occasionally my skin will get flaky and dry and itchy</li>
            <li> do I use this only if my face seems dry to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my face just seems extra dry.</li>
            <li> my face just seems extra dry.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give it a go since it essentially had the same active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> red spots on my shoulders if I rub it in too rough.  </li>
            <li> It has been a long, embarassing battle, and I have tried every product out there, prescription and over the counter.  </li>
            <li> I buy it in the biggest bottle and it lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li> I have used countless other brands of benzoyl peroxide, from Neutrogena to Paula&#x27;s Choice to Proactiv and nothing worked as well as Acne.org.  </li>
            <li> plus of this lower concentration is that it doesn&#x27;t have the tendency to dry</li>
            <li> You gotta wash your face, let it dry for 5-10 mins , apply bp , let it dry for 10-15 mins and then apply the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t afford to wait for the bp to dry.</li>
            <li> and usually it keeps my skin almost perfectly clear</li>
            <li> Usually I buy this stuff directly from the website but since I was already on amazon decided to buy it here.</li>
            <li> So i decided to try this 2.5% solution since it promises the same results with less aggression to your skin</li>
            <li> and it is feeling very dry</li>
            <li> Little red blotches speckling my legs between my waist and my knees.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and there was a little effect but not enough.</li>
            <li> But the little 2-ounce bottles ran out really quickly on my big man-thighs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really into pork, so I just avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and its working EXTREMELY well.  </li>
            <li> I tried looking  around and only found other relatively small bottles for 5 times the price by volume as this product.  </li>
            <li> the thing is that it is pretty dan expensive...</li>
            <li> Eventually I got lazy and was only using this part of the 3step process.</li>
            <li> I kept trying to avoid buying another bottle, trying other remedies.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t usually need any extra.</li>
            <li> IT!n&#x27;t usually need any extra.</li>
            <li> I had tried dozens of other products before trying this one and the difference is substantial.</li>
            <li> I put it on extra thick and then apply a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Watered down.</li>
            <li> It spreads well because its half water.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> i mean that i learned after a while that my skin will only take it once or twice a week, or it will itch a little.</li>
            <li> , therefore less irritation, itch etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say that half of it was gone because of that.  </li>
            <li> I use way less than the way the describe.  </li>
            <li> and I still have about half the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Over time you need to use less of this.</li>
            <li> It also goes on easier and feels less cake-like.</li>
            <li> but this bottle I bought the treatment feels a little watery compared to previous purchases</li>
            <li> After using it every day for a few months I am finally down to a manageable level of pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I get temporary (a few minutes)</li>
            <li> /&gt;However you need to be disciplined and apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do.</li>
            <li> Sadly once I tried to go without this for a week and acne started coming back</li>
            <li> and I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> My face is usually plenty moisturizer from my face wash</li>
            <li> It has been working for the past two yrs ..holy grail.</li>
            <li> am writing because this is not a cheap product, with the same 40 usd you can buy 4 bottles of the usual 10% benzoyl!!!!</li>
            <li> and now I hardly ever get acne.</li>
            <li> It sucks, but I&#x27;ve made peace with the fact that I have to deal with acne till who knows when.</li>
            <li> and it sucks.</li>
            <li> It took me TWO MONTHS to get a replacement, and I don&#x27;t mean a replacement bottle, I meant a replacement pump.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Without following it, my face gets to be in very sad condition.</li>
            <li> Without following it, my face gets to be in very sad condition.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously a miracle in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 24 and have had acne since I was 12-13.</li>
            <li> If I have a particularly bad area then I put extra there.  </li>
            <li> For a while I used Neutrogena&#x27;s BP treatment, but it came in a small tube and was way too expensive for what you get</li>
            <li> its a tough pill to swallow whenever you have to order these supplies, but whatre you gunna do?  </li>
            <li> In 99.99% of cas, it will make ur face worse at the start.</li>
            <li> This is where I was addicted.</li>
            <li> and it got worse.</li>
            <li> My acne is so much worse</li>
            <li> I hate for the fact that it&#x27;s really dang expensive ! ..</li>
            <li> I had terrible cystic body acne on my chest, they were red and painful and really deep all over my chest.  </li>
            <li> As I said above, I used to suffer from terrible acne on my thighs and butt.  </li>
            <li> just feels weird since it is so watery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive up front</li>
            <li> Proactive is crap if you ask me made my face worse!</li>
            <li> had bad acne for years.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> The people at acne.org have a horrible customer service team</li>
            <li> It was miserable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works as well as my usual 5-10%, though it does require a few more applications to have the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plus of this lower concentration is that it doesn&#x27;t have the tendency to dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing again as needed.</li>
            <li> anyone suffering from cystic acne should definitely give this a try. It has done wonders for my skin just use as described.The only problem I have is that I ordered a 160z and got two 8oz bottles instead.</li>
            <li> I have Oily skin and I started using this acne.org treatment for over a year ago and now I hardly ever get acne. I still do though but I keep it under control with this. I hate for the fact that it&#x27;s really dang expensive ! ..Anyway this is how i found success with it.&lt;br /&gt;Use it 5 times a week take 2 days of resting your skin with out it, to get your oil back in skin.&lt;br /&gt;(this advice goes out to those who have oily skin).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also using this Zenmed microdermabrasion scar treatment (just the clay) along with it and my skin is looking better and better each day. Also I&#x27;m drinking 4 bottles of water a day and my acne and scars are getting better. This is just a part of my OWN system i have developed in helping me get clear skin for once. The big bottle lasts me about 2-3 months which is really cool since I don&#x27;t have to worry about it running out soon. In my opinion YOU WONT FIND anything better than this online !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend you try out cucumber masks and make your own at home along with this treatment bottle !&lt;br /&gt;or buy some over the counter masks !.&lt;br /&gt;Proactive has only 1 good product I like and its the sulfur mask. I tried that along with this and it also helped big time.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has helped some people. I would buy this again just wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I use this once daily for several months now with excellent results.  I apply it to my face, chest, shoulders, and back and have seen a huge reduction in acne.  After using it every day for a few months I am finally down to a manageable level of pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is only 2.5% BP so I didn&#x27;t really have any dryness or other problems when using it.  My skin is EXTREMELY sensitive though so sometimes I get some mild burning if I put it too close to my eyes and I get temporary (a few minutes) red spots on my shoulders if I rub it in too rough.  Other than that is seems very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the product is very nice and rubs in the skin well.  I put it on extra thick and then apply a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For daily moisturizing I use this wherever I apply the treatment:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thick lotion that has not caused any acne for me and does a great job of moisturizing.  I had accutane treatment years ago and need a strong moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cause acne and this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a while when I really want to treat my skin and it is feeling very dry I use with the jojoba oil:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lasts forever and makes your skin very smooth and soft.  You can mix it with the lotion for a rich moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally clean skin!</li>
            <li> Very useful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes time to make things better. In 99.99% of cas, it will make ur face worse at the start. But, with time, ull be clean for ever.</li>
            <li> Very good product. For years I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne. Nothing worked. I&#x27;ve even tried home remedies. This really controllerd my oily skin. I&#x27;m so happy I found something that has helped me for good. Thanks to my friend that introduced me to this.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and have been battling acne since I was 10.  It has been a long, embarassing battle, and I have tried every product out there, prescription and over the counter.  I was considering Accutane until on a whim I tried the Acne.org Treatment that came as a sample when I ordered the amazing Acne.org cleanser.  I followed the regimen and the results were incredible: Within two weeks, my skin was completely clear!  I have used countless other brands of benzoyl peroxide, from Neutrogena to Paula&#x27;s Choice to Proactiv and nothing worked as well as Acne.org.  It has no fragrance whatsoever (to the reviewer who said it smelled of Cinnamon: the old formula of the Acne.org moisturizer did have that kind of fragrance.  The treatment does not.) and it is a gentle gel/lotion formula that leaves no shine or residue.  Makeup glides over it with no problem; I have used it under powder, loose mineral, liquid, and cream-to-powder foundations and the results were beautiful each and every time.  It does not dry out my skin like other BP formulations did, and I love the large, pump bottle.  Best of all, my skin is clear and calm; other BP&#x27;s left me red, peely and miserable.  I will definitely repurchase this when I run out!  Thanks, Dan!</li>
            <li> My face is definitely clearer now that I am using the Acne.org treatment, I can use as much as I need without drying out my face and having the large bottle is very convenient.</li>
            <li> 1. So overpriced. Buy the cheaper stuff, these people are middle men and we&#x27;re the ones paying for it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Watered down. It spreads well because its half water.&lt;br /&gt;3. The people at acne.org have a horrible customer service team&lt;br /&gt;4. The pump is flimsy and easily breaks. It took me TWO MONTHS to get a replacement, and I don&#x27;t mean a replacement bottle, I meant a replacement pump.&lt;br /&gt;5. Been using the clarol product for a week. MUCH better results. Will update in a month.</li>
            <li> This is the best value container of benzoyl peroxide 2.5% I can find. The formulation is gentle on my skin and seems less drying than other versions I have tried.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 4 weeks until I just had to stop using this.  At first it worked pretty well, it dried up my skin a lot the first 2 weeks, but my skin did get used to it.  It did a good job of keeping new acne from forming, but it really didnt get rid of my existing acne (my chin).  I really had high hopes for this, but nnnoope.. not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just switched to oxy clinical about a week ago- and its working EXTREMELY well.  Im hoping for the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I still use this product every once and a while, but I still have some left.  Oxy Clincal actually did NOT work for me, go figure.  I&#x27;m still trying to find what works best for my skin..</li>
            <li> Amazing product to get rid of acne but works well in synergy (Cleanser + BP + moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem : does not clear all my blackheads after 6 month of treatment (but pimples and whiteheads OK).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m clean after 4 month of treatment.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in the right time, great packaging and all but after hours of applying it I noticed my whole face itch and flushed and my eyes become swollen. Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do.</li>
            <li> will write a book if i even start but ill just saw life changer :)</li>
            <li> I had acne all throughout high school and using the Acne.org regimen, it finally cleared. I use the BP twice a day, morning and night as the regimen recommends. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used prescription benzoyl peroxide for years and this the best stuff I&#x27;ve had.  The formulation is a very light gel which spreads easily and dries nicely.  I can see the difference in my skin using the amount recommended by the acne.org website, and I won&#x27;t worry about skimping to stretch out the bottle with the larger one (self-psychology in action).  I am using it with the AHA+ (which is replacing another glycolic acid product), and I&#x27;m so impressed with both products I&#x27;ll be switching over to use the full line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note for the make up wearers: the amount of treatment (1-2 pumps of product) does take a while to dry completely even in dry air, so I&#x27;ve started doing this first thing in the morning to ensure it&#x27;s dry before putting on make up.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the re-arranging.</li>
            <li> It WORKS! I was sceptical but its the best I&#x27;ve used and will ever use! Proactive is crap if you ask me made my face worse!</li>
            <li> I do not usually make reviews and i purchase a lot at amazon, but i had to do this one for the sake of who is buying this product. I have been using on and off the standard benzoyl 10% solution for years now, and by on and off i mean that i learned after a while that my skin will only take it once or twice a week, or it will itch a little. So i decided to try this 2.5% solution since it promises the same results with less aggression to your skin, therefore less irritation, itch etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just receivd and used this 2.5% only once yesterday and i applied only a little on my face and washed off immediately because since it is a new product for me i needed to test it. As i sit here and write this review 24 hrs after using it, i am still itching myself to death! So beware, this 2.5% itches way more than the 10%!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing because this is not a cheap product, with the same 40 usd you can buy 4 bottles of the usual 10% benzoyl!!!! And this is aa product that you cannot return, because you have to use it to test it, so please beware because after you bought it you are stuck with it like me, and it is no use to me unless i weant to itch to death!</li>
            <li> As I said above, I used to suffer from terrible acne on my thighs and butt.  Little red blotches speckling my legs between my waist and my knees.  I tried using a bunch of exfoliates and soaps but that didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect.  I went to my dermatologist and she told me to try the benzoyl peroxide wash, which you apply ad rinse off in the shower.  I tried it and there was a little effect but not enough. I would say that half of it was gone because of that.  But it doesn&#x27;t matter if you stain your shirt with 10 drops of coffee or 20 does it?  I later found proactive and tried JUST the repairing treatment, which is of the &amp;#34;leave-on&amp;#34; variety.  This is where I was addicted. In a couple weeks my legs cleared up like they hadn&#x27;t been since before I hit puberty. But the little 2-ounce bottles ran out really quickly on my big man-thighs.  I tried looking  around and only found other relatively small bottles for 5 times the price by volume as this product.  Though they had no reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a go since it essentially had the same active ingredient.  So I hope that now they have a review this helps you, the buyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I use way less than the way the describe.  I get just enough to be able to coat my thighs and butt with a slippery coat that dries in just a couple minutes.  If I have a particularly bad area then I put extra there.  Mine is almost completely gone and I still have about half the bottle.  But it must be noted again that I had already been using a 10% benzoyl peroxide wash for months.  So that could have had an effect, weakening it almost to the breaking point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I for one believe that $36 is too much money for any 16oz bottle and think that they are still somewhat ripping us off though.  Also, I have no idea what the side effects are.  This isn&#x27;t a con against the product. This is really a con to this review.  Go research that.</li>
            <li> its a nessecity but the thing is that it is pretty dan expensive...its a tough pill to swallow whenever you have to order these supplies, but whatre you gunna do?  I found another supplier that sells the same product for a couple dollars cheaper so im going with that from now on</li>
            <li> The only thing that controls my adult acne. I think I order too many bottles. Over time you need to use less of this. Will order 1 bottle to last 6 months instead of two in future.</li>
            <li> I used over 6 bottles of this because this product worked for me. Cleared my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you need to be disciplined and apply it everyday. I do it twice a day and leave it on. The amount of downtime without this product on my face probably are only 4-5hours. Yes I put this even when I go to bed. Sadly once I tried to go without this for a week and acne started coming back and I had to continue my treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to leave it on your face when you sleep you need to put a cover over your pillow because this thing bleaches everything it touches, from pillows to shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also made the mistake of not applying a moisturizer on my face because it is super drying. Now my face is produces more oil than before.</li>
            <li> I Use it daily and have done so for 4 years now. Keeps acne at bay. Only thing is if you stop using it, acne flares up again, but it does keep the cysts away when used consistently.</li>
            <li> Love this product from Acne.org. I&#x27;ve been using it for some years now and it&#x27;s definitely better than any other Benzoyl Peroxide product on the market! It lasts forever too!</li>
            <li> So I used this religiously hoping to get rid of my acne and it got worse. I might have a cystic acne bump about once a year and with this I had about 15 on my face almost constantly. I started to exfoliate which is against the instructions, and my skin has gotten better. My acne is so much worse that when I started. My skin is no longer soft but it feels rubbery. The first month it was super flakey, the second it was red and raw, and now I feel I have spent my life&#x27;s savings on yet another gimmick.</li>
            <li> Usually I buy this stuff directly from the website but since I was already on amazon decided to buy it here. I love this stuff instantly  gets rid of acne but this bottle I bought the treatment feels a little watery compared to previous purchases dont know if they changed up their formula granted it still works just feels weird since it is so watery.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it clears the spot s on my face but it send ing out some red bumps on my face I really  want these to come off.</li>
            <li> Have been using for the last year or so and usually it keeps my skin almost perfectly clear but I sometimes go through phases of it not working at all and I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve learned from gossmakeup artist (youtube) and acne.org that a low dose  film of benzoyl peroxide applied daily is the key to keeping skin disinfected during the day.  this coupled with the aha+ at night are a very powerful regimen for clearing and controlling acne. maybe this won&#x27;t work for everybody, but for me it replaces the med spa dermatologist Rx for retin a microgel and obagi c serum each coming in at just under $100 for me.</li>
            <li> There is no cure for acne, you just gotta control it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 2.5% benzoyl peroxide works great. You gotta wash your face, let it dry for 5-10 mins , apply bp , let it dry for 10-15 mins and then apply the moisturizer. I do recommend you buy the Acne.org moisturizer, it&#x27;s cheap and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this at night and clyndamacin in the morning, not cuz the clyndamacin is &amp;#34;required&amp;#34; but i do it this way cuz i get it for free from my insurance, it works as good as the bp and it helps me save time in the morning when I&#x27;m short in time and I can&#x27;t afford to wait for the bp to dry. ( i use the clyndamacin the same way I use the bp, WASH FACE-LET DRY-APPLY CLYNDAMACIN-LET DRY(DRIES IN SECONDS)-THEN APPLY SUNSCREEN OR ACNE.ORG MOISTURIZER.&lt;br /&gt;I use the sunscreen recommended by Dan on acne.org, not the acne.org brand though. He came out with it last year and I had already bought a bottle of sunscreen/moisturizer that he recommends .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using natural products, the caveman regimen, everything you can think of . The only thing that WORKS is a regimen like the Acne.org regimen.It sucks, but I&#x27;ve made peace with the fact that I have to deal with acne till who knows when. However with this regimen, I&#x27;m always 98% clear and I can eat pretty much whatever I want within reason ( there are certain foods that break me out like bacon and cheese, I have cheese every now and then cuz I love cheese, I just watch how much I have and bacon I&#x27;m not really into pork, so I just avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck , I&#x27;m telling you I know what&#x27;s like dealing with acne, I&#x27;ve had cystic acne and it sucks. I still get them every now and then if I eat too much fat, I just go to the dermatologists get some cortisone shots and in 24 hours is gone. But this benzoyl peroxide is cheap, it works and it will help you control your acne.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  You have to be consistent and use a lot.  I had terrible cystic body acne on my chest, they were red and painful and really deep all over my chest.  I have tried Salicylic acid products but they don&#x27;t go deep enough to treat.  So I decided to give this a try.  Twice a day, use about 3 pumps to cover the center area of my chest and wait and let it dry completely.  This took about 3 bottles(3 months) to completely get rid of all the acne on my chest.  Occasionally my skin will get flaky and dry and itchy I will use a salicylic acid toner first to wipe and exfoliate the dead skins off, apply  this lotion let it dry and then apply a moisturizer.  Shipping is more expensive and takes a while, but I found a cheaper alternative on amazon just search 2.5% Benzoyle Peroxide it comes in a 16 oz bottle just like this one and is cheaper.  I found it works just as well, it leaves a white film when the lotion dries unlike Acne.org lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me, I apply a moisturizer over it and it is gone.  Over all this is the only thing that helped with my body acne.  The key is use A LOT, twice a day, and make sure it dries before you put on your clothes and you will see results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this treatment since 2009, and it has changed my life for the better. For a while I used Neutrogena&#x27;s BP treatment, but it came in a small tube and was way too expensive for what you get (it also stained so many of my shirts!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne issues and you&#x27;re hesitant to try this stuff out, go to acne.org. There are wonderful people on there who are incredibly helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I had bad acne for years. I wouldn&#x27;t want to go out in public, and I would even cancel plans because of the way my face looked. It was miserable. When you first start using a topical treatment, it&#x27;s going to make your face flake, and turn red. It took me around 1.5-2 weeks before everything looked normal. But after that, I never looked back. Enduring the discomfort in that short time frame has enabled me to confidently show my mug to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS This container is great, as it has a locking top. So whenever I travel, I turn the top and wrap a little plastic around the pump to make sure no leakage could happen. Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Acne.org system for about a year and have had good results.  The price for this product is the same on Amazon as it is on Acne.org.  If you are a user of Neutrogena On-the-Spot BP cream, this is a much better buy for the same % of BP.  It also goes on easier and feels less cake-like.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously a miracle in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 24 and have had acne since I was 12-13. Mine is hormonal, the cystic kind that is deep and painful and highly noticeable and leaves scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this a few years ago and followed the 3step regimen perfectly at first. For the first time, my face cleared up really well. Eventually I got lazy and was only using this part of the 3step process. My clear face was pretty well maintained despite this. Well, I ran out of my most recent bottle and wondered if perhaps I could manage without it by now.  So I didn&#x27;t order a new bottle. Bad idea. My face absolutely went nuts. I kept trying to avoid buying another bottle, trying other remedies. I finally gave up in desperation and placed the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, my face is CLEAR. I am following a slightly different routine with the treatment and I believe it is working even better than anything I&#x27;ve done before now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I do every night before bed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Face Wash - I started making homemade face wash. It is a mixture of organic, unrefined coconut oil and baking soda. You would be amazed! This stuff leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean. I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Acne.org Treatment - I use this stuff liberally. I use 2 full pumps and put it all over my whole face. I buy it in the biggest bottle and it lasts for a really long time. It&#x27;s expensive up front but it&#x27;s well worth the money and lasts for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Moisturize - I use organic, unrefined coconut oil as needed. My face tends to get plenty of moisture just from the coconut oil that is already in my face wash do I use this only if my face seems dry to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Face Wash - I use my homemade face wash while showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Makeup - I don&#x27;t use treatment in the mornings as it just doesn&#x27;t seem needed. My face is very clear just using nightly. My face is usually plenty moisturizer from my face wash so I don&#x27;t usually need any extra. The exceptions are it I am sunburned or my face just seems extra dry. In such cases I may use just a tad of coconut oil (sparingly) before applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process is what works for me. Without following it, my face gets to be in very sad condition. But after a couple months back using this treatment, my face is so clear. My husband has even commented a couple times about how good it&#x27;s looking. He says he doesn&#x27;t mind spending the money on this stuff because even HE can see that it works and he knows how much better I feel about myself when my face is clear. I&#x27;m sure he also likes looking at me and seeing a pretty complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going back and forth on whether or not to try this, take the plunge. Since my teen years I have tried everything. Proactiv, dermatologist prescribed creams, dermatologist prescribed antibiotics, every drug store acne product. Most of these products didn&#x27;t work at all and the few that did were temporary fixes that my skin became immune to and stopped working. This is truly the only product that works consistently. I will never stray from using it again as I now know that it is the key to keeping my face under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!n&#x27;t usually need any extra.

            <li> Did you change formula? No matter how much i put bp on my face it doesnt dry as much as previously. So i know my face is getting used to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time i used acne.org it was awsome. Now ehhhhh. What happened.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best BP product currently on the market. It has worked wonders for my skin. I had tried dozens of other products before trying this one and the difference is substantial. If you need to choose a BP product for any acne, mild to severe, this is the one.</li>
            <li> It has been working for the past two yrs ..holy grail.</li>
