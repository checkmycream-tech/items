            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish, when I got it</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly anyway, though!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite gold nail polishes of all time</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>After applying 2 coats to an accent nail I fell in love.</li>
            <li>I know they wanted to make sure the package didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>Love opi nail polishes.</li>
            <li>OPI makes a plethora of appealing shades.</li>
            <li>You will feel very special whenever you wear this.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous real gold color.</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful color</li>
            <li>The glitter is fairly fine and is a uniform size.</li>
            <li>There are many shades of gold out there, even developed by OPI, but this one should top the charts this spring and summer and toes begin to once again emerge from winter shoes!</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly and dries smooth.</li>
            <li>Only good as a top coat.</li>
            <li>Love that it looks like you coated your nails in real gold!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a fun color and OPI quality make this a great value.</li>
            <li>Special occasion luxury.  </li>
            <li>it becomes this gorgeous solid gold color.</li>
            <li>This color was a bold choice for me</li>
            <li>Nothing as intense as some cheaper glitter polish but a cheap of wipes won&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li>how much glittery goodness can you fit into one bottle?  </li>
            <li>but it was fresh and undiluted.</li>
            <li>The formula is amazing, the glitter is intense and densely packed, and looks fantastic in even one coat over black.</li>
            <li>This polish looks soo much prettier in person!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I only used it twice, but I got so many compliments from it.</li>
            <li>The one I bought at ULTA was so pretty</li>
            <li>The only thing is that you have to apply many coats of this polish for it to really stand out.</li>
            <li>When I recently tried this product at a salon I was amazed at the depth and complexity of the rich golden hues in this polish.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this polish!</li>
            <li>I really like to use it for a statement nail with a darker color</li>
            <li>this has the gold &amp;#34;flecks&amp;#34; in it, but doesn&#x27;t have the rough feel most &amp;#34;flaked&amp;#34; polishes have.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>SO MUCH FOR HAVING IT IN STOCK..</li>
            <li>I would say that the color is fantastic, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you are looking for gold glitter polish..</li>
            <li>and once you open your color palate to everything you&#x27;ll find out how amazing this color and any other can be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does require a little more work to remove.</li>
            <li>It does need two to three coats to be opaque, but it&#x27;s not a pain to do that because it&#x27;s not a thick polish.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, others online had the exact same problem in the same color.</li>
            <li>With the OPI quality behind this product, all I can say is that the most glamourous hue I&#x27;ve ever gotten from this company, and I have a pretty large collection of OPI nail lacquers.</li>
            <li>It lays perfectly flat and is smooth and super shiny, and it stayed on my nails for longer than 2 weeks (despite a little chipping near the tips of my nails, but that&#x27;s fairly normal considering I type a lot).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, the glitter&#x27;s not chucky, and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>It sparkles even without a clear coat added.</li>
            <li>Additionally the color is just as fresh today, several weeks later, as it was at the time of application.</li>
            <li>If you have the same problem, be sure to contact Amazon about it (even if it&#x27;s not worth it to you to return such an inexpensive product)</li>
            <li>I have tried many but it is hard to find ones with an ultimate shine.</li>
            <li>NO OTHER NAIL POLISH CAN COMPARE WITH THIS POLISH.</li>
            <li>If you look at the bottom of the bottle, it is missing the ridges that come on genuine OPI bottles, and the polish itself is simply not the same.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this polish on my toes; it goes with everything!  I had a difficult time finding this in stores.  Love Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love that this polish has varying sizes of gold flakes, making it easy to do gradients with! It lays perfectly flat and is smooth and super shiny, and it stayed on my nails for longer than 2 weeks (despite a little chipping near the tips of my nails, but that&#x27;s fairly normal considering I type a lot). I highly recommend this polish!</li>
            <li> I love this color. It looks like gold leafing. I first user Oraly Rubberized base coat. Then I put on three coats of this color. The color goes on thin, but dries really fast.  I finish it off with a perfect glazy shine using Avon&#x27;s UV Gloss Gaurd top coat. Use these products and you will love it!</li>
            <li> This polish looks soo much prettier in person! So glittery! The only thing is that you have to apply many coats of this polish for it to really stand out. I would recommend this polish to anyone who loves glitter :)</li>
            <li> I love gold nail polish. I have tried many but it is hard to find ones with an ultimate shine. This one does not disappoint! It sparkles even without a clear coat added. It does not chip off like most glitter polish either!&lt;br /&gt;It does require a little more work to remove. Nothing as intense as some cheaper glitter polish but a cheap of wipes won&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> Great nail polish, great quality, I don&#x27;t have anything else to say about it, . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I have found the OPI brand is the best polish for me.&lt;br /&gt;The Goldeneye is part of the  Skyfall collection and it is a nice gold tone.</li>
            <li> For it to actually look gold you needed about 4 coats and it was very thin and too yellow looking.</li>
            <li> This hands-down my favorite polish. It&#x27;s easy to apply, the glitter&#x27;s not chucky, and it last a long time. It does need two to three coats to be opaque, but it&#x27;s not a pain to do that because it&#x27;s not a thick polish. Love love love it.</li>
            <li> I adore this polish. Three coats and it becomes this gorgeous solid gold color. I really like to use it for a statement nail with a darker color</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish, when I got it I tested it on my nail and it looks so beautiful! I can&#x27;t believe this is only a limited edition nail polish! I think this should be in their permanent line. I love this, and will tell all my friends to get this color!</li>
            <li> oh my goodness...how much glittery goodness can you fit into one bottle?  this is so gorgeous, elegant, great on an accent nail just by itself...works well to accent any nail art.  Highly recommended if you are looking for gold glitter polish..</li>
            <li> This color is dazzling! Love that it looks like you coated your nails in real gold! It&#x27;s such a fun color and OPI quality make this a great value.</li>
            <li> this has the gold &amp;#34;flecks&amp;#34; in it, but doesn&#x27;t have the rough feel most &amp;#34;flaked&amp;#34; polishes have. it goes on smoothly and dries smooth. I&#x27;d advise using a topcoat after applying it just to keep it from &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; off.</li>
            <li> This is a rich gold with a reddish base. The glitter is fairly fine and is a uniform size. Two coats will get you total coverage and it has a nice luster.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. NO OTHER NAIL POLISH CAN COMPARE WITH THIS POLISH. THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING IT IN STOCK..</li>
            <li> The formula is amazing, the glitter is intense and densely packed, and looks fantastic in even one coat over black. It&#x27;s essentially a gold flaky bomb, with a slightly richer/redder tint to it, in a clear base (that basically makes no appearance, since the glitter is so dense.) Goes on smoothly anyway, though!</li>
            <li> With the OPI quality behind this product, all I can say is that the most glamourous hue I&#x27;ve ever gotten from this company, and I have a pretty large collection of OPI nail lacquers. It&#x27;s spectacular!</li>
            <li> This is a fake. As soon as I put it on I knew something was wrong, so I looked it up. Sure enough, others online had the exact same problem in the same color. If you look at the bottom of the bottle, it is missing the ridges that come on genuine OPI bottles, and the polish itself is simply not the same.    Here&#x27;s a link with side by side comparisons of the bottles and how each looks on your nail. This is obviously a fake.    [...]    P.S. If you have the same problem, be sure to contact Amazon about it (even if it&#x27;s not worth it to you to return such an inexpensive product) so they will launch an investigation and stop this seller from cheating others.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. This is one of my favorite gold nail polishes of all time so I had to order a couple backups.</li>
            <li> Special occasion luxury.  You will feel very special whenever you wear this.  Dense, beautiful color and texture.  I love it!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for a gold polish that isn&#x27;t just glitter. This is a nice metallic gold. It looks like Minx and doesn&#x27;t chip. I&#x27;ve had it on for a week now and it still hasn&#x27;t started to chip away. I love it.</li>
            <li> This color was a bold choice for me but I had to give it a try. After applying 2 coats to an accent nail I fell in love. This is such a beautiful color and once you open your color palate to everything you&#x27;ll find out how amazing this color and any other can be. Love OPI for the perfect flow and easy spread. The seller also packaged the product perfectly that it took me minute to get all the bubble wrap off. I don&#x27;t mind cause I know they wanted to make sure the package didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> This color is so beautiful and I&#x27;ve simply loved having it on! Any OPI nail polish is worth the price because it&#x27;s always an awesome color and it lasts!</li>
            <li> I only used it twice, but I got so many compliments from it. I would say that the color is fantastic, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as with all OPI products it&#x27;s easy to use and provides good coverage. It is a little hard to remove but not much so.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Love opi nail polishes. They are the best you can get for your money and have beautiful colors. long lasting</li>
            <li> Runny as heck. Only good as a top coat. The one I bought at ULTA was so pretty but it was fresh and undiluted.</li>
            <li> OPI makes a plethora of appealing shades. When I recently tried this product at a salon I was amazed at the depth and complexity of the rich golden hues in this polish. Additionally the color is just as fresh today, several weeks later, as it was at the time of application. There are many shades of gold out there, even developed by OPI, but this one should top the charts this spring and summer and toes begin to once again emerge from winter shoes! Try this color and you won&#x27;t want to return to yesterday&#x27;s shade of gold!</li>
