            <li>It is perfect and polished.</li>
            <li>The color is great!</li>
            <li>Although I had no idea when that day was going to be, this polish just was so beautiful, it automatically made me think wedding day.</li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>And as always, it&#x27;s another great product from Essie.</li>
            <li>I feel like I got a great bargain.</li>
            <li>This is the most perfect color for me.  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love this fingernail polish!  </li>
            <li>2-3 coats make your nails look nice but not coloured.</li>
            <li>It gives my nails a nice shine, but that&#x27;s all I can say for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because when it chips you can&#x27;t tell easily (ie.</li>
            <li>I love Essie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but nothing more than that.</li>
            <li>colors much better</li>
            <li>I love Essie nail polishes, but sugar daddy dissapointed me.</li>
            <li>i love this polish and will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake or chip easily.  </li>
            <li>I guess I will have to continue looking for the perfect light pink elsewhere.</li>
            <li>So I was in Walmart and saw this polish, and thought it was super cute, so I got it.</li>
            <li>I am not a polish person, I stick to the basics, but this is a great polish if you still want to keep it nice, professional, classy and beautiful all at the same time!!!</li>
            <li>It would be great for a French Manicure.  </li>
            <li>If you like sheer colors, great.</li>
            <li>They are light and you need bout 2 or 3 coats.</li>
            <li>and now I have colorful nails!</li>
            <li>I would have liked something more creamy pink that was more visible.</li>
            <li>It is a clean, polished look.  </li>
            <li>Another great color pink by Essie</li>
            <li>but I really wanted to get a neutral that is more versatile, so I picked up Sugar Daddy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>lol Dries quick as can be,  just as any other Essie product!♥</li>
            <li>But the colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth having in your collection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying once</li>
            <li>I love it because is natural look not so out there with too much color.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a long time for a great light pink nail polish that goes on opaque after one or two coats.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>compared to more obvious colours).</li>
            <li>Since it is light in color, I have no trouble with getting any on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is also the first time I have ever bought essie.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>(fast shipping too!)</li>
            <li>It is the perfect shade of everyday pink</li>
            <li>I love this brand so much that I bought different colors</li>
            <li>I got a french manicure (which I always do) but this particular salon used this color as a top coat.</li>
            <li>Until recently I had only used more unique colors (blues, greens, purples)</li>
            <li>and it really lasts and is easier to remove.  </li>
            <li>I really like an Essie product.</li>
            <li>I ended up using it as the base for a French manicure and it&#x27;s stunning - the perfect color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a light pink color.</li>
            <li>I love this color and I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>Very sheer unless you do two-three coats and still it&#x27;s a very pale girly oink super cute for summer and springtime dresses</li>
            <li>I only wore clear polish for that reason, but this really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was much softer than I expected, and 2 coats wasn&#x27;t very opaque.</li>
            <li>But I may as well bought clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes really well with Essie Marshmallow for french manicure.</li>
            <li>I use this on my natural nails &amp; my acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>The issue I have with this polish is on my end, I have darker nails and the color comes out an opac pink, didn&#x27;t feel it was worth it to retun, I will be giving it to someone else</li>
            <li>Essie has been my favorite brand for a few months now because the polishes last so long without chipping and make your nails very durable while they&#x27;re painted.</li>
            <li>This color is very light on my nails (I am very pale and my nails are short).  </li>
            <li>(By the way, all of Essie&#x27;s other nail colors I adore, but if you do get a lighter one just be aware of how clear they look.)</li>
            <li>My nails are already naturally pretty pink, if that makes any difference.</li>
            <li>The product shipped quickly and the price is hard to beat for brand new Essie nailnail polish.</li>
            <li>Really like essies pink polishes.</li>
            <li>But I guess it&#x27;s ok if you want something subtle..!</li>
            <li>The color is simply fantastic (subtle).  </li>
            <li>it give a VERY NATURAL looking shade of pink.</li>
            <li>When I apply sugar daddy it almost looks clear, and after a few coats it starts to increase in the light pink color to get a sort of watered down pepto bismol color.</li>
            <li>The color was like just a clear polish with a pink tint that only showed up after painting 3 coats.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy another essie polish in pink again.</li>

            <li> I put on two coats, without a base or a top coat</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not too mute to go unnoticed but not too pink to attract attention.</li>
            <li> You have to apply at least 3 times to even get the pink tint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just upset I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> I have been fond of this color and have a hard time getting it in my area.  </li>
            <li> But this made it a very weird pink, so I am sticking to 2</li>
            <li> But for me, this color is a bit boring.</li>

            <li> This color is very light on my nails (I am very pale and my nails are short).  It would be great for a French Manicure.  I put on two coats, without a base or a top coat and it really lasts and is easier to remove.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> I placed this order on June 20th and my Sister received it on June 23rd with REGULAR USPS SHIPPING!  The shipping cost was REALLY LOW, like a dollar or something.  I wanted my Sister to have this nail polish color for her French Manicures and Pedicures and her birthday is today - June 27th.  I did not think that it would arrive in time, but it arrived BEFORE!  Thank you! ;)</li>
            <li> I love Essie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a server and my manicure constantly gets chipped. I only wore clear polish for that reason, but this really works! LAST for a long time and it shines~  I love this brand so much that I bought different colors and now I have colorful nails! love it!</li>
            <li> Another great color pink by Essie, Im thinking I may have all the shades of pink that are possible by them! lol Dries quick as can be,  just as any other Essie product!♥</li>
            <li> The color is simply fantastic (subtle).  It&#x27;s well worth having in your collection.  And as always, it&#x27;s another great product from Essie.</li>
            <li> This colour is very sheer, it requires about 4 coats to notice it. 2-3 coats make your nails look nice but not coloured. It&#x27;s nice because when it chips you can&#x27;t tell easily (ie. compared to more obvious colours).</li>
            <li> This is the most perfect color for me.  It is a clean, polished look.  Since it is light in color, I have no trouble with getting any on my skin.  In addition it does not look streaky like some of the whiter polishes.</li>
            <li> Essie has been my favorite brand for a few months now because the polishes last so long without chipping and make your nails very durable while they&#x27;re painted. Until recently I had only used more unique colors (blues, greens, purples) but I really wanted to get a neutral that is more versatile, so I picked up Sugar Daddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was much softer than I expected, and 2 coats wasn&#x27;t very opaque. The color is definitely there and it covers evenly, it was just that I could still see where my nail separated from my finger which I don&#x27;t personally like. I ended up using it as the base for a French manicure and it&#x27;s stunning - the perfect color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a soft opaque pink then you may want to try another - because even after 4 coats you can still see through to where the nail lifts from the finger.</li>
            <li> If you like sheer colors, great. But for me, this color is a bit boring. You have to apply at least 3 times to even get the pink tint. It&#x27;s worth trying once but nothing more than that.</li>
            <li> Love this fingernail polish!  No need to say anymore.  It doesn&#x27;t flake or chip easily.  It&#x27;s just like going to your manicurist.</li>
            <li> The issue I have with this polish is on my end, I have darker nails and the color comes out an opac pink, didn&#x27;t feel it was worth it to retun, I will be giving it to someone else</li>
            <li> I visited NY City a couple of years ago and while I was there I went to get my nails done. I got a french manicure (which I always do) but this particular salon used this color as a top coat. I looooooved my nails with this color. I said to myself \\&quot;this is the polish I am going to where on my wedding day.\\&quot; Although I had no idea when that day was going to be, this polish just was so beautiful, it automatically made me think wedding day. I am not a polish person, I stick to the basics, but this is a great polish if you still want to keep it nice, professional, classy and beautiful all at the same time!!!</li>
            <li> I love this color and I wear it everyday. It is the perfect shade of everyday pink that&#x27;s not too mute to go unnoticed but not too pink to attract attention. It is perfect and polished. My go to color for an at home mani.</li>
            <li> I have a dark completion and was worried about this making my nails look too &amp;#34;clammy&amp;#34;. I am a big Essie fan so I wanted to give this a try. While I like there others colors much better this held up to the Essie commitment.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly and the price is hard to beat for brand new Essie nailnail polish. The color is great! I feel like I got a great bargain.</li>
            <li> I love Essie nail polishes, but sugar daddy dissapointed me. I have been searching for a long time for a great light pink nail polish that goes on opaque after one or two coats. I cannot seem to get sugar daddy to get to an opaque look, even after three or four coats. When I apply sugar daddy it almost looks clear, and after a few coats it starts to increase in the light pink color to get a sort of watered down pepto bismol color. I guess I will have to continue looking for the perfect light pink elsewhere. (By the way, all of Essie&#x27;s other nail colors I adore, but if you do get a lighter one just be aware of how clear they look.)</li>
            <li> Very sheer unless you do two-three coats and still it&#x27;s a very pale girly oink super cute for summer and springtime dresses</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother- I am a fan of Essie polishes and wanted her to try it. I ordered this product on a Friday morning, and my mother received it on Saturday! (LA area)</li>
            <li> The color was like just a clear polish with a pink tint that only showed up after painting 3 coats. I would have liked something more creamy pink that was more visible. But I guess it&#x27;s ok if you want something subtle..!</li>
            <li> I love it because is natural look not so out there with too much color.So i will recomended to others to use it.</li>
            <li> So I was in Walmart and saw this polish, and thought it was super cute, so I got it. This is also the first time I have ever bought essie. Well I just put it on and my nails don&#x27;t look different at all. My nails are already naturally pretty pink, if that makes any difference. But I may as well bought clear. It gives my nails a nice shine, but that&#x27;s all I can say for it. I&#x27;m just upset I wasted money on this. Not worth it in my opinion. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever buy another essie polish in pink again. Also I bought the \\&quot;mint candy apple\\&quot; polish they have, so hopefully that can make me understand all the essie hype.</li>
            <li> This is a light pink color. 2 coats are sufficient for french manicure. As the polish is translucent, the pink color would not be visible unless you apply about 3 coats. But this made it a very weird pink, so I am sticking to 2 coats.&lt;br /&gt;It goes really well with Essie Marshmallow for french manicure.</li>
            <li> i love this polish and will be buying more soon. I use this on my natural nails &amp; my acrylic nails. it give a VERY NATURAL looking shade of pink. I&#x27;m in love. Thanks! (fast shipping too!)</li>
            <li> I have been fond of this color and have a hard time getting it in my area.  I really like an Essie product.</li>
            <li> Really like essies pink polishes. They are light and you need bout 2 or 3 coats. But the colors are very pretty.</li>
