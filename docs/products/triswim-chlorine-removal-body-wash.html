            <li>and I have to say, \\&quot;What a great product!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Working great.</li>
            <li>It is great for after a swim, but also works well for home use with overly chlorinated tap water.</li>
            <li>Great for getting chlorine off skin.</li>

            <li>Works as is stated and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>This does a great job removing the chlorine from my skin.</li>
            <li>Since I started using Triswim, I haven&#x27;t experienced any post-swim chlorine-related skin irritation, so that&#x27;s important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t tested on animals and has great ingredients.</li>
            <li>This has helped that problem greatly, along with the lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells great and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The wash works great</li>
            <li>Worthwhile purchase!!</li>
            <li>They do a very effective job of neutralizing the chlorine smell and itch.  </li>
            <li>It also works very effectively for salt water too.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Good body wash</li>
            <li>Would be good for men and women.  </li>
            <li>works well, smells good,</li>
            <li>The lather is good, but not luxurious.</li>
            <li>It helps get all the chemicals off your skin and leaves you smelling good.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>Very glad I did since skin can still smell like chlorine even after you shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, smells good, etc.</li>
            <li>Feels good, smells nice, lathers well.</li>
            <li>It does smell very good, a sweet lemon scent.</li>
            <li>Swimmer&#x27;s Body Wash.  I have found the Triswim to be the most effective!  </li>
            <li>love this to get rid of the pool smell!</li>
            <li>We will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>We love using this product!</li>
            <li>Great scent, and easily removes chlorine without over drying.</li>
            <li>Amazing, inexpensive and effective product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not as good as we&#x27;d hoped, but okay.</li>
            <li>The body wash smelled nice but did not stop the rash problem.  </li>
            <li>Effective in removing chlorine and moisturizing skin.</li>
            <li>It works really well and travels in my gear bag perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, cleans chlorine off.</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely and doesn&#x27;t require lots of the Wash product to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li>I have found that I get the best results if I put a healthy amount in a luffa and really suds it up and scrub well.</li>
            <li>Have used it for just one week, but very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>so mucH.  Great product and skin feels ever so great; I do the pool for physical therapy almost every day.  </li>
            <li>It does get rid of the chlorine odor, it&#x27;s gentle on the skin, and I find it&#x27;s very mild, citrusy scent very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It had amazing lathering properties without using a lot of the product, easy to use open/close top.</li>
            <li>Wish they would up the vitamin C content to increase this effect even more.</li>
            <li>I love this to get the chlorine smell off my skin after swimming in a pool.</li>
            <li>The top of the container leaked.</li>
            <li>It would be better if it were in gel form.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something that would do a better job of getting rid of the chlorine odor.</li>
            <li>to make it more efficient.</li>
            <li>My skin is a lot better since I have been using this as opposed to what my pool offered.  </li>
            <li>The itch from chlorine kept me awake most of the time.</li>
            <li>If you swim more than twice a week - you need this.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It does get most of the chlorine smell off.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash</li>
            <li>For the price, the cap should have a more sturdy design.</li>
            <li>This body wash does an okay job of getting rid of the chlorine</li>
            <li>but there may be something better out there.</li>
            <li>get more of those two items than the conditioner and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE it</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great body wash.</li>
            <li>Nothing seems to be able to wash away the smell that lingers on the body after swimming, including this body wash (and I bought 2 bottles - 1 for home and 1 to take to swim).</li>
            <li>many nights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the better my skin would be.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if I used more of this product per after-swim-shower, it would do an even better job.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>Better than Avon Skin</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this body wash.  </li>
            <li>It reduces the smell on the skin by about 60% - which is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Every swimmer must have this and the proce is right, takes the smell and damage to the skin away good</li>
            <li>smell of the body wash, not the greatest, but i will use other soap which does the job for scent, but this one provides effective wash for the chloro.</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to try this product</li>
            <li>Excellent for after long pool time.</li>
            <li>This body wash is very effective at killing the chlorine smell in high chlorine water.</li>
            <li>It smells of citrus and reminds me of orange-pineapple juice, a clean scent which is suitable for men or women.</li>
            <li>and I can tell that my skin feels much more chlorine free after using it.</li>
            <li>But I am using just a handful for my whole body and hair and it still does a good job.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris</li>
            <li>The body wash seems fine.  </li>
            <li>Has nice gentle citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is important to use this product,because chlorine,etc can damage kidneys &amp; blood vessels</li>
            <li>This body wash works really well and has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>Not as great at the shampoo by same company.</li>
            <li>But what&#x27;s the point when the packaging is so cheap</li>
            <li>Yep, it washes the chlorine smell away, and has a light citrus-pine smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, immediately after my husband used it, he experienced moderate itching and skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li>Now, that smell is significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>found as combination of TRISWIM and &amp;#34;SwimSpray Chlorine Removal Spray - 4 oz&amp;#34; is almost give me a 100% clean from smell.</li>
            <li>It leaves her skin clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>The pool at our gym has a lot of chlorine and this does the job and makes me feel clean again.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and the transaction quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>did an online search for a swimmer&#x27;s body wash to clean the chlorine from body in my post-swim shower.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it is the liquid pours out easily thus using more than intended and using more to spread.  </li>
            <li>After using Triswim body wash, he was able to sleep through whole night without scratching around.</li>
            <li>We make sure to use this everytime our child finishes the swim class and works very well.</li>
            <li>It smells good, my skin doesn&#x27;t smell like chlorine, but my hair and facial hair still have a chlorinated smell.</li>
            <li>like it very much, good skin after swimming n recommended to friend, he is quite like it same as me.</li>
            <li>TRISWIM Body wash is an overall good product.  </li>
            <li>It is better to transfer liquid gel into a smaller container because original tube top not stable</li>
            <li>I expect to run out of it rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells great and not too much fragrance just enough.  </li>
            <li>We were hoping for ultra, super hydration as swimming is turning my son into an alligator.</li>
            <li>The bottle goes by quickly though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, the body wash smells good (no fruitiness or overpowering scent) and it gets rid of the chlorine smell that tends to linger on your body after a long swim.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise great product to get the chlorine smell off and also to slightly hydrate skin</li>
            <li>It should have same nice citrus scent like the rest of the products.</li>
            <li>I love to swim laps but recently developed an allergy to chlorine.  </li>
            <li>I recently started water aerobics classes several times weekly and despite showering with a good soap or body wash, I just wasn&#x27;t able to get rid of the chlorine smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Well, either this stuff is some sort of magical anti-chlorine elixir, or my body chemistry has somehow completely changed and tolerates chlorine.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and seems to work only marginally better than regular shower gel or soap.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the way</li>
            <li>it worth the money.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh smell and removed all traces of the chlorine scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than it was before, and perhaps I need to apply the wash more &amp;#34;generously,&amp;#34; but I was hoping that there would be less visible dryness.  </li>
            <li>This product is truely a god send...it got the smell of the pool right off of my skin and also left it nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>and it just pours the soap out super fast.  </li>
            <li>It did nothing more then regular soap can.  </li>
            <li>Great product to get off the chlorine, or at least to mute the odor.</li>
            <li>Works wonders especially one of the pools I swim at has SO many chemicals I used to come out</li>
            <li>Definitely better than a regular soap.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it does remove the chlorine, but who knows, can&#x27;t really measure it!</li>
            <li>my regular soap gets it out of my hair better than this.</li>
            <li>If you used it in liquid state it would run out pretty soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>I have better results scrubbing with regular soap and wash rag.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well, certainly better than just using regular soap.</li>
            <li>I had ZERO side effects after being in a pool for ~8 days, most of those days for several hours at a time.  </li>
            <li>This product does a much better job than regular soap but does not completly remove the chlorine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more soon, definitely!</li>
            <li>This body wash has proven to be exactly what I had hoped it would do.  </li>
            <li>For me, the TRISWIM Body Wash does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>After using it, I detect no lingering odor of chlorine on my skin, and it leaves a crisp citrus</li>
            <li>said, it has a nice citrus smell, and mild amount of sudz which go down the drain easy at our local LA</li>
            <li>Great stuff, but realized the price was way too high after I saw the same item in a local store.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t really tell that it does much better than regular soap or body wash for removing chlorine.</li>
            <li>Great smell, soaps up nicely, do not need to use much.  </li>
            <li>I guess treating one chemical with another isn&#x27;t that great for your skin, because my skin is even drier now than when I was using plain old Dove moisturizing body wash.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for its ability to remove chlorine and since I started using it, I am much less itchy but the top does not close properly so I am forced to keep the bottle in its own plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Just like several other reviewers, I was happy with the product, but not the packaging.</li>
            <li>I fill a smaller travel bottle that&#x27;s easy to take in the shower with shampoo and conditioner, so I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the cap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-1 star because the nozzle on the tube is to large</li>
            <li>The only criticism I have is that the body wash is very runny, so it pours out of the bottle very quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference from what I buy at the store, but it seems fine.</li>
            <li>This body wash really gets the chlorine off your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try and reduce how much the pool is drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Well, my daughter still feels itchy even after using it, also, it is not really soothing, it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I swim 2-3 times a week for 30-45 minutes and this works really well for removing the smell of chlorine.</li>
            <li>Great product, non irritating, would buy again.</li>
            <li>She tried all kinds of soaps and lotions nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>It really does rinse away the chlorine odor.</li>
            <li>if you use it at the gym showers otherwise it will get used up too fast.  </li>
            <li>so am not swimming much.</li>
            <li>I really like the product but have ordered it twice, and both times the plastic container cracked and leaked</li>
            <li>Body Wash accomplished the removal of chlorine after Hydrotherapy Sessions.</li>
            <li>It really takes the chlorine from your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin no longer feels ichy from the chlorine, though it doesn&#x27;t have much lather.</li>
            <li>This body wash really has the effect.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually it looks like it will end up fast</li>
            <li>It has a fresh citrus smell that is neither masculine nor feminine.  </li>
            <li>The price of this product is reasonable, the package sizing is reasonable to carry to the pool</li>
            <li>The manufacturer really needs to replace the packaging on this item.  </li>
            <li>Not really too sure what to write about this product without sounding homosexual.</li>
            <li>I still smelled liked chlorine, waste of money</li>
            <li>the chlorine smell wasn&#x27;t completely gone after using it, but it&#x27;s better than regular body wash.</li>
            <li>Right after my swim, I always feel a scent of chloro, no matter how many times or how heavy</li>
            <li>I swing often and this is my regular &amp;#34;soap.&amp;#34; Gets rid of that chlorine smell and, besides, makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li>This body wash left me clean and not itchy after swimming in chlorine.  </li>
            <li>the problem was back full force.  </li>
            <li>I feel that I have to use a bit more than a traditional body wash to get the desire results, but traditional wash hasn&#x27;t really helped remove all the chlorine, so we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>Kind of a small amount for the price, I used about 1/8 for 1 use.</li>
            <li>It lathers on pretty easily, and you don&#x27;t need to use half the bottle to cover yourself.  </li>
            <li>But I really wish the manufacturers had thought this through a little better.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job at hiding the smell of chlorine.  </li>
            <li>Mainly though, this soap delivers on its promise.  </li>
            <li>This product is not expensive, has a delicate sort of citrus fragrance suitable for any gender, and works like a charm, meeting all my requirements.  </li>
            <li>The main con I find with it is that it is too watery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced I wouldn&#x27;t get the same results from a cheaper drugstore option of mild soap with aloe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using this definitely works MUCH better than regular shampoos or soaps for removing chlorine smell from my body after swimming.</li>
            <li>The price is a little more than I would normally pay for body wash, but since it works, I cannot complain too much</li>
            <li>product has a couple of downsides - one is that you have to check each time you use it to make sure the lid is screwed on tight, because it tends to loosen over time and the gel can ooze out.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly, far more than any other body wash for swimmers.</li>
            <li>After a normal 90 minute swim session, I used this and found that it did almost nothing to remove the chlorine smell from my skin.</li>
            <li>It does remove the pool stink better than regular soap (not completely though).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep it in a plastic zip back to be safe, but, so far, this hasn&#x27;t been necessary.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t as itchy as normal but still itchy.</li>
            <li>The current tube is a little too cumbersome to take in my gym bag, but it can easily be redistributed into small travel containers available at most drug stores.</li>
            <li>It suds up really well and has a strong citrus fragrance while using it, but that instantly goes away after you rinse and dry off.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin softer than the other brands, stops the itching, and has a light scent.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance of the soap is subtle and nice.</li>
            <li>Disappointed at best.</li>
            <li>Which is the more of a negative given the price of the product compared to &#x27;normal&#x27; shower gel.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather that much and is a little more runny than a typical shower gel, so I mixed it in with my regular one when I showered and it was fine.</li>
            <li>I am actually considering buying the large gallon size since I use this two to three times a week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ideally I would like to find a smaller &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size or large bulk container option.</li>
            <li>It is a tad runny for my liking, but that&#x27;s really the only drawback.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking this product.</li>
            <li>This product works and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product and have repurchased it on repeat occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will order it again to see if it is only the one bottle with this problem or if the packaging really is truly defective.</li>
            <li>This is the only body wash I&#x27;ve found that really gets rid of the chlorine smell after swimming.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face is still considerably drier than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>It did not work any near as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviews that I read complained about the smell and the lathering abilitiy, but I am quite pleased with both.  </li>
            <li>So Soft.</li>
            <li>However, after just a few uses, the cap stopped closing securely and I was left with a huge mess as the product leaked.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, but I&#x27;m not really sold on how it helps your skin with excessive pool/chlorine exposure.  </li>
            <li>I swim in a pool nearly every day,have very sensitive skin and live in a high desert environment that is almost always less than 10% humidity.  </li>
            <li>I tried all kinds of body wash, including brand names, but this is so far THE body wash for swimmers - no smell of the chlorine any more, and no more dry skin.</li>
            <li>It used to be very itchy and dry after getting out of the pool, and this seems to have taken care of the problem.</li>
            <li>Not only did the body wash get rid of any residue from the pool, but it completely erased the dreaded &amp;#34;pool&amp;#34; smell!  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was able to keep it from making a mess in my gym bag after the lid failed.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it really made any difference or not because the pool I worked at this summer had so much chlorine that nothing washed the smell out.</li>
            <li>I swim a lot and have sensitive skin that itches constantly after swimming in chlorine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, using the body wash won&#x27;t necessarily make your skin soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>My 5 year old son no longer complains that his back itches, and he hasn&#x27;t had a scab appear since we started using both products.</li>
            <li>Triswim body wash doesn&#x27;t neutralize as well as I&#x27;d hoped, and it has its own weird chemical smell that&#x27;s not quite covered up by the citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of expensive for a soap.  </li>
            <li>Some of the other bodywashes I&#x27;ve tried really didn&#x27;t get the smell off.</li>
            <li>It is worth a little extra money to get the Triswim.</li>
            <li>I think it only does an OK job, not great.</li>
            <li>Washing with this after swimming &#x3D; no dry itchy skin from the chlorine.</li>
            <li>Although the chorine smell is faint on my skin after I shower with it, it&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li>pretty well - leaves me a bit less itchy and chloriny than my regular moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li>Not sure if its worth the expense.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Triswim lotion after my water aerobics class and it has completely cured my dry itchy skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I have to say, \\&quot;What a great product!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Working great.</li>

            <li> Great for getting chlorine off skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great after getting out of a pool.</li>

            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> This does a great job removing the chlorine from my skin.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Triswim, I haven&#x27;t experienced any post-swim chlorine-related skin irritation, so that&#x27;s important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t tested on animals and has great ingredients.</li>
            <li> This has helped that problem greatly, along with the lotion.</li>

            <li> Worthwhile purchase!!</li>
            <li> They do a very effective job of neutralizing the chlorine smell and itch.  </li>
            <li> It also works very effectively for salt water too.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Good body wash</li>
            <li> Would be good for men and women.  </li>
            <li> works well, smells good,</li>
            <li> The lather is good, but not luxurious.</li>
            <li> It helps get all the chemicals off your skin and leaves you smelling good.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> Very glad I did since skin can still smell like chlorine even after you shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, smells good, etc.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells nice, lathers well.</li>
            <li> It does smell very good, a sweet lemon scent.</li>
            <li> Swimmer&#x27;s Body Wash.  I have found the Triswim to be the most effective!  </li>
            <li> love this to get rid of the pool smell!</li>
            <li> We will be ordering more!</li>

            <li> Great scent, and easily removes chlorine without over drying.</li>
            <li> Amazing, inexpensive and effective product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not as good as we&#x27;d hoped, but okay.</li>
            <li> The body wash smelled nice but did not stop the rash problem.  </li>
            <li> Effective in removing chlorine and moisturizing skin.</li>
            <li> It works really well and travels in my gear bag perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell, cleans chlorine off.</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely and doesn&#x27;t require lots of the Wash product to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> I have found that I get the best results if I put a healthy amount in a luffa and really suds it up and scrub well.</li>
            <li> Have used it for just one week, but very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> so mucH.  Great product and skin feels ever so great; I do the pool for physical therapy almost every day.  </li>
            <li> It does get rid of the chlorine odor, it&#x27;s gentle on the skin, and I find it&#x27;s very mild, citrusy scent very pleasant.</li>
            <li> It had amazing lathering properties without using a lot of the product, easy to use open/close top.</li>
            <li> Wish they would up the vitamin C content to increase this effect even more.</li>
            <li> I love this to get the chlorine smell off my skin after swimming in a pool.</li>
            <li> The top of the container leaked.</li>
            <li> It would be better if it were in gel form.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something that would do a better job of getting rid of the chlorine odor.</li>
            <li> to make it more efficient.</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot better since I have been using this as opposed to what my pool offered.  </li>
            <li> The itch from chlorine kept me awake most of the time.</li>
            <li> If you swim more than twice a week - you need this.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It does get most of the chlorine smell off.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash</li>
            <li> For the price, the cap should have a more sturdy design.</li>
            <li> This body wash does an okay job of getting rid of the chlorine</li>
            <li> but there may be something better out there.</li>
            <li> get more of those two items than the conditioner and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE it</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great body wash.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to be able to wash away the smell that lingers on the body after swimming, including this body wash (and I bought 2 bottles - 1 for home and 1 to take to swim).</li>
            <li> many nights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the better my skin would be.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if I used more of this product per after-swim-shower, it would do an even better job.</li>
            <li> This product is ok.</li>
            <li> Better than Avon Skin</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this body wash.  </li>
            <li> It reduces the smell on the skin by about 60% - which is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Every swimmer must have this and the proce is right, takes the smell and damage to the skin away good</li>
            <li> smell of the body wash, not the greatest, but i will use other soap which does the job for scent, but this one provides effective wash for the chloro.</li>
            <li> and I was very excited to try this product</li>
            <li> Excellent for after long pool time.</li>
            <li> This body wash is very effective at killing the chlorine smell in high chlorine water.</li>
            <li> It smells of citrus and reminds me of orange-pineapple juice, a clean scent which is suitable for men or women.</li>
            <li> and I can tell that my skin feels much more chlorine free after using it.</li>
            <li> But I am using just a handful for my whole body and hair and it still does a good job.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris</li>
            <li> The body wash seems fine.  </li>
            <li> Has nice gentle citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is important to use this product,because chlorine,etc can damage kidneys &amp; blood vessels</li>
            <li> This body wash works really well and has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> Not as great at the shampoo by same company.</li>
            <li> But what&#x27;s the point when the packaging is so cheap</li>
            <li> Yep, it washes the chlorine smell away, and has a light citrus-pine smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, immediately after my husband used it, he experienced moderate itching and skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff, definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Now, that smell is significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> found as combination of TRISWIM and &amp;#34;SwimSpray Chlorine Removal Spray - 4 oz&amp;#34; is almost give me a 100% clean from smell.</li>
            <li> It leaves her skin clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> The pool at our gym has a lot of chlorine and this does the job and makes me feel clean again.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and the transaction quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> did an online search for a swimmer&#x27;s body wash to clean the chlorine from body in my post-swim shower.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is the liquid pours out easily thus using more than intended and using more to spread.  </li>
            <li> After using Triswim body wash, he was able to sleep through whole night without scratching around.</li>
            <li> We make sure to use this everytime our child finishes the swim class and works very well.</li>
            <li> It smells good, my skin doesn&#x27;t smell like chlorine, but my hair and facial hair still have a chlorinated smell.</li>
            <li> like it very much, good skin after swimming n recommended to friend, he is quite like it same as me.</li>
            <li> TRISWIM Body wash is an overall good product.  </li>
            <li> It is better to transfer liquid gel into a smaller container because original tube top not stable</li>
            <li> I expect to run out of it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells great and not too much fragrance just enough.  </li>
            <li> We were hoping for ultra, super hydration as swimming is turning my son into an alligator.</li>
            <li> The bottle goes by quickly though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the body wash smells good (no fruitiness or overpowering scent) and it gets rid of the chlorine smell that tends to linger on your body after a long swim.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise great product to get the chlorine smell off and also to slightly hydrate skin</li>
            <li> It should have same nice citrus scent like the rest of the products.</li>
            <li> I love to swim laps but recently developed an allergy to chlorine.  </li>
            <li> I recently started water aerobics classes several times weekly and despite showering with a good soap or body wash, I just wasn&#x27;t able to get rid of the chlorine smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Well, either this stuff is some sort of magical anti-chlorine elixir, or my body chemistry has somehow completely changed and tolerates chlorine.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and seems to work only marginally better than regular shower gel or soap.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the way</li>
            <li> it worth the money.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh smell and removed all traces of the chlorine scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than it was before, and perhaps I need to apply the wash more &amp;#34;generously,&amp;#34; but I was hoping that there would be less visible dryness.  </li>
            <li> This product is truely a god send...it got the smell of the pool right off of my skin and also left it nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> and it just pours the soap out super fast.  </li>
            <li> It did nothing more then regular soap can.  </li>
            <li> Great product to get off the chlorine, or at least to mute the odor.</li>
            <li> Works wonders especially one of the pools I swim at has SO many chemicals I used to come out</li>
            <li> Definitely better than a regular soap.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it does remove the chlorine, but who knows, can&#x27;t really measure it!</li>
            <li> my regular soap gets it out of my hair better than this.</li>
            <li> If you used it in liquid state it would run out pretty soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> I have better results scrubbing with regular soap and wash rag.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well, certainly better than just using regular soap.</li>
            <li> I had ZERO side effects after being in a pool for ~8 days, most of those days for several hours at a time.  </li>
            <li> This product does a much better job than regular soap but does not completly remove the chlorine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more soon, definitely!</li>
            <li> This body wash has proven to be exactly what I had hoped it would do.  </li>
            <li> For me, the TRISWIM Body Wash does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> After using it, I detect no lingering odor of chlorine on my skin, and it leaves a crisp citrus</li>
            <li> said, it has a nice citrus smell, and mild amount of sudz which go down the drain easy at our local LA</li>
            <li> Great stuff, but realized the price was way too high after I saw the same item in a local store.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t really tell that it does much better than regular soap or body wash for removing chlorine.</li>
            <li> Great smell, soaps up nicely, do not need to use much.  </li>
            <li> I guess treating one chemical with another isn&#x27;t that great for your skin, because my skin is even drier now than when I was using plain old Dove moisturizing body wash.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for its ability to remove chlorine and since I started using it, I am much less itchy but the top does not close properly so I am forced to keep the bottle in its own plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Just like several other reviewers, I was happy with the product, but not the packaging.</li>
            <li> I fill a smaller travel bottle that&#x27;s easy to take in the shower with shampoo and conditioner, so I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the cap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-1 star because the nozzle on the tube is to large</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have is that the body wash is very runny, so it pours out of the bottle very quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference from what I buy at the store, but it seems fine.</li>
            <li> This body wash really gets the chlorine off your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and reduce how much the pool is drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Well, my daughter still feels itchy even after using it, also, it is not really soothing, it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I swim 2-3 times a week for 30-45 minutes and this works really well for removing the smell of chlorine.</li>
            <li> Great product, non irritating, would buy again.</li>
            <li> She tried all kinds of soaps and lotions nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> It really does rinse away the chlorine odor.</li>
            <li> if you use it at the gym showers otherwise it will get used up too fast.  </li>
            <li> so am not swimming much.</li>
            <li> I really like the product but have ordered it twice, and both times the plastic container cracked and leaked</li>
            <li> Body Wash accomplished the removal of chlorine after Hydrotherapy Sessions.</li>
            <li> It really takes the chlorine from your skin.  </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin no longer feels ichy from the chlorine, though it doesn&#x27;t have much lather.</li>
            <li> This body wash really has the effect.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually it looks like it will end up fast</li>
            <li> It has a fresh citrus smell that is neither masculine nor feminine.  </li>
            <li> The price of this product is reasonable, the package sizing is reasonable to carry to the pool</li>
            <li> The manufacturer really needs to replace the packaging on this item.  </li>
            <li> Not really too sure what to write about this product without sounding homosexual.</li>
            <li> I still smelled liked chlorine, waste of money</li>
            <li> the chlorine smell wasn&#x27;t completely gone after using it, but it&#x27;s better than regular body wash.</li>
            <li> Right after my swim, I always feel a scent of chloro, no matter how many times or how heavy</li>
            <li> I swing often and this is my regular &amp;#34;soap.&amp;#34; Gets rid of that chlorine smell and, besides, makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li> This body wash left me clean and not itchy after swimming in chlorine.  </li>
            <li> the problem was back full force.  </li>
            <li> I feel that I have to use a bit more than a traditional body wash to get the desire results, but traditional wash hasn&#x27;t really helped remove all the chlorine, so we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> Kind of a small amount for the price, I used about 1/8 for 1 use.</li>
            <li> It lathers on pretty easily, and you don&#x27;t need to use half the bottle to cover yourself.  </li>
            <li> But I really wish the manufacturers had thought this through a little better.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job at hiding the smell of chlorine.  </li>
            <li> Mainly though, this soap delivers on its promise.  </li>
            <li> This product is not expensive, has a delicate sort of citrus fragrance suitable for any gender, and works like a charm, meeting all my requirements.  </li>
            <li> The main con I find with it is that it is too watery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced I wouldn&#x27;t get the same results from a cheaper drugstore option of mild soap with aloe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using this definitely works MUCH better than regular shampoos or soaps for removing chlorine smell from my body after swimming.</li>
            <li> The price is a little more than I would normally pay for body wash, but since it works, I cannot complain too much</li>
            <li> product has a couple of downsides - one is that you have to check each time you use it to make sure the lid is screwed on tight, because it tends to loosen over time and the gel can ooze out.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly, far more than any other body wash for swimmers.</li>
            <li> After a normal 90 minute swim session, I used this and found that it did almost nothing to remove the chlorine smell from my skin.</li>
            <li> It does remove the pool stink better than regular soap (not completely though).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep it in a plastic zip back to be safe, but, so far, this hasn&#x27;t been necessary.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t as itchy as normal but still itchy.</li>
            <li> The current tube is a little too cumbersome to take in my gym bag, but it can easily be redistributed into small travel containers available at most drug stores.</li>
            <li> It suds up really well and has a strong citrus fragrance while using it, but that instantly goes away after you rinse and dry off.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin softer than the other brands, stops the itching, and has a light scent.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance of the soap is subtle and nice.</li>
            <li> Disappointed at best.</li>
            <li> Which is the more of a negative given the price of the product compared to &#x27;normal&#x27; shower gel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather that much and is a little more runny than a typical shower gel, so I mixed it in with my regular one when I showered and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I am actually considering buying the large gallon size since I use this two to three times a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ideally I would like to find a smaller &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size or large bulk container option.</li>
            <li> It is a tad runny for my liking, but that&#x27;s really the only drawback.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this product.</li>
            <li> This product works and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product and have repurchased it on repeat occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will order it again to see if it is only the one bottle with this problem or if the packaging really is truly defective.</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash I&#x27;ve found that really gets rid of the chlorine smell after swimming.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is still considerably drier than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> It did not work any near as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviews that I read complained about the smell and the lathering abilitiy, but I am quite pleased with both.  </li>
            <li> So Soft.</li>
            <li> However, after just a few uses, the cap stopped closing securely and I was left with a huge mess as the product leaked.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, but I&#x27;m not really sold on how it helps your skin with excessive pool/chlorine exposure.  </li>
            <li> I swim in a pool nearly every day,have very sensitive skin and live in a high desert environment that is almost always less than 10% humidity.  </li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of body wash, including brand names, but this is so far THE body wash for swimmers - no smell of the chlorine any more, and no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> It used to be very itchy and dry after getting out of the pool, and this seems to have taken care of the problem.</li>
            <li> Not only did the body wash get rid of any residue from the pool, but it completely erased the dreaded &amp;#34;pool&amp;#34; smell!  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was able to keep it from making a mess in my gym bag after the lid failed.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really made any difference or not because the pool I worked at this summer had so much chlorine that nothing washed the smell out.</li>
            <li> I swim a lot and have sensitive skin that itches constantly after swimming in chlorine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, using the body wash won&#x27;t necessarily make your skin soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old son no longer complains that his back itches, and he hasn&#x27;t had a scab appear since we started using both products.</li>
            <li> Triswim body wash doesn&#x27;t neutralize as well as I&#x27;d hoped, and it has its own weird chemical smell that&#x27;s not quite covered up by the citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of expensive for a soap.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other bodywashes I&#x27;ve tried really didn&#x27;t get the smell off.</li>
            <li> It is worth a little extra money to get the Triswim.</li>
            <li> I think it only does an OK job, not great.</li>
            <li> Washing with this after swimming &#x3D; no dry itchy skin from the chlorine.</li>
            <li> Although the chorine smell is faint on my skin after I shower with it, it&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li> pretty well - leaves me a bit less itchy and chloriny than my regular moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Triswim lotion after my water aerobics class and it has completely cured my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Usually my child feels very itchy after swim.</li>
            <li> The second downside for me is that it does not completely prevent pool chlorine rash.  </li>
            <li> Smell is not great but also not bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to perfume smells, and this has a slight odor, but is inoffensive.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is very watery and runny.</li>
            <li> It left me with dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It does not remove it completely, though (a typical test:</li>
            <li> Instead, I left it partially on, and I close it over the opening every time I put the lid back on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not perfect, as it also leaves some of the smell, but the skin seems less dry and it does work better than regular soap as mentioned above.</li>
            <li> it lathers nicely and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I had to be extra careful to not lay the tube on its side.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t lasts that long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 times and the bottle is already 3/4 empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see how long the tube lasts.</li>
            <li> This body wash and the accompanying lotion really go a long way in reducing that smell.  </li>
            <li> If you really hate the chlorine smell, this does a good job on it.  </li>
            <li> I swim in a pool regularly and have had no itching or other skin irritation after using triswim body wash</li>
            <li> I liked the TRISWIM body wash but its lid sucks!!!!.</li>
            <li> Will now try the lotion by Triswim this winter to help out with the dry skin winter&amp;pool does to skin.</li>
            <li> My skin still feel dry and itchy  from swimming.</li>
            <li> he swims Tu/Th/Sa each week; once he started using this body wash after his swims, he noticed his skin was not as dry.</li>
            <li> It stopped my skin from smelling like chlorine and from being itchy and dry.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of the chlorine smell and the dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem that my skin can get really dry and itchy from the chlorine.</li>
            <li> It also reduces overly dry skin resulting from chlorinated water.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my already extremely dry skin either.</li>
            <li> 3 x&#x27;s / week, so my skin gets very dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> and I can sometimes smell a little chlorine later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am as a recreational swimmer who tries to get in shape by put my numbers in the pool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricy for just 8oz, almost empty after using for 1 week for 2 of us.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems not very efficient though.</li>
            <li> The TriSwim is cheaper if you hit the pool daily or few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very plesant and very subtle.</li>
            <li> find that the product lathers quite well and that a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> the lower end is sharp as a knife</li>
            <li> I wish they could fix this issue as mentioned by other users also.</li>
            <li> Other than that, seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I think my other body wash (Olay) works just as well as this.  </li>
            <li> the other brand-name soap i used on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes it pretty expensive for a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I should have guessed that there may be some body wash on the packing slip.  </li>
            <li> Hard to open.</li>
            <li> Unlike other body washes I have tried, this also moisturized my skin and did not leave my skin feeling tight.  </li>
            <li> When you spend hours in the pool every day it&#x27;s impossible to get the chlorine out without special products.  </li>
            <li> seems to neutralize the chlorine odor slightly, but not quite as well as i had hoped</li>
            <li> when you are in the pool for that long it&#x27;s really hard to eliminate the chlorine odor.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, it&#x27;s bad enough that I experience itching and/or dryness-related discomfort, particularly on my face, shoulders and torso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> worked for weak asian skin</li>
            <li> The flip cap is a little &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; but I hope they pay attention to that container.</li>
            <li> but I still noticed a little chlorine smell after showing.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but I continue to buy it because I notice a difference when I use it versus when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lathers very well but with all soaps hard water may make it difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different washes, and this stuff makes my skin itch like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I felt just as dried out and itchy as before.</li>
            <li> My daughter swims everyday and this was a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another anti-chlorine soap that gets rid of the itching, but is difficult to rinse off completely and leaves a pasty feel.  </li>
            <li> I swim everyday and this helps.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks after my 3x/wk swims.</li>
            <li> After a few uses of this product, it seems to remove the chlorine smell from skin.  </li>
            <li> After using it just a few times, the lid no longer snaps shut</li>
            <li> I used it a few times after swimming</li>
            <li> I swim almost daily in a highly chlorinated pool and hate the odor and skin dryness caused by the chlorine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but you need very little.</li>
            <li> I use the lotion during the winter when my skin dries out and again, no strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> but you might not able to carry it to swimming pool shower.</li>
            <li> I use after swimming at the gym; no more irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone is complaining about the packaging of this product.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how I can know its dealing with the clorine...</li>
            <li> No more smell.</li>
            <li> Along with Dermaswim Pro, Triswim Lotion and this product, I have no more rash from swimming at the gym pool</li>
            <li> Frankly, this product disappointed me since I was reviewing all the positive comments</li>
            <li> I swim 3-5 times a week for at least an hour,</li>
            <li> Totally not effective.</li>
            <li> I am a triathlete and sped at least three days a week at the pool.</li>
            <li> No more chlorine smell!</li>
            <li> Common guys, make it denser!</li>
            <li> once your skin dries and you lick your forearm - you can still smell a hint of chlorine; but that&#x27;s not a problem as people don&#x27;t usually come around licking my forearms at random).</li>
            <li> I got tired of the chlorine smell after a shower</li>
            <li> My poor skin needs all the chemicals off and moisturizers in.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance reminds me of a very subtle citrus (lemons and tangerines?), but not overpowering or \\&quot;feminine\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Very subtle and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a body wash; but this product does the job.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately one of the bottles leaked.</li>
            <li> Watery and useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> I still smell a faint smell of chorline</li>
            <li> Kinda expensive though.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to close&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Swimming in a pool in the winter is very tough on the skin.</li>
            <li> but this soap makes me itch like crazy - and I don&#x27;t have any allergies.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expensive!</li>
            <li> This  product did not work for me very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of chlorine on my skin.</li>
            <li> I swim 2-3 times a week, and I hate the lingering odor of chlorine on my skin afterwards.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After a normal 90 minute swim session, I used this and found that it did almost nothing to remove the chlorine smell from my skin. I felt just as dried out and itchy as before. It suds up really well and has a strong citrus fragrance while using it, but that instantly goes away after you rinse and dry off. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> not as good as we&#x27;d hoped, but okay.</li>
            <li> It did nothing more then regular soap can.  I still smelled liked chlorine, waste of money</li>
            <li> This stuff works to greatly reduce the smell, feel, and effects of chlorine on my skin after swimming each day. Wish they would up the vitamin C content to increase this effect even more. But almost perfect as is</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a body wash; but this product does the job. Unfortunately one of the bottles leaked. The producer should improve the cap closure.</li>
            <li> This  product did not work for me very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I swim three times a week. Triswim body wash doesn&#x27;t neutralize as well as I&#x27;d hoped, and it has its own weird chemical smell that&#x27;s not quite covered up by the citrus scent.  Although the chorine smell is faint on my skin after I shower with it, it&#x27;s very strong the next (non-swimming) morning when I step into the shower.  I guess treating one chemical with another isn&#x27;t that great for your skin, because my skin is even drier now than when I was using plain old Dove moisturizing body wash.  I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> Your experience may vary.  If you really hate the chlorine smell, this does a good job on it.  I&#x27;m sensitive to perfume smells, and this has a slight odor, but is inoffensive.  But if you itch, the body wash is non-conditioning.  It didn&#x27;t seem to help with itching at night, at all.</li>
            <li> worked for weak asian skin</li>
            <li> Definitely gets rid of chlorine smell. I don&#x27;t itch like I used to after a shower. I still use lotion after my shower but before Triswim I used to still itch despite using lotion. I don&#x27;t like it as much as regular body wash but it does what it is supposed to do and I will continue to use it after swimming.</li>
            <li> I love this to get the chlorine smell off my skin after swimming in a pool.</li>
            <li> The body wash works pretty well - leaves me a bit less itchy and chloriny than my regular moisturizing body wash. However, the flip-top cap opens in my swim bag, and I end up with body wash leaked all over everything - yuck!  Maybe I can pour it out into a travel bottle or something. But I really wish the manufacturers had thought this through a little better.</li>
            <li> Must have for even the moderate swimmer. I normally only swim 1-2 times per week, and I used to smell like a swimming pool for a couple days. Now, that smell is significantly reduced. This stuff rocks!!</li>
            <li> I am as a recreational swimmer who tries to get in shape by put my numbers in the pool. I found no regular body wash can help you to get rid of smell of chlorine. TRISWIM is a product help me with this problem. It is NOT so efficient as promised (my hands still care some trace of chlorine), but it is reduce it a lot&lt;br /&gt;I found as combination of TRISWIM and &amp;#34;SwimSpray Chlorine Removal Spray - 4 oz&amp;#34; is almost give me a 100% clean from smell.</li>
            <li> The top of the container leaked. I had to be extra careful to not lay the tube on its side. I will not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Tried this product when I purchased the shampoo. Very glad I did since skin can still smell like chlorine even after you shower. This body wash gets rid of chlorine smell,nice citrus scent. Will now try the lotion by Triswim this winter to help out with the dry skin winter&amp;pool does to skin. It should have same nice citrus scent like the rest of the products. Great products!</li>
            <li> Great product to get off the chlorine, or at least to mute the odor. The only negative is that it is very watery and runny. I expect to run out of it rather quickly. Which is the more of a negative given the price of the product compared to &#x27;normal&#x27; shower gel.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of the smell of chlorine and treats my skin well. Like another person said , the tube is awful! the lower end is sharp as a knife so I had to cover it with layers of duct tape just to get by. The flip cap is a little &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; but I hope they pay attention to that container. How about it???</li>
            <li> I swim three times a week and have tried several brands of Swimmer&#x27;s Body Wash.  I have found the Triswim to be the most effective!  It leaves my skin softer than the other brands, stops the itching, and has a light scent.  Nothing totally takes away the chlorine smell, but this one comes the closest!  It is worth a little extra money to get the Triswim.</li>
            <li> I liked the TRISWIM body wash but its lid sucks!!!!. I used only twice on my son and its lid started leaking. I wish they could fix this issue as mentioned by other users also. Good body wash but you might not able to carry it to swimming pool shower.</li>
            <li> I love to swim laps but recently developed an allergy to chlorine.  So I tried this body wash in hopes that it would help.  Maybe if the allergy is not too extensive this would work, but my allergy includes a horrendous rash and severe itching.  The body wash smelled nice but did not stop the rash problem.  After only two swims the problem was back full force.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells great and not too much fragrance just enough.  Would be good for men and women.  It also does the job.  The only problem I have with it is the liquid pours out easily thus using more than intended and using more to spread.  It would be better if it were in gel form.</li>
            <li> love this to get rid of the pool smell!</li>
            <li> This body wash really gets the chlorine off your skin. Some of the other bodywashes I&#x27;ve tried really didn&#x27;t get the smell off. this also is moisturizing and it smells awesome. It is a tad runny for my liking, but that&#x27;s really the only drawback.</li>
            <li> Love it. I am smell-sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Works wonders especially one of the pools I swim at has SO many chemicals I used to come out all itchy until I started using it. I also use the shampoo they both work great to get the smell off my body, hair and beard! I use the lotion during the winter when my skin dries out and again, no strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> I think it only does an OK job, not great. Still smell chlorine after using it liberally with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I recently started water aerobics classes several times weekly and despite showering with a good soap or body wash, I just wasn&#x27;t able to get rid of the chlorine smell. After reading a representation of the Amazon reviews, I decided to try Triwim Body Wash and I have to say, \\&quot;What a great product!\\&quot; It does get rid of the chlorine odor, it&#x27;s gentle on the skin, and I find it&#x27;s very mild, citrusy scent very pleasant. Since I began using Triswim, I don&#x27;t worry about the chlorine smell lingering on and on and on. It is now part of my regular after-swim kit.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of the sent.... Other than that, seems to work well.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job at hiding the smell of chlorine.  Definitely better than a regular soap.  You do have to use a lot of it so it doesn&#x27;t lasts that long.  It is kind of expensive for a soap.  The container is definitely problematic.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the trick.  I use after swimming at the gym; no more irritated skin.</li>
            <li> No more chlorine smell!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really made any difference or not because the pool I worked at this summer had so much chlorine that nothing washed the smell out. It does smell very good, a sweet lemon scent. Doesn&#x27;t lather that much and is a little more runny than a typical shower gel, so I mixed it in with my regular one when I showered and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Usually my child feels very itchy after swim. Just received the product yesterday, used once. After using Triswim body wash, he was able to sleep through whole night without scratching around.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and reduce how much the pool is drying out my skin.  The body wash seems fine.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference from what I buy at the store, but it seems fine.</li>
            <li> Finally something that let&#x27;s you leave the pool without smelling like chlorine.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but you need very little.</li>
            <li> works well, smells good,</li>
            <li> One of the review says after using, her child doesn&#x27;t feel itchy. Well, my daughter still feels itchy even after using it, also, it is not really soothing, it&#x27;s just ok. My skin still feel dry and itchy  from swimming. Maybe it does remove the chlorine, but who knows, can&#x27;t really measure it! It&#x27;s pricy for just 8oz, almost empty after using for 1 week for 2 of us.</li>
            <li> We make sure to use this everytime our child finishes the swim class and works very well. The best part is that you don&#x27;t need 2 hands to use it. It leaves her skin clean without drying it out. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband b/c he swims Tu/Th/Sa each week; once he started using this body wash after his swims, he noticed his skin was not as dry. We will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I swim 2-3 times a week for 30-45 minutes and this works really well for removing the smell of chlorine. The only criticism I have is that the body wash is very runny, so it pours out of the bottle very quickly. I&#x27;ve only used it about 5 times and the bottle is already 3/4 empty. It works best to put the body wash on a loofah or sponge or something.</li>
            <li> Yes, this product does help neutralize some of the chlorine odor but for the price I would rather use my regular wash. I have been swimming for years and I was very excited to try this product but it did not impress me. I swim 3-5 times a week for at least an hour, when you are in the pool for that long it&#x27;s really hard to eliminate the chlorine odor. I will give the lotion credit because it does help control the lingering chlorine smell along with my citrus body wash.</li>
            <li> This smelled soooo wonderful!! It had amazing lathering properties without using a lot of the product, easy to use open/close top. Worthwhile purchase!!</li>
            <li> I do water aerobics and hated that my skin smelled like chlorine the rest of the day. With this body wash I get no chlorine smell.</li>
            <li> Effective in removing chlorine and moisturizing skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, non irritating, would buy again.</li>
            <li> It stopped my skin from smelling like chlorine and from being itchy and dry.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I swim 3 days a week for about an hour, so I&#x27;m in the pool a lot.  I got tired of the chlorine smell after a shower so I decided to give this product a shot.  I&#x27;ve used it about 3 or 4 times and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do the job.  It smells good, my skin doesn&#x27;t smell like chlorine, but my hair and facial hair still have a chlorinated smell. It seams like my regular soap gets it out of my hair better than this.</li>
            <li> Since I swim in a chlorinated pool, I wanted something to cut the smell from my skin. This product works. The price is a little more than I would normally pay for body wash, but since it works, I cannot complain too much</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the chlorine smell and the dry, itchy skin. My daughter swims everyday and this was a problem. She tried all kinds of soaps and lotions nothing really worked. This did. Try their shampoo and body lotion too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I think my other body wash (Olay) works just as well as this.  I was hoping for something that would do a better job of getting rid of the chlorine odor.</li>
            <li> I had terrible chlorine rash and ordered online. Working great. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Its seems to be getting the chlorine out of my skin when I shower with this product.</li>
            <li> Watery and useless. Hated this product, returned it immediately. Totally not effective.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this product. I swim 3 miles a day over two sessions and I use this stuff twice a day. I have found that I get the best results if I put a healthy amount in a luffa and really suds it up and scrub well. Surface coating with just your hands or even a wash cloth doesn&#x27;t work as well for me and I can sometimes smell a little chlorine later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow it with the Triswim lotion which is also very good. I&#x27;m waiting to see how long the tube lasts. I feel that I have to use a bit more than a traditional body wash to get the desire results, but traditional wash hasn&#x27;t really helped remove all the chlorine, so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend the Malibu Swimmers Wellness shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh, not overpowering.  Mainly though, this soap delivers on its promise.  I swim a lot and have sensitive skin that itches constantly after swimming in chlorine.  Regular soap/body wash does not relieve it.  Triswim washes off the chlorine and there is no itching after my post-swim shower.  It rinses off well, too.  I&#x27;ve tried another anti-chlorine soap that gets rid of the itching, but is difficult to rinse off completely and leaves a pasty feel.  So, I&#x27;ll continue to order Triswim.  Oh what a relief it is.</li>
            <li> I am a triathlete and sped at least three days a week at the pool. I hate the smell of chlorine on my skin. This product works and leaves my skin soft. It is also easy to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Wodke&lt;br /&gt;Author: Running for My Life-Winning for CMT</li>
            <li> It does remove the pool stink better than regular soap (not completely though).&lt;br /&gt;It seems not very efficient though. I start from hair to make some lather (advise not for the bald guys he he :oP) to make it more efficient. If you used it in liquid state it would run out pretty soon.&lt;br /&gt;It is not perfect, as it also leaves some of the smell, but the skin seems less dry and it does work better than regular soap as mentioned above.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;Decent smell, not perfume soaked!&lt;br /&gt;-1 star because the nozzle on the tube is to large and it just pours the soap out super fast.  This makes conserving the product a bit more difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> Excellent for after long pool time. Has nice gentle citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> Every swimmer must have this and the proce is right, takes the smell and damage to the skin away good</li>
            <li> Not sure why everyone is complaining about the packaging of this product.  It works really well and travels in my gear bag perfectly.  I have used both this body wash and the lotion.  They do a very effective job of neutralizing the chlorine smell and itch.  My skin is a lot better since I have been using this as opposed to what my pool offered.  My massage therapist no longer asks if I just got out of the pool.  I am actually considering buying the large gallon size since I use this two to three times a week.  It also works very effectively for salt water too.</li>
            <li> This has proven to me to be the best body wash for swimmers.  I swim in a pool nearly every day,have very sensitive skin and live in a high desert environment that is almost always less than 10% humidity.  My poor skin needs all the chemicals off and moisturizers in.  This product is not expensive, has a delicate sort of citrus fragrance suitable for any gender, and works like a charm, meeting all my requirements.  I recommend it highly, far more than any other body wash for swimmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash after swimming in a chlorinated pool. It&#x27;s a nice product, smells good, etc. But I can&#x27;t really tell that it does much better than regular soap or body wash for removing chlorine. It does seem to reduce the chlorine smell. But it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem that my skin can get really dry and itchy from the chlorine.</li>
            <li> I swim almost daily in a highly chlorinated pool and hate the odor and skin dryness caused by the chlorine. This product takes every bit of chlorine smell out of my skin without over drying me  Very happy and will order again</li>
            <li> Right after my swim, I always feel a scent of chloro, no matter how many times or how heavy the other brand-name soap i used on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not after this one! Amazing, inexpensive and effective product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell of the body wash, not the greatest, but i will use other soap which does the job for scent, but this one provides effective wash for the chloro.</li>
            <li> I swim about 4 miles per week. The itch from chlorine kept me awake most of the time. This product really works! It&#x27;s expensive so I tried mixing it with regular body wash and it still works well. I still smell a faint smell of chorline but it&#x27;s probably because I mix it. The best compliment is I don&#x27;t itch any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers very well but with all soaps hard water may make it difficult. In this case it does not matter, it works. The fragrance is very plesant and very subtle.</li>
            <li> It is important to use this product,because chlorine,etc can damage kidneys &amp; blood vessels</li>
            <li> This body wash is very effective at killing the chlorine smell in high chlorine water. It also reduces overly dry skin resulting from chlorinated water. It is great for after a swim, but also works well for home use with overly chlorinated tap water. It smells of citrus and reminds me of orange-pineapple juice, a clean scent which is suitable for men or women. The lather is good, but not luxurious.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, but realized the price was way too high after I saw the same item in a local store.</li>
            <li> If you swim more than twice a week - you need this. Chlorine wrecks your hair and body especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product. I swim 3 days a week and the chlorine smell was getting to me. I bring the Triswim body wash to the pool and immediately shower with it after swimming. It does get most of the chlorine smell off. The pool I swim in uses a lot of chlorine, sometimes it takes a second shower to get it all off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would tell any swimmer who is in a chlorinated pool to try this.</li>
            <li> Great for getting chlorine off skin. A+</li>
            <li> I love this body wash it&#x27;s great after getting out of a pool. It helps get all the chemicals off your skin and leaves you smelling good. I&#x27;d definitely buy all there products again</li>
            <li> I swim everyday and this helps.</li>
            <li> the chlorine smell wasn&#x27;t completely gone after using it, but it&#x27;s better than regular body wash. Kinda expensive though.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, but I&#x27;m not really sold on how it helps your skin with excessive pool/chlorine exposure.  It definitely helps mask the smell of chlorine, but it is not hydrating and you will still need to use lotion after (especially in the winter time).</li>
            <li> Excellent. I swing often and this is my regular &amp;#34;soap.&amp;#34; Gets rid of that chlorine smell and, besides, makes you feel clean. Triswim also makes a great after-swim body lotion</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make any difference from regular body wash and it&#x27;s expensive!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks after my 3x/wk swims. It really does rinse away the chlorine odor. I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever!! We also bought the shampoo. if you swim a lot so the chlorine doesn&#x27;t strip your hair! Smells great and it DOES make the chlorine smell go away!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Works to remove the chlorine from our skin after swimming. We love using this product!</li>
            <li> Great smell and performance.</li>
            <li> After a few uses of this product, it seems to remove the chlorine smell from skin.  The fragrance is pleasant.  However, after just a few uses, the cap stopped closing securely and I was left with a huge mess as the product leaked.  I will need to find a replacement bottle that will hold what is left.  For the price, the cap should have a more sturdy design.</li>
            <li> Swimming in a pool in the winter is very tough on the skin. Chlorine is the culprit. This body wash does an okay job of getting rid of the chlorine but there may be something better out there.</li>
            <li> seems to neutralize the chlorine odor slightly, but not quite as well as i had hoped</li>
            <li> I have been using TriSwim ever since I came across it at race.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worked well to remove the chlorine smell from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash and shampoo are the two that get used up the quickest.&lt;br /&gt;So get more of those two items than the conditioner and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Kheil&#x27;s swimmer&#x27;s shampoo&lt;br /&gt;and the Ultra swim shampoo. But I like the tri swim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khiel&#x27;s is pricey but works. The TriSwim is cheaper if you hit the pool daily or few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the lid. Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to close&lt;br /&gt;and the shampoo or body wash leaks out.</li>
            <li> Perfect for people like me, who have to swim as therapy but is allergic to chlorine. This keeps the rash away.</li>
            <li> LOVE it so mucH.  Great product and skin feels ever so great; I do the pool for physical therapy almost every day.  Thanks for a great body wash.</li>
            <li> Works as is stated and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> I and my swimsuit smelled of chlorine and my skin felt itchy after being in the pool before I tried triswim. This will be a constant in my bag for showering after swimming 3x/week. I fill a smaller travel bottle that&#x27;s easy to take in the shower with shampoo and conditioner, so I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the cap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different washes, and this stuff makes my skin itch like crazy.  Same pool, same conditions, etc etc - but this soap makes me itch like crazy - and I don&#x27;t have any allergies.</li>
            <li> Works great.  You&#x27;ll need a sponge or a hand towel if you use it at the gym showers otherwise it will get used up too fast.  It doesn&#x27;t lather up well by hand but it does work as well as it claims. Smell is not great but also not bad.  The pool at our gym has a lot of chlorine and this does the job and makes me feel clean again.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Helps my skin.  I a still allergic to chlorine so am not swimming much. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I really like the product but have ordered it twice, and both times the plastic container cracked and leaked and I lost some of it before I could even use it!</li>
            <li> This product is truely a god send...it got the smell of the pool right off of my skin and also left it nice and soft.  The shipping was quick and the transaction quick and easy.  I would recommend this product to any swimmer.</li>
            <li> This does a great job removing the chlorine from my skin. It used to be very itchy and dry after getting out of the pool, and this seems to have taken care of the problem. The fragrance of the soap is subtle and nice. Overall, I really like this product and have repurchased it on repeat occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found a solution for the lid problem. I didn&#x27;t remove the foil seal all the way when I opened the lid. Instead, I left it partially on, and I close it over the opening every time I put the lid back on. I&#x27;ve been carrying it in a stuffed gym bag this way for a month, and I haven&#x27;t had any leakage problems. I keep it in a plastic zip back to be safe, but, so far, this hasn&#x27;t been necessary.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I can know its dealing with the clorine...but I think it&#x27;s working cause I don&#x27;t smell clorine in my skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product for its ability to remove chlorine and since I started using it, I am much less itchy but the top does not close properly so I am forced to keep the bottle in its own plastic bag. I will order it again to see if it is only the one bottle with this problem or if the packaging really is truly defective.</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash I&#x27;ve found that really gets rid of the chlorine smell after swimming. I swim a couple times a week and when people at work can smell chlorine when you walk by, you know you need to find a product that works. Lather this on, let it soak for a couple minutes and rinse. No more smell. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my already extremely dry skin either. I&#x27;ll be ordering it in bulk next time!</li>
            <li> Body Wash accomplished the removal of chlorine after Hydrotherapy Sessions.</li>
            <li> Just like several other reviewers, I was happy with the product, but not the packaging. After using it just a few times, the lid no longer snaps shut and I had to transfer it all to another container to continue to carry it to and from my \\&quot;Y\\&quot;. Fortunately, I was able to keep it from making a mess in my gym bag after the lid failed.</li>
            <li> I have better results scrubbing with regular soap and wash rag.  If I use this product alone after I swim, I will smell like chlorine still.  I have to use soap, bodywash, and this product and scrub for a while just notice a difference in smell.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well, certainly better than just using regular soap.</li>
            <li> It really takes the chlorine from your skin.  The main con I find with it is that it is too watery and it lasts 10/11 showers, shorter than a month if you swim three times a week.  Common guys, make it denser!</li>
            <li> You definitely have to use a lot f the product to make it work, a luffa sponge is definitely needed to make enough latter, but it worked well and took the chlorine smell from my skin!</li>
            <li> I swim a couple of times a week, and my skin is prone to chlorine-related dryness, especially during the winter.  Occasionally, it&#x27;s bad enough that I experience itching and/or dryness-related discomfort, particularly on my face, shoulders and torso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the body wash smells good (no fruitiness or overpowering scent) and it gets rid of the chlorine smell that tends to linger on your body after a long swim.  It lathers on pretty easily, and you don&#x27;t need to use half the bottle to cover yourself.  Since I started using Triswim, I haven&#x27;t experienced any post-swim chlorine-related skin irritation, so that&#x27;s important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, using the body wash won&#x27;t necessarily make your skin soft and moist.  The skin on my face is still considerably drier than I&#x27;d like.  It&#x27;s better than it was before, and perhaps I need to apply the wash more &amp;#34;generously,&amp;#34; but I was hoping that there would be less visible dryness.  I&#x27;ll continue using the product, but anyone buying it should definitely manage their expectations.</li>
            <li> My skin does NOT smell like chlorine! GREAT body wash!</li>
            <li> I use this with the Triswim lotion after my water aerobics class and it has completely cured my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It did not work any near as advertised. It left me with dry and itchy skin. I think I got an allergic reaction to this product. The  chlorine odor was still there. I swim 7 days a week and was looking for a product that could remove chlorine odor. Frankly, this product disappointed me since I was reviewing all the positive comments</li>
            <li> like it very much, good skin after swimming n recommended to friend, he is quite like it same as me.</li>
            <li> This works alright, but I still noticed a little chlorine smell after showing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the pool 3 days a week and always could smell chlorine on my skin even after showering.  I started using Triswim and no longer smell like a pool!  This body wash works really well and has a nice scent.  A must have for pool goers!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! Gets the chlorine smell out immediately and relieves my skin of any itchiness. It also isn&#x27;t tested on animals and has great ingredients. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> My daughter is a competitive swimmer and the amount of chlorine in pools is maddening. Nothing seems to be able to wash away the smell that lingers on the body after swimming, including this body wash (and I bought 2 bottles - 1 for home and 1 to take to swim). Disappointed at best.</li>
            <li> I am a 3-time per week swimmer.  Especially during the winter, the itch from chlorine drove me to distraction and kept me awake many nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did an online search for a swimmer&#x27;s body wash to clean the chlorine from body in my post-swim shower.  Reviews I found on various websites led me to Triswim.  I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews that I read complained about the smell and the lathering abilitiy, but I am quite pleased with both.  The fragrance reminds me of a very subtle citrus (lemons and tangerines?), but not overpowering or \\&quot;feminine\\&quot;.  Very subtle and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the product lathers quite well and that a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one criticism with which I would have to agree is that the container design, with its pointed edges, makes it necessary to transfer the product to another container so that it doesn&#x27;t puncture my swim bag.  But that takes all of 2 minutes: no big deal, considering all the positives.</li>
            <li> I had no rash or itch after using the product.  I&#x27;m using the pool for fitness, so I&#x27;m relieved that chlorine won&#x27;t keep me out of the pool.</li>
            <li> I use this on my kids after they swim, because my son has a sensitivity to chlorine. I use dermaswim on his back before he gets in the pool, and then I shower the kids with this after they swim. My 5 year old son no longer complains that his back itches, and he hasn&#x27;t had a scab appear since we started using both products. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced I wouldn&#x27;t get the same results from a cheaper drugstore option of mild soap with aloe.&lt;br /&gt;That said, it has a nice citrus smell, and mild amount of sudz which go down the drain easy at our local LA Fitness.&lt;br /&gt;Ideally I would like to find a smaller &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size or large bulk container option. The current tube is a little too cumbersome to take in my gym bag, but it can easily be redistributed into small travel containers available at most drug stores.</li>
            <li> Great smell, soaps up nicely, do not need to use much.  It is better to transfer liquid gel into a smaller container because original tube top not stable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely elliminates chlorine smell</li>
            <li> I have a sensitivity to chlorine, so I bought this thinking that the sooner I could wash it off, the better my skin would be.  Well, either this stuff is some sort of magical anti-chlorine elixir, or my body chemistry has somehow completely changed and tolerates chlorine.  I had ZERO side effects after being in a pool for ~8 days, most of those days for several hours at a time.  Not only did the body wash get rid of any residue from the pool, but it completely erased the dreaded &amp;#34;pool&amp;#34; smell!  This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> This product does a much better job than regular soap but does not completly remove the chlorine.  Not sure if its worth the expense.</li>
            <li> Using this definitely works MUCH better than regular shampoos or soaps for removing chlorine smell from my body after swimming. It does not remove it completely, though (a typical test: once your skin dries and you lick your forearm - you can still smell a hint of chlorine; but that&#x27;s not a problem as people don&#x27;t usually come around licking my forearms at random). Perhaps if I used more of this product per after-swim-shower, it would do an even better job. But I am using just a handful for my whole body and hair and it still does a good job.</li>
            <li> I swim in a pool regularly and have had no itching or other skin irritation after using triswim body wash</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is a swimmer. Great scent, and easily removes chlorine without over drying.</li>
            <li> Along with Dermaswim Pro, Triswim Lotion and this product, I have no more rash from swimming at the gym pool</li>
            <li> Not as great at the shampoo by same company. We were hoping for ultra, super hydration as swimming is turning my son into an alligator. But he likes it.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. It smells good and seems to work only marginally better than regular shower gel or soap. I used it a few times after swimming and I wasn&#x27;t as itchy as normal but still itchy.</li>
            <li> The two came in bubble wrap. The weld on one tube was already blown out.  I returned it. Started using the second tube and the same thing happend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it lathers nicely and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad. But what&#x27;s the point when the packaging is so cheap and you have to scrape it off the floor, and find another container,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy it again unless the stop counting the 1/2 cents and package it properly.</li>
            <li> use this ever nightafter our nightly swim</li>
            <li> Yep, it washes the chlorine smell away, and has a light citrus-pine smell.  Better than Avon Skin So Soft.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this body wash.  Very pleasant &amp; not overpowering.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s &amp; go to the pool 3 x&#x27;s / week, so my skin gets very dry and itchy.  This has helped that problem greatly, along with the lotion.</li>
            <li> My skin no longer feels ichy from the chlorine, though it doesn&#x27;t have much lather. Excellent product and prompt service. I&#x27;ll buy more soon, definitely!</li>
            <li> This body wash has proven to be exactly what I had hoped it would do.  I no longer have itching and I swim 6 days a week.</li>
            <li> The body wash doesn&#x27;t fully remove chlorine. It reduces the smell on the skin by about 60% - which is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I swim 2-3 times a week, and I hate the lingering odor of chlorine on my skin afterwards.  This body wash and the accompanying lotion really go a long way in reducing that smell.  It is a little pricey, but I continue to buy it because I notice a difference when I use it versus when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!! I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> Relieves itchiness caused by chlorine just like it says it does...</li>
            <li> Kind of a small amount for the price, I used about 1/8 for 1 use. Otherwise great product to get the chlorine smell off and also to slightly hydrate skin</li>
            <li> Nice smell, cleans chlorine off.</li>
            <li> For me, the TRISWIM Body Wash does exactly as advertised.  After using it, I detect no lingering odor of chlorine on my skin, and it leaves a crisp citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, immediately after my husband used it, he experienced moderate itching and skin irritation.  Thus, the loss of the fifth star.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a collegiate swimmer and she loves this stuff. When you spend hours in the pool every day it&#x27;s impossible to get the chlorine out without special products.  This body wash works well for her.</li>
            <li> Triswim Body Wash is working as advertised for keeping chorine skin dermatitis from occurring.  Must use it as directed close to the time of the chorine exposure in the swimming pool.  Lathers up nicely and doesn&#x27;t require lots of the Wash product to do the job.  Have used it for just one week, but very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Works great! Not crazy about the way it&#x27;s bottled. Hard to open. Lid broke.</li>
            <li> This body wash really has the effect.&lt;br /&gt;No chlorine smell after swimming pool.&lt;br /&gt;Actually it looks like it will end up fast (~15 usages I approximate)&lt;br /&gt;So it makes it pretty expensive for a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;But it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, performed as advertised. Removed chlorine smell and reduced skin dryness!</li>
            <li> Washing with this after swimming &#x3D; no dry itchy skin from the chlorine. Great stuff, definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and does it&#x27;s job. Great product.</li>
            <li> TRISWIM Body wash is an overall good product.  It has a fresh citrus smell that is neither masculine nor feminine.  It definitely removes Chlorine smell caused by swimming in a pool.  It does not lather up a lot, but enough to know where you have applied it.  The price of this product is reasonable, the package sizing is reasonable to carry to the pool and it definitely helps to moisturize skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a couple of downsides - one is that you have to check each time you use it to make sure the lid is screwed on tight, because it tends to loosen over time and the gel can ooze out.  The second downside for me is that it does not completely prevent pool chlorine rash.  It does help lessen the rash and on some people it might prevent the rash all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One neutral is that this product does not protect from the sun, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to either.  Also the product contains no parabens, no wheat or gluten-based ingredients.  Also it states no animal testing has been done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product!</li>
            <li> The manufacturer really needs to replace the packaging on this item.  After reading the other reviews I should have guessed that there may be some body wash on the packing slip.  The seal at the end of the tube has a hole in it.  No big deal for me as I already planned to put it into a smaller bottle anyway.  The wash works great and I can tell that my skin feels much more chlorine free after using it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body wash that neutralizes chlorine. Lemon scent doesn&#x27;t neutralize, it just masks the smell. As soon as I finish this tube of body wash, I&#x27;ll return to using my fave -- Aveeno.</li>
            <li> Nothing can beat this body wash, I assure you!!! I tried all kinds of body wash, including brand names, but this is so far THE body wash for swimmers - no smell of the chlorine any more, and no more dry skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This body wash left me clean and not itchy after swimming in chlorine.  Unlike other body washes I have tried, this also moisturized my skin and did not leave my skin feeling tight.  It has a fresh smell and removed all traces of the chlorine scent.</li>
            <li> Not really too sure what to write about this product without sounding homosexual. It does what it says it does. removes chlorine. nuf said.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells nice, lathers well. The bottle goes by quickly though.</li>
