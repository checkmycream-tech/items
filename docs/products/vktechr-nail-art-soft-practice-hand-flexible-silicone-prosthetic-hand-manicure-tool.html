            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>Excellent !!!!!</li>
            <li>Great practice hand for beginner.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect hand mannequin for display, nail fitting, jewelry modeling, and much more.  </li>
            <li>Works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very good product - fast shipment .</li>
            <li>It looks VERY cheap quality in person.</li>
            <li>I WOULD BUY OFF THIS PERSON/COMPANY AGAIN., :)</li>
            <li>Cute for practicing to paint your nails</li>
            <li>Wish they were more pliable though.</li>
            <li>I love my nail art practice</li>
            <li>and I did pretty good on my 1st time.</li>
            <li>The hand is soft and you can add nail tips to it, but it isn&#x27;t super flexible like a nail art practice hand should be, the shipping was fast and packaging was perfect though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in weight and just feels a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>The hand is very small and not of the best materials.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for the nails and hand but don&#x27;t bother of you&#x27;re looking for a realistic bracelet display.</li>
            <li>I would recommend you to purchase this -- price is right for new-in-box item.</li>
            <li>A+Seller was exactly what it stated.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Sounds like there are many, many ideas for this hand other than what it is intended for...like Halloween time!!!!</li>
            <li>Flexible  fingers makes it easy to file and add product without hitting other fingers.</li>
            <li>It hard as concrete and you will not be able to massage this thing.</li>
            <li>Bought this for our 5 year old granddaughter who was always wanting to paint everyone&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny spent!</li>
            <li>BUT THE ONLY THING WRONG IS THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT ABOUT A GOOD 3-4 WEEKS.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old loves to practice on this using all the different design she learns from &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; nail videos.</li>

            <li> A complete waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> Not enough room for fake nails,  and the color makes it weird to use.  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t use for fake nails as they wouldn&#x27;t stick to the fingers and the finger bed was also too small</li>
            <li> but it is very hard to take the nail off without messing it up</li>
            <li> Poor quality</li>

            <li> Sounds like there are many, many ideas for this hand other than what it is intended for...like Halloween time!!!!</li>
            <li> Fingers broke off. Poor quality</li>
            <li> The hand is soft and you can add nail tips to it, but it isn&#x27;t super flexible like a nail art practice hand should be, the shipping was fast and packaging was perfect though.</li>
            <li> The hand was delivered crooked &amp; mangled not a big fan.</li>
            <li> Great practice hand for beginner.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE!! BUT THE ONLY THING WRONG IS THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT ABOUT A GOOD 3-4 WEEKS., SO YES. I WOULD BUY OFF THIS PERSON/COMPANY AGAIN., :)</li>
            <li> I bought this hand for my daughter, she needed it for an experiment for her psychology class. The hand is very small and not of the best materials. It&#x27;s light in weight and just feels a bit cheap. She decided to change her project after receiving the hand</li>
            <li> Not a bracelet display. It&#x27;s fine for the nails and hand but don&#x27;t bother of you&#x27;re looking for a realistic bracelet display. The wrist is tiny.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our 5 year old granddaughter who was always wanting to paint everyone&#x27;s nails.  This was perfect for her to play with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people practice manicures on this hand. It hard as concrete and you will not be able to massage this thing. Also, you cannot practice doing acrylic nails on this. The nail beds are so rubbery that the nail tip will not stick on it. A complete waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> Cute for practicing to paint your nails</li>
            <li> Great for learning how to do acrylic nails!</li>
            <li> A+Seller was exactly what it stated. Wish they were more pliable though.</li>
            <li> what we needed for a science project.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love my nail art practice hamd but it is very hard to take the nail off without messing it up</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Practiced on the hand the same day I got it and I did pretty good on my 1st time. Definitely worth every penny spent!</li>
            <li> Not enough room for fake nails,  and the color makes it weird to use.  An overall wage of money. It looks VERY cheap quality in person.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect hand mannequin for display, nail fitting, jewelry modeling, and much more.  I would recommend you to purchase this -- price is right for new-in-box item.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my state board exam. Flexible  fingers makes it easy to file and add product without hitting other fingers.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t use for fake nails as they wouldn&#x27;t stick to the fingers and the finger bed was also too small</li>
            <li> Very good product - fast shipment . Excellent !!!!!</li>
            <li> daughter needed them to practice  for her state boards</li>
            <li> My 11 year old loves to practice on this using all the different design she learns from &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; nail videos.</li>
