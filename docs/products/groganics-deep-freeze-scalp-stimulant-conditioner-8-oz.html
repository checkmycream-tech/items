            <li>I love the smell and the freeze stimulant.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT..</li>
            <li>I really like the way this product works, it feels like you gave your scalp a refreshing spring bath that leaves your scalp nice and cool....</li>
            <li>I was having an issue with itchy scalp and bumps, but after only 3 weekly visits all bumps were gone and my scalp was invigorated and felt great.</li>
            <li>Great when used with deep freeze shampoo.</li>
            <li>Too early for results, but have heard good reviews from a friend.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product to use if you have dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair clean and</li>
            <li>Great for deep under scalp infections  or irritated scalp Strong on the DHT which is highly treating and comforting to whomever uses it.</li>
            <li>It is quite entertaining to drag my feet across the carpet, that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use Groganics until I&#x27;m quite sure the thinning has completely stopped, and I&#x27;ll save the bottles if it ever happens again.  </li>
            <li>; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for two days now, and as it does leave my hair soft and seemingly thicker than usual, and tingles, and feels great on the scalp, it also super static charges my hair,</li>
            <li>so perhaps I am being too critical on the static cling aspect of it.</li>
            <li>My first time using this product this pass weekend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried better than regular store brands like head and shoulders.  </li>

            <li>I do, however, use the Deep Freeze Shampoo and love it.  </li>
            <li>threw this away after the first use.</li>
            <li>Eases dry itchy scalp better than anything tried.  </li>
            <li>My hair and scalp feels much cleaner and healthier after using this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Groganics!</li>
            <li>I discovered that they changed their main ingredient that combats DHT- and dietary supplements.  </li>
            <li>I got a thyroid test and everything was normal.  </li>
            <li>I had to visit a new stylist while mine was on maternity leave</li>
            <li>My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, &amp; I have a lot of new growth ( I haven&#x27;t measured yet, I&#x27;m going to wait about 2 months).  </li>
            <li>This is a little strong for my eyes in the shower.</li>
            <li>I had this natural, luxuriant hair that was to die for.  </li>
            <li>Treat it early, and I hope you found this sooner than I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and stops breakage.</li>
            <li>It took 2 weeks to get my hair soft again.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good product, works excellent, saw results in one week. I used it together with the Groganics Deep Freeze Follicle Cleanser Shampoo</li>
            <li> This is a little strong for my eyes in the shower. I only use it once every two weeks and only on my temples. It does tingle, if that means anything to anyone. Along with their other products, I have experienced some thickening of previously thin spots.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two days now, and as it does leave my hair soft and seemingly thicker than usual, and tingles, and feels great on the scalp, it also super static charges my hair, when I brush it I find I am shocking myself and it static clings to my neck.  It is quite entertaining to drag my feet across the carpet, that&#x27;s for sure lol.  But, I am going to give it time, I have heard a lot of good things about groganics so perhaps I am being too critical on the static cling aspect of it.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH COMMENTING ON</li>
            <li> bought the several products shampoo, conditioner, on the spot, grotivator, root lifter and it did&#x27;t.  Either it don&#x27;t work for everyone or ppl are lying about this product line.  I didn&#x27;t even find minimal growth. difference.</li>
            <li> Great product for hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> It actually helps with hair loss.  I&#x27;m 19, and my hair has been thinning evenly around my scalp.  I had this natural, luxuriant hair that was to die for.  I woke up with it looking like a supermodel.  For the past few months, I&#x27;ve been trying rosemary shampoo, Nioxin once -until I discovered that they changed their main ingredient that combats DHT- and dietary supplements.  I got a thyroid test and everything was normal.  I just kept thinning and thinning.  I have this short bob now that I got to resemble Isabeau from Ladyhawke, but I&#x27;m still sad I didn&#x27;t learn about DHT earlier, because I&#x27;ve never really had my hair this short before.  Here&#x27;s hoping it grows out faster!  I&#x27;ll continue to use Groganics until I&#x27;m quite sure the thinning has completely stopped, and I&#x27;ll save the bottles if it ever happens again.  DHT sucks!  Treat it early, and I hope you found this sooner than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with the conditioner, and to put my Nioxin to use, I apply that after-shower/everyday cream after bathing.</li>
            <li> I had to visit a new stylist while mine was on maternity leave and she uses these products on her clients. I was having an issue with itchy scalp and bumps, but after only 3 weekly visits all bumps were gone and my scalp was invigorated and felt great. I&#x27;m back with my regular stylist and she now incorporates this product line in her business.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Leaves hair soft and stops breakage. I will never use another type of conditioner again. My hair is filling in where it was thinning really bad and less is coming out when I comb or wash it. It has a tingling sensation which last even after you wash it out. It feels like your getting a massage. Great when used with deep freeze shampoo. Once you try this product you will be hooked on it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great. It moisterizes but yet does not leave your hair feeling oily.  I love the tingly feeling.  My hair is growing in places now.  I will continue to purchase and use this conditioner, as well as, the shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp feels much cleaner and healthier after using this product. I would purchase again before giving a more comprehensive review</li>
            <li> My first time using this product this pass weekend. It make your scalp tingle.</li>
            <li> Eases dry itchy scalp better than anything tried.  Leave in a while can smell the menthol...rinse... Later the next day no itch no irritation.. Great relief best I&#x27;ve tried better than regular store brands like head and shoulders.  Will buy this often</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product works, it feels like you gave your scalp a refreshing spring bath that leaves your scalp nice and cool....love this product.</li>
            <li> i&amp;#62;m  working  with  this  product  now  A  very  good product.</li>
            <li> Works great for itchy hair I want to buy more products. I recommend this to any one who need scalp relief</li>
            <li> The Longer you keep it on the more proficient sustaining  better results..Great for deep under scalp infections  or irritated scalp Strong on the DHT which is highly treating and comforting to whomever uses it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the entire Groganics hair system for about 3 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m amazed!  My hair definitely does not shed like it was; regular shedding &amp; not much at all!  My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, &amp; I have a lot of new growth ( I haven&#x27;t measured yet, I&#x27;m going to wait about 2 months).  The DEEP FREEZE shampoo &amp; conditioner also works wonders &amp; leaves your hair SOFT!  Using the Groganics system on a daily basis produces the best results!  I wash &amp; deep condition my hair twice a week as some of the daily hair products are a bit oily, however they do show RESULTS!  I also use the vitamins, but I only take one a day as my hair does grow rapidly; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Groganics!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair or scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product to use if you have dry itchy scalp. It soothes you scalp and minimizes the dryness. If you use shampoo, conditioner and hairdress you will love you hair.</li>
            <li> Way too greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> great product. can see difference fast!</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my scalp feels in my hair after I used it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very dry and brittle feeling.</li>
            <li> I am trying the entire groganics line of products to block DHT and stimulate hair growth. Too early for results, but have heard good reviews from a friend.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. The tingling in your scalp let you know further that it&#x27;s doing what it is suppose to do...Grow Hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also I love the smell and the freeze stimulant. My hair is growing like crazy. LOVE IT..</li>
            <li> This product totally dried out my hair.  I&#x27;m blond and white.  It took 2 weeks to get my hair soft again.  There is nothing in it to condition.  I do, however, use the Deep Freeze Shampoo and love it.  It makes my hair clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw this away after the first use.</li>
            <li> Is a great product when used along side the shampoo and the head full of hair cream. did see growth when products were used together.</li>
            <li> IT TIGGLES WHEN YOU USE IT AND IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD ABOUT MY THIS PRODUCT. I USE ALL OF THEM NOW. WAITING TO SEE WHAT&#x27;S GOING TO HAPPEN TO MY HAIR. WILL WRITE BACK.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo, I don&#x27;t know if it lives up to all the product claims. But I do like the cooling affect it has and how it leaves my hair soft.  I plan on buying it again unless I come across another product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product. I used it for 4 months and my hair fell out. My hair was thinning a little, but now I have patches of hair gone. I hate I used this product.</li>
            <li> Do not expect to have the confidence these haven&#x27;t been tampered with or that you are getting what you paid for when they DO NOT have any safety or protective factory seals!!!</li>
            <li> A soothing feeling and breeze feeling to head for hours and a good rinse using to help breaking and shedding</li>
