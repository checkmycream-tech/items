            <li>really good quality hair.</li>
            <li>it looked good in photos but</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with it...</li>
            <li>If u want to get rid of the vinegar smell, just wash it once more with shampoo or dishwashing liquid which is great for stripping and follow with a nice smelling conditioner.</li>

            <li>I LOVE these !</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re soft but can get a bit tangled but still love them they blend perfectly with my hair!:)</li>
            <li>but it straightens out perfectly fine!</li>
            <li>Nice feel and easy too brush</li>
            <li>I would say I&#x27;m somewhat pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I would not wear them for more than 4 hours at most</li>
            <li>I would say I&#x27;m 70% pleased.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it, as does everyone else.</li>
            <li>i love it👌</li>
            <li>I love the hair surge.</li>
            <li>I love the smell it smells like mint which i like</li>

            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>love this extension</li>
            <li>but i absolutely love them..</li>
            <li>and I cut the extensions layers a bit so it would blend better.</li>
            <li>I have ordered so many of these...</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to wear them :)</li>
            <li>Still I would say they are a pain in the ass to untangle with spray and a brush, so if you want top quality extensions may be  </li>
            <li>you should invest more.</li>
            <li>I actually love this...</li>
            <li>I wore it out about 3 time and got many compliments.</li>
            <li>most of my friends had no idea the hair was</li>
            <li>i love this hair.</li>
            <li>i got the extension sooner than i thought i would, i love it</li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>Its okay for the price.</li>
            <li>me and my daughter use these and we love them</li>
            <li>It does make me look like i have longer and more hair.</li>
            <li>Great product, although I couldn&#x27;t curl it really</li>
            <li>more ok</li>
            <li>the hair is okay, tangles easily.nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a way to handle that.</li>
            <li>How many times you do this, depends on how tangled it is.</li>
            <li>lil more in.</li>
            <li>HOPE THIS HELPS :-)</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t expect more for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was thinking that it would be more than one piece</li>
            <li>it feels really nice and not like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I had the intention of using it the day of my wedding to ensure my wedding look was perfect, but I ended up just using my natural hair and changed my look I had originally picked.</li>
            <li>but when I got them they were smooth, and I really liked them really easy to use (:</li>
            <li>Not natural or anything, but for a costume it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>I loved them so much when they came in the mail!</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t real hair , &amp; the price is more than reasonable so you can&#x27;t expect it to be perfect .</li>
            <li>The hair is really long and shiny and they matched my hair color perfectly.</li>
            <li>But they work pretty good considering that.</li>
            <li>I would def check it out and recommend a purchase because for the value it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I had received the package a week earlier than it had said which was nice!!</li>
            <li>but if you can get your hair super straigh it should blend fine for you! :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money honestly.</li>
            <li>Other than that, excellent product!</li>
            <li>but they shed easy</li>
            <li>i would recommend it to anyone it does get tangled easy but</li>
            <li>These tangle easily if you don&#x27;t have them in your head.</li>
            <li>And easy to brush</li>
            <li>look.the hair is easy to put on and remove, doesn&#x27;t slide out of place while wearing.</li>
            <li>Shipped out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The hair in them pulls out so easily.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty nice tho.</li>
            <li>but if I wear a hat it looks fine</li>
            <li>I curled them on low-medium heat and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>but otherwise they work perfectly fine for me</li>
            <li>but i just needed to super glue the top</li>
            <li>I have thing straight hair that it pretty much worked perfectly with.</li>
            <li>the hair is real and matches my own quite well, easy to clip in and style, but a lot does fall out.</li>
            <li>but if you are just starting to get into hair extensions &amp; need something cheap then they are great.</li>
            <li>its a cheap price so expect what u pay.</li>
            <li>Its so cheap and has almost no hair.</li>
            <li>The hair looks like a cheap wig u would buy from the drug store on halloween.</li>
            <li>Yes these are def cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, let me just say that the picture is still kind of misleading, because if you are expecting these extensions to be stick straight then don&#x27;t get them.</li>
            <li>Honestly if you pay $6 for extensions you shouldnt expect much.</li>
            <li>and the price is dirt cheap</li>
            <li>free wig cap.</li>
            <li>looks good and soft</li>
            <li>Right now I see myself ordering more..</li>
            <li>, the curls came out awesome, compared to all the other extensions I bought, this is worth the $</li>
            <li>Its super long and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>They are good for a special ocassion but not everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Def worth the pricee!</li>
            <li>was so excited when they arrived.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s still in great condition as long as you take care of it .</li>
            <li>Worth the wait of shipping!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more $$$ for a nice weave!</li>
            <li>Proper color and good timing but one broke clip</li>
            <li>and it still did&#x27;nt provide full coverage</li>
            <li>I did however trim them up a bit because they were a bit longer than I wanted them to be and put a bit of baby powder on them to make them look a bit more real.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>I ordered a full set of clips</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true when they say: &amp;#34;You get what you pay for!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>+ of these for a full head like I did</li>
            <li>But for the price, I didnt really expect more.</li>
            <li>try a different product if your looking for good hair extensions.</li>
            <li>I guess when i read full head</li>
            <li>the hair was not bad but it just didnt blend well with my hair ..</li>
            <li>Other than that the hair length of great along with the texture.</li>
            <li>I will more than likely be buying more.</li>
            <li>but if your looking for some quick volume , &amp; or length I recommend this hair</li>
            <li>do not stay in place and the hair gets tangled too quick even when you&#x27;re wearing ityou straighten it</li>
            <li>so i got super glue and ran it along the rim</li>
            <li>Looks super faux.</li>
            <li>beautiful but not thick enough for my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decided to purchase this hair for a quick look.</li>
            <li>, the price would still be pretty cheap for hair extensions.</li>
            <li>Like these better hair not thick.</li>
            <li>its long black and sexy it is perfect for me</li>
            <li>But looks great none the less</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of the hair, It is easy to comb.</li>
            <li>The estimated time of arrival was listed as Jul 31-Aug 16, but these came on Jul 26, very early, and on top of that they came all the way from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>I rather give it no stars, when I purchased these it said it was real, and it took two months to get to me!!</li>
            <li>It looks like real hair!!</li>
            <li>It will have a mild shine which will look more natural and also, HAIRSPRAY when you style your hair will help.</li>
            <li>One positive thing i will say is that the seller did do its best to handle my complaint.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast  and packaged securely.</li>
            <li>For the price its fun.</li>
            <li>They sent me another one and its not even worth the wait and money.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s minimum shedding and tottally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Blends perfectly with pressed African American hair and is very well made</li>
            <li>hair is worth the price.</li>
            <li>its nice overall.</li>
            <li>this hair isn&#x27;t evem worth one star...</li>
            <li>So I just got these hair extensions yesterday, and I was pleased with how early they arrived.</li>
            <li>This matches my hair color perfectly and confused everyone I saw when I wore it.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.</li>
            <li>it came to my house fast nice and soft to the touch and the right length</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start with the good: the hair was very beautiful and goddess-like, it was quite soft and shiny( although some people may consider that a bad thing)and overall looked pretty good.</li>
            <li>Tangles easyily but love it other than that :)</li>
            <li>it came a dark brown, but I loved anyways, now my 4 years old princess can used too :)</li>
            <li>It said that it was real but when i got it, i was so excited and</li>
            <li>and it tingles right after</li>
            <li>color, brightness and length of extensions right for me.</li>
            <li>Decent quality for cheap money.  </li>
            <li>This extension is this and full and the clips are very high quality.</li>
            <li>I liked the hair piece but its not for long term use.</li>
            <li>Nice and long.</li>
            <li>This is apsolutly worth every cent of purchase, hair is large, beautiful, you can wash it, and dry in a low temperature, but it can not be washed like a real one, you are just gonna wash it with the shampoo and than put conditioner without rinse it, just dry with conditioner, and it will be beautiful shiny, and it is gonna last more than a real one.</li>
            <li>There really synthetic like super shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this is average synthetic hair, and for the price, it&#x27;s actually pretty good.</li>
            <li>The black was gorgeous , but it looked like Bratz fill hair .</li>
            <li>i love it thanks for the fast shipping i love you guys so much im so getting this again later when my hair grows a lit</li>
            <li>ws really soft ( kinda tangles easy</li>
            <li>single detailing product I own</li>
            <li>so it matches perfectly and when i style my hair just right, it doesnt even look fake</li>
            <li>very very long&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, good packaging,  long length, nice jet black color....</li>
            <li>Freaked so many people out, especially after I put a fan for that &#x27;hair blowing in the wind&#x27; effect.</li>
            <li>The clips fell out the piece was selling together in the center and on my first attempt to add it to my own hair it fell apart in my hands.</li>
            <li>Helps plump up my post-menopausal thinning hair and looks exactly like my hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown in picture.  </li>
            <li>i personally dont use these anymore, if i were to, id buy curly ones theyre more durable and can bounce and move around.</li>
            <li>Otherwise shipping was fast !</li>
            <li>You cant dye it so it has to be your EXACT shade.</li>
            <li>I will totally recommend :)</li>
            <li>They are soft and long and a good thickness.</li>
            <li>no stars because it is synthetic hair and it tingles real fast but not recommend you buy this if you are looking for real hair because its notit does not look like the picture and its way shinier</li>
            <li>/dampen it with water from a spray bottle, FIRST.</li>
            <li>The extentions are good for a few wears but after like 3 times they get raggedy and knotted.</li>
            <li>it is shiny and super soft!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this unless you have super straight hair that you don&#x27;t want to curl, or very curly hair that you don&#x27;t want to straighten.</li>
            <li>I bought two of the black color, they look great and natural, and the color is just as i wanted.</li>
            <li>I could not wait another whole month for it to be returned and then another month to get to right color.</li>
            <li>took forever to ship, hair fell out constantly but for only a couple bucks it was good for the two times i did wear them.</li>
            <li>i would have to find hair with a little more texture for me // not totally disappointed for the price</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and wanted to be able to switch it up and have long hair for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li>i have relaxed hair tried flat ironing it bone straight to help blend better .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everytime I brushed them, hair just fell out, and moving around they would get tangled easy.</li>
            <li>the package was easy to open.</li>
            <li>easy to clip to my actual hair.</li>
            <li>It makes me look so saxy, also really easy to put on, don&#x27;t forget that those are clips, so they open and close in your hair.</li>
            <li>so thats what kind of hair your gonna get the extensions weren&#x27;t full or thick.</li>
            <li>Very soft and worth the wait</li>
            <li>Good enough though for a day of long hair!</li>
            <li>you can actually see through the the fine fibers that are not hair.</li>
            <li>:) top platinum blonde, bottom is black.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be hearing a nice little review about how unprofessional your product is.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for 7.99 with free shipping and although the price was not much I don&#x27;t feel that it was worth it at all</li>
            <li>just buy the real thing instead.</li>
            <li>I truly did not expect much given the price.</li>
            <li>I am very disapointed.</li>
            <li>and it gets tangled really fast .</li>
            <li>i didnt keep it straight</li>
            <li>i tried the method another reviewer used and ran superglue along the band and it has seemed to stop shedding as much.</li>
            <li>It is ready to comb and does not tangle</li>
            <li>Not to mention the hair sheds sooo much.</li>
            <li>The hair is very shiny.</li>
            <li>the problem with the material is that you cant really move it or separate the hair.</li>
            <li>so everyone thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li>WHILE I FIX MY REAL HAIR</li>
            <li>SUCH CHEAP HAIR</li>
            <li>but you can straight it</li>
            <li>It covered up my whole head.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what are the people expecting for this price.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>i cant really talk about a product.</li>
            <li>was really looking foward to trying this out.</li>
            <li>I really like it, and its not as shiny as people say.</li>
            <li>thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>: can&#x27;t use much heat.</li>
            <li>Depends on how much hair you have in the curler and your type of curler.</li>
            <li>no one would think it was real.</li>
            <li>I just wish that had these in blonde with light brown.</li>
            <li>it was way to straight and shinny for me ..</li>
            <li>It is not very strong and very easy to fall off when comb.</li>
            <li>I will probably use it more for wearing a braid or maybe when I want a fuller look with my other extensions.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is chestnut brown and when I clip these in it I have an under layer of black, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Be careful with the clips so as not to damage your own hair or cause breakage and feel like you have nice, thick, flowy hair again!</li>
            <li>I received them today and let me say, they are SUPER long and very straight, not wavy as some describe,</li>
            <li>they werent really what i thought they would be there a little goddish for my taste, but there okay thanks</li>
            <li>you have medium - super thick hair please buy more than 3.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>, I talked my mom into buying me hair die, so I hope when I wear it next it looks real, but the hair is more like Asian girl hair</li>
            <li>So, the early arrival was the first pro.</li>
            <li>This hair was really soft and pretty</li>
            <li>Did not like hair too shiny and had alot of static hair would not stay down...</li>
            <li>The hair is nice and thick, looks and feels real</li>
            <li>Came earlier than expected, it was nice and longer</li>
            <li>I will not ever order from this particular company again.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t shed any more than any other extensions I&#x27;ve bought and although synthetic can take to some low heat curling but since they are so long they turn more into waves.</li>
            <li>However do not straighten them or curl them on high heat.</li>
            <li>I had to cut it just a little to make it look more realistic...</li>
            <li>easy to style and not noticeable like other companies i have tried.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the hair falls out on them if you use a big brush or anything, so use a little comb lol</li>
            <li>So if you have straight hair, you will probably need to get a curling iron and make a slight wave in your own hair before wearing these, because you can&#x27;t flat iron them</li>
            <li>They match her hair color very well and look natural.</li>
            <li>They are full and thick, one group so easier to instal, the hair was smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice and thick and shiny</li>
            <li>Nice and thick hair extensions.</li>
            <li>It was soft on the top part of the hair than more than half way through it was knotted and felt like dead hair.</li>
            <li>I was waithing in about one mounth and it is goureous and super long.</li>
            <li>Absolutely live them and when the time comes I deffinitly will buy them again</li>
            <li>But im ordering a new pair</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t tangle it or you&#x27;ll have to buy a new one</li>
            <li>How much depends on how big your sink is and how much water.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very soft</li>
            <li>to be synthetic hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li>and if you have to wear two pieces its even worse although they look in top shape right out of the package they are going to tangle</li>
            <li>The first times I&#x27;ve worn them, was alright, but definitely not reusable.</li>
            <li>I recommend them only if you know they are pretty disposable.</li>
            <li>It is the EXACT same hair that is on my daughter&#x27;s Barbie !</li>
            <li>Omfg I ordered these like a week ago and received them today, and they are SO soft !</li>
            <li>it actually looks like real hair and feels like it too!</li>
            <li>But it think you may need a small nape piece to blend the extention better.  </li>
            <li>They all said wow your hair has grown a lot!</li>
            <li>I recommend you getting them especially if they are your first extensions.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for this hair piece because the hair itself gets tangled very easily and it kinda thin.</li>
            <li>and when i got it... the hair came in one whole piece which i disliked about it.. but other than that its nice and soft and cant wait to put it in!</li>
            <li>This items was shipped quickly and i got it sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>Get two though cause they are not very thick.</li>
            <li>Well, I got busy and forgot.</li>
            <li>There soft</li>
            <li>Not cover whole head, sheds alot, but does blend welll with MY hair personally sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty</li>
            <li>(obviously, it isnt real hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried on these extensions they are completely tangled</li>
            <li>I would advise you to not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>The hair does not look like it does in the photo, and it&#x27;s entirely too straight to match with my hair texture.</li>
            <li>The length is not the same as it&#x27;s described, (actually much shorter).</li>
            <li>Its definitely long and pretty</li>
            <li>but they gladly fixed that problem.</li>
            <li>WAIT until that piece dries COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li>Your curls will be bouncy and soft like you just got the hair.</li>
            <li>NATURAL &gt;</li>
            <li>and I have natural hair</li>
            <li>however I will be straightening my natural hair before putting this hair in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think you can call it a full head clip if it only covers half of your head.</li>
            <li>it is also super long I these are better than the $30 synthetic extensions I buy at beauty stores I bought two and cut one piece which has 5 clips into  two pieces one with 2 clips and one with 3 and since my hair is rather thin</li>
            <li>I really wished I would have read the reviews before purchasing this hot mess.</li>
            <li>this item is not what it seem to be it states full head clip which is not true.</li>
            <li>It is not black.</li>
            <li>They are not actually black.</li>
            <li>but they are not black.</li>
            <li>it tangled very easily when i took it out of the bag, plus i couldnt untangle it with a comb, combing it just made it worse.</li>
            <li>Super cheap.. fake hair.</li>
            <li>Extensions quickly arrived much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>and I have a few tips on how to straighten natural hair w/o using grease or oily products AND get it STRAIGHT to work well with this hair if anyone wants to know.</li>
            <li>it hardly tangled and if it does its easy to take them out.</li>
            <li>good for the price but very obvious that it was fake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten clip ins before but these are very soft, I could actually use my brush on them and hair didn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>first, it wants to cling to the shirts I wear, which causes them to look very messy.</li>
            <li>I got the extensions today and the way it was packed made the hair curly on top which I disliked about it because it was folded, and there was a lot of tangle, and had to wash it before trying it on, but other than that I like the extensions.</li>
            <li>They came really early, their luxuriously long and soft.</li>
            <li>it will straighten the hair BACK to make it soft.</li>
            <li>Kind of sad to check the mail every day with hopes of receiving something you have paid for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are good long extensions but are FAKE.</li>
            <li>Pros: they are long and very soft.</li>
            <li>Uuugh won&#x27;t buy this hot mess again.</li>
            <li>However I expected to be able to at least use the product once before it fell apart and was sorely just appointment.</li>
            <li>this is by far the most sad.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re thick and full.</li>
            <li>Long, very straight, too straight looks fake because it&#x27;s so straight.</li>
            <li>I filled my sink halfway with cold water FIRST.</li>
            <li>They are deffenitly black and very shines looking.</li>
            <li>but it MUST DRY COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li>They are very close to black</li>
            <li>The only negative about this product is, it doesn&#x27;t give you full hair, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because I ordered platinum blonde extensions as well,</li>
            <li>I bought these and was very skeptical because of the bad reviews but they were wonderful shipping was fast the hair although a bit shiny deffinitly looks real</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for a little over five bucks</li>
            <li>They are sending me a new one and letting me keep the other one.</li>
            <li>Second, when I got these, le me just say I have not worn them yet, but based on what they look like I have both good and bad things to say.</li>

            <li> more ok</li>
            <li> the hair is okay, tangles easily.nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a way to handle that.</li>
            <li> How many times you do this, depends on how tangled it is.</li>
            <li> lil more in.</li>
            <li> HOPE THIS HELPS :-)</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t expect more for the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was thinking that it would be more than one piece</li>
            <li> it feels really nice and not like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I had the intention of using it the day of my wedding to ensure my wedding look was perfect, but I ended up just using my natural hair and changed my look I had originally picked.</li>
            <li> but when I got them they were smooth, and I really liked them really easy to use (:</li>
            <li> Not natural or anything, but for a costume it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I loved them so much when they came in the mail!</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t real hair , &amp; the price is more than reasonable so you can&#x27;t expect it to be perfect .</li>
            <li> The hair is really long and shiny and they matched my hair color perfectly.</li>
            <li> But they work pretty good considering that.</li>
            <li> I would def check it out and recommend a purchase because for the value it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I had received the package a week earlier than it had said which was nice!!</li>
            <li> but if you can get your hair super straigh it should blend fine for you! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money honestly.</li>
            <li> Other than that, excellent product!</li>
            <li> but they shed easy</li>
            <li> i would recommend it to anyone it does get tangled easy but</li>
            <li> These tangle easily if you don&#x27;t have them in your head.</li>
            <li> And easy to brush</li>
            <li> look.the hair is easy to put on and remove, doesn&#x27;t slide out of place while wearing.</li>
            <li> Shipped out very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The hair in them pulls out so easily.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty nice tho.</li>
            <li> but if I wear a hat it looks fine</li>
            <li> I curled them on low-medium heat and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> but otherwise they work perfectly fine for me</li>
            <li> but i just needed to super glue the top</li>
            <li> I have thing straight hair that it pretty much worked perfectly with.</li>
            <li> the hair is real and matches my own quite well, easy to clip in and style, but a lot does fall out.</li>
            <li> but if you are just starting to get into hair extensions &amp; need something cheap then they are great.</li>
            <li> its a cheap price so expect what u pay.</li>
            <li> Its so cheap and has almost no hair.</li>
            <li> The hair looks like a cheap wig u would buy from the drug store on halloween.</li>
            <li> Yes these are def cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, let me just say that the picture is still kind of misleading, because if you are expecting these extensions to be stick straight then don&#x27;t get them.</li>
            <li> Honestly if you pay $6 for extensions you shouldnt expect much.</li>
            <li> and the price is dirt cheap</li>
            <li> free wig cap.</li>
            <li> looks good and soft</li>
            <li> Right now I see myself ordering more..</li>
            <li> , the curls came out awesome, compared to all the other extensions I bought, this is worth the $</li>
            <li> Its super long and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> They are good for a special ocassion but not everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Def worth the pricee!</li>
            <li> was so excited when they arrived.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s still in great condition as long as you take care of it .</li>
            <li> Worth the wait of shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Spend a few more $$$ for a nice weave!</li>
            <li> Proper color and good timing but one broke clip</li>
            <li> and it still did&#x27;nt provide full coverage</li>
            <li> I did however trim them up a bit because they were a bit longer than I wanted them to be and put a bit of baby powder on them to make them look a bit more real.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> I ordered a full set of clips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true when they say: &amp;#34;You get what you pay for!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> + of these for a full head like I did</li>
            <li> But for the price, I didnt really expect more.</li>
            <li> try a different product if your looking for good hair extensions.</li>
            <li> I guess when i read full head</li>
            <li> the hair was not bad but it just didnt blend well with my hair ..</li>
            <li> Other than that the hair length of great along with the texture.</li>
            <li> I will more than likely be buying more.</li>
            <li> but if your looking for some quick volume , &amp; or length I recommend this hair</li>
            <li> do not stay in place and the hair gets tangled too quick even when you&#x27;re wearing ityou straighten it</li>
            <li> so i got super glue and ran it along the rim</li>
            <li> Looks super faux.</li>
            <li> beautiful but not thick enough for my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase this hair for a quick look.</li>
            <li> , the price would still be pretty cheap for hair extensions.</li>
            <li> Like these better hair not thick.</li>
            <li> its long black and sexy it is perfect for me</li>
            <li> But looks great none the less</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of the hair, It is easy to comb.</li>
            <li> The estimated time of arrival was listed as Jul 31-Aug 16, but these came on Jul 26, very early, and on top of that they came all the way from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> I rather give it no stars, when I purchased these it said it was real, and it took two months to get to me!!</li>
            <li> It looks like real hair!!</li>
            <li> It will have a mild shine which will look more natural and also, HAIRSPRAY when you style your hair will help.</li>
            <li> One positive thing i will say is that the seller did do its best to handle my complaint.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast  and packaged securely.</li>
            <li> For the price its fun.</li>
            <li> They sent me another one and its not even worth the wait and money.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s minimum shedding and tottally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Blends perfectly with pressed African American hair and is very well made</li>
            <li> hair is worth the price.</li>
            <li> its nice overall.</li>
            <li> this hair isn&#x27;t evem worth one star...</li>
            <li> So I just got these hair extensions yesterday, and I was pleased with how early they arrived.</li>
            <li> This matches my hair color perfectly and confused everyone I saw when I wore it.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money.</li>
            <li> it came to my house fast nice and soft to the touch and the right length</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the good: the hair was very beautiful and goddess-like, it was quite soft and shiny( although some people may consider that a bad thing)and overall looked pretty good.</li>
            <li> Tangles easyily but love it other than that :)</li>
            <li> it came a dark brown, but I loved anyways, now my 4 years old princess can used too :)</li>
            <li> It said that it was real but when i got it, i was so excited and</li>
            <li> and it tingles right after</li>
            <li> color, brightness and length of extensions right for me.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for cheap money.  </li>
            <li> This extension is this and full and the clips are very high quality.</li>
            <li> I liked the hair piece but its not for long term use.</li>
            <li> Nice and long.</li>
            <li> This is apsolutly worth every cent of purchase, hair is large, beautiful, you can wash it, and dry in a low temperature, but it can not be washed like a real one, you are just gonna wash it with the shampoo and than put conditioner without rinse it, just dry with conditioner, and it will be beautiful shiny, and it is gonna last more than a real one.</li>
            <li> There really synthetic like super shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this is average synthetic hair, and for the price, it&#x27;s actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> The black was gorgeous , but it looked like Bratz fill hair .</li>
            <li> i love it thanks for the fast shipping i love you guys so much im so getting this again later when my hair grows a lit</li>
            <li> ws really soft ( kinda tangles easy</li>
            <li> single detailing product I own</li>
            <li> so it matches perfectly and when i style my hair just right, it doesnt even look fake</li>
            <li> very very long&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, good packaging,  long length, nice jet black color....</li>
            <li> Freaked so many people out, especially after I put a fan for that &#x27;hair blowing in the wind&#x27; effect.</li>
            <li> The clips fell out the piece was selling together in the center and on my first attempt to add it to my own hair it fell apart in my hands.</li>
            <li> Helps plump up my post-menopausal thinning hair and looks exactly like my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown in picture.  </li>
            <li> i personally dont use these anymore, if i were to, id buy curly ones theyre more durable and can bounce and move around.</li>
            <li> Otherwise shipping was fast !</li>
            <li> You cant dye it so it has to be your EXACT shade.</li>
            <li> I will totally recommend :)</li>
            <li> They are soft and long and a good thickness.</li>
            <li> no stars because it is synthetic hair and it tingles real fast but not recommend you buy this if you are looking for real hair because its notit does not look like the picture and its way shinier</li>
            <li> /dampen it with water from a spray bottle, FIRST.</li>
            <li> The extentions are good for a few wears but after like 3 times they get raggedy and knotted.</li>
            <li> it is shiny and super soft!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this unless you have super straight hair that you don&#x27;t want to curl, or very curly hair that you don&#x27;t want to straighten.</li>
            <li> I bought two of the black color, they look great and natural, and the color is just as i wanted.</li>
            <li> I could not wait another whole month for it to be returned and then another month to get to right color.</li>
            <li> took forever to ship, hair fell out constantly but for only a couple bucks it was good for the two times i did wear them.</li>
            <li> i would have to find hair with a little more texture for me // not totally disappointed for the price</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and wanted to be able to switch it up and have long hair for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li> i have relaxed hair tried flat ironing it bone straight to help blend better .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everytime I brushed them, hair just fell out, and moving around they would get tangled easy.</li>
            <li> the package was easy to open.</li>
            <li> easy to clip to my actual hair.</li>
            <li> It makes me look so saxy, also really easy to put on, don&#x27;t forget that those are clips, so they open and close in your hair.</li>
            <li> so thats what kind of hair your gonna get the extensions weren&#x27;t full or thick.</li>
            <li> Very soft and worth the wait</li>
            <li> Good enough though for a day of long hair!</li>
            <li> you can actually see through the the fine fibers that are not hair.</li>
            <li> :) top platinum blonde, bottom is black.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be hearing a nice little review about how unprofessional your product is.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for 7.99 with free shipping and although the price was not much I don&#x27;t feel that it was worth it at all</li>
            <li> just buy the real thing instead.</li>
            <li> I truly did not expect much given the price.</li>
            <li> I am very disapointed.</li>
            <li> and it gets tangled really fast .</li>
            <li> i didnt keep it straight</li>
            <li> i tried the method another reviewer used and ran superglue along the band and it has seemed to stop shedding as much.</li>
            <li> It is ready to comb and does not tangle</li>
            <li> Not to mention the hair sheds sooo much.</li>
            <li> The hair is very shiny.</li>
            <li> the problem with the material is that you cant really move it or separate the hair.</li>
            <li> so everyone thought it was my real hair.</li>
            <li> WHILE I FIX MY REAL HAIR</li>
            <li> SUCH CHEAP HAIR</li>
            <li> but you can straight it</li>
            <li> It covered up my whole head.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what are the people expecting for this price.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> i cant really talk about a product.</li>
            <li> was really looking foward to trying this out.</li>
            <li> I really like it, and its not as shiny as people say.</li>
            <li> thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> : can&#x27;t use much heat.</li>
            <li> Depends on how much hair you have in the curler and your type of curler.</li>
            <li> no one would think it was real.</li>
            <li> I just wish that had these in blonde with light brown.</li>
            <li> it was way to straight and shinny for me ..</li>
            <li> It is not very strong and very easy to fall off when comb.</li>
            <li> I will probably use it more for wearing a braid or maybe when I want a fuller look with my other extensions.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is chestnut brown and when I clip these in it I have an under layer of black, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Be careful with the clips so as not to damage your own hair or cause breakage and feel like you have nice, thick, flowy hair again!</li>
            <li> I received them today and let me say, they are SUPER long and very straight, not wavy as some describe,</li>
            <li> they werent really what i thought they would be there a little goddish for my taste, but there okay thanks</li>
            <li> you have medium - super thick hair please buy more than 3.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> , I talked my mom into buying me hair die, so I hope when I wear it next it looks real, but the hair is more like Asian girl hair</li>
            <li> So, the early arrival was the first pro.</li>
            <li> This hair was really soft and pretty</li>
            <li> Did not like hair too shiny and had alot of static hair would not stay down...</li>
            <li> The hair is nice and thick, looks and feels real</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected, it was nice and longer</li>
            <li> I will not ever order from this particular company again.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t shed any more than any other extensions I&#x27;ve bought and although synthetic can take to some low heat curling but since they are so long they turn more into waves.</li>
            <li> However do not straighten them or curl them on high heat.</li>
            <li> I had to cut it just a little to make it look more realistic...</li>
            <li> easy to style and not noticeable like other companies i have tried.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the hair falls out on them if you use a big brush or anything, so use a little comb lol</li>
            <li> So if you have straight hair, you will probably need to get a curling iron and make a slight wave in your own hair before wearing these, because you can&#x27;t flat iron them</li>
            <li> They match her hair color very well and look natural.</li>
            <li> They are full and thick, one group so easier to instal, the hair was smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice and thick and shiny</li>
            <li> Nice and thick hair extensions.</li>
            <li> It was soft on the top part of the hair than more than half way through it was knotted and felt like dead hair.</li>
            <li> I was waithing in about one mounth and it is goureous and super long.</li>
            <li> Absolutely live them and when the time comes I deffinitly will buy them again</li>
            <li> But im ordering a new pair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t tangle it or you&#x27;ll have to buy a new one</li>
            <li> How much depends on how big your sink is and how much water.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very soft</li>
            <li> to be synthetic hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li> and if you have to wear two pieces its even worse although they look in top shape right out of the package they are going to tangle</li>
            <li> The first times I&#x27;ve worn them, was alright, but definitely not reusable.</li>
            <li> I recommend them only if you know they are pretty disposable.</li>
            <li> It is the EXACT same hair that is on my daughter&#x27;s Barbie !</li>
            <li> Omfg I ordered these like a week ago and received them today, and they are SO soft !</li>
            <li> it actually looks like real hair and feels like it too!</li>
            <li> But it think you may need a small nape piece to blend the extention better.  </li>
            <li> They all said wow your hair has grown a lot!</li>
            <li> I recommend you getting them especially if they are your first extensions.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for this hair piece because the hair itself gets tangled very easily and it kinda thin.</li>
            <li> and when i got it... the hair came in one whole piece which i disliked about it.. but other than that its nice and soft and cant wait to put it in!</li>
            <li> This items was shipped quickly and i got it sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> Get two though cause they are not very thick.</li>
            <li> Well, I got busy and forgot.</li>
            <li> There soft</li>
            <li> Not cover whole head, sheds alot, but does blend welll with MY hair personally sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty</li>
            <li> (obviously, it isnt real hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried on these extensions they are completely tangled</li>
            <li> I would advise you to not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> The hair does not look like it does in the photo, and it&#x27;s entirely too straight to match with my hair texture.</li>
            <li> The length is not the same as it&#x27;s described, (actually much shorter).</li>
            <li> Its definitely long and pretty</li>
            <li> but they gladly fixed that problem.</li>
            <li> WAIT until that piece dries COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li> Your curls will be bouncy and soft like you just got the hair.</li>
            <li> NATURAL &gt;</li>
            <li> and I have natural hair</li>
            <li> however I will be straightening my natural hair before putting this hair in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think you can call it a full head clip if it only covers half of your head.</li>
            <li> it is also super long I these are better than the $30 synthetic extensions I buy at beauty stores I bought two and cut one piece which has 5 clips into  two pieces one with 2 clips and one with 3 and since my hair is rather thin</li>
            <li> I really wished I would have read the reviews before purchasing this hot mess.</li>
            <li> this item is not what it seem to be it states full head clip which is not true.</li>
            <li> It is not black.</li>
            <li> They are not actually black.</li>
            <li> but they are not black.</li>
            <li> it tangled very easily when i took it out of the bag, plus i couldnt untangle it with a comb, combing it just made it worse.</li>
            <li> Super cheap.. fake hair.</li>
            <li> Extensions quickly arrived much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> and I have a few tips on how to straighten natural hair w/o using grease or oily products AND get it STRAIGHT to work well with this hair if anyone wants to know.</li>
            <li> it hardly tangled and if it does its easy to take them out.</li>
            <li> good for the price but very obvious that it was fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten clip ins before but these are very soft, I could actually use my brush on them and hair didn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> first, it wants to cling to the shirts I wear, which causes them to look very messy.</li>
            <li> I got the extensions today and the way it was packed made the hair curly on top which I disliked about it because it was folded, and there was a lot of tangle, and had to wash it before trying it on, but other than that I like the extensions.</li>
            <li> They came really early, their luxuriously long and soft.</li>
            <li> it will straighten the hair BACK to make it soft.</li>
            <li> Kind of sad to check the mail every day with hopes of receiving something you have paid for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are good long extensions but are FAKE.</li>
            <li> Pros: they are long and very soft.</li>
            <li> Uuugh won&#x27;t buy this hot mess again.</li>
            <li> However I expected to be able to at least use the product once before it fell apart and was sorely just appointment.</li>
            <li> this is by far the most sad.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re thick and full.</li>
            <li> Long, very straight, too straight looks fake because it&#x27;s so straight.</li>
            <li> I filled my sink halfway with cold water FIRST.</li>
            <li> They are deffenitly black and very shines looking.</li>
            <li> but it MUST DRY COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li> They are very close to black</li>
            <li> The only negative about this product is, it doesn&#x27;t give you full hair, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because I ordered platinum blonde extensions as well,</li>
            <li> I bought these and was very skeptical because of the bad reviews but they were wonderful shipping was fast the hair although a bit shiny deffinitly looks real</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for a little over five bucks</li>
            <li> They are sending me a new one and letting me keep the other one.</li>
            <li> Second, when I got these, le me just say I have not worn them yet, but based on what they look like I have both good and bad things to say.</li>
            <li> the shipping was slow but this was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I really recommend buying this if you are looking for long black hair extensions.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love this hair because it adds volume to my very thin hair</li>
            <li> its soft and not super shiney like most fake hair and it does shed</li>
            <li> My suggestion if you won&#x27;t it too look real , put very little heat on it and powder .</li>
            <li> The hair is too straight and you are not able to curl or do anything to the hair.  </li>
            <li> its short and not even that long.</li>
            <li> This item takes too long to arrive and when it&#x27;s finally get there</li>
            <li> i can curl or flat iron the hair.</li>
            <li> It was super thin and knotted.  </li>
            <li> They stayed in very nice and a little tattoo sick on and weave cap came in the order.</li>
            <li> Not made for African American hair- extremely stringy.</li>
            <li> thin, easily tangled, not easy to blend with hair, have two I ordered last MONTH and still have not been delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you need at least two for your whole head</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to just add body to already long hair, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I got it WAY earlier than the expected date.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna buy this buy two of them and don&#x27;t get them so long</li>
            <li> They took way too long to receive about one month</li>
            <li> She is trying to grow her hair long and this helps in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> It is long and not noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it took so long to come 1 month</li>
            <li> Came well packaged, arrived earlier than expected....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a long time to arrive</li>
            <li> Full enough to not look bad and soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I loved these a lot a read the reviews and was a little worried they were gonna be bad.</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to ship.</li>
            <li> shiny, but dry shampoo will do the trick.</li>
            <li> let the ink dry, this will dye the hair as well as getting rid of the shine.</li>
            <li> BUT it must be on the lowest heat possible anywhere from 80-100 degrees and only hold it in the curling iron for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> and I just wear this peasly piece under my thick natural hair , i did curl it with a low heat curling iron then held the curl with pins overnight</li>
            <li> loose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5 foot 10 and the hair come all the way down my back.</li>
            <li> it can take heat but not high heat</li>
            <li> I used it for a costume, and it arrived a month and a half later.</li>
            <li> By the second time worn it was a tangled mess</li>
            <li> The hair is very tangly which makes it very hard to style.  </li>
            <li> It was also the same color as shown in the picture, so for those people complaining about the wrong color I don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re talking about.</li>
            <li> The only thing i did not like about this is the hair does look very shiny and fake.</li>
            <li> No never never again this product no real</li>
            <li> but thats to be expected from the price.</li>
            <li> But that did not really matter, but</li>
            <li> it did not mach my hair at all, cause my hair was black and Blue, but the black in my hair turned to drown and it looked super fake in my hair</li>
            <li> They were wavy not straight.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t know if this is because they were folded up and stuffed in a package, or if that&#x27;s just the texture, but either way, don&#x27;t be fooled these are not straight.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Its way too shiny and obviously not real hair.</li>
            <li> 1# wet the hair</li>
            <li> It is definitely not real hair...</li>
            <li> It was much too thin and so shiny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real hair</li>
            <li> this was not what I expected when I got it</li>
            <li> i expected black, but it was a very dark brown; a natural black.</li>
            <li> Also when I held them up to my head they were very long( came down to about my waist)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care that it is not a full head because my hair is long as is</li>
            <li> These extensions were VERY shiny and thin and I bought two sets and it still didn&#x27;t blend with my black hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered these extensions they said 7pc when really it&#x27;s only one the hair always falls out when brushing or combing and they won&#x27;t style small for you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an avid fake hair user</li>
            <li> The due date these were suppose to arrive was August 23rd.</li>
            <li> The clips r sooooo small they can&#x27;t even clip in your hair properly.</li>
            <li> I have never even gotten to use it because the hair is extremely frizzy, matted, and knotted.</li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> IS LEAVING A LITTLE CONDITIONER IN THE HAIR AND LETTING IT DRY</li>
            <li> and I have very fluffy German hair, but nothing a straightener can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> i tried curling mine on low heat and it was a complete fail.</li>
            <li> They are not nearly as straight as they are depicted, when I got them they were actually slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> Bad decision , its cheap</li>
            <li> Definitely get two if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> soft just alot of hair was falling out cuz the sewing was poor</li>
            <li> To do this... just get your handheld steamer and hold it over the piece of hair and go up and down w/ the steamer while you run your comb thru that piece.</li>
            <li> One other thing after combing it tends to get a little tangled</li>
            <li> the color though wasn&#x27;t black</li>
            <li> my hair is all jet black</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you&#x27;re black.</li>
            <li> now it seem like less hair falls out.</li>
            <li> cause my hair is half and half</li>
            <li> It is NOT full head.</li>
            <li> Came in a bundle of tangled mess.</li>
            <li> Not even close to what the description was.so not full head.</li>
            <li> its not a full head of extensions.</li>
            <li> I did like it however always brush it after each use because it does get tangled and just a mess</li>
            <li> But it is sooo thick and long</li>
            <li> When they came in the mail they were a little bent up</li>
            <li> I gave this hair to my little girl to play dress up with.</li>
            <li> so not worth it!</li>
            <li> It does tangle and shreds a little bit, but for that price I can&#x27;t ask for a lot.</li>
            <li> You can also use a little hair spray while curling your damp synthetic hair as well.</li>
            <li> I thought the hair would be thin, super shiny, and would be too heavy in my hair, but I was all wrong.</li>
            <li> it is very dark and shiny</li>
            <li> I give the seller 5 stars for customer service but the product is a waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> IT CAN GET MESSY</li>
            <li> THE WAY I KEEP IT FROM GETTING MESSY</li>
            <li> these are a waste of money</li>
            <li> and there are a few ways.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money .</li>
            <li> The strand it is made out of is also very thin, so for those who have thick hair, like me, it might be more difficult to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are too stiff</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter who is 15 and is not easy to please and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> (Dont mess up your order!</li>
            <li> Would pass for real hair but definitely very fake, well ofcourse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another problem I had with these was you have to be very delicate in handling them, one wrong move and thy will get very tangled and might start shedding.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> BUT A USUAL DAY I ALWAYS STRAIGHTEN IT AND HAVE HAD NO ISSUES</li>
            <li> I usually just braid my hair when i use them so that the braid looks fuller and longer</li>
            <li> is over a week past delivery date listed.</li>
            <li> it was obvious that it was definetly fake .. not for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very thin, and the clip was way to big to go around my scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It get knotted and tangled all the time and very heavy.</li>
            <li> They are too long and look fake.</li>
            <li> It does not fall out, but hard to mantain.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy, I felt like it was going to show, but I ordered the wrong color</li>
            <li> feel fake and ook fake do not waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> IT sucks cuz i tried to curl</li>
            <li> It was sent late  </li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought it even with the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> But I can say that you&#x27;ll have to at least put a cup or</li>
            <li> but if you have thick hair you might need to buy 3</li>
            <li> becuz I&#x27;m forced to... :-|</li>
            <li> , it was a bit exhausting to wear all day as it becomes heavy.</li>
            <li> BUT A THICK ROW OF HAIR</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t as thick as it appears in the photos.  </li>
            <li> Take the steamer OFF that piece and release the curling iron slowly while keeping the curl in place.</li>
            <li> so your hair doesn&#x27;t look thin and choppy (unless you go for that look)</li>
            <li> If you cut or use heat, they will damage though due to the fact they they are 100% synthetic (fake).</li>
            <li> but i mean its not horrible)&lt;br /&gt;the clips are nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they were very thin, very shiny, and very fake looking.</li>
            <li> also for thick hair you may want to get 2, i noticed it was thin in my hair since i have thick hair</li>
            <li> so sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> not good at all, don&#x27;t waist you money.</li>
            <li> Always getting tangled .. Not a good choice</li>
            <li> Very thick .</li>
            <li> Very thick, to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too thin.</li>
            <li> but when I got them one of the clips were broken.</li>
            <li> It is too thin</li>
            <li> poor poor quality</li>
            <li> unfortunately it came a day to late</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to thin not what I wanted will not get again</li>
            <li> These are some really thin clip in hair extensions.</li>
            <li> so I always looked like I had unhealthy hair.</li>
            <li> , what a terrible thing of them they never gave me my money back that sucks</li>
            <li> Evokes scary scenes from the movie The Grudge and The Ring.</li>
            <li> so perhaps I was going in blind thinking</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all with these extentions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its useless</li>
            <li> These extentions are not what they are described as in the description they are fake one time use</li>
            <li> This hair is too shiny and fake looking.</li>
            <li> not what my daughter thought it would be she was not impressed with this product</li>
            <li> This is extremely uncomfortable and it&#x27;s hurts my head a lot</li>
            <li> every thing but its fake</li>
            <li> It didnt look fake in any way whatso</li>
            <li> ill give it to a friend.</li>
            <li> but what do you expect when youre paying under 10 bucks for fake hair? will not buy again.</li>
            <li> but when I got it it was the wrong color</li>
            <li> These extensions look fake.</li>
            <li> Very thin and shiny, couldnt do anything with it</li>
            <li> to thin and looks very fake .</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t worn it yet as I have had to order another one to not look crazy when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> if possible.please Don&#x27;t  be fooled these &#x27;hair extensions&#x27; look very very very fake.</li>
            <li> I find that after one wear these are tangled badly after you take them out</li>
            <li> any handheld steamer to loosen up the synthetic hair if it tangles badly after you&#x27;ve had it for a while.</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair is so poor, worst synthetic I have ever seen in my life.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed once I received this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this purchase.</li>
            <li> No matter how I tried to style them they just wound up looking incredibly fake and awful.</li>
            <li> Received my package today &amp; I am very very unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely disappointed with this hair, its the worst hair I&#x27;ve bought, it gets tangled alot and sheds alot.</li>
            <li> ... horrible...</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This was a horrible product.</li>
            <li> However the ends got disgusting almost immediately</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered these extensions they said 7pc when really it&#x27;s only one the hair always falls out when brushing or combing and they won&#x27;t style small for you</li>
            <li> I would say I&#x27;m somewhat pleased with this product. its the length I wanted &amp; the color I wanted but I should have bought the wavy version of these hair extensions. I have found 2 problem with this product. first, it wants to cling to the shirts I wear, which causes them to look very messy. second, the clips don&#x27;t want to stay in my hair. I would not wear them for more than 4 hours at most but if you are just starting to get into hair extensions &amp; need something cheap then they are great. I would say I&#x27;m 70% pleased. keep in mind these are not human hair.</li>
            <li> Its super long and gorgeous! I wear it all the time and I absolutely love it, as does everyone else.</li>
            <li> I dident like them. The extentions kepted getting tangled and when ever i combed them hair would fall out i would not recommend  these extentions to anybody</li>
            <li> Definitely get two if you have thick hair. The first times I&#x27;ve worn them, was alright, but definitely not reusable. Eventually you start to tell they are plastic.</li>
            <li> Nice feel and easy too brush shiny i love it👌</li>
            <li> I was very happy. Full enough to not look bad and soft and silky. Will  be ordering a brown next .</li>
            <li> I liked the hair piece but its not for long term use. You can was it but it gets out of shape. it is perfect for use of one photo shoot or two if your lucky.  For the price its fun. I actually bought several and breezed thru them. I recommend them only if you know they are pretty disposable.</li>
            <li> to thin and looks very fake . just buy the real thing instead. i ended up throwing it away  i had no use for it</li>
            <li> Perfect for Halloween. Hung this in one of the tiles above my cubicle. Evokes scary scenes from the movie The Grudge and The Ring. Freaked so many people out, especially after I put a fan for that &#x27;hair blowing in the wind&#x27; effect. Every person who has touched it has loved the quality so I suppose it was a great price for an extension, or so I&#x27;ve been told</li>
            <li> The hair is very tangly which makes it very hard to style.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone because of this.</li>
            <li> I truly did not expect much given the price. However I expected to be able to at least use the product once before it fell apart and was sorely just appointment. The clips fell out the piece was selling together in the center and on my first attempt to add it to my own hair it fell apart in my hands. So after waiting over a month for my productit is now happily in the trash.</li>
            <li> The length is great. The color matched mine. One of the clips broke after one use. After sending the seller an email, they asked me to submit a picture. Well, I got busy and forgot. Besides, for the price I paid, I figured these were disposable anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was not pleased with is the amount of hair on it. It&#x27;s way too thin. If you&#x27;re looking to just add body to already long hair, then this is for you. I have shoulder length hair and wanted to be able to switch it up and have long hair for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, this isn&#x27;t it. I&#x27;m not an avid fake hair user so perhaps I was going in blind thinking this would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off one star for the lack of hair. Another star for the busted clip.</li>
            <li> There really synthetic like super shiny. There soft but they shed easy</li>
            <li> let me start by saying that it took like almost 3 months for me to receive this. It got \\&quot;lost\\&quot; in the mail therefore i never received it and i had to complain to the seller. They sent me another one and its not even worth the wait and money. its a cheap price so expect what u pay. Boy, was i disapointed. I will never order this again. Its so cheap and has almost no hair. Not to mention \\&quot;23 inches\\&quot; BOLOGNE!!!!! its short and not even that long. I am very disapointed. The hair looks like a cheap wig u would buy from the drug store on halloween. One positive thing i will say is that the seller did do its best to handle my complaint. I give the seller 5 stars for customer service but the product is a waste.</li>
            <li> I love the hair surge.I love the smell it smells like mint which i like, I will be getting more to use again and for my friends.</li>
            <li> They are nice but when I got them one of the clips were broken. Proper color and good timing but one broke clip</li>
            <li> I love this it is shiny and super soft!! i would recommend it to anyone it does get tangled easy but thats about it i love it i will order one soon.</li>
            <li> low cost, and does the same as the more expensive ones. My granddaughter loves it. She wears them to school all the time.</li>
            <li> i didnt get my extensions, what a terrible thing of them they never gave me my money back that sucks</li>
            <li> Beautiful got it today looks good and soft</li>
            <li> The extensions were perfect they clip in perfectly and stay. When they came in the mail they were a little bent up but it straightens out perfectly fine! They are deffenitly black and very shines looking. The only problem is the hair falls out on them if you use a big brush or anything, so use a little comb lol</li>
            <li> Love this product yall are amazing</li>
            <li> The hair I bought at the dollar store looks better than this ! It is NOT full head. It is not black. It is the EXACT same hair that is on my daughter&#x27;s Barbie ! Will NEVER buy from them again !</li>
            <li> Good texture and it&#x27;s very soft but it only consists of 1 track i purchaced 2 and it still did&#x27;nt provide full coverage and it gets tangled really fast . But the hair is good for the  price</li>
            <li> Really good....there&#x27;s minimum shedding and tottally worth every penny. Blends perfectly with pressed African American hair and is very well made</li>
            <li> I am so impressed by this item. I got it WAY earlier than the expected date. I wasn&#x27;t supposed to get it until the end of June and I received it today. I thought the hair would be thin, super shiny, and would be too heavy in my hair, but I was all wrong. The hair is nice and thick, looks and feels real and I can&#x27;t even tell that I have extensions in. I did however trim them up a bit because they were a bit longer than I wanted them to be and put a bit of baby powder on them to make them look a bit more real. They blend great with my hair and  I love them. I will more than likely be buying more.</li>
            <li> love this extension i didnt keep it straight i curler wanded it, it came out beautiful.. it can take heat but not high heat i also put a leave in conditioner in when using heat on the hair so it wont burn but i absolutely love them.. also for thick hair you may want to get 2, i noticed it was thin in my hair since i have thick hair but when i curled it it became fuller.. all in all its a good product!</li>
            <li> the shipping was slow but this was worth the wait. the hair is real and matches my own quite well, easy to clip in and style, but a lot does fall out. i tried the method another reviewer used and ran superglue along the band and it has seemed to stop shedding as much. for under $10 you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li> This product would have been great if I had receive the correct color that I ordered! Other than that the hair length of great along with the texture.</li>
            <li> I had received the package a week earlier than it had said which was nice!! the hair is awesomee! Def worth the pricee! I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my stepdaughter. She likes to change it up and this is great, no hair dying needed. Put it in and take it out whenever you want.</li>
            <li> I bought these and was very skeptical because of the bad reviews but they were wonderful shipping was fast the hair although a bit shiny deffinitly looks real it is also super long I these are better than the $30 synthetic extensions I buy at beauty stores I bought two and cut one piece which has 5 clips into  two pieces one with 2 clips and one with 3 and since my hair is rather thin that&#x27;s was all I needed and I cut the extensions layers a bit so it would blend better. These don&#x27;t shed any more than any other extensions I&#x27;ve bought and although synthetic can take to some low heat curling but since they are so long they turn more into waves. Absolutely live them and when the time comes I deffinitly will buy them again</li>
            <li> No never never again this product no real</li>
            <li> hair is worth the price. very strong clips. shiny, but dry shampoo will do the trick. the color was off. i expected black, but it was a very dark brown; a natural black. if this happens, marker ink wil dye it, not regular hair dye! let the ink dry, this will dye the hair as well as getting rid of the shine. its nice overall.</li>
            <li> I have ordered so many of these...&lt;br /&gt;Too thin, easily tangled, not easy to blend with hair, have two I ordered last MONTH and still have not been delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just go buy noncheap ones from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Does. Not cover whole head, sheds alot, but does blend welll with MY hair personally sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty</li>
            <li> The due date these were suppose to arrive was August 23rd. I received them today and let me say, they are SUPER long and very straight, not wavy as some describe, The only problem- These tangle easily if you don&#x27;t have them in your head.</li>
            <li> I really wished I would have read the reviews before purchasing this hot mess. The pic is definitely two pieces placed together. It is too thin you can actually see through the the fine fibers that are not hair. I didn&#x27;t expect much for a little over five bucks but I thought I would get something that wasn&#x27;t plastic. Uuugh won&#x27;t buy this hot mess again. I wish I could give no stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten clip ins before but these are very soft, I could actually use my brush on them and hair didn&#x27;t come out. They stayed in very nice and a little tattoo sick on and weave cap came in the order. I don&#x27;t know as gifts but that&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> Just like Laci l never received mines as well and it&#x27;s been almost two months. Kind of sad to check the mail every day with hopes of receiving something you have paid for. I would rate this a zero also.</li>
            <li> Helps plump up my post-menopausal thinning hair and looks exactly like my hair. Be careful with the clips so as not to damage your own hair or cause breakage and feel like you have nice, thick, flowy hair again!</li>
            <li> I rather give it no stars, when I purchased these it said it was real, and it took two months to get to me!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. to be synthetic hair feels very soft. Arrive before schedule in a very good condition I recommend this to anyone. the color though wasn&#x27;t black it came a dark brown, but I loved anyways, now my 4 years old princess can used too :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE these ! Omfg I ordered these like a week ago and received them today, and they are SO soft ! And easy to brush and they don&#x27;t shed a bit ! the color is amazing and not too shiny it actually looks like real hair and feels like it too! I love them and I can&#x27;t wait to wear them :)</li>
            <li> These extensions were VERY shiny and thin and I bought two sets and it still didn&#x27;t blend with my black hair.</li>
            <li> good for the price but very obvious that it was fake. Very thin and shiny, couldnt do anything with it (obviously, it isnt real hair) took forever to ship, hair fell out constantly but for only a couple bucks it was good for the two times i did wear them.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty much it. I used it for a costume, and it arrived a month and a half later. It looks pretty nice tho. Not natural or anything, but for a costume it&#x27;s awesome. Oh, and it tangles a lot.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even believe this....&lt;br /&gt;Most of the reviews were good so I purchased these extensions.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited when they arrived. Only to open a box of tangled extensions&lt;br /&gt;Every single detailing product I own I&#x27;ve tried on these extensions they are completely tangled and I cannot get the tangles out</li>
            <li> This item is very cheap and tangles very easy. I would not recommend this product. You definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> its soft and not super shiney like most fake hair and it does shed but if you have thick hair you might need to buy 3</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all with these extentions.&lt;br /&gt;They are very thin, and the clip was way to big to go around my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I brushed them, hair just fell out, and moving around they would get tangled easy. Also they did not even match.</li>
            <li> I ordered a full set of clips</li>
            <li> I loved them so much when they came in the mail! but in the description is doesnt say if you can style them or not.&lt;br /&gt;So i tried curling mine on low heat and it was a complete fail. Now the ends are completley ruined and frizzy...&lt;br /&gt;SO DO NOT GIVE HEAT TO THEM! It will ruin them. But im ordering a new pair so hopefully its all okay!</li>
            <li> I like it it match my hair color but the clips are not holding my hair.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of my money. I would advise you to not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price. Get two though cause they are not very thick. Nice and long.</li>
            <li> Yes these are def cheap but thats to be expected from the price. Still I would say they are a pain in the ass to untangle with spray and a brush, so if you want top quality extensions may be  you should invest more. I find that after one wear these are tangled badly after you take them out and if you have to wear two pieces its even worse although they look in top shape right out of the package they are going to tangle so just be advised.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed once I received this product. The hair does not look like it does in the photo, and it&#x27;s entirely too straight to match with my hair texture. It&#x27;s true when they say: &amp;#34;You get what you pay for!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected, it was nice and longer then I thought, it was a bit staticky But that did not really matter, but it did not mach my hair at all, cause my hair was black and Blue, but the black in my hair turned to drown and it looked super fake in my hair, I talked my mom into buying me hair die, so I hope when I wear it next it looks real, but the hair is more like Asian girl hair and I have very fluffy German hair, but nothing a straightener can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> I actually love this...I have thing straight hair that it pretty much worked perfectly with. I had to cut it just a little to make it look more realistic...but I love it! It&#x27;s quick and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> But it think you may need a small nape piece to blend the extention better.  It is ready to comb and does not tangle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think you can call it a full head clip if it only covers half of your head.</li>
            <li> Received my package today &amp; I am very very unhappy with it. The clips r sooooo small they can&#x27;t even clip in your hair properly. The quality of the hair is so poor, worst synthetic I have ever seen in my life. Not to mention the hair sheds sooo much. I feel like I just got ripped off.. so sorry I wasted my money. Would not recommend this to anyone... poor poor quality... horrible... :-/ why do I have to give a star for my review to be saved... this hair isn&#x27;t evem worth one star... NB. I am just putting this one star becuz I&#x27;m forced to... :-|</li>
            <li> Would pass for real hair but definitely very fake, well ofcourse. And as the saying goes, you get what you pay for! Good enough though for a day of long hair! LOL Oh and it shed alot.. before I even tried it!</li>
            <li> Took a very long time to ship. It is a little heavy, I felt like it was going to show, but I ordered the wrong color and they couldn&#x27;t do anything about it until they shipped it. (Dont mess up your order! Double check the color you chose!) For the price, it is good though. I could not wait another whole month for it to be returned and then another month to get to right color. I gave up.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna buy this buy two of them and don&#x27;t get them so long</li>
            <li> This item takes too long to arrive and when it&#x27;s finally get there it was not as it&#x27;s described. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wedding, I was expecting to have to wait 3 weeks before I got it and was getting nervous it would miss my wedding!! They ended up arriving 5 days after I ordered it! I was ecstatic, and the product was beautiful and worked wonderfully! I&#x27;m am a SUPER happy customer :)</li>
            <li> I loved these a lot a read the reviews and was a little worried they were gonna be bad. I have short hair and didn&#x27;t know if they would work. unfortunately it came a day to late and I forgot they were coming and died my hair a lighter brown. but if I wear a hat it looks fine so the only problem I had was shipping and that it doesn&#x27;t cover the sides of my head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and it does cover the back of your head, however it does not look real. I wore it out about 3 time and got many compliments. It does not fall out, but hard to mantain.</li>
            <li> Yeah its good quality and it&#x27;s nice and thick and shiny but I didn&#x27;t know it was synthetic hair -___-</li>
            <li> They were wavy not straight. And you can&#x27;t perm them. Totally different texture then ones shown. They also clumped together with one use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to thin not what I wanted will not get again</li>
            <li> i received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. the shipping was fast  and packaged securely. the package was easy to open. the directions were easy to read and follow.the hair was very nice and just the color i wanted. easy to clip to my actual hair. i can curl or flat iron the hair. easy to style and not noticeable like other companies i have tried. no detectable bumps or string like hair look.the hair is easy to put on and remove, doesn&#x27;t slide out of place while wearing. most of my friends had no idea the hair was extensions.my hair looks nice and fuller i love this hair. i would recommend S-noilitte and all their products to all my friends and family this is my personal opinion and may differ from another person</li>
            <li> Did not like hair too shiny and had alot of static hair would not stay down... luckly I did not pay alot caise I threw it in the trash... You get what you pay for..</li>
            <li> Shipped out very quickly.  Exactly as shown in picture.  Very easy to wear with the attached clips. The hair is very shiny.</li>
            <li> Its a nice extension but the problem with the material is that you cant really move it or separate the hair. and also if you would put up with the combing and none separation, id suggest you get two. i personally dont use these anymore, if i were to, id buy curly ones theyre more durable and can bounce and move around.</li>
            <li> So I just got these hair extensions yesterday, and I was pleased with how early they arrived. The estimated time of arrival was listed as Jul 31-Aug 16, but these came on Jul 26, very early, and on top of that they came all the way from Hong Kong. So, the early arrival was the first pro. Second, when I got these, le me just say I have not worn them yet, but based on what they look like I have both good and bad things to say. I&#x27;ll start with the good: the hair was very beautiful and goddess-like, it was quite soft and shiny( although some people may consider that a bad thing)and overall looked pretty good. It was also the same color as shown in the picture, so for those people complaining about the wrong color I don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;re talking about. Also when I held them up to my head they were very long( came down to about my waist) so they will definitely add length, if not volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, let me just say that the picture is still kind of misleading, because if you are expecting these extensions to be stick straight then don&#x27;t get them. They are not nearly as straight as they are depicted, when I got them they were actually slightly wavy. Now I don&#x27;t know if this is because they were folded up and stuffed in a package, or if that&#x27;s just the texture, but either way, don&#x27;t be fooled these are not straight. So if you have straight hair, you will probably need to get a curling iron and make a slight wave in your own hair before wearing these, because you can&#x27;t flat iron them( synthetic hair can not get close to heat)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I had with these was you have to be very delicate in handling them, one wrong move and thy will get very tangled and might start shedding. The strand it is made out of is also very thin, so for those who have thick hair, like me, it might be more difficult to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this is average synthetic hair, and for the price, it&#x27;s actually pretty good. I would recommend this unless you have super straight hair that you don&#x27;t want to curl, or very curly hair that you don&#x27;t want to straighten. If you are going to get these, I would recommend you get 3+ of these for a full head like I did, the price would still be pretty cheap for hair extensions.</li>
            <li> The poroduct is good and I really love the way it looks, so I will probably buy more of these.</li>
            <li> It looks like real hair!! I really recommend buying this if you are looking for long black hair extensions. Trust me, you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> Very thick . Makes me feel like I have horse hair 😂</li>
            <li> this makes no sence a waist of money. i asked for a refund and got no responce bci guess they hv my money so they dont care. its useless i hv to throw it out</li>
            <li> I have to say I love this hair because it adds volume to my very thin hair 👌 but it isn&#x27;t real hair , &amp; the price is more than reasonable so you can&#x27;t expect it to be perfect . It does get tangled very easy but if your looking for some quick volume , &amp; or length I recommend this hair I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now &amp; it&#x27;s still in great condition as long as you take care of it .</li>
            <li> By the second time worn it was a tangled mess</li>
            <li> Like these better hair not thick. But i don&#x27;t like the clips because they pull your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care that it is not a full head because my hair is long as is and I just wear this peasly piece under my thick natural hair , i did curl it with a low heat curling iron then held the curl with pins overnight, the curls came out awesome, compared to all the other extensions I bought, this is worth the $ but ladies with short hair: Buy like 4 of these!</li>
            <li> These extensions are aweful. The hair in them pulls out so easily. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money honestly.</li>
            <li> They took way too long to receive about one month but when I got them they were smooth, and I really liked them really easy to use (:</li>
            <li> it tangled very easily when i took it out of the bag, plus i couldnt untangle it with a comb, combing it just made it worse. my hair is all jet black so it matches perfectly and when i style my hair just right, it doesnt even look fake</li>
            <li> These extentions are not what they are described as in the description they are fake one time use and they are tangled feel fake and ook fake do not waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> only thing I dislike about hair clips there loose do not stay in place and the hair gets tangled too quick even when you&#x27;re wearing ityou straighten it and it tingles right after</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you&#x27;re black. This hair is too shiny and fake looking.</li>
            <li> not what my daughter thought it would be she was not impressed with this product</li>
            <li> This is extremely uncomfortable and it&#x27;s hurts my head a lot</li>
            <li> i got the extension sooner than i thought i would, i love it but i just needed to super glue the top, hair fell out very easily. it is an over all great product</li>
            <li> These are some really thin clip in hair extensions. They look like they were cut from a Barbie doll hair. The hair doesn&#x27;t even match white people hair texture so it doesn&#x27;t blend in with no hair type. I gave this hair to my little girl to play dress up with. I do not recommend this product to anyone unless your using it as part of a Halloween prop. Thank god I only paid $12.00 (I got 2).</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE. I would ️Rate zero stars if possible.please Don&#x27;t  be fooled these &#x27;hair extensions&#x27; look very very very fake.</li>
            <li> This matches my hair color perfectly and confused everyone I saw when I wore it. They all said wow your hair has grown a lot! I wear my hair up all the time for work so everyone thought it was my real hair. I would recommend this for a night out though, it was a bit exhausting to wear all day as it becomes heavy. But looks great none the less and it is very easy to put on.</li>
            <li> My grandaughter loved it. She is trying to grow her hair long and this helps in the meantime. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> i only used it once and it got soooooo knotted, i tried washing it with conditioner and nothing! so not worth it! don&#x27;t buy syntethic hair extensions</li>
            <li> This items was shipped quickly and i got it sooner than expected.  Decent quality for cheap money.  Ive worn it to work and my coworkers think its awesome.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for this hair piece because the hair itself gets tangled very easily and it kinda thin.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re thick and full. you need at least two for your whole head but they&#x27;re the best synthetic hair extensions I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ll definitely order again. and for $6, they&#x27;re a steal.</li>
            <li> i love it came to my house fast nice and soft to the touch and the right length no joke</li>
            <li> I dont like the synthetic hair. It get knotted and tangled all the time and very heavy.</li>
            <li> Excellent attention and Product.</li>
            <li> THE HAIR IS ONE ROW BUT A THICK ROW OF HAIR IT CAN GET MESSY BUT I WASH AND STRAIGHTEN IT EVERY DAY THE WAY I KEEP IT FROM GETTING MESSY IS LEAVING A LITTLE CONDITIONER IN THE HAIR AND LETTING IT DRY WHILE I FIX MY REAL HAIR I CURL IT AND HAIRSPRAY IT ONCE IN A WHILE AND IT HOLDS BUT A USUAL DAY I ALWAYS STRAIGHTEN IT AND HAVE HAD NO ISSUES</li>
            <li> very impressed with this hair and the price was exceptional good deal.</li>
            <li> The hair is too straight and you are not able to curl or do anything to the hair.  It only slips out my hand every time I try to do something with it.</li>
            <li> SUCH CHEAP HAIR THATS WHY IT WAS ONLY 8 BUCKS</li>
            <li> Tangles easyily but love it other than that :)</li>
            <li> Its okay for the price. Honestly if you pay $6 for extensions you shouldnt expect much.</li>
            <li> Came in a bundle of tangled mess. I have never even gotten to use it because the hair is extremely frizzy, matted, and knotted. I had the intention of using it the day of my wedding to ensure my wedding look was perfect, but I ended up just using my natural hair and changed my look I had originally picked.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t what I expected. They are too stiff</li>
            <li> Do not buy save your money and buy a nice pair of extensions these are a waste of money</li>
            <li> Super cheap.. fake hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t match my hair color. Long, very straight, too straight looks fake because it&#x27;s so straight. Shiny .</li>
            <li> its long black and sexy it is perfect for me and everybody loves it and the price is dirt cheap</li>
            <li> They are full and thick, one group so easier to instal, the hair was smooth and silky. Arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> It said that it was real but when i got it, i was so excited and every thing but its fake i think semi wig. IT sucks cuz i tried to curl but it won&#x27;t but you can straight it</li>
            <li> I got the extensions today and the way it was packed made the hair curly on top which I disliked about it because it was folded, and there was a lot of tangle, and had to wash it before trying it on, but other than that I like the extensions. It covered up my whole head. Will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> it was shiny n soft just alot of hair was falling out cuz the sewing was poor so i got super glue and ran it along the rim so it wouldnt fall apart n now it seem like less hair falls out.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what are the people expecting for this price. This is apsolutly worth every cent of purchase, hair is large, beautiful, you can wash it, and dry in a low temperature, but it can not be washed like a real one, you are just gonna wash it with the shampoo and than put conditioner without rinse it, just dry with conditioner, and it will be beautiful shiny, and it is gonna last more than a real one. I was waithing in about one mounth and it is goureous and super long. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I got the hair extension today , but hair fell out rapidly . Also in addition to that it was too shiny ! The black was gorgeous , but it looked like Bratz fill hair . My suggestion if you won&#x27;t it too look real , put very little heat on it and powder . Otherwise shipping was fast !</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for 7.99 with free shipping and although the price was not much I don&#x27;t feel that it was worth it at all</li>
            <li> I bought these hair extensions for my teenager and she really liked them. They match her hair color very well and look natural.</li>
            <li> Not even close to what the description was.so not full head. It was sent late  the hair is way to shiny.. I didnt even realize what it could be opening the box</li>
            <li> me and my daughter use these and we love them no one can tell the difference between our hair n this hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!!! They came really early, their luxuriously long and soft. Comes in one piece so it&#x27;s very easy to put them in and take em out. The only negative about this product is, it doesn&#x27;t give you full hair, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me because I ordered platinum blonde extensions as well, cause my hair is half and half:) top platinum blonde, bottom is black. The price is perfect &lt;3 very pleased</li>
            <li> This hair sheds a lot! But it is sooo thick and long which is great. Don&#x27;t tangle it or you&#x27;ll have to buy a new one</li>
            <li> I loved these hair extensions. The hair is really long and shiny and they matched my hair color perfectly. I usually just braid my hair when i use them so that the braid looks fuller and longer</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re alright. If you cut or use heat, they will damage though due to the fact they they are 100% synthetic (fake). But they work pretty good considering that.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels great,  Would buy again</li>
            <li> not good at all, don&#x27;t waist you money.</li>
            <li> The length is not the same as it&#x27;s described, (actually much shorter). It is not very strong and very easy to fall off when comb.</li>
            <li> It is long and not noticeable at all. It does make me look like i have longer and more hair.</li>
            <li> My natural hair is chestnut brown and when I clip these in it I have an under layer of black, and I absolutely love it! All of my friends think I look great, and most people have to ask if they&#x27;re extensions. Great product, although I couldn&#x27;t curl it really</li>
            <li> The extentions are good for a few wears but after like 3 times they get raggedy and knotted. They are good for a special ocassion but not everyday wear.</li>
            <li> i love it thanks for the fast shipping i love you guys so much im so getting this again later when my hair grows a lit more ok bye</li>
            <li> Its way too shiny and obviously not real hair. You cant dye it so it has to be your EXACT shade. I tried dying it twice and nothing happened. But for the price, I didnt really expect more.</li>
            <li> been over a month. still not recived so i cant really talk about a product. that i dont have. wanted to write this review to warn some people that you may not ever get it. a month and 3 days have passed. since order was placed. I will not ever order from this particular company again. i dont understand this delay ive order plenty of overseas products from asia and have never come across something like this so in closing if it comes it comes. if not. oh well.. thankyou&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*my order was placed april 28,2013 it is now june 15 is over a week past delivery date listed. am assuming it&#x27;s not comming. I will leave seller a message and request funds to be returned. In the last 6 yrs or so of ordering online. this is by far the most sad. was really looking foward to trying this out.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!! I have bought from here before and never had hair come the way it did. It was super thin and knotted.  I couldn&#x27;t even do anything with it and I eventually threw it away.</li>
            <li> This item does not blend well with African American ethnic hair. It will blend well with Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, etc.</li>
            <li> this item is not what it seem to be it states full head clip which is not true. i like the texture of the product</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really good and they look  like real human hair. I recommend this extensions a lot! I&#x27;m really happy with them I may order more!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely disappointed with this hair, its the worst hair I&#x27;ve bought, it gets tangled alot and sheds alot. I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought it even with the negative reviews. I bought 2 clips thinking it was going to be enough. Right now I see myself ordering more.. I really like it, and its not as shiny as people say. It does tangle and shreds a little bit, but for that price I can&#x27;t ask for a lot. I will totally recommend :)</li>
            <li> These are great extensions. They are soft and long and a good thickness. However do not straighten them or curl them on high heat. It will fry them. I curled them on low-medium heat and it worked fine. They look amazing and blended with my hair greatly. I recommend you getting them especially if they are your first extensions. These were mine and they were easy to use and looked great on me.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> It was soft on the top part of the hair than more than half way through it was knotted and felt like dead hair. Lasted 2 days.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft but can get a bit tangled but still love them they blend perfectly with my hair!:)</li>
            <li> really good quality hair. I&#x27;m 5 foot 10 and the hair come all the way down my back. gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it took so long to come 1 month</li>
            <li> Looks super faux. Plus you cant even get it clipped in before its all tangled.  Spend a few more $$$ for a nice weave!</li>
            <li> I liked it. It was worth the money. I would def check it out and recommend a purchase because for the value it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It didnt look fake in any way whatso ever.&lt;br /&gt;It ws really soft ( kinda tangles easy but i mean its not horrible)&lt;br /&gt;the clips are nice.&lt;br /&gt;if you have medium - super thick hair please buy more than 3.&lt;br /&gt;its very very long&lt;br /&gt;its beautiful but not thick enough for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;so ill give it to a friend.</li>
            <li> its not a full head of extensions. the hair is okay, tangles easily.nicely packaged. free wig cap. but what do you expect when youre paying under 10 bucks for fake hair? will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I did like it however always brush it after each use because it does get tangled and just a mess but other then that it looks very nice</li>
            <li> Your extensions were s***. thanks for nothing. You&#x27;ll be hearing a nice little review about how unprofessional your product is.</li>
            <li> This was a horrible product. it is nothing like the picture. Right in the garbage!!! try a different product if your looking for good hair extensions.</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t as thick as it appears in the photos.  Its definitely long and pretty but I haven&#x27;t worn it yet as I have had to order another one to not look crazy when I wear it.  Who has 23 inches of two tracks of hair?</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this purchase. I bought 2 and they were very thin, very shiny, and very fake looking. No matter how I tried to style them they just wound up looking incredibly fake and awful. I would not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> This hair was really soft and pretty but when I got it it was the wrong color but they gladly fixed that problem. They are sending me a new one and letting me keep the other one. One other thing after combing it tends to get a little tangled but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a way to handle that.</li>
            <li> Pros: they are long and very soft. I received them earlier then estimated date. Packaged nice and neat. There were  no tangles in mine.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: can&#x27;t use much heat. They are too long and look fake. These extensions look fake. They were too shiny that made them look fake.&lt;br /&gt;These are good long extensions but are FAKE. Don&#x27;t recommended them.</li>
            <li> no stars because it is synthetic hair and it tingles real fast but not recommend you buy this if you are looking for real hair because its notit does not look like the picture and its way shinier</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase this hair for a quick look. Pros : Fast Shipping, good packaging,  long length, nice jet black color.... Cons : Shiny, Shedded as soon as I got it out of the packaging and while combing thru the tangles. I haven&#x27;t put it in my head yet being that I plan to curl and style before putting it in and YES, you CAN curl synthetic hair and I don&#x27;t care what kind of synthetic fabric it is. It&#x27;s HOW you do it and there are a few ways. 1# wet the hair/dampen it with water from a spray bottle, FIRST. Then curl with any type of regular curling iron BUT it must be on the lowest heat possible anywhere from 80-100 degrees and only hold it in the curling iron for a few seconds. count from 7-10. Depends on how much hair you have in the curler and your type of curler. DO NOT comb the curl. WAIT until that piece dries COMPLETELY. #2 You can also use a STEAMER. any handheld steamer to loosen up the synthetic hair if it tangles badly after you&#x27;ve had it for a while. there IS a process of doing this method to curl your hair as well. it will straighten the hair BACK to make it soft. To do this... just get your handheld steamer and hold it over the piece of hair and go up and down w/ the steamer while you run your comb thru that piece. How many times you do this, depends on how tangled it is. That piece will be damp. While it&#x27;s DAMP, take your curling iron and curl that piece and HOLD IT in the curler while  placing the steamer over that piece AT THE SAME TIME for about 7-10 seconds. Take the steamer OFF that piece and release the curling iron slowly while keeping the curl in place. you can let that piece fall or pin it but it MUST DRY COMPLETELY. Your curls will be bouncy and soft like you just got the hair. DO THIS METHOD TO RESTORE ANY SYNTHETIC HAIR no matter how tangled it is. HOW TO GET RID OF THE SHINE TO MAKE IT LOOK NATURAL &gt;&gt;&gt; As I mentioned in the beginning, I haven&#x27;t worn the hair yet because I&#x27;m prepping it before use. I noticed of course it had a shine likemost synthetic hair does and ...What did I do to get rid of that SHINE??? I filled my sink halfway with cold water FIRST. Next, I added apple cider VINEGAR to the water. How much depends on how big your sink is and how much water. But I can say that you&#x27;ll have to at least put a cup or lil more in. Then take ANY type of shampoo and conditioner and wash the hair while it&#x27;s in the sink of water. I picked up pieces at a time to wash, then just let the hair fall into the water. After I washed the pieces, I let it SOAK in the water for about 30-40mins. Then, just rinse all of the soap and vinegar out. If u want to get rid of the vinegar smell, just wash it once more with shampoo or dishwashing liquid which is great for stripping and follow with a nice smelling conditioner. That will take away most of the fake shine and strip the majority of it. It will have a mild shine which will look more natural and also, HAIRSPRAY when you style your hair will help. You can also use a little hair spray while curling your damp synthetic hair as well. I will do another review after I put the hair in and maybe post a photo too. HOPE THIS HELPS :-) By the way, I&#x27;m African American and I have natural hair however I will be straightening my natural hair before putting this hair in. My hair is not permed at all and I have a few tips on how to straighten natural hair w/o using grease or oily products AND get it STRAIGHT to work well with this hair if anyone wants to know.</li>
            <li> I bought two of the black color, they look great and natural, and the color is just as i wanted.</li>
            <li> So i ordered  my hair on the 2nd of the month and dint reieve it till the 13... and when i got it... the hair came in one whole piece which i disliked about it.. but other than that its nice and soft and cant wait to put it in!</li>
            <li> This hair extension is AMAZING. Keep in mind this does only send ONE five clip clip in extension ( I didn&#x27;t see that when I bought it). This extension is this and full and the clips are very high quality. The only thing i did not like about this is the hair does look very shiny and fake. Other than that, excellent product! Will definitely consider purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Came well packaged, arrived earlier than expected....it hardly tangled and if it does its easy to take them out. Great deal...I&#x27;m very satisfied with it...</li>
            <li> Worth the wait of shipping! Just BEAUTIFUL!!! I&#x27;m going to place another order soon. Want to have this product on hand for when its needed. Thank you</li>
            <li> These are perfect extensions but you have to order 2 of them so your hair doesn&#x27;t look thin and choppy (unless you go for that look) but otherwise they work perfectly fine for me, you can even style them however you want!</li>
            <li> It is definitely not real hair...it is very dark and shiny but I wouldn&#x27;t expect more for the price.&lt;br /&gt;It took a long time to arrive</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of the hair, It is easy to comb. I would order this product again. Thank you</li>
            <li> they werent really what i thought they would be there a little goddish for my taste, but there okay thanks</li>
            <li> Not made for African American hair- extremely stringy.</li>
            <li> Item did not work in my hair. It was much too thin and so shiny no one would think it was real.</li>
            <li> Extensions quickly arrived much earlier than expected. color, brightness and length of extensions right for me. I really loved it and would buy more.</li>
            <li> They are not actually black. They are very close to black but they are not black. Very soft and worth the wait I just wish that had these in blonde with light brown.</li>
            <li> the hair was not bad but it just didnt blend well with my hair .. it was way to straight and shinny for me .. i have relaxed hair tried flat ironing it bone straight to help blend better . it looked good in photos but up close n personal it was obvious that it was definetly fake .. not for me. i would have to find hair with a little more texture for me // not totally disappointed for the price</li>
            <li> This product arrived earlier than anticipated (about two weeks early) with the quality I expected.  For the price paid, the hair is nice, the clips were strong and sewn perfectly and the hair wasn&#x27;t too tangly.  I have no complaints, except that I should&#x27;ve bought maybe 3 of them to give the fullness in the back that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Bad decision , its cheap so thats what kind of hair your gonna get the extensions weren&#x27;t full or thick. This was a waste of my money .</li>
            <li> It worked well and served it&#x27;s time. However the ends got disgusting almost immediately so I always looked like I had unhealthy hair. I will probably still to human hair from now on.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter who is 15 and is not easy to please and she loves it.  Easy to manage, looks lovely!</li>
            <li> Very thick, to me. I actually like one piece extension. I will probably use it more for wearing a braid or maybe when I want a fuller look with my other extensions. It&#x27;s not real hair but if you can get your hair super straigh it should blend fine for you! :)</li>
            <li> great and it was what I was looking for1</li>
            <li> this was not what I expected when I got it</li>
            <li> It makes me look so saxy, also really easy to put on, don&#x27;t forget that those are clips, so they open and close in your hair.</li>
            <li> Always getting tangled .. Not a good choice</li>
            <li> Nice and thick hair extensions. Im a happy customer!</li>
            <li> I guess when i read full head I was thinking that it would be more than one piece but it is just one piece. It is a nice piece though ^_^ Very good deal it feels really nice and not like cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and looks very nice and full too.</li>
