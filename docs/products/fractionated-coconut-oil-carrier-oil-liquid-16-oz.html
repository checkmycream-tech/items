            <li>Great product for our family so far.</li>
            <li>; It&#x27;s in an easy to use plastic bottle with a flip cap</li>

            <li>I received a free bottle for me to review -</li>
            <li>The amber color protects the FCO from oxidation from light or sun.</li>
            <li>Great carrier oil to use with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Great, just wish it was bigger</li>
            <li>This is great because I also have a tendency to get sunburned on my upper shoulders.</li>
            <li>perfect for massages, and your own scented oil in it to personalize it for your needs, put it on your hair before dying or chemical treatments, put it on your skin when you get out of the shower- while your skin is still wet, on feet at bed time, on hands-especially cuticles, massage your young child -or</li>
            <li>: It works well as a moisturizer, I&#x27;ve been going to the beach a lot and needed something for my sun burnt skin.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Not scent free.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy your product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>who, since I die my hair a lot I found out that you can put this on your hair first and it will protect it and keep it in fabulous condition, putting this on your feet at night before bed then putting socks on will enable you to wake with soft tootsies, awesome fo since I die my hair a lot I found out that you can put this on your hair first and it will protect it and keep it in fabulous condition,  apply it to your feet at night, put your socks on, wake up in the morning with soft beautiful feet versus my normal Fred Flintstone feet!  </li>
            <li>It is fast becoming one of my favorite skin products.  </li>
            <li>This is good quality oil, mixes easily with all my essential oils to make face wash, lotion, shaving lotion.  </li>

            <li>I was excited to try this product..</li>
            <li>I originally thought oh I will give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I received a free e book moments after placing the order and love the pump that is included, it makes using this oil that much easier.</li>
            <li>I have many essential oils and some can cause redness, rash or sensitivity if used on their own.</li>
            <li>is a small but great company with fab products &amp; I want to show them some love</li>
            <li>It also is nice just straight out of the bottle on your skin after a hot shower.  </li>
            <li>That really doesn&#x27;t happen with many products these days.</li>
            <li>There was an book that came with it full of ideas of how to use your FCO.</li>
            <li>When it arrived the bottle was in plastic, which is good as a tiny bit of oil had leaked.  </li>
            <li>It removes my mascara with ease, no burning like many so-called gentle formulas.</li>
            <li>The fractionated coconut oil is light, easily absorbed into the skin and scalp, and convenient because it stays in liquid form.</li>
            <li>This oil is so clear and refined, it is easy to use in so many products.</li>
            <li>did receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback, regardless I only recommend products that worked for me and that I think will work for my readers.have many essential oils and some can cause redness, rash or sensitivity if used on their own.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, spreads well on the skin and rubs in pretty quickly..</li>
            <li>This is very nice, no smell, works great and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>new favorite use is to clean my face-</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly and softens skin</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and when they said it would.</li>
            <li>I use this in my African American daughter&#x27;s hair after her bath and it works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This won&#x27;t disappoint and the size is perfect and should last awhile even with regular use.</li>
            <li>Product delivered quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and I am already seeing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It feels so clean &amp; pure &amp; is absorbed into the skin so quickly &amp; easily without any greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>especially cuticles  perfect for massages, and your own scented oil in it to personalize it for your needs, put it on your hair before dying or chemical treatments, put it on your skin when you get out of the shower- while your skin is still wet, on feet at bed time, on hands-especially cuticles, massage your young child -or</li>
            <li>This is a great carrier oil too, so you can add your own essential oils or blend with other oils to make custom blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really happy to see that for less than what I paid for a teeny lil bottle of fractionated coconut oil from another brand, this is a HUGE bottle, so you definitely get more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>This fractionated coconut oil really was filled to the brim when I opened it.</li>
            <li>I made a gentle lavender oil to smooth on my arms.</li>
            <li>I made a gentle lavender oil to smooth on my arms.</li>
            <li>Thanks, LaLune, for including a free pump for the bottle.</li>
            <li>To me, fractionated coconut oil is a must-have product‚Äîespecially if you&#x27;re into essential oils or creating your own all-natural products at home.</li>
            <li>Just rub on like lotion after showering and say hello to baby soft skin :)</li>
            <li>I could literally rub this in and it would be absorbed within seconds.</li>
            <li>did receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback, regardless I only recommend products that worked for me and that I think will work for my readers.</li>
            <li>Wow do I love this product.  </li>
            <li>; natural product will order more.</li>
            <li>I just got it today and slathered it on right after my shower.</li>
            <li>I found that with this oil (used with an oil or not) I could out it on, then out my clothes right on without having to wait for any amount of time.</li>
            <li>What I love the most is that it is all natural and will not harm human or pet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The solid coconut oils I&#x27;ve purchased are all in large tubs, so always removing it with a clean spoon (to prevent bacteria from growing in it) isn&#x27;t as quick and easy to use as the pump is with fractionated coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>In the midwest of the USA (North Dakota) during a dry winter and in the warm spring temperature of Guatemala.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the oil felt a bit too runny</li>
            <li>Will be ordering this exact product when I run out.</li>
            <li>I love the FCO to use after shower or making essential oil blends.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more thanks again!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First time ever trying coconut oil</li>
            <li>Very pleased w LaLune products this time and previously.  </li>
            <li>Great for mixing with essential oils or just using alone for dry skin!</li>
            <li>There was some spillage of oil on outside of oil container, but the bottle was very full.  </li>
            <li>it is very</li>
            <li>I really like the included pump.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s fragrance free because there are essential oil mixes that do NOT smell good with coconut, at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It does not clog pores and gives a very dewy look to the skin.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes but does not stay really sticky like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered my 6th bottle because my family wants some as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Skye Dupre</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s easier to use for a hair conditioner because it is liquid at room temperature (unlike non-fractionated coconut oil) and the pump makes it really convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>Its very moisturizing and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have bought the kind that come from the different companies but still was left wanting something else.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Much better quality than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Then I realized there are many other</li>
            <li>Then I realized there are many other uses</li>
            <li>I live a fast paced life so having to sit and wait isn&#x27;t something I can afford to do.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product, it just needs a few tweaks in the packaging department.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular fractionated coconut oil is compose of Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair mainly.</li>
            <li>go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend La Lune Naturals Fractionated Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li>recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was highly impr</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The oils is high quality</li>
            <li>Without it, it would be messy to use as it is very light liquid.</li>
            <li>Many essential oils cannot be put directly on the skin, however, mixed with fractionated coconut oil, which functions as a carrier and diluter of the essential oil, the benefits of the essential oil can be safely</li>
            <li>We use it for everything from softening rough skin, making hair soft and silky and my current favorite aka; &amp;#34;honey!</li>
            <li>The pump is very convenient and it doesn&#x27;t pump out very much, just enough you need.</li>
            <li>is a small but great company with fab products &amp; I want to show them some lovet on your skin when you get out of the shower while your skin is still wet, on feet before bedtime, on hands-</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well on the skin and makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I swear it increases the moisturizing qualities of my normal routine without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased solid coconut oils in the past and used it for lots of things but only recently was introduced to fractionated coconut oil, but I am loving how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li>even use this on my dog who has very sensitive skin allergy season.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a dark amber colored plastic and comes with a free pump.</li>
            <li>So far the oil is everything I hoped it to be!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft without being greasy!</li>
            <li>, I have used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s upper shoulders where he was sunburned and where he started to peel and it really helped keep it moisturized!</li>
            <li>and we were pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>(pretty sure that&#x27;ll be worse in labor).</li>
            <li>Soaks right in, no smell, thin and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is a clear liquid and does not have any scent.</li>
            <li>began by using the oil directly on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I was scared that it would be way too greasy for my naturally oily skin and scalp.</li>
            <li>I was scared that it would be way too greasy for my naturally oily skin and scalp.</li>
            <li>I decided to give coconut oil a try, and so far, it has cleared up the rosacea on my nose.  </li>
            <li>After I started using this oil on my feet, the calluses have almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>I added some of the coconut oil to my skin cream, along with a few more drops of sandalwood essential oil.</li>
            <li>I added some of the coconut oil to my skin cream, along with a few more drops of sandalwood essential oil.</li>
            <li>It might sound odd but I am using it on my bare skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>Customer service is amazing,  there was a small discrepancy in my second order and they reshipped the entire order.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light-weight, extra nourishment for my 63 year old skin, underneath my regular serum and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The oil itself is exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>I had a seaweed wrap done at a spa and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it left my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it left it so soft also.</li>
            <li>Simple and natural and</li>
            <li>I use it for hot oil treatments on my hair in conjunction with almond oil and other hair products!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously you must apply it carefully when using on a pet or small child.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for massages, and your own scented oil in it to personalize it for your needs, put it on your hair before dying or chemical treatments, put it on your skin when you get out of the shower while your skin is still wet, on feet before bedtime, on hands-especially cuticles  </li>
            <li>, my hair has been moisturized and soft since I&#x27;ve been using it and can&#x27;t go back to regular coconut</li>
            <li>I will recommend this oil to every and all people who use essential oils, coconut oil, or lotion in general.  </li>
            <li>Virgin coconut oil is a solid, gel-like consistency in average temperatures, but at high temperatures it melts.</li>

            <li> I received a free bottle for me to review -</li>
            <li> The amber color protects the FCO from oxidation from light or sun.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil to use with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great, just wish it was bigger</li>

            <li> I was excited to try this product..</li>
            <li> I originally thought oh I will give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I received a free e book moments after placing the order and love the pump that is included, it makes using this oil that much easier.</li>
            <li> I have many essential oils and some can cause redness, rash or sensitivity if used on their own.</li>
            <li> is a small but great company with fab products &amp; I want to show them some love</li>
            <li> It also is nice just straight out of the bottle on your skin after a hot shower.  </li>
            <li> That really doesn&#x27;t happen with many products these days.</li>
            <li> There was an book that came with it full of ideas of how to use your FCO.</li>
            <li> When it arrived the bottle was in plastic, which is good as a tiny bit of oil had leaked.  </li>
            <li> It removes my mascara with ease, no burning like many so-called gentle formulas.</li>
            <li> The fractionated coconut oil is light, easily absorbed into the skin and scalp, and convenient because it stays in liquid form.</li>

            <li> absorbs quickly and softens skin</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and when they said it would.</li>
            <li> I use this in my African American daughter&#x27;s hair after her bath and it works great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This won&#x27;t disappoint and the size is perfect and should last awhile even with regular use.</li>
            <li> Product delivered quickly and as described.</li>

            <li> This is a great carrier oil too, so you can add your own essential oils or blend with other oils to make custom blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really happy to see that for less than what I paid for a teeny lil bottle of fractionated coconut oil from another brand, this is a HUGE bottle, so you definitely get more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This fractionated coconut oil really was filled to the brim when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I made a gentle lavender oil to smooth on my arms.</li>
            <li> I made a gentle lavender oil to smooth on my arms.</li>
            <li> Thanks, LaLune, for including a free pump for the bottle.</li>
            <li> To me, fractionated coconut oil is a must-have product‚Äîespecially if you&#x27;re into essential oils or creating your own all-natural products at home.</li>
            <li> Just rub on like lotion after showering and say hello to baby soft skin :)</li>
            <li> I could literally rub this in and it would be absorbed within seconds.</li>
            <li> did receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback, regardless I only recommend products that worked for me and that I think will work for my readers.</li>
            <li> Wow do I love this product.  </li>
            <li> ; natural product will order more.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and slathered it on right after my shower.</li>
            <li> I found that with this oil (used with an oil or not) I could out it on, then out my clothes right on without having to wait for any amount of time.</li>
            <li> What I love the most is that it is all natural and will not harm human or pet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The solid coconut oils I&#x27;ve purchased are all in large tubs, so always removing it with a clean spoon (to prevent bacteria from growing in it) isn&#x27;t as quick and easy to use as the pump is with fractionated coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> In the midwest of the USA (North Dakota) during a dry winter and in the warm spring temperature of Guatemala.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the oil felt a bit too runny</li>
            <li> Will be ordering this exact product when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love the FCO to use after shower or making essential oil blends.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more thanks again!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First time ever trying coconut oil</li>
            <li> Very pleased w LaLune products this time and previously.  </li>
            <li> Great for mixing with essential oils or just using alone for dry skin!</li>
            <li> There was some spillage of oil on outside of oil container, but the bottle was very full.  </li>
            <li> it is very</li>
            <li> I really like the included pump.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s fragrance free because there are essential oil mixes that do NOT smell good with coconut, at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It does not clog pores and gives a very dewy look to the skin.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes but does not stay really sticky like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered my 6th bottle because my family wants some as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Skye Dupre</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s easier to use for a hair conditioner because it is liquid at room temperature (unlike non-fractionated coconut oil) and the pump makes it really convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> Its very moisturizing and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have bought the kind that come from the different companies but still was left wanting something else.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Much better quality than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Then I realized there are many other</li>
            <li> Then I realized there are many other uses</li>
            <li> I live a fast paced life so having to sit and wait isn&#x27;t something I can afford to do.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product, it just needs a few tweaks in the packaging department.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular fractionated coconut oil is compose of Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair mainly.</li>
            <li> go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend La Lune Naturals Fractionated Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li> recommend this highly.</li>

            <li> The oils is high quality</li>
            <li> Without it, it would be messy to use as it is very light liquid.</li>
            <li> Many essential oils cannot be put directly on the skin, however, mixed with fractionated coconut oil, which functions as a carrier and diluter of the essential oil, the benefits of the essential oil can be safely</li>
            <li> We use it for everything from softening rough skin, making hair soft and silky and my current favorite aka; &amp;#34;honey!</li>
            <li> The pump is very convenient and it doesn&#x27;t pump out very much, just enough you need.</li>
            <li> is a small but great company with fab products &amp; I want to show them some lovet on your skin when you get out of the shower while your skin is still wet, on feet before bedtime, on hands-</li>
            <li> It absorbs really well on the skin and makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I swear it increases the moisturizing qualities of my normal routine without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased solid coconut oils in the past and used it for lots of things but only recently was introduced to fractionated coconut oil, but I am loving how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li> even use this on my dog who has very sensitive skin allergy season.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a dark amber colored plastic and comes with a free pump.</li>
            <li> So far the oil is everything I hoped it to be!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft without being greasy!</li>
            <li> , I have used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s upper shoulders where he was sunburned and where he started to peel and it really helped keep it moisturized!</li>
            <li> and we were pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> (pretty sure that&#x27;ll be worse in labor).</li>
            <li> Soaks right in, no smell, thin and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is a clear liquid and does not have any scent.</li>
            <li> began by using the oil directly on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I was scared that it would be way too greasy for my naturally oily skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> I was scared that it would be way too greasy for my naturally oily skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> I decided to give coconut oil a try, and so far, it has cleared up the rosacea on my nose.  </li>
            <li> After I started using this oil on my feet, the calluses have almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> I added some of the coconut oil to my skin cream, along with a few more drops of sandalwood essential oil.</li>
            <li> I added some of the coconut oil to my skin cream, along with a few more drops of sandalwood essential oil.</li>
            <li> It might sound odd but I am using it on my bare skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> Customer service is amazing,  there was a small discrepancy in my second order and they reshipped the entire order.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light-weight, extra nourishment for my 63 year old skin, underneath my regular serum and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The oil itself is exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> I had a seaweed wrap done at a spa and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it left my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it left it so soft also.</li>
            <li> Simple and natural and</li>
            <li> I use it for hot oil treatments on my hair in conjunction with almond oil and other hair products!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously you must apply it carefully when using on a pet or small child.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for massages, and your own scented oil in it to personalize it for your needs, put it on your hair before dying or chemical treatments, put it on your skin when you get out of the shower while your skin is still wet, on feet before bedtime, on hands-especially cuticles  </li>
            <li> , my hair has been moisturized and soft since I&#x27;ve been using it and can&#x27;t go back to regular coconut</li>
            <li> I will recommend this oil to every and all people who use essential oils, coconut oil, or lotion in general.  </li>
            <li> Virgin coconut oil is a solid, gel-like consistency in average temperatures, but at high temperatures it melts.</li>
            <li> I also used a small amount in my shampoo and conditioner to really allow the hair to absorb and benefit from the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This had the same results so anyone that has dry skin this will help</li>
            <li> Fractionated coconut oil breaks up the different components of regular coconut oil and separates out individual fatty acids/triglycerides.</li>
            <li> I mix a little of this oil with sugar and a drop of peppermint oil as a scrub for my dry lips and it makes them so soft  </li>
            <li> If you decide to use the pump, pour a small amount of the oil out first or you will have a mess on your hands.</li>
            <li> : Bottle arrived with pump in separate plastic bag with twist tie inside larger box containing other items.</li>
            <li> I can even just use the oil, with a few drops of essential oil as my perfume, rather than spending so much on commercial perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> so you&#x27;re much less likely to spill and waste, especially helpful when using it for massage.</li>
            <li> is that it opened in transit, bypassed the bottle&#x27;s little white seal (don&#x27;t ask me how) and proceeded to spill some of its contents into the plastic bag it was packaged in.</li>
            <li> Not much was lost</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, sometimes multiple times a day!</li>
            <li> Not a to strong but unpleasant</li>
            <li> my split and dry ends are practically gone in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> and it was extremely softening.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, my other item was sealed in plastic and did not get oil into the fabric.</li>
            <li> I had a small bottle and poured the fractionated coconut oil in, then added 6 drops of the lavender essential oil.</li>

            <li> Due to allergies I am restricted to products associated with Coconut Oil.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s nongreasy unlike other oils and lotions.</li>
            <li> Actually I am not sure if this product here is only for beauty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too sticky like other oil does.</li>
            <li> Goes on a bit greasy, but soaks in dry in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I apply the coconut oil and peppermint on the skin and it cools my itchy skin down.</li>
            <li> Anxious to see how well it works on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t had the baby, but we&#x27;ve given each other massages with it a few times.  </li>
            <li> The coconut oil helps to spread the essential oils among the potpourri, so I need less of the expensive essential oil.</li>

            <li> I dont think i would use it on my face under make up, feels a little shiny.  </li>
            <li> but it was a bit messy and faded some of the label&#x27;s lettering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have worked with quite a few.</li>
            <li> As it is it has a heavily processes smell.</li>
            <li> This oil works well for massage, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> I just use it plain.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I lost that recently</li>
            <li> It helped her little itchy spot behind her ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very wasteful and annoying...</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean anything to me, but I know a lot of people look for that.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had no idea what fractionated meant, but this is a great product, I received this free for reviewing purposes and am very pleased with it, I was already a coconut oil customer but I always have a problem with how greasy it leaves my hands and the stains ugh. LaLune made it so that there&#x27;s no greasy spots anywhere,I use it in my hair and all over my body and it has been doing a great job so far. I would&#x27;ve fathered a teeny coconut oil smell but, my fianc&amp;eacute; said he rather no smell than the rancid smell the coconut oil leaves behind, now he tells me ladies, men huh.&lt;br /&gt;So I am overall very happy with it, my hair has been moisturized and soft since I&#x27;ve been using it and can&#x27;t go back to regular coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;The pump that comes with it is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://youtu.be/m4qInIM5pC8</li>
            <li> To me, fractionated coconut oil is a must-have product‚Äîespecially if you&#x27;re into essential oils or creating your own all-natural products at home. I just recently entered the world of essential oils so fractionated coconut oil has become a best friend to me. Needless to say, I love it when I get a product that is affordable, high-quality, and serves it&#x27;s purpose. La Lune Naturals Fractionated Coconut Oil lives up to those expectations. You receive 16 ounces of oil‚Äîfilled to the rim. I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that either. I learned this when I tried to attach the included pump. It overflowed! If you decide to use the pump, pour a small amount of the oil out first or you will have a mess on your hands. Don&#x27;t worry if you do end up with a mess though, because fractionated coconut oil doesn&#x27;t stain or leave a greasy residue. Just wipe it up with a mild detergent and water, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend La Lune Naturals Fractionated Coconut Oil. It&#x27;s perfect for diluting essential oils, for using as a stand-alone product for moisturizing or lubricating, and in body scrubs/lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Product provided for review purposes without cost. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I really like the included pump. Will be a good purchase if you are looking for a good coconut oil. I WILL purchase this brand from now on.  Thank you La Lune</li>
            <li> Its liquid, no warming, just wonderful pure oil. I just got it today and slathered it on right after my shower. Tonight washed my face and slathered it on the mug.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great care in package.  Good pricing.</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and softens skin</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Packaged nicely so nothing leaked in or out.  Very nice oil. Use it with essential oil mixes and works well.  Use it neat,on my neck, and it smooths and softens.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it for my hair and I am very happy with the results !!!  THANKS</li>
            <li> The bottle is a dark amber colored plastic and comes with a free pump. The only issue I had with the push pump it came in originally, is that it opened in transit, bypassed the bottle&#x27;s little white seal (don&#x27;t ask me how) and proceeded to spill some of its contents into the plastic bag it was packaged in. Not much was lost but it was a bit messy and faded some of the label&#x27;s lettering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good carrier oil and a great bargain for the price and amount you get! At first I thought the oil felt a bit too runny but that&#x27;s just because I got used to using the edible solid variety. I like that it&#x27;s non greasy, hypoallergenic, and that it doesn&#x27;t stain fabrics like regular coconut oil. I also like that it&#x27;s fragrance free because there are essential oil mixes that do NOT smell good with coconut, at least in my opinion. Overall a good product, it just needs a few tweaks in the packaging department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Good quality coconut oil, my skin loves it! The product comes in a convenient pump and the coconut oil is fractionated, which means it stays liquid even in colder temperatures. Just rub on like lotion after showering and say hello to baby soft skin :)</li>
            <li> Love the item and for a great price it works to keep skin smooth can be used in hair treatments lotions anything you&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, love the pump!</li>
            <li> Very nice, light, my skin enjoys it.</li>
            <li> Product seal was there but not sealed and oil leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast and quality is awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in regards to the product description along with the promotion that I received to try this product.  It came today and I made up one of the recipes that I received.  I already had the seaweed powder which I used along with my body wash.  But I mixed the oil about a 1/4 cup along with 2 scoops of my seaweed powder into a mason jar and put in my coconut body wash and added water until it was all mixed in.  I then just lathered my body with the concoction while taking a shower and it was extremely softening. I had a seaweed wrap done at a spa and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it left my skin.  This had the same results so anyone that has dry skin this will help and I just followed up with applying the coconut oil as a moisturizer to my hair prior to washing it and it left it so soft also.Terrific product!!!</li>
            <li> I like the oil but the bottle was packaged with a big item, placed horizontally in the box and resulted in oil leaking out of the bottle, out of the plastic bag it was twist tied in, into the box.  Thankfully, my other item was sealed in plastic and did not get oil into the fabric.</li>
            <li> I really love this company. Their products arrive promptly and as described. This fractionated coconut oil really was filled to the brim when I opened it. That really doesn&#x27;t happen with many products these days. I am excited to make the coconut recipes provided in the e-book that also came with this product. So far the oil is everything I hoped it to be!</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived quickly and when they said it would. I received a free e book moments after placing the order and love the pump that is included, it makes using this oil that much easier. The oil itself is exactly what I wanted and expected. Nice lightweight, odorless non greasy oil. Will be ordering this exact product when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love the coconut products, but have never used the fractionated oil before.  I LOVE IT.  It feels so clean &amp; pure &amp; is absorbed into the skin so quickly &amp; easily without any greasy residue.  It is fast becoming one of my favorite skin products.  Thank you for introducing it to me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil. Soaks right in, no smell, thin and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love how the product feels on my skin. It is not too greasy and does not have the coconut smell. And it comes with a pump to make it easy to dispense!  Will definitely buy again in the future!</li>
            <li> Love. Best oil tried so far.Easy&amp; smooth to use &amp; it works on my over 60 skin.</li>
            <li> Fractionated Coconut oil- i used this producton my arms and feet and it made my skin feel great. It moisturized and replenished my skin. I love the way it smells. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. ‚Ä™</li>
            <li> Just received and on time.  Been using coconut oil in my coffee and to cook with.  Wanted to start using on my skin.  Anxious to see how well it works on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before I ordered this product and it totally lived up to my expectations.  It makes my skin so soft without being greasy!</li>
            <li> I was really happy to see that for less than what I paid for a teeny lil bottle of fractionated coconut oil from another brand, this is a HUGE bottle, so you definitely get more bang for your buck. It&#x27;s another one of those multipurpose products that is a constant in my house. We use it for everything from softening rough skin, making hair soft and silky and my current favorite aka; &amp;#34;honey! please rub my back!&amp;#34; It&#x27;s in an easy to use plastic bottle with a flip cap so you&#x27;re much less likely to spill and waste, especially helpful when using it for massage. This is a great carrier oil too, so you can add your own essential oils or blend with other oils to make custom blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite use is to clean my face- no matter how I pile it on, this takes it off with no effort at all, even waterproof mascara! It actually works better than the cray expensive makeup remover I used to buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount, however all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best coconut oils I have worked with and I have worked with quite a few. I am an essential oil user and need a carrier oil. I have bought the kind that come from the different companies but still was left wanting something else. I found that with this oil (used with an oil or not) I could out it on, then out my clothes right on without having to wait for any amount of time. I could literally rub this in and it would be absorbed within seconds. I live a fast paced life so having to sit and wait isn&#x27;t something I can afford to do. This oil was smooth, not greasy at all, and didn&#x27;t leave me with a tropical smell that sometimes you just don&#x27;t want.  I will recommend this oil to every and all people who use essential oils, coconut oil, or lotion in general.  I received a free bottle for me to review - but this doesn&#x27;t change my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice coconut oil. Good for your skin!</li>
            <li> LaLune Naturals 100% Fractionated Coconut Oil comes in a 16 oz. amber plastic bottle with a pump. The amber color protects the FCO from oxidation from light or sun. It is made in the USA. It is a clear liquid and does not have any scent. It is not tested on animals. It is listed as Vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what is fractionated coconut oil and what is it good for? Regular coconut oil is a bit of a shape-shifter. It is extracted from coconuts. Virgin coconut oil is a solid, gel-like consistency in average temperatures, but at high temperatures it melts. It smells and tastes like coconut. Fractionated coconut oil breaks up the different components of regular coconut oil and separates out individual fatty acids/triglycerides. This particular fractionated coconut oil is compose of Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride. The wonderful thing about fractionated oils such as the LaLune Naturals Fractionated Coconut Oil is that it has no scent or taste. It provides the benefits of coconut oil to the health and beauty industry. This oil is good on it&#x27;s own, for massage or hydration of the skin, increased manageability when used in hair, as a carrier for essential oils, as an added component to shampoos, conditioners, or lotions and creams. Many essential oils cannot be put directly on the skin, however, mixed with fractionated coconut oil, which functions as a carrier and diluter of the essential oil, the benefits of the essential oil can be safely realized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began by using the oil directly on my skin and hair. I loved how easily it spread and how quickly it absorbed, without being greasy or oily. It immediately hydrated and soothed my skin. It does not clog pores and gives a very dewy look to the skin. On my hair it brightened the hair, reduced the frizz and increased the shine. I also used a small amount in my shampoo and conditioner to really allow the hair to absorb and benefit from the coconut oil. This oil is so clear and refined, it is easy to use in so many products. I have many essential oils and some can cause redness, rash or sensitivity if used on their own. I made a gentle lavender oil to smooth on my arms. I had a small bottle and poured the fractionated coconut oil in, then added 6 drops of the lavender essential oil. It smells great and helps my skin recover and feel hydrated. I added some of the coconut oil to my skin cream, along with a few more drops of sandalwood essential oil. I even made some glycerin soap and added a capful of coconut oil to increase the richness and benefits from the oil while washing. I also prepared some potpourri with plants from my garden, stirring in some coconut oil, then adding essential oil to use for aromatherapy. The coconut oil helps to spread the essential oils among the potpourri, so I need less of the expensive essential oil. I can even just use the oil, with a few drops of essential oil as my perfume, rather than spending so much on commercial perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback, regardless I only recommend products that worked for me and that I think will work for my readers.have many essential oils and some can cause redness, rash or sensitivity if used on their own.

            <li> I ordered and received my Coconut Oil in the stated time period. I love the FCO to use after shower or making essential oil blends. This includes a pump which makes it less messy when using. There was an book that came with it full of ideas of how to use your FCO. I will purchases another soon.</li>
            <li> will be ordering again as soon as I am low</li>
            <li> Love it - leaves my skin nice a smooth</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Love the oil!  And great savings deal too. This is my probably 4th purchase from the company (different products)</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product.. Ive been using jars of coconut oil for skin and hair but of course they solidify and i ended up having to take chunks out with my finger nail.. This is a liquid which comes with a pump or screw top lid.. Easy to use, spreads well on the skin and rubs in pretty quickly.. I dont think i would use it on my face under make up, feels a little shiny.  Do use it at night on my face.. Have used it on my hair with a shower cap.. Hair felt good after a wash.  No smell at all but i believe it can be used as a carrier oil for essential oils.. I just use it plain. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Due to allergies I am restricted to products associated with Coconut Oil.  Wow do I love this product.  I originally thought oh I will give this a try.  It moisturizes but does not stay really sticky like some oils do -  I mix it at night with non smelling cr√®me and it is the perfect mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> Love it and plan on ordering more. Works well with my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil to use with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it all over my body.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery. Great product for our family so far.</li>
            <li> Great, just wish it was bigger</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I use it on my baby and use it as a carrier oil with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered my 6th bottle because my family wants some as well. I use it for my hair, skin after shower, legs after I shave. It&#x27;s not greasy and very light weight.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! This product is phenomenal! It is silky and moisturizing and there&#x27;s no oily residue. It has replaced all of my moisturizers, and even my eye-makeup remover. It is soothing and luxurious for massage. An all-purpose, exquisite product! Buy it and experiment. You&#x27;ll be delighted!</li>
            <li> Love the pump that comes with it...very convenient</li>
            <li> Great product! The pump is a great idea, but watch it: this one comes out fast!</li>
            <li> I use this in my African American daughter&#x27;s hair after her bath and it works great! I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product! We appreciate the pump that is included.  This is an item that will be purchased again.</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixing and diluting essential oils or uses alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Massage is great with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;Baby oils tend to leave a residue and not flow as smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This won&#x27;t disappoint and the size is perfect and should last awhile even with regular use.</li>
            <li> I am sent products to try out in exchange for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;This review is requested to be shared on my personal website, FB and on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on my skin every day. I used it in two different places with opposite climate conditions: In the midwest of the USA (North Dakota) during a dry winter and in the warm spring temperature of Guatemala. It keeps my skin moisturized well and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out from it (I have sensitive skin). I like that it&#x27;s nongreasy unlike other oils and lotions. I also like that there&#x27;s no scent. I love coconut oil, but I don&#x27;t like that I smell like I&#x27;ve rubbed coconut from a tree all the time. The pump that comes with the product is great and so is the cap to allow you to store the oil properly. Unfortunately, I lost that recently and I am a bit bummed out about it since I travel a lot. This is a great amount and I will definitely order it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s upper shoulders where he was sunburned and where he started to peel and it really helped keep it moisturized! This is great because I also have a tendency to get sunburned on my upper shoulders.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my daughter-in-law&#x27;s suggestion to use as a carrier for homeopathic oils.  It might sound odd but I am using it on my bare skin on my face.  It&#x27;s very light-weight, extra nourishment for my 63 year old skin, underneath my regular serum and moisturizer.  I swear it increases the moisturizing qualities of my normal routine without feeling greasy.  Simple and natural and my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> Goes on a bit greasy, but soaks in dry in a few minutes. Makes my skin softer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical buying this product. Coconut oil and it&#x27;s many forms seems to be all the rage. I was scared that it would be way too greasy for my naturally oily skin and scalp. Then I realized there are many other uses.&lt;br /&gt;After a bit of Googling I was highly impr I was a little skeptical buying this product.

Then I realized there are many other uses &amp; I became obsessed with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;After googling &amp; you tubing a bit I discovered this oil can be used in cooking (not the oil out of this bottle.  Actually I am not sure if this product here is only for beauty. Can you ingest it? Maybe someone from &amp;#34;LaLune&amp;#34; will answer that for me )&lt;br /&gt;Any who, since I die my hair a lot I found out that you can put this on your hair first and it will protect it and keep it in fabulous condition, putting this on your feet at night before bed then putting socks on will enable you to wake with soft tootsies, awesome fo since I die my hair a lot I found out that you can put this on your hair first and it will protect it and keep it in fabulous condition,  apply it to your feet at night, put your socks on, wake up in the morning with soft beautiful feet versus my normal Fred Flintstone feet!

            <li> It&#x27;s not too sticky like other oil does. I will be back for more thanks again!</li>
            <li> Great for mixing with essential oils or just using alone for dry skin!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. The &amp;#34;Free&amp;#34; pump that came with it is defective and does not work. I don&#x27;t want to have to return everything and pay for shipping just to get a pump that works. Otherwise the product would get 5 stars from me.  Thanks, Skye Dupre</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is amazing! I use it everyday, sometimes multiple times a day! It has no scent so you won&#x27;t end up smelling like a college kid on spring break!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great in my hair, my split and dry ends are practically gone in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;When La Lune asked for a review, I was more than happy to give one. I highly recommend this to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more for sure, I am a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping; natural product will order more.</li>
            <li> Product delivered quickly and as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Pro: It works well as a moisturizer, I&#x27;ve been going to the beach a lot and needed something for my sun burnt skin.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Not scent free. While they didn&#x27;t add any scents I wish they had. Something like Coconut would be good. As it is it has a heavily processes smell. That&#x27;s the best way to describe it. Not a to strong but unpleasant so I would recommend putting on something with a scent afterward especially if going on a date or something.</li>
            <li> Good size bottle for the money, although it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased solid coconut oils in the past and used it for lots of things but only recently was introduced to fractionated coconut oil, but I am loving how easy it is to use.  I find it&#x27;s easier to use for a hair conditioner because it is liquid at room temperature (unlike non-fractionated coconut oil) and the pump makes it really convenient to use.  The solid coconut oils I&#x27;ve purchased are all in large tubs, so always removing it with a clean spoon (to prevent bacteria from growing in it) isn&#x27;t as quick and easy to use as the pump is with fractionated coconut oil.  I massage this  into my scalp and all of my hair (especially the ends) and wrap it up, leaving it overnight and I can notice a big difference in how moisturized my hair feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has no noticeable scent and makes for a great carrier oil or for adding to body butters.  It also is nice just straight out of the bottle on your skin after a hot shower.  Very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;____________________&lt;br /&gt;Made by: LaLuneNaturals&lt;br /&gt;Made in: U.S.A.&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: LaLuneNaturals&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 3 days after order date&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Bottle arrived with pump in separate plastic bag with twist tie inside larger box containing other items.</li>
            <li> Got this to use as a massage oil for labor.  Still haven&#x27;t had the baby, but we&#x27;ve given each other massages with it a few times.  When it arrived the bottle was in plastic, which is good as a tiny bit of oil had leaked.  It&#x27;s unscented, which is perfect for someone who has problem with strong smells (pretty sure that&#x27;ll be worse in labor).</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell the difference between this and the big box store brand  Even when the box store product is melted.  This is very smooth and light and soaks right in.  Use for everything on skin and hair.  And of course diluting precious oils.</li>
            <li> This is good quality oil, mixes easily with all my essential oils to make face wash, lotion, shaving lotion.  There&#x27;s an ebook of helpful recipes that comes with it.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Nice - love an easy to use coconut oil. Appreciate the customer contact from the company as well. Pleasant experience to purchase from them.</li>
            <li> Nice light massage oil.  This oil works well for massage, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy.  Customer service is amazing,  there was a small discrepancy in my second order and they reshipped the entire order.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for any better service,  thank you!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing oil!  It removes my mascara with ease, no burning like many so-called gentle formulas. I use it all over my face as a wonderful moisturizer under my Retin A, making it absorb better with no irritation.  It works great on cuticles too.  I love that there is no scent because all scented products give me a headache.  You get a generous amount for the money - so spoil yourself!</li>
            <li> What a great product! The pump is very convenient and it doesn&#x27;t pump out very much, just enough you need. This is not cold-pressed, btw, it has been heated. That doesn&#x27;t mean anything to me, but I know a lot of people look for that.</li>
            <li> The fractionated coconut oil is light, easily absorbed into the skin and scalp, and convenient because it stays in liquid form. My package arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks, LaLune, for including a free pump for the bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great price and quick ship.</li>
            <li> Received this Coconut Oil for free! First time ever trying coconut oil and we were pleasantly surprised! We used it on our hair and skin! Absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I looove this coconut oil!! I use it on my hair mainly. However it is good as a moisturizer on my skin. I use it for hot oil treatments on my hair in conjunction with almond oil and other hair products! Its great!</li>
            <li> Love this coconut oil.  Absorbs quickly and I am already seeing a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing!!!  I have had a lot of issues with Rosacea on my nose.  I have tried several prescription products ordered by my doctor, and still have issues with rosacea.  I decided to give coconut oil a try, and so far, it has cleared up the rosacea on my nose.  I also love it as a moisturizer around my fingernails.  It is a generous size bottle and love the pump.  I will definitely be ordering this again.  Great Product!!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy your product. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
            <li> Nice product. Luv it! I use it on my hair and skin. No issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Love this coconut oil!!!  It really works great as a carrier oil for all my extracts.  It absorbs really well on the skin and makes my hair soft and shiny.  I mix a little of this oil with sugar and a drop of peppermint oil as a scrub for my dry lips and it makes them so soft  This is a must in my beauty regime.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely. There was some spillage of oil on outside of oil container, but the bottle was very full.  The oils is high quality and I love the pump lid.  Very pleased w LaLune products this time and previously.  I would definitely buy from them again.  They often give coupons for future purchases</li>
            <li> excellent product, no scent so I can use this as a carrier oil and it will not affect the smell of my essential oils. Also a very good price and prompt delivery. This is also the purchase of my third bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of this Fractionated Coconut Oil. I ordered an extra one by accident and was going to return one but decided to keep both. I keep one at downstairs and 2nd one on upstairs. I had bad calluses on my feet for a very long time. They were deep and nasty. After I started using this oil on my feet, the calluses have almost completely disappeared. I also get itchy skin during summer time. I apply the coconut oil and peppermint on the skin and it cools my itchy skin down. The free pump came with the bottles made easy to use the oil. Without it, it would be messy to use as it is very light liquid.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and reasonably priced. Very happy to be able to obtain it easily via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very obsessed with coconut oil just for everything it could do. This product is amazing just because it&#x27;s forever in liquid form so it&#x27;s easier to be used</li>
            <li> I love having the pump.</li>
            <li> Great product. Lots of information.</li>
            <li> My doctor mentioned using Coconut Oil as a moisturizer.  I decided to give it a try.  I was very impressed with this oil. Its very moisturizing and non-greasy.  Best part, no smell.  Can&#x27;t wait to experiment by adding essential oils.</li>
            <li> This is very nice, no smell, works great and a little goes a long way.  I use it on everything</li>
            <li> This product works well enough. However, the bottle won&#x27;t stop leaking. Very wasteful and annoying...</li>
