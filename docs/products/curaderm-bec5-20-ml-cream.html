    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I had what was best described as an ulcerating keratosis on my collarbone.  </li>
            <li>Though the area is now pinkish but not sore, I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Better instructions would have been helpful!!</li>
            <li>After having successfully treated a sizable non-melanoma malignancy, on my arm, I am now treating some sunspots on the forehead and hands.</li>
            <li>for most impressive user reviews.  </li>
            <li>Good news -</li>
            <li>He looked at me and said: \\&quot;I have good news for you - we found that your skin has no cancer cells.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>My head is now looking rather good in that regard.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results from using the Curaderm-Bec5 product.</li>
            <li>In many cases I think surgery by a good plastic surgeon is preferable.  </li>
            <li>Doctor also told me that Lugolis Iodine will do the trick, as well as a very strong hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got three more sunspots to go since I like to remove them one at a time</li>
            <li>the stuff works; but I have scarring where I removed the sunspots - a worthwhile tradeoff, IMO.</li>
            <li>make sure you have confirmation that you having a non-melanoma form of cells.</li>
            <li>My NP suggested this cream after we, had frozen off,many spots on my nose and face, but  they kept coming back,this was from too many years in the Hawaiian sun.  </li>
            <li>THE RASH IS BETTER.</li>
            <li>OK, so this stuff seems to work.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.    </li>
            <li>I am satisfied and glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the results and would recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li>I am very thankful for this very effective remedy, and am taking advantage of the fall and winter months to treat the sun damaged skin spots.</li>
            <li>Curaderm is really great for curing many skin conditions that over the counter products can not help with ,and I would highly recommend ordering the product from Amazon .</li>
            <li>it is a liquid, not a cream, with some creamy lumps in it at times, and to clean the top of the tube each time.   </li>
            <li>He strongly recommended not doing that; however, I went ahead and applied Curaderm for 10 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure you see a dermatologist first to be sure it&#x27;s a benign cancer.  </li>
            <li>I like the two inch micropoere tape because you can cut it to fit the size of the area that you want to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be honest that doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference.</li>
            <li>Smooth, even skin.  </li>
            <li>This is most important to know coze mistake might be very costly!  </li>
            <li>I first purchased Curaderm more than 15 years ago when it was $10 for 20ml tube</li>
            <li>That is, it may gradually shift or move from its original location.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure (at 65).    </li>
            <li>I thank my lucky stars I found out about Curaderm.  </li>
            <li>Now it is 1050% higher and doesn&#x27;t come with the gel!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the company would want me to have them checked by a professional, but as a holistic physician myself, I&#x27;m feeling pretty comfortable with these results.</li>
            <li>I think Curaderm should be applied for eight to twelve weeks to be fairly sure that the treatment is complete.  </li>
            <li>ITS WORTH A TRY.  </li>
            <li>But I guess if it works, it will be worth it.    </li>
            <li>I learned a lot from that experience, and  six years later my cheek is about 98% normal in appearance, even with fairly close inspection.</li>
            <li>and it dissolved it and within a month it has filled in with new skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to see if the new skin is gradually affected by sunlight to have a more normal matching color</li>
            <li>I have had benign skin cancers for thirty years and have many scars and gouges from the Mohs surgeries that were necessary.  </li>
            <li>What has happened to make the price go up so much?!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the scar as much as the depression!    </li>
            <li>The process wasn&#x27;t pretty</li>
            <li>they are the fastest on the market when it comes to buying on the internet ,and they deliver exactly what you order.</li>
            <li>Yes, this cream really works!  </li>
            <li>It started eating away at the cancer cells with the first treatment.  </li>
            <li>To help with that, after you&#x27;ve gotten the micropore tape on the lesion to which you&#x27;ve applied the cream, you can apply a hot damp wash cloth.</li>
            <li>A couple were confirmed by a professional as either cancerous or pre-cancer.  </li>
            <li>nothing ever healed it up for more than maybe a day before it would split open again and start to bleed, etc.  </li>
            <li>First couple days I didn&#x27;t feel any of the burning that people described.  </li>
            <li>Despite the high price, it&#x27;s still worth the money.</li>
            <li>The wound closed, became red and is now healing very nicely...</li>
            <li>But as many others have also noted, a scar is far better than an open wound, constantly bleeding and ruining my clothes.    </li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with 3 large basal cell carcinomas on my nose.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned out the wound and it looked pretty clean, though still obviously unhealed.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a number of precancerous sunspots from too much sun and decided to try Curaderm about two weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>He looked really puzzled.</li>
            <li>thanks you</li>
            <li>THIS IS REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE.  </li>
            <li>HAVE REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li>For that much money, I was literally embarrassed for myself when I opened the box and saw it.    </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s an old cancer that&#x27;s been growing for many years, the lesions can be deep, extensive, and require many months to eradicate, necessitating several tubes of the cream to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had it for about 5 years, and it was pretty much crusty and gross and bleeding pretty much every day.  </li>
            <li>as many have said before, which basically means that there was an icky layer of pus-like fluid over top of it.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist had confirmed the sites were clear of cancer (but strangely enough didn&#x27;t want to know why), so I used Curaderm on my cheek with confidence.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and only takes about a month to heal.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to you.  </li>
            <li>Curaderm-Bec5 cream is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Worked; sunspots turn white and swell up, unlike healthy tissue, then a day or two later the sunspot starts getting soft and flaking off.  </li>
            <li>It then takes about a month for the skin to return to normal.</li>
            <li>From all of this experience I have learned some things worth sharing for advice in extensive cases, using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The skin is very slightly darker than the surrounding skin, but at 76 years old, my skin is far from as nice as a baby&#x27;s anyway.  </li>
            <li>Then a friend told me about Curaderm, which was a relatively new product at that time.</li>
            <li>I started to just live with it.  </li>
            <li>The first one was on my neck, at the top of my spine, and was a long, painful experience, with three applications, each one taking a chunk of meat out, as large as a silver dollar, and leaving a 1/4\\&quot; cavity that a golf ball could rest in nicely.  </li>
            <li>The first sunspot on my right knee is gone and now is completely healed, the second on my right thigh is almost healed, the third on my right hand left a deep hole where the keratosis was but has scabbed over and is healing.  </li>
            <li>On my head, I have seen it attack areas 1-1/2\\&quot; or more distant from the obvious cancer area.</li>
            <li>My bottle seems mostly liquid, I applied, this, with a Qtip to areas, and put a bandaid on it at night..and in 7 weeks I had a peeling off of skin, and no more soreness at the sites.  </li>
            <li>They had grown quite large and I needed extensive Mohs surgery and plastic surgery to fix.  </li>
            <li>My cheek is now clear and has no scar.  </li>
            <li>it was clearly \\&quot;eating away\\</li>
            <li>When I developed a lesion on my lower leg that was about 1 inch in diameter, I showed it to my primary-care physician.  </li>
            <li>I frequently develop squamous cell lesions.  </li>
            <li>There was MUCH pain associated with that, and every subsequent application of bloodroot salve.  </li>
            <li>Surprised me.</li>
            <li>After the five days, I took it off, and it had basically healed over completely.  </li>
            <li>If you can afford it, I now recommend the Curaderm, but if you&#x27;re willing to endure a bit more pain and save a few dollars, go with the bloodroot black salve.    </li>
            <li>It works quickly and painlessly, leaving only new, pink skin where the cancer was.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to resist putting the cream on new lesions that are opening up, and I doubt that would work very well anyway, even though it is desirable to not be treating more than about two square inches of open lesion area in total.</li>
            <li>After 10 weeks the lesion site looked pretty rough, so I got worried and went to the Moh&#x27;s surgeon.  </li>
            <li>He has been using it for a month now and the area is slowly filling in with new skin from the edges and the depressed area is becoming smaller.  </li>
            <li>Also, the new skin that grows back will be somewhat un pigmented.</li>
            <li>When I put some cream on the area, the red dots would produce craters, the size of a dime or a nickle, or maybe develop into a shallow eroded valley, one inch or two or more in length.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth  is, if you get too many lesions going at once, it can take a long time outof your day to treat them at least twice per day, as is recommended per the instructions.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST ONE AND HALF YEARS OF BATTLING THE RASH WITH PERSCRIPTION DRUGS</li>
            <li>Each time the surgeon failed to remove the whole cancer and it reappeared along the suture line, thus becoming larger with each surgery.  </li>
            <li>I had to use it on several different &#x60;reincarnations&#x27; of the cancer in that area because the surgery had scrambled the connections between the cancer cells that remained, so the cream could not follow them all to get rid of the entire cancer as it normally would.</li>
            <li>I first started using it in 2006 on what remained of a cancerous mole on my left cheek which, after trying several other things including \\&quot;PDQ,\\</li>
            <li>I STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE I AM CLEAR OF THE RASH, BUT</li>
            <li>The Curaderm cream definitely eradicates skin cancer, and it apparently works by the biochemical method that the literature says it does.</li>
            <li>The instructions on the Curaderm web site says to apply it until the area is covered with \\&quot;new pink skin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Apparently, the skin on different parts of the body has different tendencies to scar.</li>
            <li>2 years ago I was diagnosed for non-melanoma form skin cancer - a small red stain on the right side of my nose.</li>
            <li>After cleaning on day 4 or 5, I noticed that the area that used to be the main ulcerating part of the keritosis had been completely eaten away and left a small divot maybe 1/4\\&quot; deep.  </li>

            <li> Surprised me.</li>
            <li> After the five days, I took it off, and it had basically healed over completely.  </li>
            <li> If you can afford it, I now recommend the Curaderm, but if you&#x27;re willing to endure a bit more pain and save a few dollars, go with the bloodroot black salve.    </li>
            <li> It works quickly and painlessly, leaving only new, pink skin where the cancer was.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to resist putting the cream on new lesions that are opening up, and I doubt that would work very well anyway, even though it is desirable to not be treating more than about two square inches of open lesion area in total.</li>
            <li> After 10 weeks the lesion site looked pretty rough, so I got worried and went to the Moh&#x27;s surgeon.  </li>
            <li> He has been using it for a month now and the area is slowly filling in with new skin from the edges and the depressed area is becoming smaller.  </li>
            <li> Also, the new skin that grows back will be somewhat un pigmented.</li>
            <li> When I put some cream on the area, the red dots would produce craters, the size of a dime or a nickle, or maybe develop into a shallow eroded valley, one inch or two or more in length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth  is, if you get too many lesions going at once, it can take a long time outof your day to treat them at least twice per day, as is recommended per the instructions.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST ONE AND HALF YEARS OF BATTLING THE RASH WITH PERSCRIPTION DRUGS</li>
            <li> Each time the surgeon failed to remove the whole cancer and it reappeared along the suture line, thus becoming larger with each surgery.  </li>
            <li> I had to use it on several different &#x60;reincarnations&#x27; of the cancer in that area because the surgery had scrambled the connections between the cancer cells that remained, so the cream could not follow them all to get rid of the entire cancer as it normally would.</li>
            <li> I first started using it in 2006 on what remained of a cancerous mole on my left cheek which, after trying several other things including \\&quot;PDQ,\\</li>
            <li> I STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE I AM CLEAR OF THE RASH, BUT</li>
            <li> The Curaderm cream definitely eradicates skin cancer, and it apparently works by the biochemical method that the literature says it does.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the Curaderm web site says to apply it until the area is covered with \\&quot;new pink skin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Apparently, the skin on different parts of the body has different tendencies to scar.</li>
            <li> 2 years ago I was diagnosed for non-melanoma form skin cancer - a small red stain on the right side of my nose.</li>
            <li> After cleaning on day 4 or 5, I noticed that the area that used to be the main ulcerating part of the keritosis had been completely eaten away and left a small divot maybe 1/4\\&quot; deep.  </li>
            <li> In other spots the healing is complete, but they were smaller in size.   </li>
            <li> but the outcome was pretty amazing!Everyday as I applied the cream it would burn like fire for about an hour (maybe less).Within the month the burning stopped, the wound healed and you can hardly tell I had the carcenoma.</li>
            <li> I would get a little red dot or two, on clear white skin nearby.</li>
            <li> I was told upon inquiry to Dr. Cham&#x27;s office, who developed the cream, if you keep the cream application in the open lesions there will be less, tendencies to scar.</li>
            <li> My order came fast and I start applying a small amount of cream 3 times a day during 2 weeks up to the operation day.</li>
            <li> The one thing I felt the product did not address was how long one should use it , or the actually look of the results, and what to expect, after 8 weeks.   </li>
            <li> The scar issue was not really a problem for me, but I just recently read a case on Dr. Gary Gordon&#x27;s website about this product, and thought I&#x27;d like to give it a try before going back to have surgery.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I used the cream way too long on my sun spots and now have a depression and a scar on my cheek.</li>
            <li> and you fell down and skinned your knee, and your mother put iodine on it, and your knee &#x60;lit up like fire&#x27; for a few minutes, if not worse.</li>
            <li> , I bought it (it was more expensive), and it worked even faster, with much less pain, and no scar on the two times I tried it.  </li>
            <li> It took two tubes and about 4 weeks, much better than my MDs plan for a painful and messy solution lasting nearly a year.</li>
            <li> Well, when that day finally came, I already knew about Curaderm and had used it on two other sites.  </li>
            <li> that helped me (and later to some other people I shared my experience with).</li>
            <li> However, we tried it on several lesions other places on our body</li>
            <li> One on my back reacted and am now treating it, but several others showed no response, which I&#x27;m taking to mean they aren&#x27;t likely cancerous.  </li>
            <li> A couple days later there was no more change in the wound, so I decided it was enough.  </li>
            <li> Even convinced my super skeptical wife.    </li>
            <li> the skin is a little waxy and still red so it may end up leaving a scar.  </li>
            <li> The area healed very well over several weeks, and after about three months it became difficult to see where the lesion was.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and each time I applied the cream it burned moderately for a few minutes and</li>
            <li> I had used Curaderm on several small lesions that I thought were probably squamous cell carcinoma and it cleared them up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First is that the cream will attack nearby cancerous areas other than the one that you can see and that you think you are treating.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because the scalp has lots of nerves, compared to other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Curaderm on other skin lesions as a sort of test, to see if there would be any reaction.  </li>
            <li> Had 3 dark spots on the tip of my nose.  </li>
            <li> The moist heat will help settle the pain down some.</li>
            <li> I think I maybe should have just used the cream for 1 week or less on those.  </li>
            <li> I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY RASH IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.</li>
            <li> But it probably costs me less than a dollar to treat one cancerous spot.  </li>
            <li> In all YES YES, instead of doctors cutting into skin and body, I would recomment friends to us this first....</li>
            <li> In the last year (2011 - 2012) I have used the Curaderm to get rid of skin cancer on almost all of my head (it looked like a red, raw, &#x27;moonscape&#x27; with craters and deep ugly miniature canyons, eroded areas etc.</li>
            <li> It was a little worrisome I will admit.  </li>
            <li> My understanding of how to use this product was not great due to the limited information on the product information sheet.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a little hard to do, because the area becomes reddish and somewhat weepy.  </li>
            <li> A small piece of skin from my nose was removed and taken to the lab for examination.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure of this produce and being a Holistic practitioner, I used it as described.  </li>
            <li> Two years ago a dermatologist told me the small indented lesion on my forehead was precancerous.</li>
            <li> Tends to leave a small scar, which doesn&#x27;t bother me, since I&#x27;ll not be entering any bathing suit competitions</li>
            <li> But I just think you should know how seriously small this thing is.  </li>
            <li> But there was no more broken, scraggly skin, no bleeding.    </li>
            <li> &quot; what I imagine to be the diseased tissue, leaving a half inch roundish wound.  </li>
            <li> On the belly and ribs, it can also sting and burn for a few seconds, or minutes, but not so painful as on the head.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t bloody</li>
            <li> IT WORST.  </li>

            <li> I have had benign skin cancers for thirty years and have many scars and gouges from the Mohs surgeries that were necessary.  I always dreaded the day I&#x27;d learn I had a skin cancer on my face.  Well, when that day finally came, I already knew about Curaderm and had used it on two other sites.  My dermatologist had confirmed the sites were clear of cancer (but strangely enough didn&#x27;t want to know why), so I used Curaderm on my cheek with confidence.  My cheek is now clear and has no scar.  I thank my lucky stars I found out about Curaderm.  I highly recommend it to you.  Just be sure you see a dermatologist first to be sure it&#x27;s a benign cancer.  Monica Caulfield</li>
            <li> I first purchased Curaderm more than 15 years ago when it was $10 for 20ml tube and it came with a disinfectant gel. Now it is 1050% higher and doesn&#x27;t come with the gel! What has happened to make the price go up so much?! Despite the high price, it&#x27;s still worth the money. It kills skin cancer cells. In fact, if you have a spot that you suspect is cancerous you can treat it with Curaderm. If there&#x27;s no pain or redness after 4 or 5 days of treatment it&#x27;s not cancer.</li>
            <li> Had some doubt about the effectiveness of the product. Have NO DOUBTS now. Did everything it claimed even quicker than predicted. Even convinced my super skeptical wife.    THX CuraDerm.    Doug R</li>
            <li> My understanding of how to use this product was not great due to the limited information on the product information sheet.  As a result, I used the cream way too long on my sun spots and now have a depression and a scar on my cheek. I don&#x27;t mind the scar as much as the depression!    There is no question that this cream works though.  I also had 2 precancerous spots and they are gone after 8 weeks of application...and without scarring.  My husband had 2 basal cell that are gone and healed without scarring as well.  But for some reason, all the sun spots that I treated have scars.  I think I maybe should have just used the cream for 1 week or less on those.  I thought that you had to wait for them to stop looking pus laden before you stopped.    Better instructions would have been helpful!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results from using the Curaderm-Bec5 product. After having successfully treated a sizable non-melanoma malignancy, on my arm, I am now treating some sunspots on the forehead and hands. I am very thankful for this very effective remedy, and am taking advantage of the fall and winter months to treat the sun damaged skin spots. Curaderm-Bec5 cream is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it but gave it a try. I was amazed how the cream ate away the cancer. The process wasn&#x27;t pretty but the outcome was pretty amazing!Everyday as I applied the cream it would burn like fire for about an hour (maybe less).Within the month the burning stopped, the wound healed and you can hardly tell I had the carcenoma.</li>
            <li> Curaderm is really great for curing many skin conditions that over the counter products can not help with ,and I would highly recommend ordering the product from Amazon . they are the fastest on the market when it comes to buying on the internet ,and they deliver exactly what you order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a number of precancerous sunspots from too much sun and decided to try Curaderm about two weeks ago.  The first sunspot on my right knee is gone and now is completely healed, the second on my right thigh is almost healed, the third on my right hand left a deep hole where the keratosis was but has scabbed over and is healing.  I use bandaids to cover the Curaderm when I apply it to the sunspots and use iodine to keep the wound disinfected once Curaderm has removed the keratosis.  Worked; sunspots turn white and swell up, unlike healthy tissue, then a day or two later the sunspot starts getting soft and flaking off.  I&#x27;ve got three more sunspots to go since I like to remove them one at a time so I do not run out of Curaderm in the middle of a treatment.  Good news - the stuff works; but I have scarring where I removed the sunspots - a worthwhile tradeoff, IMO.</li>
            <li> 2 years ago I was diagnosed for non-melanoma form skin cancer - a small red stain on the right side of my nose. My doctor scheduled an operation 3 weeks after the biopsy day so same day I started searching the Internet for alternative options and choose BEC-5 for most impressive user reviews.  My order came fast and I start applying a small amount of cream 3 times a day during 2 weeks up to the operation day. On the back of my mind I did not believe that BEC-5 will do a miracle so I did not cancel operation. A small piece of skin from my nose was removed and taken to the lab for examination.  40 min later when I still was sitting in the chair when my doctor returned back. He looked really puzzled. He looked at me and said: \\&quot;I have good news for you - we found that your skin has no cancer cells. Hm... What did you do?\\&quot;  Just then I told him about my research and about BEC-5 that helped me (and later to some other people I shared my experience with). Yes, this cream really works!  However, if you planning to start using BEC-5 make sure you have confirmation that you having a non-melanoma form of cells. This is most important to know coze mistake might be very costly!  Good luck.</li>
            <li> My son had surgery twice to remove a basal cell carcinoma from his scalp.  Each time the surgeon failed to remove the whole cancer and it reappeared along the suture line, thus becoming larger with each surgery.  Then we ordered some of this cream.  It started eating away at the cancer cells with the first treatment.  Just as the literature describes, it gets larger and what was a raised area becomes depressed.  He has been using it for a month now and the area is slowly filling in with new skin from the edges and the depressed area is becoming smaller.  I am very impressed.  I also used it on a lesion my husband had on his forehead and it dissolved it and within a month it has filled in with new skin.  This lesion had not been biopsied, so I don&#x27;t know what it was.  However, we tried it on several lesions other places on our body and it did nothing, so I tend to assume what my husband had was either cancerous or pre-cancerous, since the cream is only designed to work on that type of lesion.</li>
            <li> It works quickly and painlessly, leaving only new, pink skin where the cancer was.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I had used Curaderm on several small lesions that I thought were probably squamous cell carcinoma and it cleared them up.  When I developed a lesion on my lower leg that was about 1 inch in diameter, I showed it to my primary-care physician.  He biopsied it and the pathology report said it was squamous cell carcinoma.  My doctor recommended Moh&#x27;s surgery, but I told him I was going to try Curaderm on it.  He strongly recommended not doing that; however, I went ahead and applied Curaderm for 10 weeks.  After 10 weeks the lesion site looked pretty rough, so I got worried and went to the Moh&#x27;s surgeon.  He biopsied it and found no cancer.  He recommended the application of Fluocinonide 0.05% ointment to aid in healing.  The area healed very well over several weeks, and after about three months it became difficult to see where the lesion was.  The skin is very slightly darker than the surrounding skin, but at 76 years old, my skin is far from as nice as a baby&#x27;s anyway.  There has been no recurrence after about three years.    I frequently develop squamous cell lesions.  I have had about 30 surgically removed.  In many cases I think surgery by a good plastic surgeon is preferable.  It&#x27;s quick and only takes about a month to heal.  The difficulty in using Curaderm is determining when to stop applying it.  The instructions on the Curaderm web site says to apply it until the area is covered with \\&quot;new pink skin.\\&quot;  That&#x27;s a little hard to do, because the area becomes reddish and somewhat weepy.  I think Curaderm should be applied for eight to twelve weeks to be fairly sure that the treatment is complete.  It then takes about a month for the skin to return to normal.</li>
            <li> The Curaderm cream definitely eradicates skin cancer, and it apparently works by the biochemical method that the literature says it does. I first started using it in 2006 on what remained of a cancerous mole on my left cheek which, after trying several other things including \\&quot;PDQ,\\&quot; I finally had gotten mhos surgery to get rid of the mole. However, in about 3-4 months afterward, the cancer was coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The area began itching again, just like before. Then a friend told me about Curaderm, which was a relatively new product at that time. I had to use it on several different &#x60;reincarnations&#x27; of the cancer in that area because the surgery had scrambled the connections between the cancer cells that remained, so the cream could not follow them all to get rid of the entire cancer as it normally would. I learned a lot from that experience, and  six years later my cheek is about 98% normal in appearance, even with fairly close inspection. In the last year (2011 - 2012) I have used the Curaderm to get rid of skin cancer on almost all of my head (it looked like a red, raw, &#x27;moonscape&#x27; with craters and deep ugly miniature canyons, eroded areas etc. while I was extensively working on it). I am still working on my belly and forearms. From all of this experience I have learned some things worth sharing for advice in extensive cases, using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First is that the cream will attack nearby cancerous areas other than the one that you can see and that you think you are treating. That&#x27;s because of the biochemical way in which the \\&quot;BEC\\&quot; ingredient works. As the cream kills the cancer cells it creates lesions. On my head, I have seen it attack areas 1-1/2\\&quot; or more distant from the obvious cancer area. I would get a little red dot or two, on clear white skin nearby. When I put some cream on the area, the red dots would produce craters, the size of a dime or a nickle, or maybe develop into a shallow eroded valley, one inch or two or more in length. Also, a lesion you are working on may &#x60;migrate.&#x27; That is, it may gradually shift or move from its original location. That&#x27;s because there are cancer cells immediately nearby that are not visible on the skin surface. If it&#x27;s an old cancer that&#x27;s been growing for many years, the lesions can be deep, extensive, and require many months to eradicate, necessitating several tubes of the cream to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second is that lesions on the head can cause a lot of stinging pain when the cream is applied. That&#x27;s because the scalp has lots of nerves, compared to other parts of the body. It can be like when you were a child and you fell down and skinned your knee, and your mother put iodine on it, and your knee &#x60;lit up like fire&#x27; for a few minutes, if not worse. To help with that, after you&#x27;ve gotten the micropore tape on the lesion to which you&#x27;ve applied the cream, you can apply a hot damp wash cloth. The moist heat will help settle the pain down some. Then you can move onto the next lesion. On the belly and ribs, it can also sting and burn for a few seconds, or minutes, but not so painful as on the head. I like the two inch micropoere tape because you can cut it to fit the size of the area that you want to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, regards raised scarring. My head is now looking rather good in that regard. But I have some raised scarring on my chest and belly that appears to be reducing somewhat as time goes by. I was told upon inquiry to Dr. Cham&#x27;s office, who developed the cream, if you keep the cream application in the open lesions there will be less, tendencies to scar. To be honest that doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference. Apparently, the skin on different parts of the body has different tendencies to scar. Also, the new skin that grows back will be somewhat un pigmented. I&#x27;ll have to see if the new skin is gradually affected by sunlight to have a more normal matching color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth  is, if you get too many lesions going at once, it can take a long time outof your day to treat them at least twice per day, as is recommended per the instructions. That can be unavoidable if your lesions are migrating as I explain above. It&#x27;s hard to resist putting the cream on new lesions that are opening up, and I doubt that would work very well anyway, even though it is desirable to not be treating more than about two square inches of open lesion area in total. That&#x27;s because of the strain on your body to heal, and the time required to treat a lot of lesions at one time, and for an extended period of time, which may be unavoidable as I explain. For about eight months I was spending about five hours per day on it, in the shower removing tape, cleaning the lesions, drying off, shaving my head, applying cream and tape to the lesions etc.</li>
            <li> My NP suggested this cream after we, had frozen off,many spots on my nose and face, but  they kept coming back,this was from too many years in the Hawaiian sun.  I was not sure of this produce and being a Holistic practitioner, I used it as described.  The one thing I felt the product did not address was how long one should use it , or the actually look of the results, and what to expect, after 8 weeks.   Or whether you can use it again and how soon. My bottle seems mostly liquid, I applied, this, with a Qtip to areas, and put a bandaid on it at night..and in 7 weeks I had a peeling off of skin, and no more soreness at the sites.  Though the area is now pinkish but not sore, I am happy with the results.  In other spots the healing is complete, but they were smaller in size.   My recommendation is to alert the people using this product to know it is a liquid, not a cream, with some creamy lumps in it at times, and to clean the top of the tube each time.   As it crystalizes.  In all YES YES, instead of doctors cutting into skin and body, I would recomment friends to us this first....thanks you</li>
            <li> Two years ago a dermatologist told me the small indented lesion on my forehead was precancerous. This was at the same time she removed a tiny basal cell carcinoma from my forearm, which left a two inch scar.  The scar issue was not really a problem for me, but I just recently read a case on Dr. Gary Gordon&#x27;s website about this product, and thought I&#x27;d like to give it a try before going back to have surgery.  I followed the instructions and each time I applied the cream it burned moderately for a few minutes and it was clearly \\&quot;eating away\\&quot; what I imagine to be the diseased tissue, leaving a half inch roundish wound.  Within about 6 days the stinging sensation stopped, replaced by itching that I associate with healing.  The wound closed, became red and is now healing very nicely...maybe even without a scar.   Incidently...I&#x27;ve used Curaderm on other skin lesions as a sort of test, to see if there would be any reaction.  One on my back reacted and am now treating it, but several others showed no response, which I&#x27;m taking to mean they aren&#x27;t likely cancerous.  I&#x27;m sure the company would want me to have them checked by a professional, but as a holistic physician myself, I&#x27;m feeling pretty comfortable with these results.</li>
            <li> I SPREAD THIS ALL OVER A RASH I HAVE BEEN BATTLING FOR 2 YEARS.  IT ONLY STUNG IN THE AREA WHERE THE RASH WAS.  THE RASH IS BETTER. I WOULD TRY THIS BEFORE HAVING A DOCTOR CUT ON ME TO REMOVE A SPOT ON MY BODY, AND LEAVING A SCAR.  ITS WORTH A TRY.  I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY RASH IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS. I STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE I AM CLEAR OF THE RASH, BUT THIS IS REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE.  THE FIRST ONE AND HALF YEARS OF BATTLING THE RASH WITH PERSCRIPTION DRUGS ONLY MADE IT WORST.  THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF USING ALL NATURALS,AND WATCHING MY DIET ( PHASE ONE DIET) HAVE REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE. THIS IS PART OF MY REGIME.  I WILL ALWAYS KEEP A TUBE ON HAND.</li>
            <li> I have used the bloodroot salve for years, on skin cancers.  A couple were confirmed by a professional as either cancerous or pre-cancer.  The first one was on my neck, at the top of my spine, and was a long, painful experience, with three applications, each one taking a chunk of meat out, as large as a silver dollar, and leaving a 1/4\\&quot; cavity that a golf ball could rest in nicely.  There was MUCH pain associated with that, and every subsequent application of bloodroot salve.  But it probably costs me less than a dollar to treat one cancerous spot.  Tends to leave a small scar, which doesn&#x27;t bother me, since I&#x27;ll not be entering any bathing suit competitions, I&#x27;m pretty sure (at 65).    When my MD (!) recommended Curaderm, I bought it (it was more expensive), and it worked even faster, with much less pain, and no scar on the two times I tried it.  If you can afford it, I now recommend the Curaderm, but if you&#x27;re willing to endure a bit more pain and save a few dollars, go with the bloodroot black salve.    Doctor also told me that Lugolis Iodine will do the trick, as well as a very strong hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> Curaderm Bec5 actually removed keratosis, a pre cancerous condition of the scalp. It took two tubes and about 4 weeks, much better than my MDs plan for a painful and messy solution lasting nearly a year. Surprised me. J Smith</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with 3 large basal cell carcinomas on my nose.  They had grown quite large and I needed extensive Mohs surgery and plastic surgery to fix.  As a last resort I tried Curaderm.  After 12 weeks all the spots have literally dissolved.  This treatment saved me from a very extensive, invasive, and costly ($30,000) surgery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review in a couple weeks to give the results.  But I just think you should know how seriously small this thing is.  The tube is barely larger than my thumb.  For that much money, I was literally embarrassed for myself when I opened the box and saw it.    But I guess if it works, it will be worth it.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;  Update  &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;    OK, so this stuff seems to work.  I had what was best described as an ulcerating keratosis on my collarbone.  About the size of a shirt button.  I&#x27;d had it for about 5 years, and it was pretty much crusty and gross and bleeding pretty much every day.  Ruined t-shirts, bed sheets, pillow cases, you name it.    Nothing I ever tried worked.  I tried manuka honey, sunspot gel, lysine, peroxide, hydrocolloid bandages... nothing ever healed it up for more than maybe a day before it would split open again and start to bleed, etc.  I started to just live with it.  I don&#x27;t know where I came across this product, but I decided to try it after reading the reviews.  Glad I did.    So I basically used it for 7 or 8 days.  First couple days I didn&#x27;t feel any of the burning that people described.  On day number 3 it started to burn.  By day five it was literally eating away the scarred, ulcerating wound.  What used to be about the size of a shirt button now was eaten away to about the size of a nickel.  It was a little worrisome I will admit.  But it wasn&#x27;t bloody, it was just like the layers of skin had been eaten away.  This wound also started to \\&quot;weep\\&quot;, as many have said before, which basically means that there was an icky layer of pus-like fluid over top of it.  But it wasn&#x27;t like an infection, it was just that sort of yellowy color.    After cleaning on day 4 or 5, I noticed that the area that used to be the main ulcerating part of the keritosis had been completely eaten away and left a small divot maybe 1/4\\&quot; deep.  But there was no more broken, scraggly skin, no bleeding.    A couple days later there was no more change in the wound, so I decided it was enough.  I cleaned out the wound and it looked pretty clean, though still obviously unhealed.    I then switched over to using a hydrocolloid bandage and left that on for about 5 days.  After the five days, I took it off, and it had basically healed over completely.  Smooth, even skin.  Granted the skin is a little waxy and still red so it may end up leaving a scar.  But as many others have also noted, a scar is far better than an open wound, constantly bleeding and ruining my clothes.    I will have to see in a month or two how the skin heals up, but even if it stays like it is now I am satisfied and glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Found this product on Dr. OZ show. Had 3 dark spots on the tip of my nose.  After 7 days of treatment, 3 applications per day, my nose has no spots and actually looks like younger skin.  I am so pleased with the results and would recommend to anyone.  Thank you.  Ric Blackburn</li>
