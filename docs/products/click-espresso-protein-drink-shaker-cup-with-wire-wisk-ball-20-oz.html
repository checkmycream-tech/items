            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I own 7 of them in varying sizes and have been thoroughly pleased with each.</li>
            <li>I love this drink.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s dishwasher safe</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>It gets all the lumps out and makes my drink smooth!</li>
            <li>It is one of the strongest bottles I have come across and isn&#x27;t as big as most bottles -- perfect for mixing Click Decaf.</li>
            <li>I have used many types of protein drink shaker cups</li>
            <li>and this works better than all the others.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love my click shaker ball cup.</li>
            <li>This was an impulse buy, but I am glad that I did get it.  </li>
            <li>It works ok, doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>The measurements on the side show up to 12 oz (and that still leaves plenty of space for the mix on top of the 12 oz mark).</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite protein shake bottles.</li>
            <li>It mixes well and easy to drink from...</li>
            <li>I also love how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li>makes it easy to take and use your protein drinks on the go.</li>
            <li>Easy to take your shake with you.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty well made, is nice to look at..</li>
            <li>Easy to use, Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I also use it for Carnation Instant Breakfast drinks and the whisk ball is a great help.</li>
            <li>I went to order a similar cup on Amazon, and none of those type had great reviews.</li>
            <li>if I had to, they are cheap and compact.</li>
            <li>It does not leak AT ALL and everything gets super blended.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>It comes with a metal whisk-type ball in it - easy to remove to wash - it mixes whatever you put in it very well.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right size for me.</li>
            <li>I wish the cup were a little bigger, but otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>The lid closes tightly and doesn&#x27;t leak at all, and the shaker ball works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>Tried so many bottles, this is the only one that I&#x27;m using now.</li>
            <li>Most of the issue is because they&#x27;re all so dang big.</li>
            <li>The shape of the container doesn&#x27;t really fit in most car cup holders; and is a little bulky.</li>
            <li>The shaker cup was exactly what I expected - it blended my protein shake well and was easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>so putting 9oz water or more will probably lead to minor leakage, in my case it did.&lt;br /&gt;Anything</li>
            <li>My husband used to have one of those large cups with the motorized lid to mix his protein shakes</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t find any huge lumps left over in the bottle after I drink it, and there is no horrible odor after use, especially if you clean it regularly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much more effective the wire ball makes mixing up a powder drink, other than maybe a some fewer shakes, but one thing is for sure, it has to be cleaned properly.</li>
            <li>it works very well with all the powders I have used it with</li>
            <li>the wire wisk mixes really well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It mixes very well.</li>
            <li>The shaker makes it much easier to stick to my regimen.  </li>
            <li>Anyways straight to point:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love the little whisk ball.</li>
            <li>but I can live with it</li>
            <li>and it is a lot harder to clean, so</li>
            <li>Also, the lid screws on securely and the cover for the drink spout clicks firmly in to place</li>
            <li>Have purchased several cans so far.</li>
            <li>That little spring blender ball in there really works.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My only complaint and the reason I took away one star is that is does leak slightly when I shake it vigorously with hot water.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a smaller version to the other ones we bought for our son when we used it to mix his foods.</li>
            <li> I only use 8 oz of water and 2 shake scoops and don&#x27;t need a 20+ oz (or larger) bottle because it&#x27;s just a waste of space.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I was thinking.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to my friends and anyone that enjoys the Click Protein Drinks ot any other Proteind drinks.</li>
            <li> It mixes my protein drinks up quickly, no clumps.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to question if it&#x27;s on tight or not.</li>
            <li> A waste of money, except that the container might be used another way.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaker-cup for a few years now and it works.</li>
            <li> Sort of a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why that is.</li>
            <li> If you have owned a Blender bottle in the past, you already know what to expect from this item.</li>
            <li> It is small, but it mixes my protein shakes up without any of the nasty clumps I get when I use a non-Blender bottle product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the taste and gave me heartburn.  :-(</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the taste and gave me heartburn.  :-(</li>
            <li> Great product. Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent. The lid closes tightly and doesn&#x27;t leak at all, and the shaker ball works surprisingly well. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Loved the cup use it for juicing the ball is great for remixing juice during the day. Did not like the click powdered protein drinks at all not a fan of the drink but a fan of the shaker cup</li>
            <li> I needed it to help disable a powder in a liquid while traveling (in lieu of a blender).  I didn&#x27;t do it well at all.  A waste of money, except that the container might be used another way.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaker-cup for a few years now and it works. I&#x27;m not sure how much more effective the wire ball makes mixing up a powder drink, other than maybe a some fewer shakes, but one thing is for sure, it has to be cleaned properly. If the cup or the ball is not cleaned promptly or properly, it smells like rotting milk and it is a lot harder to clean, so I can only assume that bacteria has a field day with the surgical steel for some reason.</li>
            <li> I love this drink.  It tastes so good and helps keep the metabolism running.  Have purchased several cans so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to mix and go. it works very well with all the powders I have used it with and it&#x27;s a smaller version to the other ones we bought for our son when we used it to mix his foods.</li>
            <li> great size &amp; the wire wisk mixes really well.  the top seals perfect so there are no leaks and it&#x27;s dishwasher safe</li>
            <li> Great shaker, it works well to mix the Click protein drink! It mixes well and easy to drink from...I recommend!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t function without this morning beverage.</li>
            <li> I really really love it! It does not leak AT ALL and everything gets super blended. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Amazing to mix my click drink!!! Love it! It gets all the lumps out and makes my drink smooth! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect size and is a subscribe and save item! It is one of the strongest bottles I have come across and isn&#x27;t as big as most bottles -- perfect for mixing Click Decaf. Protein Coffee in!!!!</li>
            <li> Sort of a waste of money.  It doesn&#x27;t blend any differently than using a spoon.  The shape of the container doesn&#x27;t really fit in most car cup holders; and is a little bulky.</li>
            <li> I love the little whisk ball. I have used many types of protein drink shaker cups and this works better than all the others. My only complaint and the reason I took away one star is that is does leak slightly when I shake it vigorously with hot water. Not sure why that is. If I wrap a paper towel around when shaking it absorbs any liquid that escapes. I also love how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love my click shaker ball cup. it thoroughly shakes the product up. no lumps or bumps. love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> The shaker cup was exactly what I expected - it blended my protein shake well and was easy to clean.  I appreciate the volume markings on the side.</li>
            <li> If you have owned a Blender bottle in the past, you already know what to expect from this item. It is small, but it mixes my protein shakes up without any of the nasty clumps I get when I use a non-Blender bottle product. I own 7 of them in varying sizes and have been thoroughly pleased with each.</li>
            <li> I use this for carrying milk juice etc with me for breakfast at work.  I can put it in my purse lunch box etc and don&#x27;t have to worry about it spilling or the container opening.  I also use it for Carnation Instant Breakfast drinks and the whisk ball is a great help.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, Easy to clean. Great on the go.&lt;br /&gt;It makes it easy to take and use your protein drinks on the go.</li>
            <li> Tried so many bottles, this is the only one that I&#x27;m using now. The steel ball does cause some lumps when making protein drink but I can live with it</li>
            <li> Shaker worked well. Samll and compack, teaviles well. The ball helps brake up protein power well. All in all a good buy.</li>
            <li> It mixes very well. Would recommend this to my friends and anyone that enjoys the Click Protein Drinks ot any other Proteind drinks.</li>
            <li> The shaker makes it much easier to stick to my regimen.  It mixes my protein drinks up quickly, no clumps.  I keep one at the office and one at home for convenience.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This Shaker cup makes whipping up a protein shake a breeze.  I like a scoop of BSN Strawberry Protein powder, water/gatorade and a splash of vanilla almond milk.  Tastes tropical.  yumm</li>
            <li> this is great if you are always on the go like me.  does not spill!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful. I&#x27;ve had several mixing cups. This one is awesome.</li>
            <li> My husband used to have one of those large cups with the motorized lid to mix his protein shakes but it broke. I went to order a similar cup on Amazon, and none of those type had great reviews. I ended up ordering this cup instead because of the good reviews and it works well for him. I wish the cup were a little bigger, but otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This was an impulse buy, but I am glad that I did get it.  It comes with a metal whisk-type ball in it - easy to remove to wash - it mixes whatever you put in it very well.  Buy it.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I had had this shaker for a couple of years now - it continues to be great.  It is still leak proof and the wire whisk still mixes the protein drinks well.  It performs just as it did the day I bought it.  It is just the right size for me.</li>
            <li> It works ok, doesn&#x27;t leak. A little smaller than I was thinking.</li>
            <li> This shaker cup is the perfect size for me.  Great quality and good to go!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am satisfied!!  I would recommend</li>
            <li> This product is pretty well made, is nice to look at.. Anyways straight to point:&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty small as you can see so putting 9oz water or more will probably lead to minor leakage, in my case it did.&lt;br /&gt;Anything under 9oz is generally perfect, mixes great with the wire wisk ball.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find any huge lumps left over in the bottle after I drink it, and there is no horrible odor after use, especially if you clean it regularly. I would only wish this bottle to be a bit larger so I wouldn&#x27;t have any problems with leakage after rigorous shaking.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would buy another one of these if I had to, they are cheap and compact.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Dies not make me jittery and is an excellent meal replacement</li>
            <li> Works great with my Click protein powder. That little spring blender ball in there really works. No clumps. Easy to take your shake with you. I leave one at work. i actually have 3 of these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues finding a shaker bottle for my protein shakes. Most of the issue is because they&#x27;re all so dang big. I only use 8 oz of water and 2 shake scoops and don&#x27;t need a 20+ oz (or larger) bottle because it&#x27;s just a waste of space. I found these bottles and they&#x27;re great. The measurements on the side show up to 12 oz (and that still leaves plenty of space for the mix on top of the 12 oz mark). The shaker ball that mixes the protein shake mix is great and mixes it very smoothly, better than anything else (non-mechanical) that I&#x27;ve tried to date. Also, the lid screws on securely and the cover for the drink spout clicks firmly in to place so you don&#x27;t have to question if it&#x27;s on tight or not.This is now my favorite protein shake bottles.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Click Protein shake and the shaker cup makes it alal complete.&lt;br /&gt;Very durable cup!</li>
