            <li>This is the best.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely fashion, very happy, I was waiting for them,as I needed them to apply medication.</li>
            <li>and they work great!</li>
            <li>These work great for my mother, who is suffering from dementia and can&#x27;t brush for herself.</li>
            <li>These are great.  </li>
            <li>Great product shipping redicilous</li>
            <li>this was great for wetting my mouth.</li>
            <li>Great product - great price; will order again IF ever need them - received so many at great price it will be awhile.</li>
            <li>Good product for person who has problems holding objects.  </li>
            <li>Used for nursing care but also handy for crafts.</li>
            <li>I am sure these swabs have many uses, for people with mouth or teeth surgeries or sensitivities.  </li>
            <li>Suggestion- watch to make sure person does not try to bite the swabs.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>We have found many uses for this Toothett Oral Care Swabs.  </li>
            <li>My husband lost his saliva as a result of radiation for cancer more than a decade ago.  </li>
            <li>Great for elderly people and others with very sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>Bought these for my mother who is bedridden with advanced alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</li>
            <li>This is a critically important feature.</li>
            <li>these helped keep his mouth clean and moist.</li>
            <li>I use for clean teeth my cats</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;Toothette&amp;#34; brand in particular is probably as good as you can find as far as quality goes for this type of product.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and pictured!</li>
            <li>Product was as advertised and provides the function of more completely applying the rinse to teeth and gums..</li>
            <li>I can get in a good 5 tooth brushings per swab before I throw it out and open a new one.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed - thank you</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy enough to get a good scrub on his teeth and clean them well, yet they are soft enough to not give him the prickly feeling of a toothbrush and cause him to try to run for the hills.  </li>
            <li>High quality products!</li>
            <li>They helped heal severe mouth sores as a result of intense chemo therapy.</li>
            <li>Thanks for stocking these.</li>
            <li>Sticks are nice and long, works well, not individual wraps, and also pricey for samples, on time</li>
            <li>These Toothettes are soft and gentle in the mouth....</li>
            <li>Got this to help brush the cats teeth as the normal brush that came with their toothpaste was too abrasive and would hurt their gums.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same brand the hospital use.</li>
            <li>and I have never been able to find a small toothbrush that was soft enough to not bother him or cause him discomfort when I brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li>Just run a little warm water and then gently scrub your teeth and mouth for at least one minute.</li>
            <li>Good product but be careful as the sponge tip has a tenancy to come off and could possibly choke someone who is unable to swallow.</li>

            <li> Wrong; they are cheaply made and overpriced; won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other similar products on the market.  </li>
            <li> I have a small dog who is 6 years old</li>
            <li> That leaves the green lollipops as the ONLY way he can keep his mouth moist.  </li>
            <li> So minus 1 star.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed a little because 5 of the 20 swabs had half of the scrubbing top missing or cut off at the factory.</li>
            <li> Subsequent surgery has left him unable to swallow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the little pink sponges until they are no more.</li>
            <li> Thank God for these toothettes, which we call green lollipops.  </li>
            <li> I bought a different brand from Kroger pharmacy one time &amp; he was mad.  </li>
            <li> Works well, still gotta handle them with a bit of muscle, but the brushes are gentler on their gums and have been helping to get rid of bad kitty breath.</li>
            <li> Exellent  for sick people to moisture their mouth.</li>
            <li> Everything else stung and hurt terribly.</li>

            <li> This was our 2nd order of these, My husband was having problems swallowing water and these helped keep his mouth clean and moist. They are the same as the hospital uses. Exactly as described and pictured!</li>
            <li> Got this to help brush the cats teeth as the normal brush that came with their toothpaste was too abrasive and would hurt their gums. Works well, still gotta handle them with a bit of muscle, but the brushes are gentler on their gums and have been helping to get rid of bad kitty breath.</li>
            <li> These were just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Good product but be careful as the sponge tip has a tenancy to come off and could possibly choke someone who is unable to swallow.</li>
            <li> These work great for my mother, who is suffering from dementia and can&#x27;t brush for herself.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed - thank you</li>
            <li> High quality products! Exactly the same brand the hospital use.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Have tons of uses.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I was looking for. I will definitely be ordering again soon. I will recommend to friends</li>
            <li> I use for clean teeth my cats</li>
            <li> I have a small dog who is 6 years old and I have never been able to find a small toothbrush that was soft enough to not bother him or cause him discomfort when I brush his teeth.  These oral care swabs have been a life saver. They are sturdy enough to get a good scrub on his teeth and clean them well, yet they are soft enough to not give him the prickly feeling of a toothbrush and cause him to try to run for the hills.  I can get in a good 5 tooth brushings per swab before I throw it out and open a new one.  I am sure these swabs have many uses, for people with mouth or teeth surgeries or sensitivities.  This &amp;#34;Toothette&amp;#34; brand in particular is probably as good as you can find as far as quality goes for this type of product.</li>

            <li> Good product for person who has problems holding objects.  Great for elderly people and others with very sensitive teeth.  Suggestion- watch to make sure person does not try to bite the swabs.</li>
            <li> I love these.  They are quite convenient for a lot of uses.</li>
            <li> Great product - great price; will order again IF ever need them - received so many at great price it will be awhile.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my mother who is bedridden with advanced alzheimer&#x27;s disease. They look like the type used in the hospital, so I chose them.  Wrong; they are cheaply made and overpriced; won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> I need this product for helping to cleanse my mouth and throat after tongue cancer surgery.  This is the best.</li>
            <li> We have found many uses for this Toothett Oral Care Swabs.  Used for nursing care but also handy for crafts.</li>
            <li> Sticks are nice and long, works well, not individual wraps, and also pricey for samples, on time</li>
            <li> Great product shipping redicilous</li>
            <li> Thank God for these toothettes, which we call green lollipops.  My husband lost his saliva as a result of radiation for cancer more than a decade ago.  Subsequent surgery has left him unable to swallow.  So he cannot drink water.  That leaves the green lollipops as the ONLY way he can keep his mouth moist.  We never leave our home without these in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other similar products on the market.  However, these have a plastic stem as opposed to a cardboard one.  So he can keep the lollipop in his mouth without the stem disintegrating.  This is a critically important feature.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> This is sealed but not individually sealed. I prefer individually sealed toothette. So minus 1 star. No problem with reseller.</li>
            <li> I bought these because my son had a Bone Marrow Transplant and can&#x27;t brush his teeth with a regular tooth brush.  His hospital used these and he likes doing mouth care with them!!!  I bought a different brand from Kroger pharmacy one time &amp; he was mad.  These Toothettes are soft and gentle in the mouth....I would recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> These tooth swabs saved me! They helped heal severe mouth sores as a result of intense chemo therapy. Just run a little warm water and then gently scrub your teeth and mouth for at least one minute. Everything else stung and hurt terribly. These are the way to go.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves these.  She has very sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, very happy, I was waiting for them,as I needed them to apply medication.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my uncle that is going through chemo and they work great! I knew this after my mother bought them for me after going though chemo myself and it had given me such pain in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Had pneumonia and could not swallow so this was great for wetting my mouth. Thanks for stocking these.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised and provides the function of more completely applying the rinse to teeth and gums..</li>
            <li> I was disappointed a little because 5 of the 20 swabs had half of the scrubbing top missing or cut off at the factory. But the intact ones work like advertized.</li>
            <li> They look sturdy but as yet I haven&#x27;t used them. I&#x27;m using the little pink sponges until they are no more. Then I shall use these.</li>
