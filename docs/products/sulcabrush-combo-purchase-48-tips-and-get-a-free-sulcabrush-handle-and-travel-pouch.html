            <li>This is a great product!</li>

            <li>I get great responses from my periodontal hygienist by using the Sulcabrush.</li>

            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>The difference was remarkable.  </li>
            <li>Great cost effective too.</li>
            <li>When used this 1.1% fluoride toothpaste these honies should keep you out of the dentist office for good.</li>
            <li>I get good reviews when I go for my semi-annual cleaning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found them!</li>
            <li>My wife is the one who finds Sulcabrush especially useful for her gum massage.  </li>
            <li>The dentist sent one home with my husband, and it looked like a good idea to keep gums healthy, so I ordered some myself.</li>
            <li>Sulcabrushes were recommended to me by a dental hygenist more than twenty years ago.</li>
            <li>I love the sulca brush because it gets in between.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>so now I can change them more often.</li>
            <li>I received the brushes in a timely manner and was quite pleased to have received a case in addition to the handle.  </li>
            <li>Have used for many years.</li>
            <li>Flossing is fine, but better plus Sulcabrushing.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find them now available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use them</li>
            <li>You can massage the gums with this so easily and, while it does not replace floss, the bristles get between teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to carry when traveling.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; easy to change the brush tips when they get worn.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth,especially the lower front, stain free.</li>
            <li>I bought 48, as they&#x27;ve been great for my oral health, but the quality has definitely deteriorated.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for probably 4 years &amp; order through the mail since it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in our drug stores.  </li>
            <li>My gums have really improved!!!  </li>
            <li>My orthodontist recommended this brush and it is very effective used along with my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Originally got a brush from my periodontist&#x27;s office, which received it as a promotional.  </li>
            <li>These are the replacement brushes for t he Sulcabrush which is use to clean plaque from the gum line of you teeth.</li>
            <li>The tips keep my gums and teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>My dentist gave me one and these replacement heads came quickly.  </li>
            <li>Have received great results since starting to use this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Always had a problem using floss, these brushes help very well.</li>
            <li>Because the brush is replaceable after its been used for a period of time,  it is economical to get the combo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a useful tool for anyone, a required tool for anyone with existing gingivitis or periodontal disease.</li>
            <li>That process works just right for me.</li>
            <li>I like them very much.</li>
            <li>The tips appear to be identical; the one for \\&quot;inside\\&quot; wears significantly quicker than the one for \\&quot;outside.\\&quot;  Rather than toss both tips together, you can economize by tossing the worn \\&quot;inside\\&quot; tip, transferring the \\&quot;outside\\&quot; tip to the \\&quot;inside\\&quot; hole of the brush, and putting a new tip in the \\&quot;outside\\&quot; hole.  </li>
            <li>actually, a bit more than I wanted.</li>
            <li>The brush works really well.  </li>
            <li>My husband has some teeth issues and the Sulcabrush works really well for him.</li>
            <li>It really gets the plaque.  </li>
            <li>She recommended using the Sulcabrush with mouthwash to deep clean both teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it myself.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and it is easier to buy refills this way than finding them at a drug store.</li>
            <li>So I kicked into high gear and started using the Sulcabrush after flossing and before brushing with my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sulcabrush for a year or two, and in the first ones I bought the bristles were hard, solid and densely packed, and each one lasted a long time - many months.</li>
            <li>And it feels like each of these definitely will not last as long as the older ones I had.</li>
            <li>In a package there is normally one brush longer than the other.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Sulcabrushes were recommended to me by a dental hygenist more than twenty years ago. They are very effective in maintaining gum and teeth health. It&#x27;s very hard to find them in USA drug or big box stores and I bought them via mail order from Canada. I was glad to find them now available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wonderful purchase for the 3 Sulcabrushes that I have.</li>
            <li> The brush works really well.  My wife is the one who finds Sulcabrush especially useful for her gum massage.  The product is long lasting. . Because the brush is replaceable after its been used for a period of time,  it is economical to get the combo package.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the sulca brush because it gets in between. I alternate products, peroxide and baking soda, tea oil toothpaste, cream of tartar and peroxide. Keeps my teeth,especially the lower front, stain free.</li>
            <li> Originally got a brush from my periodontist&#x27;s office, which received it as a promotional.  It&#x27;s the tool for the \\&quot;brush each tooth\\&quot; approach to dental hygiene.  At each periodontal cleaning I&#x27;ve had since starting to use this brush the hygienist has mentioned continued improvement in my condition.  The tips appear to be identical; the one for \\&quot;inside\\&quot; wears significantly quicker than the one for \\&quot;outside.\\&quot;  Rather than toss both tips together, you can economize by tossing the worn \\&quot;inside\\&quot; tip, transferring the \\&quot;outside\\&quot; tip to the \\&quot;inside\\&quot; hole of the brush, and putting a new tip in the \\&quot;outside\\&quot; hole.  It&#x27;s a useful tool for anyone, a required tool for anyone with existing gingivitis or periodontal disease.</li>
            <li> These sulcabrushes are a necessity for my dental care. Quite difficult to find in the drugstore to purchase..  Great cost effective too.</li>
            <li> I use my Sulcabrush daily, having refill brushes on hand are a must.  I couldn&#x27;t find refill brushes at any of the stores close to home and ordering them in bulk has been great.</li>
            <li> My husband has some teeth issues and the Sulcabrush works really well for him.</li>
            <li> I love this.  My dentist gave me one and these replacement heads came quickly.  I go through a set a week approximately so I recommend buying them in bulk.</li>
            <li> My dentist had me start using these while treating my gum issues.  The difference was remarkable.  It is so easy to use them I keep a set in the bathroom abu also in a little box in the living room and use it while watching movies on TV.</li>
            <li> These are great. The dentist sent one home with my husband, and it looked like a good idea to keep gums healthy, so I ordered some myself. I like them very much.</li>
            <li> These are the replacement brushes for t he Sulcabrush which is use to clean plaque from the gum line of you teeth. When used this 1.1% fluoride toothpaste these honies should keep you out of the dentist office for good.</li>
            <li> Extra tips so now I can change them more often.</li>
            <li> It really gets the plaque.  Use it every time I brush and floss my teeth.  Recommended by my dentist.  Highly recommend it myself.</li>
            <li> Have received great results since starting to use this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Always had a problem using floss, these brushes help very well.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes in a timely manner and was quite pleased to have received a case in addition to the handle.  I am sharing the brushes with my daughter.  They will last us for a long time.  There is however one thing I noticed.  In a package there is normally one brush longer than the other. They were designed,one brush was longer for inside and a  shorter brush for outside of the teeth. I could not tell a difference in the length of the brushes.  They both seem the same which was somewhat of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> My orthodontist recommended this brush and it is very effective used along with my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> actually, a bit more than I wanted.</li>
            <li> Having used Sulcabrushes for some time, I expected excellence and received it.  Customer service was also 5-star.  My periodontist and I highly recommend this product and it is easier to buy refills this way than finding them at a drug store.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to buy this for the rest of my life.  The tips keep my gums and teeth clean.  I get good reviews when I go for my semi-annual cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use the Sulcabrush for &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; after meals as a convenience!&lt;br /&gt;Changing the little brushes when needed - gets between teeth &amp; cleans gums that flossing cannot!</li>
            <li> Excellent periodontal tool. The</li>
            <li> Helps immensely to keep the tooth plaque in check.</li>
            <li> I get great responses from my periodontal hygienist by using the Sulcabrush. She recommended using the Sulcabrush with mouthwash to deep clean both teeth and gums. That process works just right for me.</li>
            <li> Since my periodontist started me using this product, my gum condition, irregular teeth cleaning and periodontist satisfaction with my teeth and gums are all vastly improved.</li>
            <li> My husband has gum disease due to diabetes. After laser gum surger, his surgeon told him to use this brush instead of flossing twice a day. What a difference it has made.  His gums are doing great.</li>
            <li> The Sulcabrush is a great addition to your dental care.  You can massage the gums with this so easily and, while it does not replace floss, the bristles get between teeth.  It&#x27;s difficult to find a Sulcabrush, never mind the replacement brushes.  It is easy to carry when traveling.  This purchase will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs..well made...Sulcabrush lasts two months, at least.  Flossing is fine, but better plus Sulcabrushing.  Have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sulcabrush for a year or two, and in the first ones I bought the bristles were hard, solid and densely packed, and each one lasted a long time - many months. The new ones I received are softer and less dense, as if there are fewer bristles on each one. And it feels like each of these definitely will not last as long as the older ones I had. It seems like the manufacturer is skimping on quality. I&#x27;ll still use them - I bought 48, as they&#x27;ve been great for my oral health, but the quality has definitely deteriorated.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for probably 4 years &amp; order through the mail since it doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in our drug stores.  Easy to use &amp; easy to change the brush tips when they get worn.  Very effective.</li>
            <li> Works great. Dentists suggested I use it. Can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been diligent about my teeth so when I was diagnosed with severe gum disease, I was totally shocked.  After two laser surgeries,  my gums still were in very bad shape.  So I kicked into high gear and started using the Sulcabrush after flossing and before brushing with my Sonicare.  My gums have really improved!!!  I will be using Sulcabrushes for the rest of my life!  I&#x27;m so glad I found them!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you like hearing from your dentist that your home care is great</li>
