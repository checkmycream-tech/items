            <li>Battery operations make ideal for home use.</li>
            <li>Still going strong after over a year of use!!!</li>
            <li>Still a great deal though.  </li>
            <li>I use on both my hair and beard, great cuts.  </li>
            <li>it is a good tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found that without the power cords, I am able to cut my own hair if I have too</li>
            <li>Although all the gadgets are not being used, the ones that are used most frequently (dailey) still work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>So I want to thank you first for your quick service and your excellent product.</li>
            <li>Better than I though it would be.  </li>
            <li>is ok for a really quick clean up but not for a good cut.</li>
            <li>For me, the saver works very well and does a good job</li>
            <li>this kit is excelent is complete and too good, and the shipping was excelent all the description is right, very clear and the quality is perfect</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to pack my excellent corded/heavy WAHL &amp;#34;baldfader&amp;#34; clipper (due to weight and voltage requirements)</li>
            <li>This has easily done 4 cuts to one set of batteries and is going strong.</li>
            <li>Trims neatly and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It also gets pretty warm after 10 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>It may have shipped with cheap batteries (can&#x27;t remember).  </li>
            <li>All the extras you get with it are fantastic too.</li>
            <li>relatively light weight and compact in size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this clipper only once so far, but am very happy with the experience...</li>
            <li>He has used it several times and is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Really, it was that easy.</li>
            <li>device is perfect - it accepts full-size WAHL combs, batteries last for a very long time</li>
            <li>I then replaced them with lithiums, mainly to make the unit lighter, and they are still going strong after a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and the hair cuts come out like professional cuts!</li>
            <li>Worked very well, if with her very first try on my head and beard.</li>
            <li>this is not the first time they send me</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t tell him this was the first time I&#x27;ve used these clippers...</li>
            <li>The device will not heat up during usage and the noise level is acceptable (although higher than the corded WAHL clippers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the addition of very sharp scissors - they came in handy for detailing.    </li>
            <li>Much better than the $94.03 Andis rechargable I owned previously, which quit holding a charge after the first year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At $31.34 (total), the price has gone up significantly from the $19.77 I paid in 2012.  </li>
            <li>So far, these are my first set of cordless clippers.</li>
            <li>I wanted a cordless clipper to give myself hair cuts (it&#x27;s easy when you&#x27;re in the military)</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this trimmer, it cut for maybe one second, but no longer.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this item.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend these clippers for use while traveling or at home.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for someone who is on the go and may not have access to an electrical outlet.</li>
            <li>The sissors are not sharp and the trimmer does not get close enough to give a clean skin, it leaves stubbles.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and now the head easily detaches if I press it too tightly against my body . . .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful enough, portable enough, and comes with all the accessories one would need at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The entire process took exactly seven days from ordering on my mobile phone to picking it up in the Walmart retail store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this clipper is powerful, dependable, and the battery charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Batteries have to be industrial strength as standard copper top do not seem to hold a charge long enough for this power hungry clipper.</li>
            <li>So far we like them, no problems.</li>
            <li>my near bold hair, I will need to curve the guide  little bit.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who need occasional use of electric clippers.</li>
            <li>Even if I remove the guide comb and run the bare blades across my head, it will not cut.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- somewhat affordable due to rare use on business trips only (6-7 times a year)&lt;br /&gt;- simple use, not too many unnecessary extra features&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>You can stop looking for a GREAT hair cutting kit, this is it!  </li>
            <li>quickly realized that market has only very few battery driven WAHL clippers that accept the full-size WAHL combs (sizes 1-8, 12,..).</li>

            <li> quickly realized that market has only very few battery driven WAHL clippers that accept the full-size WAHL combs (sizes 1-8, 12,..).</li>
            <li> Most Lithium-Ion and rechargeable WAHL clippers have smaller-sized combs (which will have a more difficult time cutting hair) and are smaller in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Batteries last a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> It cut through extremely thick and curly hair very well, without any pulling or snags.</li>
            <li> Everything seems reasonably sturdy, and the only, tiny, complaint is that the on/off button requires two hands - it&#x27;s hard to press.    </li>
            <li> WELL worth the small amount of money to purchase this!!!</li>
            <li> All of which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> The name is known but the product is not quite what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It does the job as posted, but the head doesn&#x27;t give u the flexibility to change degree of cuts other than the attached parts</li>
            <li> This item was purchased over a year ago and cost less than 25.00.  </li>
            <li> Previously purchased shaver and misplaced.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy and fits the hand.</li>
            <li> At less than $1 per piece, it&#x27;s hard to beat a deal like this.</li>
            <li> waste your time and money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of paying $10 for a haircut</li>
            <li> so unfortunately I have to purchase another.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Stopped working after one minute, I&#x27;m not kidding!! this is not the first time they send me this unusable crap!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!</li>
            <li> works perfect for me, now I can stand in the tub to buzz my head &amp; not worry about the hair getting everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this clipper only once so far, but am very happy with the experience... It cut through extremely thick and curly hair very well, without any pulling or snags. Ton of attachments, and I really appreciated the addition of very sharp scissors - they came in handy for detailing.    Everything seems reasonably sturdy, and the only, tiny, complaint is that the on/off button requires two hands - it&#x27;s hard to press.    My friend was very impressed with me and the haircut, and had got a lot of compliments since. I didn&#x27;t tell him this was the first time I&#x27;ve used these clippers... until *after* the haircut [teehee]. Really, it was that easy.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this trimmer, it cut for maybe one second, but no longer. It turns on and buzzes, but when I run it through my hair, it does not cut. Even if I remove the guide comb and run the bare blades across my head, it will not cut. I&#x27;ve had it only 3 days, but it&#x27;s going back the next chance I get.</li>
            <li> At $31.34 (total), the price has gone up significantly from the $19.77 I paid in 2012.  Still a great deal though.  Much better than the $94.03 Andis rechargable I owned previously, which quit holding a charge after the first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my Wahl about once a week.  It may have shipped with cheap batteries (can&#x27;t remember).  If so, I didn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t use them.  I used alkalines initially and got about a year out of them.  I then replaced them with lithiums, mainly to make the unit lighter, and they are still going strong after a year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item.  If mine ever gives up, I will replace it with the same thing.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cordless clipper to give myself hair cuts (it&#x27;s easy when you&#x27;re in the military) and this gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone about six haircuts before having to replace the batteries.  It&#x27;s powerful enough, portable enough, and comes with all the accessories one would need at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.</li>
            <li> At last convinced my wife to cut my hair. Worked very well, if with her very first try on my head and beard. Batteries have to be industrial strength as standard copper top do not seem to hold a charge long enough for this power hungry clipper. Otherwise I see no issues with it. All the extras you get with it are fantastic too.</li>
            <li> it is a good tool.&lt;br /&gt;to my near bold hair, I will need to curve the guide  little bit.  bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb</li>
            <li> Excellent set of clippers that will give a great cut!</li>
            <li> I constantly travel through the USA and Europe for business and these trips last up to 2 months. Didn&#x27;t want to pack my excellent corded/heavy WAHL &amp;#34;baldfader&amp;#34; clipper (due to weight and voltage requirements) so I decided to get a mobile/battery driven one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key criteria for me were:&lt;br /&gt;- battery driven (with regular house-hold battery cells)&lt;br /&gt;- accepts existing full-size WAHL combs&lt;br /&gt;- somewhat affordable due to rare use on business trips only (6-7 times a year)&lt;br /&gt;- simple use, not too many unnecessary extra features&lt;br /&gt;- relatively light weight and compact in size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly realized that market has only very few battery driven WAHL clippers that accept the full-size WAHL combs (sizes 1-8, 12,..). Most Lithium-Ion and rechargeable WAHL clippers have smaller-sized combs (which will have a more difficult time cutting hair) and are smaller in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I didn&#x27;t want to carry a charger with me (weight/hassle) all Lithium-Ion WAHL clippers were not a potential choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the WAHL Anywhere Clipper on www.wahl.com and bought this item on the Walmart mobile app and had it shipped to a local WALMART in Redlands, California. I couldn&#x27;t find this set anywhere in the retail stores. The price was around the 10 $US mark (excluding CA sales tax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device came in the boxed retail packaging and was paid with a gift card online (during the purchase). The entire process took exactly seven days from ordering on my mobile phone to picking it up in the Walmart retail store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is perfect - it accepts full-size WAHL combs, batteries last for a very long time (I have eneloop rechargeable batteries in mine and they have been working for 3 months now). The device will not heat up during usage and the noise level is acceptable (although higher than the corded WAHL clippers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these clippers for use while traveling or at home.</li>
            <li> I used already your product. So I want to thank you first for your quick service and your excellent product.</li>
            <li> Previously purchased shaver and misplaced.  Ordered a replacement.  For me, the saver works very well and does a good job</li>
            <li> These clippers have mowed through every inch of my head and body hair for over a year; but I dropped it once and now the head easily detaches if I press it too tightly against my body . . . well this happened once too often and I broke the plastic that attaches the clipper head to the clipper body . . . so unfortunately I have to purchase another. But this clipper is powerful, dependable, and the battery charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect home haircut kit!  My wife can trim my hair, and I can trim our son&#x27;s.  We can even do fancy things like layering and chipping in.  The kit comes with all the standard-sized clipper guides, and even a pair of hair scissors!  At less than $1 per piece, it&#x27;s hard to beat a deal like this.</li>
            <li> It does the job as posted, but the head doesn&#x27;t give u the flexibility to change degree of cuts other than the attached parts</li>
            <li> WELL worth the small amount of money to purchase this!!! Still going strong after over a year of use!!!</li>
            <li> The head is non-adjustable, the grip of the clippers themselves feels like a flashlight (not durable) and the attachments are flimsy plastic. It also gets pretty warm after 10 minutes or so. All of which is to be expected. I wish they supplied heavier duty attachments and an adjustable head. I&#x27;m tired of paying $10 for a haircut so these have paid for themselves already. If anyone has suggestions for a different product, let me know</li>
            <li> I use on both my hair and beard, great cuts.  Batteries last a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> You can stop looking for a GREAT hair cutting kit, this is it!  It is so easy to use and the hair cuts come out like professional cuts!</li>
            <li> My husband loves that it&#x27;s wireless but however we are going threw a lot of AA batteries.  So we did end up buying rechargeable batteries for this.  So I would recommend buying them when you purchase this!</li>
            <li> this kit is excelent is complete and too good, and the shipping was excelent all the description is right, very clear and the quality is perfect</li>
            <li> Superb set for non-professional work. Battery operations make ideal for home use. Highly recommended for those who need occasional use of electric clippers.</li>
            <li> YOU JUST CAN&#x27;T BEAT THIS FOR THE MONEY.  This item was purchased over a year ago and cost less than 25.00.  Although all the gadgets are not being used, the ones that are used most frequently (dailey) still work perfectly.  I highly recommend this for someone who is on the go and may not have access to an electrical outlet.</li>
            <li> The name is known but the product is not quite what I expected.  The sissors are not sharp and the trimmer does not get close enough to give a clean skin, it leaves stubbles.&lt;br /&gt;This is ok for a really quick clean up but not for a good cut.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I have found that without the power cords, I am able to cut my own hair if I have too</li>
            <li> I have very short hair and regularly shave it myself on a zero blade. This has easily done 4 cuts to one set of batteries and is going strong. I suspect I&#x27;ll get about 8 cuts off the one set of batteries.</li>
            <li> So far, these are my first set of cordless clippers. So far we like them, no problems. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is they take AA batteries, I would prefer built in one.</li>
            <li> Has the power to get job done.</li>
            <li> Better than I though it would be.  Trims neatly and is easy to use.  Not too heavy and fits the hand.</li>
            <li> My son needed a battery operated hair cutter and I found this one online and decided to give it a try. He has used it several times and is very satisfied with it.</li>
