            <li>Nice for hair!</li>
            <li>Looks good and seems good</li>
            <li>Leave on your hair for an hour and it leaves you with moisturized, thicker, healthier, shinier, and more beautiful hair.</li>

            <li>The real product is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, but it doesn&#x27;t make it better either.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>love these products will buy more</li>
            <li>my hair moisturized, I love this hydration.</li>
            <li>great stuff for my dry, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I am happy I didn&#x27;t waste $40 to figure this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had at first ordered the travel size just to try it out and see if it worked for my hair (the full size was too pricey of a commitment).  </li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Smooth and no tangles but not heavy or weighted after drying.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t fully follow the instructions of towel drying my hair first, leave this in for about 10 minutes, and rinsing off.  </li>
            <li>made my hair feel really smooth but for the price you can probably find a full size conditioner that can do the same.</li>
            <li>My hair became soft, silky, smooth.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be re-purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Makes hair looking soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry, curly and frizzy, but this did not help it to be any better.</li>
            <li>It leaves my processed, dry hair feeling like healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Also it does not do any intense hydration to your hair.</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been highlighting so much I was having problems with breaking, brittle, and unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much healthier now that I have used this.</li>
            <li>Real product would get a 5+.</li>
            <li>more thing: The picture shows the regular mask, but the actual product is the weightless mask for fine and dry hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask, it makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>price is high.</li>
            <li>I really did my research on this line and felt that a mask would be great for my chemically relaxed hair that has been a bit dry as of late.</li>
            <li>Great for thick curly dry hair and color treated.</li>
            <li>Makes hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Even though this was for medium to thick hair, it worked really well to add some moisture back to my very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing about this mask is that it is very fragant...</li>
            <li>If you are scent sensitive, this may not be for you.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Had extreme hair fall after using this. Also it does not do any intense hydration to your hair. My hair is dry, curly and frizzy, but this did not help it to be any better. Would not recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> really love this product! my hair dresser suggested using it once a week and I can really tell a difference. The &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; lasts me for a while.</li>
            <li> great stuff for my dry, curly hair.  love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. My hair was rcently ruined and with the help of this baby it is on it&#x27;s road to recovery!</li>
            <li> I really like this mask, it makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Very good for summer hair! Smooth and no tangles but not heavy or weighted after drying. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Even though this was for medium to thick hair, it worked really well to add some moisture back to my very fine hair.  I&#x27;ve been highlighting so much I was having problems with breaking, brittle, and unmanageable hair.  Using this once a week for a month was enough to add some life back to my hair.  I had at first ordered the travel size just to try it out and see if it worked for my hair (the full size was too pricey of a commitment).  I didn&#x27;t fully follow the instructions of towel drying my hair first, leave this in for about 10 minutes, and rinsing off.  I just squeezed the extra water out of my hair, and covered it with a shower cap after applying and did everything else I needed to do.  My hair is so much healthier now that I have used this. I will buy this again, and next time get the bigger size.</li>
            <li> It was as advertised and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference; even after using it for over 2 months. It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, but it doesn&#x27;t make it better either.</li>
            <li> Love the travel size in this product!  Always receive compliments on the great smell</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! my hair feels so nice and hydrated. Totally recommend just like any other Moroccan oil product. Worth the price</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It leaves my processed, dry hair feeling like healthy hair. Especially when I leave a little bit of product on the ends without washing out.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> made my hair feel really smooth but for the price you can probably find a full size conditioner that can do the same.</li>
            <li> Leave on your hair for an hour and it leaves you with moisturized, thicker, healthier, shinier, and more beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> love these products will buy more</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! I have been holding out purchasing this product because of the high cost (one you start an expensive habit it never goes away lol) but finding it at this price was definitely a deal I could not pass up. I really did my research on this line and felt that a mask would be great for my chemically relaxed hair that has been a bit dry as of late. This product did not disappoint. As soon as I applied this to my shower wet hair it began to transform. My hair became soft, silky, smooth. The only thing about this mask is that it is very fragant...so your hair will smell like the mask for a few days. If you are scent sensitive, this may not be for you. I will most definitely be re-purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: The picture shows the regular mask, but the actual product is the weightless mask for fine and dry hair. Still worked wonders on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> wonderful smell.  my hair moisturized, I love this hydration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far it seems to have helped my dried out, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Nice for hair! Makes hair looking soft and smooth. Expensive product!</li>
            <li> The real product is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. This isn&#x27;t the same. So I&#x27;m torn on what to rate it. So I went with 4. Real product would get a 5+.</li>
            <li> Looks good and seems good it was a little weird they used scotch tape to keep the lid down and not open while being shipped</li>
            <li> The best once a week hair treatment around. Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. Item was exactly as described and super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stuff is pretty expensive compared to what I currently use. Considering that hair type, heredity, diet, &amp; other products used all may change how well this works for the individual; I wanted to see if it was what I need. I prefer the the oil (different purchase, same brand) over this cream. I gave this 4 stars bc I am happy I didn&#x27;t waste $40 to figure this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, it is environmentally irresponsible of me to have this shipped so far for so little - I digress.</li>
            <li> Great for thick curly dry hair and color treated. Makes hair very soft. I use it and leave it in and then style my hair, since my hair can get so dry. Only complaint is this is a very small tube and price is high.</li>
            <li> reordered so it must work</li>
