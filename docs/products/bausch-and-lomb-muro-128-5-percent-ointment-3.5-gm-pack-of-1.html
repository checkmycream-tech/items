            <li>It was great as always.</li>
            <li>this  a really good product..</li>
            <li>I continue to use it whenever my eyes are irritated and am happy to have something that works that I can feel safe using every day.</li>
            <li>Fortunately my eye specialist assures me I can use it the rest of my life!!.  </li>
            <li>Then my chiropractor suggested this product, which he likes because it&#x27;s effective and safe (unlike the steroid eye products), and it worked.</li>
            <li>and this is most helpful to use at night before sleeping.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>This works out well for me to be able to order through Amazon and saves $$ in my pocket.  </li>
            <li>so there are so many thousands of people who don&#x27;t know about it.  </li>
            <li>The ointment is exactly what I ordered and priced well and made by a reputable company with a good expiration date.</li>
            <li>, I feel like I&#x27;m not as good at getting it really covered inside my eye</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Works great for night use for extremely dry eyes.</li>
            <li>If you have dry eyes or wear contacts this cream will make your eyes feel great at night.</li>
            <li>Prescribed by my doctor one drop on my right eye and it helps a lot with my vision to reduce corneal dryness and it also has a soothing effect.</li>
            <li>it really helps my eyes!</li>
            <li>I tried many products recommend by several doctors and it wasn&#x27;t until this product that I found relief</li>
            <li>Much happy &amp;#34;we&#x27;re on it&amp;#34; twaddle from the supplier but no action and my request for refund totally ignored.  </li>
            <li>You want to pull your eyelid down, apply a nice line of it inside on bottom of eyelid, then close your eye.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS VERY HELPFUL.</li>
            <li>This ointment doesn&#x27;t burn, is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>This is great for dry eyes although a little greasy when first applied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will cloud your vision completely if you do it right</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product I bought was delivered fast and had a very long expiry date which is rare when you buy from ebay...</li>
            <li>Too light, too short lasting.  </li>
            <li>Very hard to find in most pharmacies for a decent price.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s when the tube gets older and almost empty</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t suffer those few months first.</li>
            <li>Move your eye ball up down and around to really coat</li>

            <li> Excellent product it really helps my eyes! Very hard to find in most pharmacies for a decent price. I only use this brand ever since my eyes had problems.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  Works great for night use for extremely dry eyes.</li>
            <li> eye doc recommended for dry eyes. It gives some relief.</li>
            <li> This is great for dry eyes although a little greasy when first applied.</li>

            <li> Just what the doctor ordered.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately you failed to supply all items required. Time wasted going to payment only to find items couldn&#x27;t be send to Australia. Most annoying.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it to relieve eye pain and it works GREAT!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have found that helps with my dry eyes at night. I tried many products recommend by several doctors and it wasn&#x27;t until this product that I found relief</li>
            <li> I had a terrible problem with the edges of my eyelids--red, irritated, cracked and oozing--that went on for months and months. I went to the ophthalmologist, a dermatologist, a regular doctor, all in vain. Nothing helped. Then my chiropractor suggested this product, which he likes because it&#x27;s effective and safe (unlike the steroid eye products), and it worked. I continue to use it whenever my eyes are irritated and am happy to have something that works that I can feel safe using every day.</li>
            <li> Needed it for post eye-surgery....about $12 cheaper online....prbly overrated....it hydrates the dry eye....cud prbly use a cheaper brand</li>
            <li> It was great as always.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE -- Ordered may 1 2014 and paid for but Muro 128 never receivedt.  Much happy &amp;#34;we&#x27;re on it&amp;#34; twaddle from the supplier but no action and my request for refund totally ignored.  Won&#x27;t make this mistake twice.</li>
            <li> The ointment is exactly what I ordered and priced well and made by a reputable company with a good expiration date.</li>
            <li> this  a really good product.. i had to get some  today at a local drug store  i wish i could have ordered it on here but i could not wait. i had to pay $25.00 for mine i woke up  this morning  my eyes watery and sore  and swollen i could not even close my eyes due to the severe  pain. that i had .so i used this  and now my eyes are less swollen and the pain  is gone away i suffer with extreeme dry eyes and this works wonders.for me........</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my doctor one drop on my right eye and it helps a lot with my vision to reduce corneal dryness and it also has a soothing effect.</li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes or wear contacts this cream will make your eyes feel great at night. I have been using this product for 5 years</li>
            <li> MY DOCTOR RECOMMENED AND IT IS VERY HELPFUL. I HAVE CORNEAL EROSION</li>
            <li> I have a medical condition for my left eye , I have been using this product for few years now...I love it..&lt;br /&gt;The product I bought was delivered fast and had a very long expiry date which is rare when you buy from ebay...</li>
            <li> This product literally saved my life. I would wake up in the middle of the night with a sudden tear in my cornea and be in the worst pain imaginable.  My vision would blur and one bedtime I couldn&#x27;t open my eye for three days. I went to the dr and was diagnosed with basement epithelial membrane dystrophy. After the guy gave me some refresh drops or something as equally weak, it kept happening. Whenit became every night, I went back and was considering surgery because I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily saw a different doctor and she mentioned muro 128. I bought it that day and have faithfully used it every day since. Ive only had corneal abrasions a few times since staying this 8 onths ago. And that&#x27;s when the tube gets older and almost empty, I feel like I&#x27;m not as good at getting it really covered inside my eye some try not to get that low anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will cloud your vision completely if you do it right so use it only at night. The day time drops I tried a few times but it burned a lot so I stopped. This ointment doesn&#x27;t burn, is very soothing.  You want to pull your eyelid down, apply a nice line of it inside on bottom of eyelid, then close your eye. Let it sit a bit. Move your eye ball up down and around to really coat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from corneal abrasions this could save you too! I only wish I had found it earlier so I didn&#x27;t suffer those few months first.</li>
            <li> This works out well for me to be able to order through Amazon and saves $$ in my pocket.  When it came it was so cold but warmed up to room temperature.</li>
            <li> Expensive but is very soothing for my dry eyes at night time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every single night for 10 years.  I have chronic dry eye because of a cornea dystrophy and this problem will never go away.  Thank god I found Muro 128 ointment.  I use it every night without fail.  I keep one in my purse, at home, at our vacation cabin anywhere I might get stranded away from home.  Just the thought of being with it panics me.  Fortunately my eye specialist assures me I can use it the rest of my life!!.  Too bad more eye professionals don&#x27;t know about it so there are so many thousands of people who don&#x27;t know about it.  The solution is worthless.  Too light, too short lasting.  Its a joke.  I use the ointment every night and need nothing during the day.</li>
            <li> Been using these drops for years, and they help the dryness in my eyes,  Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mom mom</li>
            <li> product works for the purpose of dry eyes at night, although I think that the product from the manufacturer is a bit pricey. Prefer to buy it from Amazon,</li>
