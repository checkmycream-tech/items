            <li>AM ALL ABOUT THE &amp;#34;TOTAL PACKAGE&amp;#34; WHEN MAKING A PURCHASE FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL!  </li>
            <li>Got these brushes in yesterday and once i opened the chemical smell was really strong but doesnt affect the brushes .</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and I would definitely recommended to other make-up artists or beginner looking for quality brushes at a great price.</li>
            <li>but they are fine after washing them.</li>
            <li>THE PROCESS OF UNWRAPPING REVEALS A FABULOUS COLLECTION.  </li>
            <li>The case fits comfortably in any carry-on and even my hand bag with no problem.  </li>
            <li>The fan brush was soft and good for applying highlight color to my cheekbones and the lip brush worked well too.</li>
            <li>, THIS IS A GIFT TO A SPECIAL FRIEND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE COLLECTION SPEAKS TO A QUALITY PRODUCT WITH A CLASSY LOOK AT AN AMAZING PRICE</li>
            <li>I also loved the fact that there was such a variety of brush shapes</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>THE RECIPIENT WILL FEEL PRETTY SPECIAL AT EVERY</li>
            <li>Love the fact that everything is complete with this set.  </li>
            <li>so It was well worth the $1.99.</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>While these are not brushes I reach for regularly, there were a couple that I liked.</li>
            <li>The angled blush brush is nice, as well as the larger blending brush, and both fan brushes.</li>
            <li>They did have a strong smell when I opened them but that went away as soon as they aired out.</li>
            <li>The brushes feel nice, they are soft and work well so far.</li>
            <li>They do smell a bit when first getting them</li>
            <li>Soft and full brushes.</li>
            <li>I got them on promotion earlier in the year to try them out because I received a promotion code, but the are definitely worth full price.</li>
            <li>Whole heartedly recommend.</li>
            <li>Better rhan what I expected.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other fan brush I have tried.</li>
            <li>, I BOUGHT,  A HIGH RATING</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend leaving the case out away from the brushes to air out because there is a strong smell due to the dye used on the brush case.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very soft, and they shed quite often.</li>
            <li>Powder brushes are SOOO soft!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend these to anyone interested in make up.</li>
            <li>so one would know what they are all meant for because there seem to be a couple near duplicates.</li>
            <li>The brushes are incredibly soft which i truly like there was sjme shedding of the hair</li>
            <li>Knowing the eyes are one of the sensitive areas of the body, there needs to be softer hairs on the makeup brush.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a typical inclusion.</li>
            <li>Only minor shedding after washing the first time.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush set when there was a quick sale a few months ago.</li>
            <li>Very accessible case (not to big and clumsy), brush texture</li>
            <li>I washed them as soon I received them and no visable shedding or major issue.</li>
            <li>The brushes overall are not bad, but they do shed a little while washing.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>No lines from the foundation brush and the powder brush blends seamless for an air brushed look.</li>
            <li>Am not a fan of the blush brush its not dense enough, its soft but would require several applications to get a definded cheek color.</li>
            <li>They are very light, so its a lil weird cause</li>

            <li> (Some hairs did fall out, but I think that is to be expected.)  </li>
            <li> My only issue was that a few of the brushes did tend to shed.</li>
            <li> I hair on the brushes are too rough!</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this set, as I love a few of the brushes, and I hate a few others.</li>
            <li> However, the eye brow brush, powder brush, and foundation brush are very poor quality.</li>
            <li> so that wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> A couple of them shed awfully and have yet to stop.</li>

            <li> Powder brushes are SOOO soft!  (Some hairs did fall out, but I think that is to be expected.)  A brush for every occasion.  Whole heartedly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love my brush set! Very accessible case (not to big and clumsy), brush texture very nice! My only concern is that brushes aren&#x27;t labeled and for a newbie to makeup like me just learning about the uses for different types of brush, its a little time consuming trying to figure out their uses! But with more practice I will be a pro! I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>

            <li> Love the fact that everything is complete with this set.  I no longer have to purchase everything individually, this set saved me a lot of money.  The brushes hold the powder make-up well when applying.  The case fits comfortably in any carry-on and even my hand bag with no problem.  I would def purchase this as a gift for friends. thank again for the Set, I love it</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes are of pretty good quality. A couple of them shed awfully and have yet to stop. I wish they would have come with labels so one would know what they are all meant for because there seem to be a couple near duplicates. They did have a strong smell when I opened them but that went away as soon as they aired out. The Brush roll is pretty nice and it all came in a nice velvet bag. I got it during the sale so It was well worth the $1.99. I wouldn&#x27;t pay as much as they are priced because I feel there are better options for a good price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice! The quality is excellent, especially for the price. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because the bag has a slight chemical smell. The brushes do not have the smell.</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes! They came in a very nice brush roll that is handy for travel and storage and I love that it even had a travel pouch as well.  The brushes were super soft and seemed to be of very good quality. My only issue was that a few of the brushes did tend to shed. My favorite brush was the fan brush. It works better than any other fan brush I have tried. I also loved the fact that there was such a variety of brush shapes/sizes to choose from and that they were each individually wrapped and protected.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the makeup brush! Good quality, fast delivery and exactly what I was looking for! Will recommend this product 100%</li>
            <li> These are really great brushes for the price point. They would make a nice starter kit for someone getting into makeup! While I don&#x27;t have use for some of the brushes, most of them are handy.</li>
            <li> I just received my make up brush set and it really is amazing. The brushes are so soft and I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Totally worth every penny. I absolutely love it.  It has every brush you could ever need. I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Got these brushes in yesterday and once i opened the chemical smell was really strong but doesnt affect the brushes . The brushes are incredibly soft which i truly like there was sjme shedding of the hair hopefully once i wash thia will go away overall i do recommend these :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are fairly ok, I love the selection, it also has a pretty good case for storage plus an additional bag. I&#x27;ve used these once. I washed them as soon I received them and no visable shedding or major issue. They are very light, so its a lil weird cause I do feel like I have to get use to realising that I do have something in my hands. Am not a fan of the blush brush its not dense enough, its soft but would require several applications to get a definded cheek color. Lovd the brushes tho.</li>
            <li> Lovely set of brushes. They do smell a bit when first getting them but they are fine after washing them. The brushes feel nice, they are soft and work well so far. The brush roll they come in is very handy for travelling, convenient and looks sleek. Only minor shedding after washing the first time. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> These are actually my favorite brush set, and I kind of horde makeup brushes. I got them on promotion earlier in the year to try them out because I received a promotion code, but the are definitely worth full price. The brushes feel sturdy in my hand and I haven&#x27;t had any brush hairs falling out. I love the roll up bag with magnetic closure. Very nice quality. Also, the fact that this set comes with a fan brush is great. That&#x27;s not a typical inclusion. I would give this set to my friends as gifts. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter in law who loves makeup, and she could not believe the quality of the brushes! I would recommend this product to anyone who uses makeup on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> I love how the make up brushes came as a set.  Problems I have with this product, the brushes fall out. I hair on the brushes are too rough! I would not recommend using around the eyes. Knowing the eyes are one of the sensitive areas of the body, there needs to be softer hairs on the makeup brush.</li>
            <li> While these are not brushes I reach for regularly, there were a couple that I liked. The fan brush was soft and good for applying highlight color to my cheekbones and the lip brush worked well too.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and would be a great gift for someone who is starting out to experiment with makeup. I recommend leaving the case out away from the brushes to air out because there is a strong smell due to the dye used on the brush case. The brushes overall are not bad, but they do shed a little while washing.</li>
            <li> Better rhan what I expected. Soft and full brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft but sheds a little bit, got them when they were $1.99 so that wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my daughter and she loves it! the brushes are very soft and she says the use of them is perfect. the look she gave herself using them was impressive, we&#x27;ll be back for more</li>
            <li> Sooo happy with my newbrush set, you jus got tolove it!! They feels and looks good, and the price was awsome</li>
            <li> I love this brush set! I use them on my clients and the application is beautiful!  No lines from the foundation brush and the powder brush blends seamless for an air brushed look.Excellent quality and I would definitely recommended to other make-up artists or beginner looking for quality brushes at a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set when there was a quick sale a few months ago. I have mixed feelings about this set, as I love a few of the brushes, and I hate a few others. The angled blush brush is nice, as well as the larger blending brush, and both fan brushes. However, the eye brow brush, powder brush, and foundation brush are very poor quality. They aren&#x27;t very soft, and they shed quite often. It is a good set for a beginner, who is dabbling in makeup, but not the best choice for someone who considers themselves a professional or connoisseur.</li>
            <li> I bought this brushes ser For My wife and She loved it! Im Glad she&#x27;s happy with it! Will recomend this product with out a doubt</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a great price. I will definitely recommend these to anyone interested in make up. Great to add to your collection</li>
