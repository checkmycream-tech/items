            <li>I&#x27;m a Duke Cannon fan, love the soaps!</li>
            <li>Nice scent..  </li>
            <li>Some of the proceeds go to vets, which is nice too.</li>
            <li>Would have liked it better without the milled pieces.</li>
            <li>The smell is unique - and WE love it on him!</li>
            <li>The oat flakes in the bar seem to be more for grip than exfoliate.</li>
            <li>My husband love this soap.  </li>
            <li>The scent faded after a week; I&#x27;m sure it still smells</li>
            <li>Rinses very clean.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend loves this soap it is a huge chunk that fits into his hands easily</li>
            <li>Lathers very well and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>The text on the packaging is hilarious - worth the price by itself.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, gets you clean.</li>
            <li>I saturate a washcloth with water and turn the soap around in it until it is full of lather and then scrub myself clean with it.</li>
            <li>Fair price for big bar of soap, did not get soggy...  </li>
            <li>The mild scent is perfect and the bricks are huge and last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are mildly scented.</li>
            <li>Very funny soap.</li>
            <li>The smells are very mild, and don&#x27;t smell like flowers, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>Another thing to add is in the event that some ninja or would-be assassin invades your home in order to silence your roar while your showering, you have a powerful weapon in your hands.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s massive size and striking scent will bring out the true man within you.</li>
            <li>the record (and this part is a response to the whiny guy who wrote that the &amp;#34;milled pieces for exfoliating are not consistant and some are very large and could draw blood.</li>
            <li>The milled pieces for exfoliating are not consistant and some are very large and could draw blood.</li>
            <li>huge bar of soap, probably the size of two or three normal ones.</li>
            <li>Found myself picking them out of the soap surface in order to use the soap&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just now finishing up my third brick of Duke Cannon soap since being gifted one at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The bars are big, and they last a while, which is good.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky or slimy film on your skin and should last for a good long time.</li>
            <li>When it arrived in it&#x27;s manila envelope I thought somebody had sent me a brick, as a warning, or just because I have a large collection of bricks.</li>
            <li>and I have fairly large hands.</li>
            <li>I really like these Duke Cannon soaps.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend appreciated this, since he is retired Army.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not anything more than what it says it is- a very large bar of plain soap.  </li>
            <li>I would love this stuff, except for the rather sharp steel cut grains, that are throughout the soap.  </li>
            <li>Big soap, gets you clean.</li>
            <li>It really kind of stinks more than anything, but maybe it&#x27;s just me.  </li>
            <li>High quality bar of soap.</li>
            <li>What you get is a burly chunk of high quality cleaning product.</li>
            <li>I was surprised the envelope could contain the weight of the bar&#x27;s pure testosterone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful.  </li>
            <li>They clean well and leave skin dry, non-greasy.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy using it with all of my other soaps and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Smells very much like Ivory soap to me and left my skin with that dragging feeling just like Ivory soap does.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t try wash myself directly with a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells you may not like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soapy and cleans well, but for the price, I think I&#x27;ll take 2x the amount of Dial or Irish Spring.</li>
            <li>The women you live with won&#x27;t use them, which is also a potential plus.  </li>
            <li>, I would prefer it without the grains, and it seems a little pricy, but I think its worth it.  </li>
            <li>Finally someone thought of making a guys soap that is big and masculine smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to have enough emollients in it to keep your skin good in the dry cold winters and still not make you oily.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell is unique - and WE love it on him!</li>
            <li> I really like these Duke Cannon soaps. They are mildly scented. They clean well and leave skin dry, non-greasy. I have dry skin and it hasn&#x27;t made it too dry. Used on the face, it seems to reduce wrinkles. They are big bars, so I cut them in half to last longer. The oat flakes in the bar seem to be more for grip than exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift.  Very funny soap.</li>
            <li> High quality bar of soap. Last about 5 weeks of use. And I&#x27;m back big dude. Lots of skin. Daily showers about 2 times a week multiple showers. Lathers very well and has a nice scent. Rinses very clean. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband love this soap.  It lasts for ever and smells great.  Finally someone thought of making a guys soap that is big and masculine smell.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever. The mild scent is perfect and the bricks are huge and last a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record (and this part is a response to the whiny guy who wrote that the &amp;#34;milled pieces for exfoliating are not consistant and some are very large and could draw blood. Found myself picking them out of the soap surface in order to use the soap&amp;#34;). I don&#x27;t try wash myself directly with a bar of soap. I&#x27;m a big guy who gets filthy dirty at work and would never manage to get clean like that. I saturate a washcloth with water and turn the soap around in it until it is full of lather and then scrub myself clean with it. All the perfumed girly soaps they sell in stores get mushy and disappear in no time like that. Seriously, I would go through the largest bars of the most common brands in a week or thereabouts of showers, but here it is nearing the end of May and I&#x27;m just now finishing up my third brick of Duke Cannon soap since being gifted one at Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best soap ever.</li>
            <li> Great price, product received was as described. No issues.</li>
            <li> Big soap, gets you clean.</li>
            <li> Not as big as a brick but I really enjoy using it with all of my other soaps and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Fair price for big bar of soap, did not get soggy...  Nice scent..  I only gave it a 3 because it, did not last every long for a big bar of soap...</li>
            <li> Works as described. Shipment went as planned</li>
            <li> Smell 5stars&lt;br /&gt;Size  5stars&lt;br /&gt;Chunks of rocks or oatmeal -9stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Duke Cannon fan, love the soaps!</li>
            <li> Duke Cannon products are not for the faint of heart or the small of ballsack. What you get is a burly chunk of high quality cleaning product. The only thing manlier would be throwing lye against your wet body. When it arrived in it&#x27;s manila envelope I thought somebody had sent me a brick, as a warning, or just because I have a large collection of bricks. I was surprised the envelope could contain the weight of the bar&#x27;s pure testosterone. I opened the package and out wafted a manly scent, reminiscent of the time my gramps single-handedly won the Korean war. Be careful if you drop this bar of soap, you might just break your foot. Another thing to add is in the event that some ninja or would-be assassin invades your home in order to silence your roar while your showering, you have a powerful weapon in your hands.</li>
            <li> If so, turn back now. This soap isn&#x27;t for the faint of heart, nor is it for people with small, womanly like hands. It&#x27;s massive size and striking scent will bring out the true man within you.</li>
            <li> The bar is a little unwieldy intact - I cut it in half and it works great.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Way too big to hold onto and I have fairly large hands. The milled pieces for exfoliating are not consistant and some are very large and could draw blood. Found myself picking them out of the soap surface in order to use the soap. On the Pro side, it lathers and rinses well. Doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky or slimy film on your skin and should last for a good long time. Would have liked it better without the milled pieces. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, gets you clean.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend appreciated this, since he is retired Army.  And he smells good, too.</li>
            <li> It really kind of stinks more than anything, but maybe it&#x27;s just me.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells you may not like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not anything more than what it says it is- a very large bar of plain soap.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful.  It&#x27;s very soapy and cleans well, but for the price, I think I&#x27;ll take 2x the amount of Dial or Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> The soap works well; incredible lathering capability. I smell like victory and it carried over to my work life as well. It helped me get the job done. Raise a glass to Duke Cannon!</li>
            <li> huge bar of soap, probably the size of two or three normal ones. smells good not girly at all....I would buy another one</li>
            <li> This is a review for Victory Flavored Duke Cannon Bar soap. It was green for about three days, but, has been turning blue. Doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with melting. The scent faded after a week; I&#x27;m sure it still smells but I can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> The text on the packaging is hilarious - worth the price by itself.</li>
            <li> I like the Productivity scent the best, but this one is very good also.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend loves this soap it is a huge chunk that fits into his hands easily and he likes the smell</li>
            <li> I would love this stuff, except for the rather sharp steel cut grains, that are throughout the soap.  The bars are big, and they last a while, which is good.  The women you live with won&#x27;t use them, which is also a potential plus.  The smells are very mild, and don&#x27;t smell like flowers, which I really like.  I really hate soaps with powerful smells, and started using Ivory, which is lousy in the winter months for drying out the skin.  This stuff seems to have enough emollients in it to keep your skin good in the dry cold winters and still not make you oily.  Really good stuff, I would prefer it without the grains, and it seems a little pricy, but I think its worth it.  Some of the proceeds go to vets, which is nice too.</li>
            <li> Good soap. Cleans well and has a good odor. I also like the scrubbing that the particulates in the soap generate on the skin. My only complaint is that given its size I was hoping it would last even longer. I also like that a portion of the proceeds is suppose to go to support US veterans, something I wish I could confirm.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the scent. Smells very much like Ivory soap to me and left my skin with that dragging feeling just like Ivory soap does.</li>
            <li> I like using this product as it&#x27;s simple and has a manly smell to it. The soap lasts a long time - hence the name &amp;#34;big @ss bar of soap.&amp;#34;</li>
