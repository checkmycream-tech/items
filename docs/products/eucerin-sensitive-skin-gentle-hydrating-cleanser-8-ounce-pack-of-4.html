            <li>It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live, so was thrilled to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>As a woman in her 70&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been using this Eucerin Cleanser for my dry skin (that comes with age) &amp; have found it to be perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>While using this cleaner along with their anti wrinkle cream and using a upward motion to apply both many of the fine line and wrinkles have disappeared from my face.  </li>
            <li>they taped the tops closed, but despite their best efforts there was some leakage.  </li>
            <li>Great , non-drying cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and i have been worry and almost giving up in finding a good one and Finally thanks to Amazons reviews</li>
            <li>I get it at my hospital pharmacy, and now it is easy to get online.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt dry out, no residue, perfect clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores any more, so I hope it continues to be available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, but it gives a good clean feeling without a residue.  </li>
            <li>It removes makeup, including eye makeup, just fine.</li>
            <li>This one is fine for everywhere else, just won&#x27;t use on my face.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>with it, quite comfortable after cleansing, recommendable after all</li>
            <li>Rinses easily, and has no bad scent to it.</li>
            <li>had high hopes for this after reading the excellent reviews here and entering it in Skin Deep&#x27;s Database.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>

            <li>Washes clean, and not greasy.</li>

            <li>fine the right one in the drug stores.</li>
            <li>Eucerin sensitive skin gentle hydrating face wash is the best I have found for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>actually, it&#x27;s a fairly high-quality product for facial cleaning, just that it is not so foam-rich as to my expectations.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that works for me and in fact seems to do my skin some good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve turned all my friends on to this product and they love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>My face now nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I love Eucerin brand so much.</li>
            <li>I jumped on beautypedia.com and found out that my beloved Cetaphil had actually changed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, it gave me before the due date and is just as it was in the pictures</li>
            <li>Not greasy, easily rinsed off, gentle.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with many allergy problems.  </li>
            <li>It meets all my qualifications- not expensive, no fragrance and removes makeup!</li>
            <li>Best facial soap for the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also frgance free which is important to me since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many expensive face washes -- some have done much more harm than good, including organic products.</li>
            <li>I love Eucerin&#x27;s sensitive skin anti-wrinkle cream (both the day one with sunscreen and the night one without), so I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>After trying several other name brand cleansers I found this to work the best.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of foam.</li>
            <li>Foams gently, fragrance fee, leaves a clean feeling without drying.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is dry and oily and it works great.</li>
            <li>I used it on my babies instead of the standard baby washes because it has no fragrance at all, which is VERY important to me as I am prone to fragrance-induced migraines.</li>
            <li>For the first time, I do not have redness in the morning after cleansing.</li>
            <li>Soft and fit for swnsitive skin.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried many different brands.</li>
            <li>You can spend a LOT more money and facial cleansers, but there&#x27;s no need.  </li>
            <li>I have searched for years to find a facial cleanser like this when the Lancome product I used to love was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>unlike many other brands, is a rich creme that does not end up fostering break-outs.</li>
            <li>First bought one bottle and afterwards ordered a set of four, which is also sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>It removes makeup (including mascara) and leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see this sensitive skin cleanser back on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea.</li>
            <li>Love it, and feel comfort for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t dry the face as most of the others.</li>
            <li>I started using this product a few years ago and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love this really gentle cleanser; it has no fragrance, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount comes out when you press down the top</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentile...</li>
            <li>This product is gentle to your skin since I did not have any break outs from the product.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li>This lathers up very well, feels very moist and non drying, does not aggravate my acne prone skin, and is unscented.  </li>
            <li>, I think I prefer a cleanser that does not lather up as much</li>
            <li>I like this product because it cleanses well and is very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>they really do everything they claim to do..</li>
            <li>I was using another gentle cleanser that didn&#x27;t remove all of my makeup (esp. mascara).  </li>
            <li>Bottle lasts much longer than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I also use this as a bodywash - it is so gentle.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>While being gentle, it cleans the face very well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li>I really appreciate this product and trust the eucerin name.</li>
            <li>Very trustworthy brand.</li>
            <li>Our whole family also use Eucerin cleansing relief bath gel.</li>
            <li>I have other Eucerin products and love them, but this one has a scent that I just don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>This seems to clean a little better, but still does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>This works fine for me so far, with no issues of itchy skin, and cleanses well enough.  </li>
            <li>There are no paid endorsements like on TV, in magazines,or on many other beauty websites!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping it will remain available online for a very long time.</li>
            <li>My skin feels better and with less breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product leaves yous skin soft, smooth, and younger looking almost immediately upon using it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it really highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
            <li>Hard to find in brick and mortar stores, I was thrilled to see this 4 pack.</li>
            <li>This has been a staple, gentle cleanser in my bathroom for nearly 20 years.</li>
            <li>It reach my expectaion and clear skin very well.</li>
            <li>Try this gentle cleanser -- you might be surprised.</li>
            <li>Yes, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and can react differently to various products, but as a man who shaves nearly every day, this cleanser is non-irritating and leaves just the slightest amount of moisture on the face - barely detectable, but effective.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the cleanser that is in the tube, but the dispenser bottle is convenient and I have no complaint about the product.</li>
            <li>If you live in the NY/NJ area you can get it at Harmon.</li>
            <li>my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It keeps my hands very soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive face skin, so when i went to order it on line and found other face products i order them and love them, i use them daily.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft, and this is one product I am not giving up!</li>
            <li>My only suggestion for someone that tends to wear a lot of make-up (I have to for work) is to soak a cotton ball in eye make-up remover and use it all over your face first before using the cleanser.</li>
            <li>dry, sensitive, allergy-prone skin will continue with Cetaphil&#x27;s Daily Facial Cleanser, until I find something better.</li>
            <li>And although I have sensitive facial skin, where this product really shines is that it doesn&#x27;t aggravate the eczema on my hands after I wash with it.</li>
            <li>the products i use are all eucerin, O10 anti-wrinkle sensitive skin lotion spf 15,  gentle hydrating cleanser and Q10 anti wrinkle skin cream, also the eucerin aquahor advance therapy for my eye lids and hands only at night</li>
            <li>Now that her face is clear, she still uses this all the time.</li>
            <li>I then searched everywhere for a replacement: a gentle, non-fragrant cleanser that actually cleans.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it, even my teenage boys.  </li>
            <li>Learned that their idea of sensitive skin and mine don&#x27;t match.  </li>
            <li>I like the line of eucerin products...works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the cleanser for me, by far.</li>
            <li>My husband is also using it; even he does not have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>i&#x60;m 65 years old and have friends that i have recommend them too.</li>
            <li>I like Eucerin products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do like Eucerin brand skin care products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li>I use it followed by Eucerin&#x27;s Q10 Sensitive Skin Creme &amp;</li>
            <li>it keeps my face &amp; neck soft &amp; moisturized for the day.  </li>
            <li>AND SO FAR IT IS</li>
            <li>so far no problem with that.</li>
            <li>I used the anti wrinkle cream and also lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li>- I am a religious follower of this website - it rates thousands of skincare &amp; makeup lines based on real life experience of reviewers and also based on scientific research of ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was down to my last bottle and had not been able to find it online the last time I looked.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I had been using Cetaphil for years because it was supposed to be gentle and for a long time it worked, but my skin started breaking out again</li>
            <li>Not much to say about the product except it cleanses thoroughly without drying the skin, which is exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this gentle product for a very long time; but it is not found anywhere around me</li>
            <li>I was struggling to find a gentle cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin but also one that would take off all of my makeup.</li>
            <li>I finally found that this is the one fits my facial skin very well.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I found which came close is Purpose, which was a decent but ultimately unsatisfactory substitute.</li>
            <li>All the Eucerin lotions are readily available, but it is hard to find the cleanser.</li>
            <li>Use it with a japanese natural sponge</li>
            <li>I discovered that it suds very well on wet fingers as I rub them vigorously together and then apply to my face.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin that tends to get a bit dry during the winter.</li>
            <li>I used this product on my face and it cleaned my face well and did not dry it out.</li>
            <li>Many &#x27;acne&#x27; creams only made everything worse.</li>
            <li>I have had such  trouble finding the right facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have never written a review for a product before, but I read other customer reviews extensively before purchasing something new online, so</li>

            <li> It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live, so was thrilled to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As a woman in her 70&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been using this Eucerin Cleanser for my dry skin (that comes with age) &amp; have found it to be perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> While using this cleaner along with their anti wrinkle cream and using a upward motion to apply both many of the fine line and wrinkles have disappeared from my face.  </li>
            <li> they taped the tops closed, but despite their best efforts there was some leakage.  </li>
            <li> Great , non-drying cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and i have been worry and almost giving up in finding a good one and Finally thanks to Amazons reviews</li>

            <li> Doesnt dry out, no residue, perfect clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores any more, so I hope it continues to be available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is gentle, but it gives a good clean feeling without a residue.  </li>
            <li> It removes makeup, including eye makeup, just fine.</li>
            <li> This one is fine for everywhere else, just won&#x27;t use on my face.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheap.</li>

            <li> fine the right one in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> Eucerin sensitive skin gentle hydrating face wash is the best I have found for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> actually, it&#x27;s a fairly high-quality product for facial cleaning, just that it is not so foam-rich as to my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that works for me and in fact seems to do my skin some good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve turned all my friends on to this product and they love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> My face now nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love Eucerin brand so much.</li>
            <li> I jumped on beautypedia.com and found out that my beloved Cetaphil had actually changed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it gave me before the due date and is just as it was in the pictures</li>
            <li> Not greasy, easily rinsed off, gentle.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with many allergy problems.  </li>
            <li> It meets all my qualifications- not expensive, no fragrance and removes makeup!</li>
            <li> Best facial soap for the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also frgance free which is important to me since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many expensive face washes -- some have done much more harm than good, including organic products.</li>
            <li> I love Eucerin&#x27;s sensitive skin anti-wrinkle cream (both the day one with sunscreen and the night one without), so I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> After trying several other name brand cleansers I found this to work the best.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of foam.</li>
            <li> Foams gently, fragrance fee, leaves a clean feeling without drying.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is dry and oily and it works great.</li>
            <li> I used it on my babies instead of the standard baby washes because it has no fragrance at all, which is VERY important to me as I am prone to fragrance-induced migraines.</li>
            <li> For the first time, I do not have redness in the morning after cleansing.</li>
            <li> Soft and fit for swnsitive skin.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried many different brands.</li>
            <li> You can spend a LOT more money and facial cleansers, but there&#x27;s no need.  </li>
            <li> I have searched for years to find a facial cleanser like this when the Lancome product I used to love was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> unlike many other brands, is a rich creme that does not end up fostering break-outs.</li>
            <li> First bought one bottle and afterwards ordered a set of four, which is also sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> It removes makeup (including mascara) and leaves my skin clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see this sensitive skin cleanser back on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea.</li>
            <li> Love it, and feel comfort for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t dry the face as most of the others.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few years ago and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love this really gentle cleanser; it has no fragrance, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and doesn&#x27;t dry me out.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount comes out when you press down the top</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentile...</li>
            <li> This product is gentle to your skin since I did not have any break outs from the product.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> This lathers up very well, feels very moist and non drying, does not aggravate my acne prone skin, and is unscented.  </li>
            <li> , I think I prefer a cleanser that does not lather up as much</li>
            <li> I like this product because it cleanses well and is very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> they really do everything they claim to do..</li>
            <li> I was using another gentle cleanser that didn&#x27;t remove all of my makeup (esp. mascara).  </li>
            <li> Bottle lasts much longer than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I also use this as a bodywash - it is so gentle.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> While being gentle, it cleans the face very well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li> I really appreciate this product and trust the eucerin name.</li>
            <li> Very trustworthy brand.</li>
            <li> Our whole family also use Eucerin cleansing relief bath gel.</li>
            <li> I have other Eucerin products and love them, but this one has a scent that I just don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced and I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This seems to clean a little better, but still does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> This works fine for me so far, with no issues of itchy skin, and cleanses well enough.  </li>
            <li> There are no paid endorsements like on TV, in magazines,or on many other beauty websites!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping it will remain available online for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My skin feels better and with less breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product leaves yous skin soft, smooth, and younger looking almost immediately upon using it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it really highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
            <li> Hard to find in brick and mortar stores, I was thrilled to see this 4 pack.</li>
            <li> This has been a staple, gentle cleanser in my bathroom for nearly 20 years.</li>
            <li> It reach my expectaion and clear skin very well.</li>
            <li> Try this gentle cleanser -- you might be surprised.</li>
            <li> Yes, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and can react differently to various products, but as a man who shaves nearly every day, this cleanser is non-irritating and leaves just the slightest amount of moisture on the face - barely detectable, but effective.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the cleanser that is in the tube, but the dispenser bottle is convenient and I have no complaint about the product.</li>
            <li> If you live in the NY/NJ area you can get it at Harmon.</li>
            <li> my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It keeps my hands very soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive face skin, so when i went to order it on line and found other face products i order them and love them, i use them daily.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft, and this is one product I am not giving up!</li>
            <li> My only suggestion for someone that tends to wear a lot of make-up (I have to for work) is to soak a cotton ball in eye make-up remover and use it all over your face first before using the cleanser.</li>
            <li> dry, sensitive, allergy-prone skin will continue with Cetaphil&#x27;s Daily Facial Cleanser, until I find something better.</li>
            <li> And although I have sensitive facial skin, where this product really shines is that it doesn&#x27;t aggravate the eczema on my hands after I wash with it.</li>
            <li> the products i use are all eucerin, O10 anti-wrinkle sensitive skin lotion spf 15,  gentle hydrating cleanser and Q10 anti wrinkle skin cream, also the eucerin aquahor advance therapy for my eye lids and hands only at night</li>
            <li> Now that her face is clear, she still uses this all the time.</li>
            <li> I then searched everywhere for a replacement: a gentle, non-fragrant cleanser that actually cleans.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it, even my teenage boys.  </li>
            <li> Learned that their idea of sensitive skin and mine don&#x27;t match.  </li>
            <li> I like the line of eucerin products...works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the cleanser for me, by far.</li>
            <li> My husband is also using it; even he does not have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> i&#x60;m 65 years old and have friends that i have recommend them too.</li>
            <li> I like Eucerin products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do like Eucerin brand skin care products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> I use it followed by Eucerin&#x27;s Q10 Sensitive Skin Creme &amp;</li>
            <li> it keeps my face &amp; neck soft &amp; moisturized for the day.  </li>
            <li> AND SO FAR IT IS</li>
            <li> so far no problem with that.</li>
            <li> I used the anti wrinkle cream and also lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive.</li>
            <li> - I am a religious follower of this website - it rates thousands of skincare &amp; makeup lines based on real life experience of reviewers and also based on scientific research of ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was down to my last bottle and had not been able to find it online the last time I looked.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I had been using Cetaphil for years because it was supposed to be gentle and for a long time it worked, but my skin started breaking out again</li>
            <li> Not much to say about the product except it cleanses thoroughly without drying the skin, which is exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gentle product for a very long time; but it is not found anywhere around me</li>
            <li> I was struggling to find a gentle cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin but also one that would take off all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> I finally found that this is the one fits my facial skin very well.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I found which came close is Purpose, which was a decent but ultimately unsatisfactory substitute.</li>
            <li> All the Eucerin lotions are readily available, but it is hard to find the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Use it with a japanese natural sponge</li>
            <li> I discovered that it suds very well on wet fingers as I rub them vigorously together and then apply to my face.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin that tends to get a bit dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face and it cleaned my face well and did not dry it out.</li>
            <li> Many &#x27;acne&#x27; creams only made everything worse.</li>
            <li> I have had such  trouble finding the right facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for a product before, but I read other customer reviews extensively before purchasing something new online, so</li>
            <li> It leaves a little bit of a silky feeling behind, but not so much as I don&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li> I have finally found something for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin gets red and irritated by all other cleansers, especially in the eye area.</li>
            <li> A little of this spreads a ling way and there is no waste.</li>
            <li> Tiny little bit makes enough lather for the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through countless other products that, although they worked fin for my face, made my hands break out.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is a bit high, but this is hard to find this in the drug store, and I have no idea why.  </li>
            <li> I have searched for a cleanser that would not break out my skin or dry it out.</li>
            <li> After 1 week of use, started having dry, scaly patches.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin  out.</li>
            <li> Its just that my face becomes dry after four days of using it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (oily in some spots, dry in others) that is prone to both breakouts and flaking.</li>
            <li> It does dry skin out but my face doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as after some other cleaners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive at all, but I have to be very careful about the products that I use so that the breakouts and/or dryness doesn&#x27;t get out of hand.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected on time...  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it in your eyes because it will burn.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few cleansers that actually removes makeup, including mascara, without making my skin feel dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes a non-foaming hydrating cleanser that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> but when I dry off my skin doesn&#x27;t feel at all tight.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I am overjoyed I can now find this Eucerin cleanser again on Amazon and echo the other reviewer who cannot imagine someone using this once and not being sold for life.</li>
            <li> So what do I do with the other 3 unused bottles of product?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing yet not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I avoid contact with my lips since the taste of this product is very bitter and that concerns me as I wouldn&#x27;t want to ingest the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s hard to find a facial cleanser that is a foaming type like this that isn&#x27;t drying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also extremely convenient that it comes in the pump bottle with a small footprint that takes up little counter space.  </li>
            <li> but I do not particularly enjoy smelling it, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this a few days try and was not happy with the dry,tight feeling it left my face feeling.</li>
            <li> Also, although I hate flowery, perfume-y scents, it does have a slight chemical-something non-scent that is not unpleasant</li>
            <li> For a little while, I was not able to find this -- I think they ceased production.</li>
            <li> I had used a lot of different cleansers, from expensive lines, they would get changed or discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why is so hard to find it in the stores...</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores now.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to work so hard to remove all the residual suds.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to get in the stores.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I bought a four pack and one of the cleansers was broken and messed up the packaging box.</li>
            <li> It cleanses and moisturizes without leaving behind that oily feeling, yet it helps moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I started using it and noticed my face clearing up and no more crazy spots within a week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the pump for 2 out of 4 of these does not work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found this drying and not at all &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this cleanser, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I decided to try something else from Burt&#x27;s Bees with disastrous results.  </li>
            <li> Also hate the smell.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best cleanser ever!As time as they&#x27;ll keep make it,I&#x27;ll buy it and you can&#x27;t beat the price also.I don&#x27;t know why is so hard to find it in the stores...</li>
            <li> Use it in the morning in the shower and at night.  Use it with a japanese natural sponge and my face seems happy.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face and it cleaned my face well and did not dry it out. I will continue to use this product, it did not STING my eyes like some CRAZIES have mentioned in their reviews.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser for sensitive skin. My skin gets red and irritated by all other cleansers, especially in the eye area. This cleanser gets all my makeup off &amp; does not leave any residue whatsoever. I also love that it is fragrance free! I can&#x27;t find this anywhere in stores but I definitely don&#x27;t mind ordering in bulk off Amazon. Great price too for the quality!</li>
            <li> great product, great brand</li>
            <li> my skin is very sensitive. Using Eucerin makes my skin feel very clean.. I love it</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser that I&#x27;ve ever found to remove makeup GENTLY without drying out my skin or leaving a residue.  It seems as though Eucerin discontinued it, so here I am stocking up.  Product arrived as expected on time...  they taped the tops closed, but despite their best efforts there was some leakage.  Nothing to write home about.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. Leaves my face feeling clean and soft.  It&#x27;s very gentile... don&#x27;t ever want to change!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Foams gently, fragrance fee, leaves a clean feeling without drying.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Eucerin sensitive skin gentle hydrating face wash is the best I have found for sensitive skin. For the first time, I do not have redness in the morning after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have searched for a cleanser that would not break out my skin or dry it out. This product to me , is better than any thing that i have ever used.</li>
            <li> For a little while, I was not able to find this -- I think they ceased production. I then searched everywhere for a replacement: a gentle, non-fragrant cleanser that actually cleans. The only thing I found which came close is Purpose, which was a decent but ultimately unsatisfactory substitute. I am overjoyed I can now find this Eucerin cleanser again on Amazon and echo the other reviewer who cannot imagine someone using this once and not being sold for life.</li>
            <li> Great product, does not itch, my family uses it regulary for hydrating face. It is a part of our daily cleansing routine</li>
            <li> Eucerin gentle cleanser is the best!  My whole family uses it, even my teenage boys.  I had used a lot of different cleansers, from expensive lines, they would get changed or discontinued.  I found this several years ago, and it is the best cleanser ever!  It is gentle, but it gives a good clean feeling without a residue.  Try it, you will love it!  It is hard to find in stores now.  I get it at my hospital pharmacy, and now it is easy to get online.  All the Eucerin lotions are readily available, but it is hard to find the cleanser.</li>
            <li> Excellent, non-drying cleanser for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love Eucerin face wash and bought a 4-pack.  Unfortunately the pump for 2 out of 4 of these does not work.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle to your skin since I did not have any break outs from the product. Although I wish the product had more Hydrating properties. This product did not hydrate my skin well enough I am thinking that is why they are not selling this product on store shelves with the rest of their line. I wish they would reconsider adding something to the product it to hydrate better I believe it would increase sales.</li>
            <li> This has been a staple, gentle cleanser in my bathroom for nearly 20 years. It removes all my makeup in one lather/rinse step and is also safe to use around my eyes. I used it on my babies instead of the standard baby washes because it has no fragrance at all, which is VERY important to me as I am prone to fragrance-induced migraines. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few years ago and absolutely love it! I was struggling to find a gentle cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin but also one that would take off all of my makeup. After trying several other name brand cleansers I found this to work the best. I have normal skin that tends to get a bit dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> Learned that their idea of sensitive skin and mine don&#x27;t match.  After 1 week of use, started having dry, scaly patches.  I have discontinued use and it cleared up.  So what do I do with the other 3 unused bottles of product?</li>
            <li> Great , non-drying cleanser for sensitive skin. And it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I like the line of eucerin products...works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great value and good product!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser - it&#x27;s also frgance free which is important to me since I have sensitive skin. Should cost about $6 a bottle. It foams up nicely and just removes everything in one swoop! I used to use an Olay cleanser which seemed comparable, but it was not removing all my makeup. This is the cleanser for me, by far. It meets all my qualifications- not expensive, no fragrance and removes makeup! If you live in the NY/NJ area you can get it at Harmon.</li>
            <li> It reach my expectaion and clear skin very well.</li>
            <li> I have skin that dries out very easily. Ive used all sorts of things over the years and thought Id try this out after my Aveno started bugging me. Ive used this for over a month now and its the best Ive ever used. Doesnt dry out, no residue, perfect clean. Highly reccomend!</li>
            <li> actually, it&#x27;s a fairly high-quality product for facial cleaning, just that it is not so foam-rich as to my expectations. with it, quite comfortable after cleansing, recommendable after all</li>
            <li> This lathers up very well, feels very moist and non drying, does not aggravate my acne prone skin, and is unscented.  That said, for use on a daily basis, I think I prefer a cleanser that does not lather up as much so I don&#x27;t have to work so hard to remove all the residual suds.  Also, although I hate flowery, perfume-y scents, it does have a slight chemical-something non-scent that is not unpleasant but I do not particularly enjoy smelling it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product that I would recommend and may buy again.</li>
            <li> I started using Eucerin products 25 years ago when my child&#x27;s pediatrician recommended it. They are all quality products that are consistently good for my skin and my children&#x27;s skin, and don&#x27;t cost a fortune. It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live, so was thrilled to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best facial soap for the dry winter months.  No greasy or oily residue, but definitely keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Good cleaning performance, can discharge makeup, moist degree</li>
            <li> I like this product because it cleanses well and is very inexpensive.  I use it every day.  Eucerin products are good and affordable.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and oily skin. My dermatologist recommended this product and I am sold! It cleans without drying and does not leave any kind of film on my face. It does not make my rosacea break out further like alot of cleansers did that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love this soap it&#x27;s a amazing!</li>
            <li> I have problem skin with acne and rosacea. I&#x27;ve tried many expensive face washes -- some have done much more harm than good, including organic products. This is the only soap I can use on my face.</li>
            <li> For someone with very sensitive skin, and allergies to ingredients, this cleanser is wonderful. It makes your skin so soft, and this is one product I am not giving up!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product and am thankful that there were so many customer reviews in favor of it.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few cleansers that actually removes makeup, including mascara, without making my skin feel dry and tight.  Hard to find in brick and mortar stores, I was thrilled to see this 4 pack.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with many allergy problems.  I finally found that this is the one fits my facial skin very well.  My husband is also using it; even he does not have sensitive skin like mine. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Soft and fit for swnsitive skin. Feel clean and comfortable. Good price.</li>
            <li> I did not like the scent of this product. I have other Eucerin products and love them, but this one has a scent that I just don&#x27;t like.  l won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Very very nice Gentle Clenser.. Tiny little bit makes enough lather for the face. love All EUCERIN products..they really do everything they claim to do.. The price is good for a good product!</li>
            <li> I was using another gentle cleanser that didn&#x27;t remove all of my makeup (esp. mascara).  This seems to clean a little better, but still does not dry out my skin.  It leaves a little bit of a silky feeling behind, but not so much as I don&#x27;t feel clean.  I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> I am elderly. I have dry skin.  I garden daily.  I have tried every soap there is.  This is the only one that works for me and in fact seems to do my skin some good.  I love all the Eucerin products.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be one of the best face cleansers for sensitive  skin on the market.  And I&#x27;ve tried many different brands.</li>
            <li> From the wife: Have been using this for about 6 months. It removes makeup, including eye makeup, just fine. Washes clean, and not greasy. Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin  out. Bottle lasts much longer than I thought it would. And although I have sensitive facial skin, where this product really shines is that it doesn&#x27;t aggravate the eczema on my hands after I wash with it. I&#x27;ve been through countless other products that, although they worked fin for my face, made my hands break out. Wonderful stuff!!</li>
            <li> i&#x60;ve been using this brand for a couple of years, recommend by my doctor, but couldn&#x60;t fine the right one in the drug stores. I have very sensitive face skin, so when i went to order it on line and found other face products i order them and love them, i use them daily. i&#x60;m 65 years old and have friends that i have recommend them too. the products i use are all eucerin, O10 anti-wrinkle sensitive skin lotion spf 15,  gentle hydrating cleanser and Q10 anti wrinkle skin cream, also the eucerin aquahor advance therapy for my eye lids and hands only at night</li>
            <li> Best facewash ever.  I was down to my last bottle and had not been able to find it online the last time I looked.  I decided to try something else from Burt&#x27;s Bees with disastrous results.  I decided to go back and see if there was anything else from Eucerin and here it was again!  I have been using their products for over 36 years.  I was thrilled to see this sensitive skin cleanser back on Amazon.  I also use this as a bodywash - it is so gentle.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, easily rinsed off, gentle. I like Eucerin products for sensitive skin. A little of this spreads a ling way and there is no waste. Good price for 4!</li>
            <li> Simply the best skin cleanser for super sensitive skin- doesn&#x27;t burn eyes either! I always keep extra bottles on hand.</li>
            <li> You can spend a LOT more money and facial cleansers, but there&#x27;s no need.  I have used hundreds of different facial cleansers and nothing compares to this product.  Yes, everyone&#x27;s skin is different and can react differently to various products, but as a man who shaves nearly every day, this cleanser is non-irritating and leaves just the slightest amount of moisture on the face - barely detectable, but effective.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser on the market today, bar none!  I don&#x27;t understand why so many people don&#x27;t know about this product.  I&#x27;ve turned all my friends on to this product and they love it as much as I do. My skin actually looks younger since I started using it.  Once you start to use this you will never not use it.  This product leaves yous skin soft, smooth, and younger looking almost immediately upon using it.  It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing yet not greasy.  Can you say magic in a bottle.  Amazon&#x27;s price is a bit high, but this is hard to find this in the drug store, and I have no idea why.  Just get it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves Eucerin.</li>
            <li> I prefer the cleanser that is in the tube, but the dispenser bottle is convenient and I have no complaint about the product. I do like Eucerin brand skin care products for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for almost 10 years now and I have yet to find anything better for the price!  It removes makeup (including mascara) and leaves my skin clean and soft.  I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser does not irritate it.  My husband uses this product to shave his face in the shower and he loves it too.  One of my all time favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face lotion for a couple years now and love it! I have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. I also love the SPF in it! Would definitely recommend it. Also purchasing it on Amazon in the pack of 4 is definitely a bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found this drying and not at all &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34;.  Must be the sodium laureth sulfate (foaming agent).  Neutrogena makes a non-foaming hydrating cleanser that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as dry and tight.  This one is fine for everywhere else, just won&#x27;t use on my face.</li>
            <li> Do you find your eyes burn during the day? Maybe it&#x27;s the soap -- especially \\&quot;anti\\&quot; soaps . Try this gentle cleanser -- you might be surprised. While being gentle, it cleans the face very well. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have searched for years to find a facial cleanser like this when the Lancome product I used to love was discontinued.  I like that it foams and cleans thoroughly but when I dry off my skin doesn&#x27;t feel at all tight.  I have very dry sensitive skin and this is great.  For me it&#x27;s hard to find a facial cleanser that is a foaming type like this that isn&#x27;t drying.  And I&#x27;m not a big fan of how it feels to wash my face with non-foaming cream-type cleansers. It&#x27;s also extremely convenient that it comes in the pump bottle with a small footprint that takes up little counter space.  I&#x27;d recommend it really highly.</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work that well, the product is runny. Don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li> As a woman in her 70&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been using this Eucerin Cleanser for my dry skin (that comes with age) &amp; have found it to be perfect for me.  I use it followed by Eucerin&#x27;s Q10 Sensitive Skin Creme &amp; it keeps my face &amp; neck soft &amp; moisturized for the day.  I&#x27;ve found this brand is a winner &amp; unlike many other brands, is a rich creme that does not end up fostering break-outs.</li>
            <li> I gave this a few days try and was not happy with the dry,tight feeling it left my face feeling. In addition to the lack of moisture, the smell is quite chemical-y.&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this after reading the excellent reviews here and entering it in Skin Deep&#x27;s Database.&lt;br /&gt;My dry, sensitive, allergy-prone skin will continue with Cetaphil&#x27;s Daily Facial Cleanser, until I find something better.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive acne prone skin with rosacea. I love Eucerin&#x27;s sensitive skin anti-wrinkle cream (both the day one with sunscreen and the night one without), so I gave this a try. However, it irritated my skin, making it red and itchy.</li>
            <li> JUST RECIEVED AND HAVE USED IT AND SO FAR IT IS GREAT LEAVES FACE FEELING NICE AND CLEAN</li>
            <li> I use it every day. Love it, and feel comfort for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have to say, that I have tried plenty of cleanser for the face. This one doesn&#x27;t dry the face as most of the others. It feels great and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product</li>
            <li> We cannot find this cleanser in the stores, so we always get this online. If you like non-oily/non-drying face wash get this. My wife had severe acne for two years, and this is the only product that would not irritate or cause flare-ups. Many &#x27;acne&#x27; creams only made everything worse. Now that her face is clear, she still uses this all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gentle product for a very long time; but it is not found anywhere around me anymore so I have to order it on line, so far no problem with that.</li>
            <li> I have found eucerin products to be easy to use and good for the skin.  While using this cleaner along with their anti wrinkle cream and using a upward motion to apply both many of the fine line and wrinkles have disappeared from my face.  My skin appear to be tighter even though I am losing weight (on design).</li>
            <li> I have had such  trouble finding the right facial cleanser. I kept breaking out and rashes a plenty. My doctor recommended Eucerin which I had to get it from the pharmacy. I started using it and noticed my face clearing up and no more crazy spots within a week. I really appreciate this product and trust the eucerin name.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Very trustworthy brand. Not much to say about the product except it cleanses thoroughly without drying the skin, which is exactly what it is supposed to do. First bought one bottle and afterwards ordered a set of four, which is also sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It is great for getting rid of dry skin on the face. Very hard to get in the stores.  Forget trying to look for it. You should just order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this really gentle cleanser; it has no fragrance, doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and doesn&#x27;t dry me out. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be available in stores any more, so I hope it continues to be available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. I started using this when I got pregnant and have loved it since. I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore so I&#x27;m hoping it will remain available online for a very long time. I have sensitive skin that is dry and oily and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have finally found something for my dry skin. My face now nice and soft. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> It does dry skin out but my face doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as after some other cleaners I&#x27;ve tried. I wish it foamed better too....but I guess that&#x27;s what maybe makes it gentler?</li>
            <li> Never had a face cleanser that burned my eyes.  Also hate the smell.  Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> This is a nice products, lots of lather, and leave your skin feeling nice and smooth, would keep buying this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it gave me before the due date and is just as it was in the pictures, I recommend it to all</li>
            <li> Great Great Great, this its the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever had please don&#x27;t discontinuous and don&#x27;t change the formula, I have a extremely sensitive skin and i have been worry and almost giving up in finding a good one and Finally thanks to Amazons reviews I got this one works perfect.</li>
            <li> After using Olay for over 10 years, I&#x27;m so glad I made the change to Eucerin.  My skin feels better and with less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of skin care products in my time. Eucerin is by far the best. Just the right amount of foam. I don&#x27;t like extra foamy facial soap. I love how my skin feels after washing. It doesn&#x27;t feel dry and tight. I use it in the shower. I also have one by the sink to wash my hands. It keeps my hands very soft and moist. I am in my 40&#x27;s. People tell me I look 10 years younger. Use this product as part of your beauty ritual. You will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I love the Eucerin lotions and this cleanser turned out to be every bit as good. Just the right amount comes out when you press down the top and my skin feels so good after using it.I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
            <li> I love Eucerin brand so much. I used the anti wrinkle cream and also lotion for sensitive skin. Our whole family also use Eucerin cleansing relief bath gel. I  bought the facial cleanser as my body shop aloe vera cleanser run off. My skin is really sensitive. I wanted to love the cleanser. Its just that my face becomes dry after four days of using it. So I am going to end up using it as a hand and body wash. By the way, I bought a four pack and one of the cleansers was broken and messed up the packaging box.</li>
            <li> This works fine for me so far, with no issues of itchy skin, and cleanses well enough.  Be careful not to get it in your eyes because it will burn.  I avoid contact with my lips since the taste of this product is very bitter and that concerns me as I wouldn&#x27;t want to ingest the ingredients.  I discovered that it suds very well on wet fingers as I rub them vigorously together and then apply to my face.  Rinses easily, and has no bad scent to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in the shower for many years.  It cleanses and moisturizes without leaving behind that oily feeling, yet it helps moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for a product before, but I read other customer reviews extensively before purchasing something new online, so I thought that this product deserved my input. I have combination skin (oily in some spots, dry in others) that is prone to both breakouts and flaking. My skin is not sensitive at all, but I have to be very careful about the products that I use so that the breakouts and/or dryness doesn&#x27;t get out of hand. This cleanser is fantastic! I read about it on a website called beautypedia.com - I am a religious follower of this website - it rates thousands of skincare &amp; makeup lines based on real life experience of reviewers and also based on scientific research of ingredients. There are no paid endorsements like on TV, in magazines,or on many other beauty websites! Anyway, I had been using Cetaphil for years because it was supposed to be gentle and for a long time it worked, but my skin started breaking out again and I hadn&#x27;t changed my skincare routine. I jumped on beautypedia.com and found out that my beloved Cetaphil had actually changed it&#x27;s formula and was no longer a recommended cleanser for my skin! The website lets you search by brand, product type, skin care needs, price, animal testing, etc., etc. I plugged in what I was looking for, and this Eucerin cleanser was what I found to meet all of my requirements.I LOVE IT! Unfortunately, I have only been able to find it online, so I buy it in multiples (I ran out twice by accident and pimples followed shortly). This is the first time that I&#x27;ve seen Amazon sell it as a 4 pack, and trust me, it&#x27;s the best bargain I&#x27;ve seen. My only suggestion for someone that tends to wear a lot of make-up (I have to for work) is to soak a cotton ball in eye make-up remover and use it all over your face first before using the cleanser. Also, it&#x27;s always good to use a face cloth with the cleanser to get some exfoliation benefits too. This cleanser is meant to be gentle and non-irritating, and it is definitely both of those, but the trade off is that to remove a lot of makeup you need to use a lot of cleanser, which I think is a waste. If you buy this cleanser, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
