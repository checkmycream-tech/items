            <li>he said they feel so good just having someyhing to hold in his fingers and put in his mouth without the side effects</li>
            <li>They arrived in good condition, however, they did not puff, like advertised.</li>
            <li>Good prop item.</li>
            <li>I loved tricking my family and friends.</li>
            <li>They are a great product but they weren&#x27;t packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li>I love this, great for cosplays.</li>
            <li>These are very authentic looking cigarettes</li>
            <li>Looks very believable but doesn&#x27;t give out any &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li>Ok, these being so cheap, they&#x27;re not the greatest thing ever.</li>
            <li>It WAS pretty awesome.</li>

            <li>I think thee are the coolest prank things I ever had I love it!</li>
            <li>but I was able to mostly unsquish, good for a murder mystery dinner party!</li>
            <li>these are amazing.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect anything amazing</li>
            <li>These cigarettes are amazing-</li>
            <li>My company banned all smoking on campus, even in one&#x27;s own car.</li>
            <li>Especially useful when it is suppose to be a teenager smoking.</li>
            <li>There okay not as good as id like</li>
            <li>it was nice</li>
            <li>I use it with a particular card trick and it works flawlessly every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>QUICK SHIPPING AND GREAT</li>
            <li>It is very easy to accidentally ingest.</li>
            <li>These arrived quickly which was nice!</li>
            <li>It was a nice surprise, just make sure you don&#x27;t breath in like I did. :)</li>
            <li>They are ok .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll sure get that dork at the campus chasing you all over because he thinks you&#x27;re smoking on school</li>
            <li>and it entertained them for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those that don&#x27;t want to smoke for an acting role or Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>i already used one will buy more</li>
            <li>Most of the dust fell out in shipping because it wasn&#x27;t packaged in a box or anything.</li>
            <li>How many people touched them before they were sent?  </li>
            <li>Would recommend getting  more.</li>
            <li>People many die of smoking</li>
            <li>all of the powder was at the top</li>
            <li>I figured I should have done better by rolling some paper and putting some talc inside.</li>
            <li>It could&#x27;ve been more cost-efficient.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d be ok for parties I guess.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>They look OK made of paper</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Overall this product was good, Did what it said and was great.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be better</li>
            <li>I have fooled many people.</li>
            <li>cute gag gift i dont smoke</li>
            <li>Therefore, neither worked appropriately.</li>
            <li>if you want this for a play or costume then sure get it</li>
            <li>I would love it if you guys could check us out please and thank you.</li>
            <li>really all together made a great 20&#x27;s gal.</li>
            <li>my friends love it and adorable everyone love it when they see it.</li>
            <li>Not too many smoke waves that come out</li>
            <li>and they weren&#x27;t packaged the best, But overall this product was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have high hopes about it always effective because I got one that was defective and didn&#x27;t work, the good thing was it came in TWOs rather than</li>
            <li>but I decided not to even though they work pretty good</li>
            <li>They were a nice addition to may already cool costume.</li>
            <li>Well, so far so good, although it would&#x27;ve been nice to get some instructions...</li>
            <li>will buy more, good product, very detail and presentable.</li>
            <li>Very cool prop.</li>
            <li>Love how it appears to light up and puffs smoke when air is blown into it.</li>
            <li>i also purchased a cigarette holder and put them in it, the puff cigarettes worked great, people were surprised, they thought, hey you cant smoke in here.</li>
            <li>love it and cheap price</li>
            <li>This is a good prank but you can&#x27;t really over use it or else the cotton inside starts to get moist from saliva</li>
            <li>so this was a good replacement of a real cigarette.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now if you&#x27;re so against influencing kids to smoke by selling something like this, why not offer some other excellent costumes as well.</li>
            <li>There are other practical jokes that are very awesome, also.  </li>
            <li>Really cool!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using for my costume and they&#x27;re easy to get the powder out of to look like you&#x27;re smoking.</li>
            <li>They showed up very quickly, and I&#x27;ve fooled a lot of people with them.  </li>
            <li>smoke is easy to see</li>
            <li>I say fine for them all, let them have their say.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re tremendous!</li>
            <li>They will fit fine in my cigarette holder and make the outfit a hit for the roaring 20&#x27;s outfit.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t raise an eyebrow, but the guy he was talking to had a huge look of surprise.</li>
            <li>cheap, came apart in the package</li>
            <li>oh well they are cheap</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t spend your money on this cheap toy gag prank its to cheap to work and</li>
            <li>THESE ARE CHEAP AND TIPPED WITH ORANGE FOIL.</li>
            <li>Bought these to fit into a cigarette holder for a theme party.  </li>
            <li>They were fantastic and arrived ahead of the scheduled date.  </li>
            <li>Nice not to have the real smoke or smell of cigarettes.</li>
            <li>They looked great, especially when attaching one at the end of a smoking wand.</li>
            <li>I stopped and laughed and asked him why he didn&#x27;t seem surprised, and he said that it didn&#x27;t stink like a cigarette</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure at a distance they look muuuch more real.</li>
            <li>but husband thought it was real and got a good laugh</li>
            <li>it looks real and it would work great for a play or a costume but does not act real.</li>
            <li>that more &#x27;smoke&#x27; would come out in order to really fool your friends or to have fun!!</li>
            <li>It was kind of realistic, but wears out after a while.</li>
            <li>Does not look realistic, even from a distance, theater crew ended up making our own props.</li>
            <li>For only $1 they&#x27;re pretty good!</li>
            <li>hardly any powder comes out when you blow its not that good but good for the price</li>
            <li>, you need to clean the end because its has holes for the smoke to come out</li>
            <li>I found that they were more flimsy than I originally thought and did not look very realistic.</li>
            <li>When you blow out it looks like real smoke the look very realistic, funny, fun, great to trick your friends/family.</li>
            <li>Overall it was good tho.</li>
            <li>This puff cigarette is really cool.</li>
            <li>they are kinda cool till they run out</li>
            <li>Cool, fooled my parents</li>
            <li>Okay, I got this for my costume and it really works.</li>
            <li>when i bought them i thought they looked cool</li>
            <li>good enough for a halloween party -</li>
            <li>Not bad though for the price.</li>
            <li>its a good product it runs out pretty fast but its still cool and fun and its at a right price</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; was pretty easy to see and lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li>I guess i was the lucky one.</li>
            <li>It looks so realistic and believable.</li>
            <li>my husband just quick smoking</li>
            <li>The shipping was super crappy, they put the cigarettes in an envelope and they were squished and a bunch of powder was at the bottom of the bag.</li>
            <li>Either way, shipped quickly and came just in time.</li>
            <li>although they were not expensive they were totally cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>These puff cigarettes are the perfect prop for a theatrical production where the script calls for the actor to smoke onstage and either the actor doesn&#x27;t smoke, is too young to really smoke or</li>
            <li>These are awesome for movies or plays, but they don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>I used them for several hours (not continuously) and there is still more \\&quot;smoke\\&quot; to go!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; faded pretty quickly but the &amp;#34;flame&amp;#34; is a metallic red and is VERY believable.</li>
            <li>My elementary age kids thought they were teriffic</li>
            <li>So much fun.  </li>
            <li>good, but not much smoke</li>
            <li>I used them for a 60&#x27;s party and they were a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>but they can be fun to use.</li>
            <li>Fun item for a 60&#x27;s party</li>
            <li>fun cigarettes for our party</li>
            <li>Costume, so fun and</li>
            <li>Fun to play around with.</li>
            <li>, so he knew right off it was a joke.</li>
            <li>These look very real and were a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>They look like real cigarettes and the puffs are cool.  </li>
            <li>This product was received very quick; however, they were completely busted when I opened the packaging.</li>
            <li>I do not have much luck getting the puff effect, but the ash section is especially realistic.  </li>
            <li>This was for Halloween; the red foil made it look like it was lit and the puff of smoke was fun for sure.</li>
            <li>WELL SPENT FOR SURE!</li>
            <li>They really smoke and look amazingly real!!</li>
            <li>This is really really effective, especially if you bought this for mainly trolling or planking.</li>
            <li>I got about 3 good puffs out of all cigarettes, so may spend a little more next time</li>
            <li>Worked funny but be cautious if you pull this prank on parents</li>
            <li>funny thing is is the people tht</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many ideas you could try if you want to give kids a different sort of message.</li>
            <li>the powder is more solid and will probably stick too).</li>
            <li>Overall, I defintely think you could trick most people and its safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. if the \\&quot;smoke\\&quot; is not coming out anymore</li>
            <li>Might have been able to squeeze them back into shape but they were too flimsy.</li>
            <li>AND EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS REAL!</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>These look like they are real cigs and lit!</li>
            <li>however the only that could make that better is you join them in dying.</li>
            <li>and they almost look real!</li>
            <li>These cigarettes look so real!</li>
            <li>Well first I will say dont suck it blow</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how real they looked!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for the costume.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t quite look like really cigarettes at all but for the fun, I am not one to ruin it.</li>
            <li>They basically came in an envelope with no padding but the price can&#x27;t be beat and shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>You only have so many puffs</li>
            <li>well worth the cheap price for a few laughs :)</li>
            <li>These were pretty funny to have around at a party.</li>
            <li>I had bought these from the state fair a few years ago and thats the reason I bought these.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product, it&#x27;s just the way they get shipped, that&#x27;s what I disliked....</li>
            <li>Looks Realistic, feels realistic, and cheap.</li>
            <li>They came flat and most of the puff leaked into the package.</li>
            <li>A real cigarette with a spot of glue and red glitter would have been better.</li>
            <li>A lot of the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; was rubbed off but besides that these were pretty decent!</li>
            <li>I must say, these cigarettes are VERY realistic.</li>
            <li>They are very realistic and we \\&quot;puffed\\&quot; on them all night.</li>
            <li>Very realistic cherry sparkles on the end.</li>
            <li>very clever.</li>
            <li>cigarette looked very realistic and everyone commented how real it looked ...</li>
            <li>Looking at the picture, you see the cigarettes in a nice little package.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I recieved it quickly and it did have free shipping , but other than that they sucked.</li>
            <li>The cigarette looks real, but when it cam time to create the smoke</li>
            <li>So much so that the people at the party that I attended thought I was smoking a real cigarette.</li>
            <li>It looks fairly real from a distance but not up close.</li>
            <li>These were very inexpensive but got a lot of laughs at the office.</li>
            <li>Even tho i&#x27;m not smoker, the smoke looks so real.</li>
            <li>The powder is used up fast.</li>
            <li>they look completely real.  </li>
            <li>Basically, they&#x27;re a one time use, so thankfully, they&#x27;re cheap enough to stock up on.</li>
            <li>They looked real and were durable all throughout the night.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I fool myself that I am smoking a real cigarette (quit after smoking for 20 years).  </li>
            <li>The tip has orange colored foil beneath the \\&quot;ash\\&quot;, so it really looks lit.  </li>
            <li>The cigarettes puffed smoke and some people thought they were real.  </li>
            <li>The product was recieved very timely.  </li>
            <li>They were very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>They really pulled it together</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This was ordered to play a trick on someone, to make him think they were real.  </li>
            <li>so i wouldn&#x27;t really recommend on puffing it</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t really feel or look like the picture.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting rid of these for a real cigarette.</li>
            <li>So they were very convenient because the club is a non smoking facility.    </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>so it dosen&#x27;t run out so fast</li>
            <li>Looked real however, did not work well at all, made one or two puff</li>
            <li>They looked real</li>
            <li>these cigarettes look so real</li>
            <li>these are so much mire healthier</li>
            <li>I got tons of compliments on how real it looked.  </li>
            <li>It worded very well with the jeweled cigarette holder to give me the 20&#x27;s look for my event.</li>
            <li>I THOUGHT THEY REALLY LIT UP LIKE THE ONES</li>
            <li>At one party, three bar tenders asked me to \\&quot;put that out\\&quot; because they look so real.</li>
            <li>They look real.</li>
            <li>I coulda got real cigs</li>
            <li>But you really do get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not attempt to return them for a refund is because I figured it would cost me more to send back than it was worth.</li>
            <li>Seller said that these would look like the real thing.</li>
            <li>My dad borrowed one for a bit and his friends thought it was real...</li>
            <li>They look real but you have to blow into them instead of suck the smoke out</li>
            <li>but people thought I was really smoking</li>
            <li>Went very well with my costume and character.</li>
            <li>i really got them fool....</li>
            <li>This product looks like a  real cigarettes and smoke does come out.</li>
            <li>Run out fast and don&#x27;t even look real</li>
            <li>but I did not stay in the holder very well</li>
            <li>, the puffing part looks so real-</li>
            <li>They looked so real.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I guess I expected a little more but 4 stars is about right.</li>
            <li>so I got lucky that they were not crushed.</li>
            <li>originally bought these as a joke, since the smokers in the company regularly take smoke breaks throughout the day, a cube neighbor</li>
            <li>I suppose that he has never realized that many theatres use fake cigarettes, some of which are pretty elaborate.</li>
            <li>They look realistic and take away any stress of real smoking on stage.  </li>
            <li>If you need something that lasts for more than a half hour, these aren&#x27;t gonna cut it.</li>
            <li>They are that realistic.</li>
            <li>The cigarettes look realistic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth it, better then the expensive ones :)</li>
            <li>Realistic from a distance</li>
            <li>When I received this the post office that I had it sent to told me that whoever sent the package only had a stamp of .48 cents on it and the weight required a total of $2.00 so on top of paying for the product and supposedly receiving &amp;#34;FREE&amp;#34; shipping I had to also pay the difference or</li>
            <li>The looks of unknowing people was classic.</li>
            <li>Looks so realistic.</li>
            <li>Looked realistic, but did not have any puff in them at all.</li>
            <li>I used them for a costume party and they looked incredibly realistic, with the smoke coming out of the end and</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t look quite so realistic anymore.</li>
            <li>The packet was full of powder everywhere and the cigarette was flat.</li>
            <li>The puff cigarrettes were used in a high school play written and directed by students.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but if you suck more than a little some of the powder can get on your tongue and you can wipe it off with something.</li>
            <li>actually end up buying it and have fun</li>
            <li>so I ordered a few more for rehearsal.</li>
            <li>was hoping for something better, but I didn&#x27;t waste my money trying for it.</li>
            <li>were ok, smoke didnt last too long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to see the smoke emanating from a single cigarette, however, it&#x27;s great for any cigarette holder.</li>
            <li>Maybe for high school PLAYS, but there should be no reason why it should be in a 6 year old&#x27;s mouth!</li>
            <li>and it has a shiny metallic piece of plastic on the end to make other light around you seem like it&#x27;s lit by reflection.</li>
            <li>The play was a western and the product was better than expected.</li>
            <li>These arrived completely flattened, but I was able to carefully work them back into shape and they did &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
            <li>They arrived slightly smashed but that is fine with me.</li>
            <li>Looks incredibly realistic and people will mistake it for the real thing, especially from a distance.</li>
            <li>Extremely realistic yet was too wide to properly fit the standard sized cigarette holder used with Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>The ends (the part that&#x27;s &amp;#34;lit&amp;#34;) are flat and there isn&#x27;t a lot of puff.</li>
            <li>definitely an awesome accessory for my mad men costume!</li>
            <li>Overall very realistic tho</li>
            <li>They were very realistic and the smoke could be seen in the back of the audience.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little fragile, but otherwise fantastic!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re realistic enough, it&#x27;s pretty obvious close up</li>
            <li>You actually have to blow through them to get the fake smoke and all of the ones I ordered worked great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- dress up as a cancer/AIDS patient, complete with sunken cheeks and bald-cap.</li>
            <li>I could not believe this item was listed as the 95th item for toys for 5 to 7 year old children.  </li>
            <li>I have shared the link showing this toy as a recommended toy for 5 o 7 year old kids with my friends on facebook</li>
            <li>If what you want is toy cigarettes that look like the real thing yet don&#x27;t need the actual puff, this&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li>The powder is not toxic but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend inhaling it deeply like real smoke (not that</li>
            <li>These cigarettes are so real looking that everyone at the party had to take a second look.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and messy.</li>
            <li>I had my 9 year old son use them and walk around or hang his hand out the window.  </li>
            <li>They totally resemble the real thing.</li>
            <li>Used with a faux cigarette holder and loved fake smoke effect.  </li>
            <li>care should be taken to keep them off stage in a sturdy box  when not in use to protect them as they could be crushed rather easily, but if the actor and prop master takes proper care , one should easily last the run of a 3 week production.</li>
            <li>I used these for a final exam monologue in my theatre class, they looked realistic and sold my character</li>
            <li>Looks real &amp; lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>These puff cigarettes look real and puff smoke for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Although this clearly comes from a third party vendor, amazon should screen any offers and remove any inappropriate ones.</li>
            <li>I wish they would last longer, but they are inexpensive enough that it doesn&#x27;t cost much to get replacements.</li>
            <li>And also the smoke is barely visible!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smoke, but I thought I would have a little fun with it and saw the CEO talking to a Director in his cube.</li>
            <li>The cigarette looks realistic but the fake smoke is more like powder coming out of it.</li>
            <li>There good for prancing but if your a student you could get in serious trouble.</li>
            <li>These have little tiny pieces of red glitter at the tip that pick up the light and appear to be glowing ash from as close as 1 - 2 feet away.</li>
            <li>I could barely even get &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li>Smoke barely comes out</li>
            <li>, I say it&#x27;s worth it to buy a few of these.</li>
            <li>Scares people around you for a second, but as they really look at it, they know it&#x27;s not a real cigarette.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed in this as they seem to be a great alternative to real cigarettes for costumes.</li>
            <li>I walked past, puffing a little, the Director nearly fell off his chair, but the CEO was cool as a cucumber.</li>

            <li> he said they feel so good just having someyhing to hold in his fingers and put in his mouth without the side effects</li>
            <li> They arrived in good condition, however, they did not puff, like advertised.</li>
            <li> Good prop item.</li>
            <li> I loved tricking my family and friends.</li>
            <li> They are a great product but they weren&#x27;t packaged appropriately.</li>
            <li> I love this, great for cosplays.</li>
            <li> These are very authentic looking cigarettes</li>
            <li> Looks very believable but doesn&#x27;t give out any &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> Ok, these being so cheap, they&#x27;re not the greatest thing ever.</li>
            <li> It WAS pretty awesome.</li>

            <li> I think thee are the coolest prank things I ever had I love it!</li>
            <li> but I was able to mostly unsquish, good for a murder mystery dinner party!</li>
            <li> these are amazing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect anything amazing</li>
            <li> These cigarettes are amazing-</li>
            <li> My company banned all smoking on campus, even in one&#x27;s own car.</li>
            <li> Especially useful when it is suppose to be a teenager smoking.</li>
            <li> There okay not as good as id like</li>
            <li> it was nice</li>
            <li> I use it with a particular card trick and it works flawlessly every time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> QUICK SHIPPING AND GREAT</li>
            <li> It is very easy to accidentally ingest.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly which was nice!</li>
            <li> It was a nice surprise, just make sure you don&#x27;t breath in like I did. :)</li>
            <li> They are ok .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll sure get that dork at the campus chasing you all over because he thinks you&#x27;re smoking on school</li>
            <li> and it entertained them for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those that don&#x27;t want to smoke for an acting role or Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> i already used one will buy more</li>
            <li> Most of the dust fell out in shipping because it wasn&#x27;t packaged in a box or anything.</li>
            <li> How many people touched them before they were sent?  </li>
            <li> Would recommend getting  more.</li>
            <li> People many die of smoking</li>
            <li> all of the powder was at the top</li>
            <li> I figured I should have done better by rolling some paper and putting some talc inside.</li>
            <li> It could&#x27;ve been more cost-efficient.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d be ok for parties I guess.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> They look OK made of paper</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> Overall this product was good, Did what it said and was great.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be better</li>
            <li> I have fooled many people.</li>
            <li> cute gag gift i dont smoke</li>
            <li> Therefore, neither worked appropriately.</li>
            <li> if you want this for a play or costume then sure get it</li>
            <li> I would love it if you guys could check us out please and thank you.</li>
            <li> really all together made a great 20&#x27;s gal.</li>
            <li> my friends love it and adorable everyone love it when they see it.</li>
            <li> Not too many smoke waves that come out</li>
            <li> and they weren&#x27;t packaged the best, But overall this product was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have high hopes about it always effective because I got one that was defective and didn&#x27;t work, the good thing was it came in TWOs rather than</li>
            <li> but I decided not to even though they work pretty good</li>
            <li> They were a nice addition to may already cool costume.</li>
            <li> Well, so far so good, although it would&#x27;ve been nice to get some instructions...</li>
            <li> will buy more, good product, very detail and presentable.</li>
            <li> Very cool prop.</li>
            <li> Love how it appears to light up and puffs smoke when air is blown into it.</li>
            <li> i also purchased a cigarette holder and put them in it, the puff cigarettes worked great, people were surprised, they thought, hey you cant smoke in here.</li>
            <li> love it and cheap price</li>
            <li> This is a good prank but you can&#x27;t really over use it or else the cotton inside starts to get moist from saliva</li>
            <li> so this was a good replacement of a real cigarette.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now if you&#x27;re so against influencing kids to smoke by selling something like this, why not offer some other excellent costumes as well.</li>
            <li> There are other practical jokes that are very awesome, also.  </li>
            <li> Really cool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using for my costume and they&#x27;re easy to get the powder out of to look like you&#x27;re smoking.</li>
            <li> They showed up very quickly, and I&#x27;ve fooled a lot of people with them.  </li>
            <li> smoke is easy to see</li>
            <li> I say fine for them all, let them have their say.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re tremendous!</li>
            <li> They will fit fine in my cigarette holder and make the outfit a hit for the roaring 20&#x27;s outfit.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t raise an eyebrow, but the guy he was talking to had a huge look of surprise.</li>
            <li> cheap, came apart in the package</li>
            <li> oh well they are cheap</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t spend your money on this cheap toy gag prank its to cheap to work and</li>
            <li> THESE ARE CHEAP AND TIPPED WITH ORANGE FOIL.</li>
            <li> Bought these to fit into a cigarette holder for a theme party.  </li>
            <li> They were fantastic and arrived ahead of the scheduled date.  </li>
            <li> Nice not to have the real smoke or smell of cigarettes.</li>
            <li> They looked great, especially when attaching one at the end of a smoking wand.</li>
            <li> I stopped and laughed and asked him why he didn&#x27;t seem surprised, and he said that it didn&#x27;t stink like a cigarette</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure at a distance they look muuuch more real.</li>
            <li> but husband thought it was real and got a good laugh</li>
            <li> it looks real and it would work great for a play or a costume but does not act real.</li>
            <li> that more &#x27;smoke&#x27; would come out in order to really fool your friends or to have fun!!</li>
            <li> It was kind of realistic, but wears out after a while.</li>
            <li> Does not look realistic, even from a distance, theater crew ended up making our own props.</li>
            <li> For only $1 they&#x27;re pretty good!</li>
            <li> hardly any powder comes out when you blow its not that good but good for the price</li>
            <li> , you need to clean the end because its has holes for the smoke to come out</li>
            <li> I found that they were more flimsy than I originally thought and did not look very realistic.</li>
            <li> When you blow out it looks like real smoke the look very realistic, funny, fun, great to trick your friends/family.</li>
            <li> Overall it was good tho.</li>
            <li> This puff cigarette is really cool.</li>
            <li> they are kinda cool till they run out</li>
            <li> Cool, fooled my parents</li>
            <li> Okay, I got this for my costume and it really works.</li>
            <li> when i bought them i thought they looked cool</li>
            <li> good enough for a halloween party -</li>
            <li> Not bad though for the price.</li>
            <li> its a good product it runs out pretty fast but its still cool and fun and its at a right price</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; was pretty easy to see and lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li> I guess i was the lucky one.</li>
            <li> It looks so realistic and believable.</li>
            <li> my husband just quick smoking</li>
            <li> The shipping was super crappy, they put the cigarettes in an envelope and they were squished and a bunch of powder was at the bottom of the bag.</li>
            <li> Either way, shipped quickly and came just in time.</li>
            <li> although they were not expensive they were totally cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> These puff cigarettes are the perfect prop for a theatrical production where the script calls for the actor to smoke onstage and either the actor doesn&#x27;t smoke, is too young to really smoke or</li>
            <li> These are awesome for movies or plays, but they don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I used them for several hours (not continuously) and there is still more \\&quot;smoke\\&quot; to go!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; faded pretty quickly but the &amp;#34;flame&amp;#34; is a metallic red and is VERY believable.</li>
            <li> My elementary age kids thought they were teriffic</li>
            <li> So much fun.  </li>
            <li> good, but not much smoke</li>
            <li> I used them for a 60&#x27;s party and they were a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> but they can be fun to use.</li>
            <li> Fun item for a 60&#x27;s party</li>
            <li> fun cigarettes for our party</li>
            <li> Costume, so fun and</li>
            <li> Fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> , so he knew right off it was a joke.</li>
            <li> These look very real and were a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li> They look like real cigarettes and the puffs are cool.  </li>
            <li> This product was received very quick; however, they were completely busted when I opened the packaging.</li>
            <li> I do not have much luck getting the puff effect, but the ash section is especially realistic.  </li>
            <li> This was for Halloween; the red foil made it look like it was lit and the puff of smoke was fun for sure.</li>
            <li> WELL SPENT FOR SURE!</li>
            <li> They really smoke and look amazingly real!!</li>
            <li> This is really really effective, especially if you bought this for mainly trolling or planking.</li>
            <li> I got about 3 good puffs out of all cigarettes, so may spend a little more next time</li>
            <li> Worked funny but be cautious if you pull this prank on parents</li>
            <li> funny thing is is the people tht</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are so many ideas you could try if you want to give kids a different sort of message.</li>
            <li> the powder is more solid and will probably stick too).</li>
            <li> Overall, I defintely think you could trick most people and its safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. if the \\&quot;smoke\\&quot; is not coming out anymore</li>
            <li> Might have been able to squeeze them back into shape but they were too flimsy.</li>
            <li> AND EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS REAL!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> These look like they are real cigs and lit!</li>
            <li> however the only that could make that better is you join them in dying.</li>
            <li> and they almost look real!</li>
            <li> These cigarettes look so real!</li>
            <li> Well first I will say dont suck it blow</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how real they looked!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for the costume.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t quite look like really cigarettes at all but for the fun, I am not one to ruin it.</li>
            <li> They basically came in an envelope with no padding but the price can&#x27;t be beat and shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> You only have so many puffs</li>
            <li> well worth the cheap price for a few laughs :)</li>
            <li> These were pretty funny to have around at a party.</li>
            <li> I had bought these from the state fair a few years ago and thats the reason I bought these.  </li>
            <li> It is a good product, it&#x27;s just the way they get shipped, that&#x27;s what I disliked....</li>
            <li> Looks Realistic, feels realistic, and cheap.</li>
            <li> They came flat and most of the puff leaked into the package.</li>
            <li> A real cigarette with a spot of glue and red glitter would have been better.</li>
            <li> A lot of the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; was rubbed off but besides that these were pretty decent!</li>
            <li> I must say, these cigarettes are VERY realistic.</li>
            <li> They are very realistic and we \\&quot;puffed\\&quot; on them all night.</li>
            <li> Very realistic cherry sparkles on the end.</li>
            <li> very clever.</li>
            <li> cigarette looked very realistic and everyone commented how real it looked ...</li>
            <li> Looking at the picture, you see the cigarettes in a nice little package.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I recieved it quickly and it did have free shipping , but other than that they sucked.</li>
            <li> The cigarette looks real, but when it cam time to create the smoke</li>
            <li> So much so that the people at the party that I attended thought I was smoking a real cigarette.</li>
            <li> It looks fairly real from a distance but not up close.</li>
            <li> These were very inexpensive but got a lot of laughs at the office.</li>
            <li> Even tho i&#x27;m not smoker, the smoke looks so real.</li>
            <li> The powder is used up fast.</li>
            <li> they look completely real.  </li>
            <li> Basically, they&#x27;re a one time use, so thankfully, they&#x27;re cheap enough to stock up on.</li>
            <li> They looked real and were durable all throughout the night.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I fool myself that I am smoking a real cigarette (quit after smoking for 20 years).  </li>
            <li> The tip has orange colored foil beneath the \\&quot;ash\\&quot;, so it really looks lit.  </li>
            <li> The cigarettes puffed smoke and some people thought they were real.  </li>
            <li> The product was recieved very timely.  </li>
            <li> They were very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> They really pulled it together</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This was ordered to play a trick on someone, to make him think they were real.  </li>
            <li> so i wouldn&#x27;t really recommend on puffing it</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t really feel or look like the picture.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting rid of these for a real cigarette.</li>
            <li> So they were very convenient because the club is a non smoking facility.    </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> so it dosen&#x27;t run out so fast</li>
            <li> Looked real however, did not work well at all, made one or two puff</li>
            <li> They looked real</li>
            <li> these cigarettes look so real</li>
            <li> these are so much mire healthier</li>
            <li> I got tons of compliments on how real it looked.  </li>
            <li> It worded very well with the jeweled cigarette holder to give me the 20&#x27;s look for my event.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THEY REALLY LIT UP LIKE THE ONES</li>
            <li> At one party, three bar tenders asked me to \\&quot;put that out\\&quot; because they look so real.</li>
            <li> They look real.</li>
            <li> I coulda got real cigs</li>
            <li> But you really do get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not attempt to return them for a refund is because I figured it would cost me more to send back than it was worth.</li>
            <li> Seller said that these would look like the real thing.</li>
            <li> My dad borrowed one for a bit and his friends thought it was real...</li>
            <li> They look real but you have to blow into them instead of suck the smoke out</li>
            <li> but people thought I was really smoking</li>
            <li> Went very well with my costume and character.</li>
            <li> i really got them fool....</li>
            <li> This product looks like a  real cigarettes and smoke does come out.</li>
            <li> Run out fast and don&#x27;t even look real</li>
            <li> but I did not stay in the holder very well</li>
            <li> , the puffing part looks so real-</li>
            <li> They looked so real.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I guess I expected a little more but 4 stars is about right.</li>
            <li> so I got lucky that they were not crushed.</li>
            <li> originally bought these as a joke, since the smokers in the company regularly take smoke breaks throughout the day, a cube neighbor</li>
            <li> I suppose that he has never realized that many theatres use fake cigarettes, some of which are pretty elaborate.</li>
            <li> They look realistic and take away any stress of real smoking on stage.  </li>
            <li> If you need something that lasts for more than a half hour, these aren&#x27;t gonna cut it.</li>
            <li> They are that realistic.</li>
            <li> The cigarettes look realistic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth it, better then the expensive ones :)</li>
            <li> Realistic from a distance</li>
            <li> When I received this the post office that I had it sent to told me that whoever sent the package only had a stamp of .48 cents on it and the weight required a total of $2.00 so on top of paying for the product and supposedly receiving &amp;#34;FREE&amp;#34; shipping I had to also pay the difference or</li>
            <li> The looks of unknowing people was classic.</li>
            <li> Looks so realistic.</li>
            <li> Looked realistic, but did not have any puff in them at all.</li>
            <li> I used them for a costume party and they looked incredibly realistic, with the smoke coming out of the end and</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t look quite so realistic anymore.</li>
            <li> The packet was full of powder everywhere and the cigarette was flat.</li>
            <li> The puff cigarrettes were used in a high school play written and directed by students.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but if you suck more than a little some of the powder can get on your tongue and you can wipe it off with something.</li>
            <li> actually end up buying it and have fun</li>
            <li> so I ordered a few more for rehearsal.</li>
            <li> was hoping for something better, but I didn&#x27;t waste my money trying for it.</li>
            <li> were ok, smoke didnt last too long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see the smoke emanating from a single cigarette, however, it&#x27;s great for any cigarette holder.</li>
            <li> Maybe for high school PLAYS, but there should be no reason why it should be in a 6 year old&#x27;s mouth!</li>
            <li> and it has a shiny metallic piece of plastic on the end to make other light around you seem like it&#x27;s lit by reflection.</li>
            <li> The play was a western and the product was better than expected.</li>
            <li> These arrived completely flattened, but I was able to carefully work them back into shape and they did &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
            <li> They arrived slightly smashed but that is fine with me.</li>
            <li> Looks incredibly realistic and people will mistake it for the real thing, especially from a distance.</li>
            <li> Extremely realistic yet was too wide to properly fit the standard sized cigarette holder used with Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> The ends (the part that&#x27;s &amp;#34;lit&amp;#34;) are flat and there isn&#x27;t a lot of puff.</li>
            <li> definitely an awesome accessory for my mad men costume!</li>
            <li> Overall very realistic tho</li>
            <li> They were very realistic and the smoke could be seen in the back of the audience.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little fragile, but otherwise fantastic!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re realistic enough, it&#x27;s pretty obvious close up</li>
            <li> You actually have to blow through them to get the fake smoke and all of the ones I ordered worked great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- dress up as a cancer/AIDS patient, complete with sunken cheeks and bald-cap.</li>
            <li> I could not believe this item was listed as the 95th item for toys for 5 to 7 year old children.  </li>
            <li> I have shared the link showing this toy as a recommended toy for 5 o 7 year old kids with my friends on facebook</li>
            <li> If what you want is toy cigarettes that look like the real thing yet don&#x27;t need the actual puff, this&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> The powder is not toxic but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend inhaling it deeply like real smoke (not that</li>
            <li> These cigarettes are so real looking that everyone at the party had to take a second look.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and messy.</li>
            <li> I had my 9 year old son use them and walk around or hang his hand out the window.  </li>
            <li> They totally resemble the real thing.</li>
            <li> Used with a faux cigarette holder and loved fake smoke effect.  </li>
            <li> care should be taken to keep them off stage in a sturdy box  when not in use to protect them as they could be crushed rather easily, but if the actor and prop master takes proper care , one should easily last the run of a 3 week production.</li>
            <li> I used these for a final exam monologue in my theatre class, they looked realistic and sold my character</li>
            <li> Looks real &amp; lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> These puff cigarettes look real and puff smoke for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Although this clearly comes from a third party vendor, amazon should screen any offers and remove any inappropriate ones.</li>
            <li> I wish they would last longer, but they are inexpensive enough that it doesn&#x27;t cost much to get replacements.</li>
            <li> And also the smoke is barely visible!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smoke, but I thought I would have a little fun with it and saw the CEO talking to a Director in his cube.</li>
            <li> The cigarette looks realistic but the fake smoke is more like powder coming out of it.</li>
            <li> There good for prancing but if your a student you could get in serious trouble.</li>
            <li> These have little tiny pieces of red glitter at the tip that pick up the light and appear to be glowing ash from as close as 1 - 2 feet away.</li>
            <li> I could barely even get &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> Smoke barely comes out</li>
            <li> , I say it&#x27;s worth it to buy a few of these.</li>
            <li> Scares people around you for a second, but as they really look at it, they know it&#x27;s not a real cigarette.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this as they seem to be a great alternative to real cigarettes for costumes.</li>
            <li> I walked past, puffing a little, the Director nearly fell off his chair, but the CEO was cool as a cucumber.</li>
            <li> These fake cigarettes were super realistic.</li>
            <li> I have always let my child come on this site to check out toys and show me what she&#x27;d like for Christmas or her birthday, so that I can read reviews and decide, but if you are going to try to sell this type of product to my YOUNG child, I think we will start shopping other places for toys.</li>
            <li> , my only problem was that it was a bit difficult to manage to get the &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; to come out of the cigarette, but after caring them around long enough, and having to reshape them multiple times, I got the smoke to come out easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until the late 70&#x27;s that we put a stop to doctors and celebrities supporting smoking.</li>
            <li> By blowing into the cigarette, a small puff of \\&quot;powder\\&quot; comes out, looking just like real smoke.  </li>
            <li> They came in a flat envelop .</li>
            <li> It could&#x27;ve damage them since they were flat and some powder came out.</li>
            <li> They do however look alright, and would work for a play so long as actually blowing smoke is not a concern.</li>
            <li> the cigarettes were flat from shipment</li>
            <li> this product came squished and was flat.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other fake ones from a different company and everything was better</li>
            <li> At least real cigarettes are properly wrapped.</li>
            <li> I was mistaken and thought these actually did a fake puff or were the ones that light up....</li>
            <li> singles.i would recommend this for pranks but don&#x27;t go extreme when using for pranks, you can really get in trouble.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, they work...at least they will look real in the cigarette holder I purchased.</li>
            <li> So I got in touch on the 5th time they sent out replacements and all the replacements was the same crushed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However - they are fragile, so be careful with them.</li>
            <li> so I tried the other one but with the same unsuccessful results.</li>
            <li> This may have possibly been done due to flattened during shipment.  </li>
            <li> The orange part did make them look a little redneck, so I cut off those parts to make them regular, white cigs.</li>
            <li> The puff cigarettes came like in the picture and it lasted very long</li>
            <li> go as a suicide victim (you pick the way to go!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that such a successful company would use this type of tactic to get people to buy products.</li>
            <li> Just loose.</li>
            <li> Even though I did read most reviews about how bad they were</li>
            <li> and I had to throw them away a huge disappointment</li>
            <li> They might have been usable if they hadn&#x27;t been mailed in an envelop so they came crushed.</li>
            <li> Everything came on time and was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am going to try and make them round and glue them back together!</li>
            <li> Go ahead and buy if you are curious.</li>
            <li> , the cigerettes were crushed...</li>
            <li> and it came crushed</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It would have cost more to return idiots next time put it in a box!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I cannot believe a company like Amazon is promoting smoking to young children.  </li>
            <li> it barely worked and you could hardly see the smoke.</li>
            <li> Each of our guests got one and these fake cigarettes were really a hit!</li>
            <li> the bag was filled with powder, didn&#x27;t blow smoke, \\&quot;ember\\&quot; tip looked very fake</li>
            <li> I have to say other than that, I tricked my sister with this in no time.</li>
            <li> You just never no if the ones in the store actually create the puff or not (most don&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> :When you blow only a small amount of &#x27;smoke&#x27; is seen.</li>
            <li> would be fun silly gift, but unfortunately they were not properly packed so they were crushed to the point that I did not even give them as part of the present.</li>
            <li> Only reason why I gave 4 stars is it&#x27;s hard to blow into and make it smoke a lot.</li>
            <li> The only hard thing for me was to get smoke out</li>
            <li> it might work from a distance but not useful for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time or money to return.  </li>
            <li> It was a lie however, when the seller promised that puffing on these fake cigarettes would put out the allusion of real smoke.</li>
            <li> This fake smoke-puffing cigarettes really helped him pull off the character he played.</li>
            <li> I set one down on the table to take a photo, and a friend reached over to pick it up so that it would not burn.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other fake cigarettes (puff or not), these are flimsy and nearly fall apart when you pick them up, much less put them in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Also, once the end gets wet, it immediately shrivels up and is not able to use again.</li>
            <li> There was white powder everywhere and the fake cigarettes were completely flat.</li>
            <li> also its seems a little odd that it says &amp;#34;trick your friends&amp;#34</li>
            <li> They came in a little damaged but they still work.</li>
            <li> i put a little bit of baby powder in it</li>
            <li> and it worked a little bit.</li>
            <li> a little squished</li>
            <li> Here are a few ideas I&#x27;ve got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- tape your arm behind your back and go as an amputee who was playing with fireworks</li>
            <li> When I tried to round them out again, the paper came undone.</li>
            <li> They both work, and I&#x27;ve pranked quite a few people with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the cigarette holder as well and the cigarettes would not fit into the holder</li>
            <li> Both were a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> $2 wasted.</li>
            <li> waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> , what a waste of money i have to say</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but if you want it as a prank then dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> When I got this item it was all smushed up and it was just waste of money</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> Do not buy them they are a waste of money</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers are giving this John reviewer a hard time because he&#x27;s against this product.</li>
            <li> I cant be to mad didn&#x27;t pay that much for them</li>
            <li> Nothing funnier than seeing a 7 yo try to look tough but totally failing because they are laughing too hard.</li>
            <li> I walked past the CEO of our (sort of small company) and did a little puff.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they are supposed to smoke, but still serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> For me, 1 out of 5 blows would produce small amounts of smoke.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it took forever to arrive, there was only two</li>
            <li> So I told them to send it in a small box.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to wait a while to puff again to see a small amount of &#x27;smoke&#x27;.</li>
            <li> i used these for a photo shoot because actual cigarettes were way too expensive.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s theater class recently had a stage play where he played as the &amp;#34;modern-day prodigal son&amp;#34; and had to use fake vice props.</li>
            <li> you cant suck only blows its useless..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this can literally get you in trouble , especially if you&#x27;re a teenager or even worse, a kid.</li>
            <li> I bought these fake cigarettes for a short film I was making and they were ridiculous.</li>
            <li> i cannot even explain im very mad at how long it took and it is useless first cigarette broke</li>
            <li> I am shocked that this product is in the 5-7yr old toy section.</li>
            <li> also the company will harass you if you say anything negative about you.</li>
            <li> Hate real cigarettes</li>
            <li> Product arrived late and broken</li>
            <li> Looks fake and was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its pretty disgusting that they Should advertise these as a CHILD&#x27;s toy.</li>
            <li> I have blown at least 20 puffs on one of the cigarettes and it still hasn&#x27;t run out of powder!</li>
            <li> its dumb buy</li>
            <li> I had it tucked behind my ear the night of my performance and someone tapped me on the shoulder and asked if it was lit.</li>
            <li> Baby powder is used (quite poorly) for the puff effect.  </li>
            <li> It did often get confused with E-Cigs though.</li>
            <li> The packaging that they were shipped in was not great</li>
            <li> Poorly done.</li>
            <li> I AM IRATELY CONFUSED AS TO WHO</li>
            <li> only bad thing about it is, after about 20 blows, the POWDER SMOKE will run out!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my take on these fake cigarettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is totally innappropriate and sends a very bad message to our your people who we are suppose to protect!</li>
            <li> Even if it is pretend and fake.</li>
            <li> Fake cigarettes and cigars should not be offered as a toy for 5-7 year olds.   </li>
            <li> Still puffs for fake cigarettes so it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> I received two fake cigarettes thrown into a mailing envelope.</li>
            <li> They are what they are - fake cigs.  </li>
            <li> They look so fake.</li>
            <li> Fake smoke adds to the effect.</li>
            <li> The cigarettes were smashed and unable to be used.</li>
            <li> They looked soo fake</li>
            <li> it couldn&#x27;t even trick a drunk person</li>
            <li> Well, they do look like cigarettes but the fake smoke looks like a joke.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a silly gag.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and so I had a blast inhaling and pushing the fake smoke out of these.</li>
            <li> There is supposed to be fake smoke that comes out when you blow on them and nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> A lot people didn&#x27;t realize they were fake until they looked at it closely.</li>
            <li> Its lame its just powder in paper</li>
            <li> Packaging was very poor, offering no protection for the two cigarettes in the plastic pouch.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?!?!?</li>
            <li> I prank my dad and he slapped it out of my hand and when crazy when I told him it was fake</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s disappointing and the presentation was lacking.</li>
            <li> Although the product does not state whether or not the powder is dangerous to inhale.</li>
            <li> and that was about it, tried and tried but cold</li>
            <li> They look extremely fake!</li>
            <li> Needless to say i couldn&#x27;t use it for my play!</li>
            <li> This pack of 2 fake cigarettes exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have no idea why some people wrote bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Bad service.</li>
            <li> I guess for.the price, they werent bad.</li>
            <li> I am shocked to see this product advertised for children.</li>
            <li> I told the thin bag with no protection is awful and all orders is damage.</li>
            <li> this sucks!!!!</li>
            <li> STINKS!</li>
            <li> Just awful not happy bad very bad service.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy to see this here.</li>
            <li> its so stupid</li>
            <li> I scared the crap out of my parents by using it in the house.</li>
            <li> Smoking is very bad for ones health and it</li>
            <li> However, the powder works very badly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use at all and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that they do not work.</li>
            <li> It was HYSTERICAL.  </li>
            <li> They also get all nasty when you put it in your mouth!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all and the powder goes into your mouth and it is so nasty.</li>
            <li> AWFUL never will order from them again.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely terrible and did NOT work as promised!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked funny but be cautious if you pull this prank on parents</li>
            <li> Product arrived late and broken</li>
            <li> They are a great product but they weren&#x27;t packaged appropriately. They arrived smashed and only one of them worked as a result</li>
            <li> The cigarette looks real, but when it cam time to create the smoke it was a dud. There were two in a pack so I tried the other one but with the same unsuccessful results.</li>
            <li> I bought from the same company as last year but found that the cigarette looked different and more fake than last years. It won&#x27;t fool anyone but may be good for stage prompts.</li>
            <li> Ecelent all. Is a good seller</li>
            <li> They are ok . Just didn&#x27;t like the way it was wrapped up. They came in a flat envelop . It could&#x27;ve damage them since they were flat and some powder came out.</li>
            <li> I did not like the way these were made.</li>
            <li> I must say, these cigarettes are VERY realistic. So much so that the people at the party that I attended thought I was smoking a real cigarette. It&#x27;s hard to see the smoke emanating from a single cigarette, however, it&#x27;s great for any cigarette holder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product send the \\&quot;right\\&quot; message to kids....gag or no gag &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until the late 70&#x27;s that we put a stop to doctors and celebrities supporting smoking. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;We have not come along way baby with this product.</li>
            <li> funny thing is is the people tht actualy despise this item actually end up buying it and have fun</li>
            <li> I bought this toy just for the heck of it and it does nothing it just is the way that you see it in the picture.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers are giving this John reviewer a hard time because he&#x27;s against this product. I say fine for them all, let them have their say. Here&#x27;s my take on these fake cigarettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering what the cost of smokes are these days, I say it&#x27;s worth it to buy a few of these. They never go out. You can use them ANYWHERE you&#x27;re not allowed to smoke. It&#x27;ll sure get that dork at the campus chasing you all over because he thinks you&#x27;re smoking on school property!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you&#x27;re so against influencing kids to smoke by selling something like this, why not offer some other excellent costumes as well. Here are a few ideas I&#x27;ve got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- dress up as a cancer/AIDS patient, complete with sunken cheeks and bald-cap. For that added effect paint some [[ASIN:B000UU64F0 oozing sores]] on your face.&lt;br /&gt;- have a hole in your neck from throat cancer and talk like the robot Twiki on [[ASIN:B0013OXWU2 Buck Rogers]]: be-da-be-da-be-da-beet!&lt;br /&gt;- go as a Holocaust survivor (same as cancer patient, but add a tattoo)&lt;br /&gt;- tape your arm behind your back and go as an amputee who was playing with fireworks&lt;br /&gt;- go as a suicide victim (you pick the way to go!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many ideas you could try if you want to give kids a different sort of message. As we can see by todays teens we haven&#x27;t been doing our work...time to try something else.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as part of a prank. It looks fairly real from a distance but not up close. Also it only gives off maybe 4 or 5 puffs of smoke. Overall it was good tho.</li>
            <li> its a good product it runs out pretty fast but its still cool and fun and its at a right price</li>
            <li> Update: My company banned all smoking on campus, even in one&#x27;s own car. I don&#x27;t smoke, but I thought I would have a little fun with it and saw the CEO talking to a Director in his cube. I walked past, puffing a little, the Director nearly fell off his chair, but the CEO was cool as a cucumber. I stopped and laughed and asked him why he didn&#x27;t seem surprised, and he said that it didn&#x27;t stink like a cigarette, so he knew right off it was a joke. The look on the Director&#x27;s face was priceless, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought these as a joke, since the smokers in the company regularly take smoke breaks throughout the day, a cube neighbor and I decided we deserved \\&quot;smoke breaks,\\&quot; too!  These were very inexpensive but got a lot of laughs at the office. I walked past the CEO of our (sort of small company) and did a little puff. He didn&#x27;t raise an eyebrow, but the guy he was talking to had a huge look of surprise. I started laughing and showed it to them. The only thing it lacks is the smell of cigarettes. My elementary age kids thought they were teriffic and it entertained them for more than an hour. Two days later, they are still playign with them occasionally. We took photos and uploaded them to Facebook. Nothing funnier than seeing a 7 yo try to look tough but totally failing because they are laughing too hard. Plus, they have no idea how to hold the thing in their mouths. These have little tiny pieces of red glitter at the tip that pick up the light and appear to be glowing ash from as close as 1 - 2 feet away. You have to study it closely while holding it still to tell that it&#x27;s very tiny glitter, and not glowing ash. Of all of the stagecraft cigarettes, these are the ones that are the best value for your money.</li>
            <li> This is a great prop. Perfect for those that don&#x27;t want to smoke for an acting role or Halloween costume. I scared the crap out of my parents by using it in the house. I had it tucked behind my ear the night of my performance and someone tapped me on the shoulder and asked if it was lit.</li>
            <li> The puff cigarettes came like in the picture and it lasted very long i already used one will buy more</li>
            <li> I could not believe this item was listed as the 95th item for toys for 5 to 7 year old children.  I contacted Amazon&#x27;s customer service line, and Queen told me she could not do anything until a review was written on this project.  Seriously, I cannot believe a company like Amazon is promoting smoking to young children.  And I could not believe that the customer service representatives did not care enough to look into this situation.  Amazon, you should be ashamed of this.  I have been an Amazon customer for several years, but now I am embarrassed to use this site.  I have shared the link showing this toy as a recommended toy for 5 o 7 year old kids with my friends on facebook and I have sent this information to CNN and Fox News.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that this product is in the 5-7yr old toy section. Seriously?!?!? I have always let my child come on this site to check out toys and show me what she&#x27;d like for Christmas or her birthday, so that I can read reviews and decide, but if you are going to try to sell this type of product to my YOUNG child, I think we will start shopping other places for toys. Very disappointed that such a successful company would use this type of tactic to get people to buy products.</li>
            <li> This puff cigarette is really cool. It looks and smokes like a cigarette. Even tho i&#x27;m not smoker, the smoke looks so real. This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> i just used these things to screw around with my friends and they worked they are kinda cool till they run out</li>
            <li> Love how it appears to light up and puffs smoke when air is blown into it.</li>
            <li> This product is totally innappropriate and sends a very bad message to our your people who we are suppose to protect! Smoking is very bad for ones health and it STINKS! I am shocked to see this product advertised for children.</li>
            <li> Compared to other fake cigarettes (puff or not), these are flimsy and nearly fall apart when you pick them up, much less put them in your mouth.  Baby powder is used (quite poorly) for the puff effect.  It comes out in clumps, not a puff.  There are much better and realistic-feeling fake cigarettes out there.</li>
            <li> Its pretty disgusting that they Should advertise these as a CHILD&#x27;s toy. Maybe for high school PLAYS, but there should be no reason why it should be in a 6 year old&#x27;s mouth! Even if it is pretend and fake. I am very unhappy to see this here. THIS should not be a TOY for children!</li>
            <li> Extremely realistic yet was too wide to properly fit the standard sized cigarette holder used with Halloween costume. After cramming it in there, it did not puff anymore.</li>
            <li> John Madachik needs to lighten up a bit before he dies of a stroke. I suppose that he has never realized that many theatres use fake cigarettes, some of which are pretty elaborate. This is no different. Get off your soap box John.</li>
            <li> cheap, came apart in the package</li>
            <li> If what you want is toy cigarettes that look like the real thing yet don&#x27;t need the actual puff, this&#x27;ll work for you. However, the powder works very badly. I could barely even get &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; at all. They do however look alright, and would work for a play so long as actually blowing smoke is not a concern.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I guess I expected a little more but 4 stars is about right. The cigarette looks realistic but the fake smoke is more like powder coming out of it. When they say blow don&#x27;t suck, you can suck but if you suck more than a little some of the powder can get on your tongue and you can wipe it off with something. The powder is not toxic but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend inhaling it deeply like real smoke (not that its a good idea either but the powder is more solid and will probably stick too). Overall, I defintely think you could trick most people and its safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. if the \\&quot;smoke\\&quot; is not coming out anymore, you need to clean the end because its has holes for the smoke to come out and they are blocked.</li>
            <li> Fake cigarettes and cigars should not be offered as a toy for 5-7 year olds.   I&#x27;m very disappointed in Amazon. Although this clearly comes from a third party vendor, amazon should screen any offers and remove any inappropriate ones.</li>
            <li> We used this during our production of &#x27;Hello Dolly&#x27; and it worked great - a good period piece.</li>
            <li> although they were not expensive they were totally cheaply made.  Fell apart when using (blowing smoke out of them)..</li>
            <li> They might have been usable if they hadn&#x27;t been mailed in an envelop so they came crushed. Might have been able to squeeze them back into shape but they were too flimsy. A real cigarette with a spot of glue and red glitter would have been better. The powder is used up fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great prop for any theater production or an addition to a costume.  This was just what my noir detective costume needed!  Looks incredibly realistic and people will mistake it for the real thing, especially from a distance.</li>
            <li> These look very real and were a lot of fun.  I tried them out in my office and everyone wanted some.  I passed them out to several family members and we started puffing when dessert was served in a no-smoking area.  The the rest of the family and the waiter almost choked. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They also worked to keep others from pushing my friend&#x27;s daughter to smoke.</li>
            <li> These cigarettes are so great, I would give them infinity stars.  They have tons of smoke puffing out they look completely real.  I would rate this for $1,000,000.  This is the awsomist toy I ever had, even though I know no one should smoke.  This should not be used by kids who want to smoke. My mom doesn&#x27;t like smoking.  My grandma ordered these.  There are other practical jokes that are very awesome, also.  These were used in a play and they should have all the parents have them as infinity stars.  These were great to be found at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> These are awesome for movies or plays, but they don&#x27;t last long at all. Basically, they&#x27;re a one time use, so thankfully, they&#x27;re cheap enough to stock up on. If you need something that lasts for more than a half hour, these aren&#x27;t gonna cut it. Can&#x27;t complain though because of the price.</li>
            <li> Most of the dust fell out in shipping because it wasn&#x27;t packaged in a box or anything. Just loose. That&#x27;s disappointing and the presentation was lacking. Still puffs for fake cigarettes so it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> No packaging whatsoever.  No paper label as shown in the picture and no plastic bag to hold the cigarettes.  I received two fake cigarettes thrown into a mailing envelope. How many people touched them before they were sent?  I&#x27;m supposed to put them in my mouth?  I don&#x27;t think so.  At least real cigarettes are properly wrapped.</li>
            <li> These cigarettes were a perfect match for an Audrey Hepburn Halloween costume.  They looked real and were durable all throughout the night.</li>
            <li> QUICK SHIPPING AND GREAT SERVICE!I USED THIS PRODUCT DURING AN ONSTAGE PERFORMANCE IN FRONT OF ABOUT 400 PEOPLE AND EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS REAL! MY MONEY WAS WELL SPENT FOR SURE!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a Chicago gangster themed murder mystery party. Each of our guests got one and these fake cigarettes were really a hit! They are very realistic and we \\&quot;puffed\\&quot; on them all night. You actually have to blow through them to get the fake smoke and all of the ones I ordered worked great. My friends all kept theirs and one of my friends was going to try to trick her husband with hers when she got home. They are that realistic. We loved them!</li>
            <li> The powder was coming out into package.  This may have possibly been done due to flattened during shipment.  Overall very realistic tho</li>
            <li> It WAS pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> They are what they are - fake cigs.  Sometimes I fool myself that I am smoking a real cigarette (quit after smoking for 20 years).  Give it a try. Maybe it will work for you too.</li>
            <li> It fooled a lot of people. I had people wondering when I started smoking</li>
            <li> Cool, fooled my parents</li>
            <li> I am using these for a college play they make good props.  They fall apart sometimes so I ordered a few more for rehearsal.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a Halloween costume, and they were perfect!  By blowing into the cigarette, a small puff of \\&quot;powder\\&quot; comes out, looking just like real smoke.  The tip has orange colored foil beneath the \\&quot;ash\\&quot;, so it really looks lit.  Very convincing!</li>
            <li> These puff cigarettes are the perfect prop for a theatrical production where the script calls for the actor to smoke onstage and either the actor doesn&#x27;t smoke, is too young to really smoke or fire marshall regulations prohibit smoking. The cigarettes look realistic. care should be taken to keep them off stage in a sturdy box  when not in use to protect them as they could be crushed rather easily, but if the actor and prop master takes proper care , one should easily last the run of a 3 week production.</li>
            <li> Was in a local play set in the 1930&#x27;s.  used these for a prop.  exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> cigarette looked very realistic and everyone commented how real it looked ... great prop or halloween accessory would definatley recommend</li>
            <li> Bought these to go with my Cruela deVille costume for a work function.  Ordered them at the last minute with hopes of receiving them before the party.  To my surprise, they were in my mailbox the next day!  Would shop with this seller again for sure!  The cigarettes puffed smoke and some people thought they were real.  Worked out great with the cigarette holder.</li>
            <li> These cigarettes are so real looking that everyone at the party had to take a second look.  I set one down on the table to take a photo, and a friend reached over to pick it up so that it would not burn.  Very realistic cherry sparkles on the end.</li>
            <li> It was kind of realistic, but wears out after a while. Loved them while they lasted. Would recommend getting  more.</li>
            <li> Great.  Everything came on time and was what I expected.</li>
            <li> The product was recieved very timely.  The puff cigarrettes were used in a high school play written and directed by students.  They were very realistic and the smoke could be seen in the back of the audience.  The play was a western and the product was better than expected.</li>
            <li> This product was received very quick; however, they were completely busted when I opened the packaging. There was white powder everywhere and the fake cigarettes were completely flat. Can&#x27;t use at all and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These look like they are real cigs and lit! Works great with costume! Not sure if they are supposed to smoke, but still serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> People many die of smoking however the only that could make that better is you join them in dying.</li>
            <li> They were like paper thin and did not blow any smoke, these where cheap and I had to throw them away a huge disappointment</li>
            <li> They were very inexpensive. So i do know you get what you pay for. they fell apart and the powder was everywhere</li>
            <li> Good but u have to fix it all of the powder was at the top so I had to take out the red thing and the cotton and put the power in the red thing then put the cotton back on and then put the red thing on and there it worked</li>
            <li> I love this, great for cosplays. It works for awhile but oh well they are cheap i can buy more&lt;br /&gt;i have no idea why some people wrote bad reviews. I guess i was the lucky one. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it, better then the expensive ones :)</li>
            <li> This is really really effective, especially if you bought this for mainly trolling or planking. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this can literally get you in trouble , especially if you&#x27;re a teenager or even worse, a kid. It looks so realistic and believable. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s durable because it last for about four days or a week or so. Don&#x27;t have high hopes about it always effective because I got one that was defective and didn&#x27;t work, the good thing was it came in TWOs rather than singles.i would recommend this for pranks but don&#x27;t go extreme when using for pranks, you can really get in trouble.</li>
            <li> Used these for a stage production and they worked well.  They look realistic and take away any stress of real smoking on stage.  Especially useful when it is suppose to be a teenager smoking.</li>
            <li> Okay, I got this for my costume and it really works. They came in a little damaged but they still work. They really pulled it together and they almost look real!</li>
            <li> I got these to go with my flapper costume. I thought they were neat, however since I was chasing my son around all night I forgot to use them. But I think they were a great buy.</li>
            <li> They will fit fine in my cigarette holder and make the outfit a hit for the roaring 20&#x27;s outfit. Thanks</li>
            <li> This was ordered to play a trick on someone, to make him think they were real.  It worked, so they served their purpose.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to fool anyone with these. They look so fake. I figured I should have done better by rolling some paper and putting some talc inside. It could&#x27;ve been more cost-efficient.</li>
            <li> My son loves these, got them for his rockstar birthday party! The lower rating is because the were flattened when they arrived. When I tried to round them out again, the paper came undone. I am going to try and make them round and glue them back together!</li>
            <li> For me, 1 out of 5 blows would produce small amounts of smoke. Cheap and messy. Realistic from a distance and it truly feels like a cigarette, but up close, is very obviously not.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for something better, but I didn&#x27;t waste my money trying for it. Go ahead and buy if you are curious.</li>
            <li> these are amazing. I had my 9 year old son use them and walk around or hang his hand out the window.  It was HYSTERICAL.  We even had a mom threaten to call the police! The &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; faded pretty quickly but the &amp;#34;flame&amp;#34; is a metallic red and is VERY believable.</li>
            <li> Great prop for my costume. Fake smoke adds to the effect. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a cigarette prop.</li>
            <li> i also purchased a cigarette holder and put them in it, the puff cigarettes worked great, people were surprised, they thought, hey you cant smoke in here.</li>
            <li> When you blow out it looks like real smoke the look very realistic, funny, fun, great to trick your friends/family.</li>
            <li> These puff cigaretters are good props that will fool people if you take a picture with them they do come out with puff that is like</li>
            <li> The cigarettes were smashed and unable to be used.</li>
            <li> I attempted to use these for a photography project as I was not allowed to use herbal or nicotine cigarettes. When they arrived, they were flattened. I found that they were more flimsy than I originally thought and did not look very realistic. The ends (the part that&#x27;s &amp;#34;lit&amp;#34;) are flat and there isn&#x27;t a lot of puff. After one or two blows into the cigarette, there&#x27;s no powder left in them. They&#x27;d be ok for parties I guess.</li>
            <li> These cigarettes look so real! I have blown at least 20 puffs on one of the cigarettes and it still hasn&#x27;t run out of powder! They both work, and I&#x27;ve pranked quite a few people with it. For only $1 they&#x27;re pretty good! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> If you blow through it then like powder comes out so i wouldn&#x27;t really recommend on puffing it</li>
            <li> A lot of the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; was rubbed off but besides that these were pretty decent! They got the job done. :)  They work GREAT in the cigarette holder I&#x27;ll be using for my costume and they&#x27;re easy to get the powder out of to look like you&#x27;re smoking. They&#x27;re realistic enough, it&#x27;s pretty obvious close up but I&#x27;m sure at a distance they look muuuch more real.</li>
            <li> were ok, smoke didnt last too long</li>
            <li> When I received this the post office that I had it sent to told me that whoever sent the package only had a stamp of .48 cents on it and the weight required a total of $2.00 so on top of paying for the product and supposedly receiving &amp;#34;FREE&amp;#34; shipping I had to also pay the difference or the post office would send it back!! And then there&#x27;s the actual product. They look OK made of paper so they don&#x27;t really feel or look like the picture. and you cant see the smoke out of it!! If it was possible they would receive 0 stars!! 1 is to many!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t spend your money on this cheap toy gag prank its to cheap to work and its dumb buy hey I did buy it lol</li>
            <li> Well first I will say dont suck it blow I suck it a bunch of powder when in my mouth so later on that day I prank my dad and he slapped it out of my hand and when crazy when I told him it was fake his face turn red with laughter this is a cheap and awesome prank so buy it to trick people</li>
            <li> its so stupid i cannot even explain im very mad at how long it took and it is useless first cigarette broke</li>
            <li> Halloween accessory.  Hate real cigarettes</li>
            <li> Does not look realistic, even from a distance, theater crew ended up making our own props.</li>
            <li> Good price, bought these cigarettes to use with a cigarette holder with a Cruella De-vil costume. They worked well, when you blow into them, they blow out smoke!</li>
            <li> They showed up very quickly, and I&#x27;ve fooled a lot of people with them.  They totally resemble the real thing.</li>
            <li> Really cool! Actually does look like you are smoking!</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly which was nice! Needed them for a costume. Only reason why I gave 4 stars is it&#x27;s hard to blow into and make it smoke a lot. Smoke barely comes out but it worked for what I needed.</li>
            <li> I needed these for my Halloween costume; I went as a mob wive. I couldn&#x27;t believe how real they looked!</li>
            <li> These puff cigarettes serve their purpose for our 1920s themed bridal shower. They fit perfectly in our cigarette holders! I would definitely buy them again</li>
            <li> They looked soo fake it couldn&#x27;t even trick a drunk person</li>
            <li> They look extremely fake! They are not held together by anything and fell apart as soon as I took them out. And also the smoke is barely visible! I have ordered other fake ones from a different company and everything was better the quality was amazing! They also get all nasty when you put it in your mouth!</li>
            <li> This sucked. Looks fake and was a waste of money. It looked like it took 2 minutes to put together</li>
            <li> the bag was filled with powder, didn&#x27;t blow smoke, \\&quot;ember\\&quot; tip looked very fake, the cigerettes were crushed...it might work from a distance but not useful for my purposes. product was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> So much fun.  Used with a faux cigarette holder and loved fake smoke effect.  Exactly what I wanted for the costume.</li>
            <li> this sucks!!!! when i bought them i thought they looked cool but when i tryed them they sucked!! dont buy these</li>
            <li> the cigarettes were flat from shipment</li>
            <li> These are cool&lt;br /&gt;Fooled a couple people</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t quite look like really cigarettes at all but for the fun, I am not one to ruin it. Okay. Well, they do look like cigarettes but the fake smoke looks like a joke. LOL</li>
            <li> I ordered the cigarette holder as well and the cigarettes would not fit into the holder so I didn&#x27;t use them.  Both were a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a silly gag. i think i&#x27;m gonna send you all a pack of onion gum and a whooppee cushion, or something.</li>
            <li> My niece went on her prom with a Great Gatsby theme and she loved the cigarettes</li>
            <li> Overall this product was good, Did what it said and was great. Unfortunately, it took forever to arrive, there was only two and they weren&#x27;t packaged the best, But overall this product was pretty good.</li>
            <li> good, but not much smoke</li>
            <li> I bought these shortly after the Ohio smoking ban and boy did I get some people good. The looks of unknowing people was classic. It did often get confused with E-Cigs though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all and the powder goes into your mouth and it is so nasty. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!! I thought it was going to be better but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> kinda addictive i do not like them.</li>
            <li> These fake cigarettes were super realistic. Although the product does not state whether or not the powder is dangerous to inhale. Quite frankly, there&#x27;s no safety between the powder and your mouth. It is very easy to accidentally ingest. Also, once the end gets wet, it immediately shrivels up and is not able to use again. I have to say other than that, I tricked my sister with this in no time.</li>
            <li> hardly any powder comes out when you blow its not that good but good for the price ps you only get 4</li>
            <li> Not at all what i was expecting.</li>
            <li> love it and cheap price</li>
            <li> Not nearly enough of a puff for anyone to notice. I ended up getting rid of these for a real cigarette.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Halloween costume, I was a Flapper. I put these in the end of the cigarette holder I got, and it looked perfect with the puffs of smoke; which I didn&#x27;t know it did that when I bought them. It was a nice surprise, just make sure you don&#x27;t breath in like I did. :)</li>
            <li> I bought these for a Halloween costume and the cigarettes worked great as they puffed for hours! The packaging that they were shipped in was not great so I got lucky that they were not crushed. They basically came in an envelope with no padding but the price can&#x27;t be beat and shipping was really fast! You just never no if the ones in the store actually create the puff or not (most don&#x27;t) so I was happy with my purchase &amp; product!</li>
            <li> Great addition to my outfit for a Roaring Twenties themed party!</li>
            <li> Arrived smashed, did not function properly, that is did not &amp;#34;blow smoke&amp;#34;. I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I recideved my product in 2 days and they&#x27;re awesome! you blow into them and POWDER SMOKE comes out! They&#x27;re tremendous! Da only bad thing about it is, after about 20 blows, the POWDER SMOKE will run out! So they&#x27;re just 1.14, get you aboud 5!</li>
            <li> I purchased these puff cigarettes to use as I posed as a nurse for halloween at a nite club.  My trick was to give these to the anyone I doomed to be a psych patient.  So they were very convenient because the club is a non smoking facility.    Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works really well. Looks so realistic. I troll my friends with it all the time&lt;br /&gt;The smoke is easy to see</li>
            <li> This product was shipped in an envelope!!! Needless to say i couldn&#x27;t use it for my play! Instead i had to make my own and roll a paper cigarette and color it! The packet was full of powder everywhere and the cigarette was flat. It would have cost more to return idiots next time put it in a box!</li>
            <li> They came smashed.in Package. Didn&#x27;t use yet. We&#x27;ll see if they don&#x27;t Puff. Purchased for a Gatsby Wedding. Cigarette holder.</li>
            <li> This is a good prank but you can&#x27;t really over use it or else the cotton inside starts to get moist from saliva so i would say just take about 10,15 blows so it dosen&#x27;t run out so fast</li>
            <li> Looked real however, did not work well at all, made one or two puff and that was about it, tried and tried but cold not make it puff again.</li>
            <li> These arrived completely flattened, but I was able to carefully work them back into shape and they did &amp;#34;puff&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
            <li> These are very authentic looking cigarettes and I use them as part of my ashtray collection display.  I do not have much luck getting the puff effect, but the ash section is especially realistic.  I have fooled many people.</li>
            <li> Love these fake Cigarettes. They went well with my Cruella DeVil costume. They looked real and so I had a blast inhaling and pushing the fake smoke out of these. AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> They look like real cigarettes and the puffs are cool.  You only have so many puffs so choose wisely when you puff.  I used them for a 60&#x27;s party and they were a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> Great cigarette prop for variety of costumes.  don&#x27;t inhale tho!  This is meant to be puffed out like powdery dust to look like smoke.  very clever.</li>
            <li> this product came squished and was flat. it barely worked and you could hardly see the smoke.And it only worked for 1 puff and thats it. Do not buy this product!!!!</li>
            <li> They work as advertised for a number of &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34; blowing outward.  Don&#x27;t expect anything amazing but they can be fun to use.</li>
            <li> these cigarettes look so real thank goodness these are so much mire healthier my husband just quick smoking he said they feel so good just having someyhing to hold in his fingers and put in his mouth without the side effects</li>
            <li> I got tons of compliments on how real it looked.  It worded very well with the jeweled cigarette holder to give me the 20&#x27;s look for my event.</li>
            <li> cute gag gift i dont smoke but husband thought it was real and got a good laugh</li>
            <li> Fun item for a 60&#x27;s party</li>
            <li> I had bought these from the state fair a few years ago and thats the reason I bought these.  These did not work.  There is supposed to be fake smoke that comes out when you blow on them and nothing happened.  Not worth the time or money to return.  $2 wasted.</li>
            <li> Um, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this.. The shipping was super crappy, they put the cigarettes in an envelope and they were squished and a bunch of powder was at the bottom of the bag. Ehh, I don&#x27;t know. I formed them back to shape with my fingers. It is a good product, it&#x27;s just the way they get shipped, that&#x27;s what I disliked....</li>
            <li> There okay not as good as id like</li>
            <li> Just awful not happy bad very bad service. I order this and it came crushed I called customer service no help. So I got in touch on the 5th time they sent out replacements and all the replacements was the same crushed. I told the thin bag with no protection is awful and all orders is damage. So I told them to send it in a small box. But they paid me no mind so I kept getting this with no Change so I just gave up. AWFUL never will order from them again. Bad service.</li>
            <li> Packaging was very poor, offering no protection for the two cigarettes in the plastic pouch.  Also, the tracking # on the front of the package had been &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; out...looks like someone used a utility knife to remove it.  This left the contents exposed.  I have not used them yet...they were purchased as part of a &amp;#34;flapper&amp;#34; costume I will be sporting at a convention in April.  Hopefully, they work...at least they will look real in the cigarette holder I purchased.</li>
            <li> I think thee are the coolest prank things I ever had I love it! Me and my friend had a ball with then!</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THEY REALLY LIT UP LIKE THE ONES A FRIEND OF MINE HAS. HIS ALSO PUFFS SMOKE. THESE ARE CHEAP AND TIPPED WITH ORANGE FOIL. DON&#x27;T BOTHER!</li>
            <li> I was mistaken and thought these actually did a fake puff or were the ones that light up.... They are not.  Not bad though for the price.</li>
            <li> Well, so far so good, although it would&#x27;ve been nice to get some instructions... also its seems a little odd that it says &amp;#34;trick your friends&amp;#34; on the label but that doesn&#x27;t have to do with the product. Either way, shipped quickly and came just in time.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a costume prop and they were great. A lot people didn&#x27;t realize they were fake until they looked at it closely. It held up well for all the parties I went to. One of them broke, but that was only because I accidentally shut it in the car door. Oops!</li>
            <li> I used these as part of a WWII soldier costume and got TONS of compliments. At one party, three bar tenders asked me to \\&quot;put that out\\&quot; because they look so real. They&#x27;re a little fragile, but otherwise fantastic!</li>
            <li> waste of time and money. I cant be to mad didn&#x27;t pay that much for them but they didn&#x27;t work i put a little bit of baby powder in it and it worked a little bit. They look nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> When I recieved these cigarettes the powder had already all fallen out, what a waste of money i have to say</li>
            <li> Looked realistic, but did not have any puff in them at all.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Poorly done.</li>
            <li> Very cool prop. I use it with a particular card trick and it works flawlessly every time.&lt;br /&gt;The kids are fascinated. Thank you again</li>
            <li> They look real. It will be a perfect accessory for my Halloween costume. They arrived slightly smashed but that is fine with me.</li>
            <li> Package came and both cigarettes were damaged. Therefore, neither worked appropriately. Very disappointed in this as they seem to be a great alternative to real cigarettes for costumes.</li>
            <li> A++++++++++++. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Yea why did I get these? I coulda got real cigs</li>
            <li> Pros:Looks Realistic, feels realistic, and cheap. That&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:When you blow only a small amount of &#x27;smoke&#x27; is seen. And if you puff back to back &#x27;smoke&#x27; won&#x27;t come out. You&#x27;ll have to wait a while to puff again to see a small amount of &#x27;smoke&#x27;. Doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish that more &#x27;smoke&#x27; would come out in order to really fool your friends or to have fun!! But you really do get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Looking at the picture, you see the cigarettes in a nice little package.&lt;br /&gt;What I received looked nothing like how it looks there, they were lose in the packaging it was shipped in. It&#x27;s like someone took them out of a bigger container and just sent them. I wanted to give them as a gag gift but I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re sanitary, I don&#x27;t know who handled them. If I had known they weren&#x27;t packaged, I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely terrible and did NOT work as promised! I bought these fake cigarettes for a short film I was making and they were ridiculous. The only reason I did not attempt to return them for a refund is because I figured it would cost me more to send back than it was worth. It was a lie however, when the seller promised that puffing on these fake cigarettes would put out the allusion of real smoke. Seller said that these would look like the real thing. LIE, LIE, LIE!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased these cigarettes to be used in a play where smoking was called for but we were in a location where we couldn&#x27;t actually smoke. They worked great for what we needed them for. The only probably we had is that they only lasted for about 3-5 rehearsals before they no longer &amp;#34;smoked&amp;#34;. I wish they would last longer, but they are inexpensive enough that it doesn&#x27;t cost much to get replacements.</li>
            <li> This was for Halloween; the red foil made it look like it was lit and the puff of smoke was fun for sure.</li>
            <li> would be fun silly gift, but unfortunately they were not properly packed so they were crushed to the point that I did not even give them as part of the present.</li>
            <li> I choose to give the rating of 3 stars because of the packaging.  They two puffs came in what looks like wax paper ..they were just thrown in the envelope..</li>
            <li> fun cigarettes for our party</li>
            <li> This pack of 2 fake cigarettes exceeded my expectations! I used them for a costume party and they looked incredibly realistic, with the smoke coming out of the end and the red shimmer to make them look like they glow. I used them for several hours (not continuously) and there is still more \\&quot;smoke\\&quot; to go! My dad borrowed one for a bit and his friends thought it was real... well worth the cheap price for a few laughs :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However - they are fragile, so be careful with them. I knocked some of the powder off the end and it didn&#x27;t look quite so realistic anymore.</li>
            <li> it looks real and it would work great for a play or a costume but does not act real. also the company will harass you if you say anything negative about you. if you want this for a play or costume then sure get it but if you want it as a prank then dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> good enough for a halloween party -</li>
            <li> Even though I did read most reviews about how bad they were I didn&#x27;t listen to them.. I recieved it quickly and it did have free shipping , but other than that they sucked. The powder is all out in the bag, and it get all in your mouth grody.. ~</li>
            <li> They arrived in good condition, however, they did not puff, like advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought these to fit into a cigarette holder for a theme party.  They were fantastic and arrived ahead of the scheduled date.  Would order from National Party Supply again in the future.</li>
            <li> We bought the &#x27;cigarettes&#x27;&#x27; for a masquerade party!!  My daughter went as Cruella DeVil.  It made the costume with the cigarette holder that we got also!!  They really smoke and look amazingly real!!</li>
            <li> There good for prancing but if your a student you could get in serious trouble. I would recommend this to somebody who likes to prank people not someone who isn&#x27;t one.</li>
            <li> They look real but you have to blow into them instead of suck the smoke out but people thought I was really smoking and I was going to use them for pranks and all but I decided not to even though they work pretty good but if you want to see some of my pranks on youtube I just started and my channel is called prankmediaful I would love it if you guys could check us out please and thank you.</li>
            <li> I guess for.the price, they werent bad. They came flat and most of the puff leaked into the package. I got about 3 good puffs out of all cigarettes, so may spend a little more next time</li>
            <li> went to a 1920&#x27;s party. Went very well with my costume and character. Nice not to have the real smoke or smell of cigarettes.</li>
            <li> My friends thought that i started smoking ....i really got them fool....This product looks like a  real cigarettes and smoke does come out.</li>
            <li> Looks real &amp; lasts a long time. Great purchase with no risk to your health!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Run out fast and don&#x27;t even look real</li>
            <li> it was nice but I did not stay in the holder very well</li>
            <li> I used these for a final exam monologue in my theatre class, they looked realistic and sold my character, my only problem was that it was a bit difficult to manage to get the &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; to come out of the cigarette, but after caring them around long enough, and having to reshape them multiple times, I got the smoke to come out easily.</li>
            <li> Package came and was covered with the powder on the inside, otherwise it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Costume, so fun and really all together made a great 20&#x27;s gal.</li>
            <li> Ok, these being so cheap, they&#x27;re not the greatest thing ever. They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do. It&#x27;s a look a like cigarette and has some cotton inside to hold the white powder that gives that smoke effect when you blow. Fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a custom party and for performances - it does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a smoker so this was a good replacement of a real cigarette.</li>
            <li> These were pretty funny to have around at a party. The orange part did make them look a little redneck, so I cut off those parts to make them regular, white cigs. They looked great, especially when attaching one at the end of a smoking wand. The &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; was pretty easy to see and lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li> These cigarettes are amazing- I had people second looking all night, the puffing part looks so real- definitely an awesome accessory for my mad men costume!</li>
            <li> a little squished but I was able to mostly unsquish, good for a murder mystery dinner party!</li>
            <li> will buy more, good product, very detail and presentable. my friends love it and adorable everyone love it when they see it.</li>
            <li> DOESNT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS IN THE \\&quot;KIDS TOYS\\&quot; AGES 5-7! I AM IRATELY CONFUSED AS TO WHO AND WHY THERE ARE STARS. NOTE:PLURAL...\\&quot;STARSSSS!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> You just blow chalk dust out of the front it seems like and it has a shiny metallic piece of plastic on the end to make other light around you seem like it&#x27;s lit by reflection. Scares people around you for a second, but as they really look at it, they know it&#x27;s not a real cigarette.</li>
            <li> a bit smooshed but well enough ;3</li>
            <li> When I got this item it was all smushed up and it was just waste of money so don&#x27;t buy this item</li>
            <li> i used these for a photo shoot because actual cigarettes were way too expensive. these look just like cigarrettes and got the job done.</li>
            <li> Looks very believable but doesn&#x27;t give out any &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> Good prop item. My son&#x27;s theater class recently had a stage play where he played as the &amp;#34;modern-day prodigal son&amp;#34; and had to use fake vice props. This fake smoke-puffing cigarettes really helped him pull off the character he played.</li>
            <li> Its lame its just powder in paper you cant suck only blows its useless.. I don&#x27;t recommend to anyone. waste of money</li>
            <li> These puff cigarettes look real and puff smoke for a long time.  They were a nice addition to may already cool costume.</li>
            <li> I loved tricking my family and friends. They looked so real. The only hard thing for me was to get smoke out</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that they do not work. Do not buy them they are a waste of money I WOULD NOT SUGGEST BUYING THESE TO ANYONE!</li>
            <li> Not too many smoke waves that come out</li>
