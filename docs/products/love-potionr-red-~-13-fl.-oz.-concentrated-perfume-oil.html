            <li>So nice!!</li>
            <li>This scent is just so gorgeous!  </li>
            <li>When I apply the oil it warms up on my skin it blooms beautifully over time –</li>
            <li>Just absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>LOL).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Vanilla infused cinnamon sugared butter is what I call this delicious smelling sexy treat.</li>
            <li>I went on a date with told me that I smelled so good he wanted to eat me.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I gave it a benefit of a doubt and tried it on, thinking maybe others might like it and also thinking about one of the product reviewers here who typed this on her headline &amp;#34;SO GOOD</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, with that out of the way, let me say, this stuff is as good as people say.  </li>
            <li>#34;Oh my God, what smells so good?  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that will have the guys drooling (or if you just want to smell good for you)</li>
            <li>The best way i can describe the sent is a sweet cinnamon chocolate candy,  but here is where the problem (or maybe the fun comes in, i hope to to put this to the test in April when I get up with my college sweetheart, LOL), the scent is SCRONG!!!!</li>
            <li>They also included free samples which are all so good that I want all of them!</li>
            <li>Hilarious!  </li>
            <li>guys love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>this is probably the best beginner&#x27;s perfume to try from LP and was one of my first loves.</li>
            <li>The scent is sexy!</li>
            <li>Okay people, its me Leapy again, with another review!  </li>
            <li>This scent will make you feel sexy!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re doin?&amp;#34; I love it!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and rub the perfume oil on me in the hot pressure points that the instruction card advised, and while i think the perfume smelled amazing, i was not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li>It is just amazing.  </li>
            <li>Let me reiterate, i think the scent smells amazing, but its just SCRONG to my nose, and the reason why it is SCRONG to my nose, is because even though i am the the one that is wearing the perfume, ultimatley the scent is NOT for my nose.  </li>
            <li>That work together creating an AMAZING scent.  </li>
            <li>The vanilla nicely balances the cinnamon and deeper notes.</li>
            <li>guess that&#x27;s why the vanilla is so nice</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m delighted I found Love Potion Fragrances online.</li>
            <li>Their whole line is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Either way, give it time to warm on your skin</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful scent and has only gotten me good comments from those around me.</li>
            <li>It is very strong and long-lasting (hence the perceived &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; price for the size)</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments from guys when I wear this product - and I love it!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s warm and sexy and</li>
            <li>ideal date-night scent, or really for anytime you want to add some Va Va Voom to your day.&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorites from LPs signature line.</li>
            <li>this ages beautifully, if it doesn&#x27;t seem to suit you on first try give it some time and try it again, these scents are magic truly and can transform into some of your favorites if you give them a chance.</li>
            <li>Even applied very lightly seems to garner attention.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i love the scent</li>
            <li>I did notice that not too many females are attracted to the sent; I&#x27;ve had comments that I smell like incense.  </li>

            <li>Pachouli and amber resin mostly.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is interesting.</li>
            <li>Well, except from my spouse, but everyone else likes it :)</li>
            <li>I bought Love Potion:</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li>It turns heads not only because it is a great scent with good throw, but also because it is SEXY.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Sexy, ripped, untamable lumberjack with a restless soul and a wandering eye.  </li>
            <li>:-))</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get this straight, the scent smells great</li>
            <li>It just kept smelling better and better.  </li>
            <li>I always get compliments galore when i wear this, but my favorite reaction was when I was standing in line in the store.</li>
            <li>I do have emphasize that this perfume really id so much more than cinnamon however.</li>
            <li>and this smells like anything but cheap smelling!.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Cougar or LFM :)</li>
            <li>I dabbed it on and enjoyed the depth of the scent.</li>
            <li>good God, did it work wonders on him ;)  </li>
            <li>My beautiful bride wears this for &#x27;special occasions&#x27; because she knows how much it affects me.  </li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li>This perfume is more like a cheap incense from the street corners of NYC.</li>
            <li>and you might be surprised at just how great this one is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will just melt right into your skin creating a warm, sexxxxy scent.  </li>
            <li>LP Red is sexy and long-lasting, it is no wonder why this is one of LPMP’s most popular and well-loved scents!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I would like the scent because I am picky with fragrances and do not like strong scents.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want it to be too strong.  </li>
            <li>So, I highly recommend being cautious where you go while wearing this, because it really isn&#x27;t fair.  </li>
            <li>Normally I like to smell whatever I&#x27;m going to be buying,  but the reviews were really good</li>
            <li>The vanilla,dark sugars,amber and cinnamon mix to make this a sweet and sexy scent.</li>
            <li>Potion arrived in a beautiful bag along with several free samples.</li>
            <li>This is a very hot, spicy scent from Love Potions&#x27; signature fragrance line.  </li>
            <li>It is sensuously rich with sweet, elegant vanilla, what I think is brown sugar, woods and resins.</li>
            <li>: Red is great for 99%-100% of people, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>but the cinnamon is really light</li>
            <li>Then it melds with the spicy scent of cinnamon and the smooth amber and resins.  </li>
            <li>This smells like cheap incense sold in streets, like another another reviewer wrote.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and creamy with some spice as well.  </li>
            <li>, you get some free samples, and free shipping on one order per month.  </li>
            <li>I am seeing that a couple of people have said in their reviews that this smells of cheap incense.</li>
            <li>I do not feel that  I would classify it as either incensey or cheap.</li>
            <li>Then I wear it to my yoga class because it was not strong but smells so delicious.  </li>
            <li>I should have lipstick on LOL) just like the other Love Potions</li>
            <li>~ Extraordinary aphrodisiac, inspires happiness, playfulness, sexual arousal, lust, and is physically vitalizing, familial sense memories, soothing, nurturing, comforting.&lt;br /&gt;AMBER ~ Fertility, luck, riches, sensuality.&lt;br /&gt;PATCHOULI</li>
            <li>The ingredient combo in this works really well together to create a slinky, sexy scent that makes me feel super feminine and confident.</li>
            <li>This is the first ever scent i tried from Love Potion.</li>
            <li>It was love at first smell.  </li>
            <li>This scent was one of the first Love Potion scents I tried.</li>
            <li>The sweet scent in the beginning is so luscious and rich.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this scent, and I can&#x27;t believe how dead sexy it is!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this often, but it&#x27;s my go-to for special occasions, no doubt.  </li>
            <li>Makes you smell good enough to eat!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>on my skin leaving the sweet scent of vanilla lingering all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Smells like cinnamon sugar and good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s candy sweet</li>
            <li>This is a very fun scent to wear and the reactions from men are fun to watch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been  loyal LP consumer ever since.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, there are options to add pheromones (although this fragrance works TREMENDOUSLY on its own!)  </li>
            <li>Wear with caution because this one is HOT!</li>
            <li>Exceptional experience especially for a first time customer.</li>
            <li>that I was mesmerizing.</li>
            <li>&quot; (especially with the copulins added), this is a perfume you DO NOT WEAR for your OWN pleasure if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>As it warmed on my skin it changed from more vanilla-cinnamon and apricot to a deep rich amber, cinnamon and vanilla.</li>
            <li>That being said, the base of the fragrance has great vanilla notes, and is warm, sweet, and sexy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because I realized the instruction card was right</li>
            <li>The whole presentation made me feel special</li>
            <li>I know that&#x27;s certainly worked for me!</li>
            <li>~ Male sexual stimulation, passion, lust, healing, protection, energy, creativity, psychic powers.&lt;br /&gt;DARK</li>
            <li>First day of wearing the oil....</li>
            <li>The first time I try it on and went to the store...</li>
            <li>love the scent looking to get moor later on husband loves it .lasts</li>
            <li>Words can&#x27;t even describe the olfactory poetry that is Love Potion Red.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t know exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I came across Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie almost by accident and the first scent that caught my eye was LP Red.</li>
            <li>Love Potion Red is one of the first perfumes I bought (several years ago)from Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie, and to this day is still one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Not to mention my husband&#x27;s ;)</li>
            <li>This is not as exactly described by the reviewers here.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this, I bought it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only personally encountered one individual who didn&#x27;t care for this on me (but it was my best friend&#x27;s husband on a night we were all going out together, so no worries there.  </li>
            <li>i just received my perfume oil roll on of Love Potion Red.</li>
            <li>Each ingredient combines as supporting cast members to create an overall sophisticated scent that is divine.</li>
            <li>This was one of the first LP scents I ever tried after a friend recommended the line to me.  </li>
            <li>I applied sparingly at first as it was spicy and resiny</li>
            <li>The other thing I love about Love Potion perfumes in general is that they can be worn and enjoyed even by people who are generally bothered by perfume.</li>
            <li>It has a really lasting and lingering scent and smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore Love Potion Red.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much Magickal Perfumerie!</li>
            <li>After it dries down, I get a nice vanilla scent with hint of cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Red from the seller&#x27;s website after finding it first here on Amazon because someone mentioned additional options for customization were available on the website.  </li>
            <li>If the color red did somehow magically acquire an actual scent, I’m positive it would smell like Love Potion Red.</li>
            <li>people were talking to me, adoring me, and swooning.</li>
            <li>It starts off very spicy on my skin</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much because as it combines with your body warmth, the air fills with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went to a school/social PTA event and got unusual attention from some of the dads there.</li>
            <li>I really was looking forward to this.</li>
            <li>I can say this perfume oil is definetley something you would wear in an intimate setting.</li>
            <li>This scent is a most deliciously dark blend and always gets me compliments, not only on the fragrance but in the fact that it is so unique - exactly what I was hoping to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s tempered by amber and woods which tend to be some other favorite scents of mine by LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love Potion Red is exactly as its name describes, very, very red.</li>
            <li>and so far its REALLY working!</li>
            <li>At first i was surprised at all the attention I was getting and did not realize that this fragrance was working like</li>
            <li>The only reason I have not given this one a full four stars is my issue with cinnamon, and not the blend itself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and buttery with a dark vein of patchouli running through it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this perfume and everything else created by LPMP.  </li>
            <li>so I feel a little more dressed up when I wear it(Like</li>
            <li>well, when you go DIRECTLY to the seller&#x27;s website the products are about 5 dollars CHEAPER, and it comes with an option to add copulins ( i am not a chemist, but what i gathered the copulins is a natural occuring pheromone that attracts the opposite sex) for an additional 5 dollars, plus you get FREE SAMPLES with your order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In this fragrance that base is enhanced  with wonderful hot cinnamon and brown sugar notes.</li>
            <li>I feel dead sexy when I wear this.</li>
            <li>No, the previous word is NOT A TYPO, i meant what i said, the scent is SCRONG (it&#x27;s beyond strong), it  is very incensy smelling (think Egyptian Musk incense, but not the smell, but the INTENSITY of the smell), the instruction card also states that copulins (while a potent sexual pheremone, it stinks, and you need to allow 10 minutes for this perfume (if you get it with the copulins) to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also since these types of scents can change and deepen with age, if you do not like it right away, put it away for a while and try it at some later date.</li>
            <li>And the pretty beaded bag it comes in does make you feel a little like you bought an actual magic potion.  </li>
            <li>My significant other loves this as well, and he always seems to want to live in my neck when I wear this particular blend.</li>
            <li>get frequent compliments when I wear this!</li>
            <li>Men go wild over this perfume!</li>
            <li>They are rich and long lasting, but cling close to the skin and don&#x27;t leave obnoxious trails that gag everyone in your wake.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I suggest that anyone woman who wants to seduce that special guy or put the spice back in her romance with her signifigant other ORDER</li>
            <li>Since everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different as is our ability to pick out certain scents, I would say try it and see if you like it.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely suggest if someone&#x27;s starting out with trying fragrances from this company and wanted to know where to begin.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>but with a mature vibe</li>
            <li>me, I get a lot of vanilla, cinnamon, and resins and it reminds me of cool evenings by a fireplace getting cozy with your significant other.</li>
            <li>Since then, I order it directly from the company&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>It is sweet, complex, and drop dead sexy.</li>
            <li>I wore it to work when I first bought it, and the cleaning lady literally stopped what she was doing, walked over and leaned next to me to sniff deeply.  </li>
            <li>LP Red was at first a total departure than what I was used to in a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I believe that is where the \\&quot;power\\&quot; of this perfume will come from, and the raw, strong scent will make sense (to the opposite sex).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like you leave a trail in your wake, with people stopping, heads turning, and just general distraction when you walk by.  </li>
            <li>BUT at this price, it *is* quite reasonable and a very rich, gourmand type scent that to my nose actually smells rather expensive.</li>
            <li>The oil is very intense and a little goes</li>
            <li>He later told me he tried to keep himself 3 feet away at all times, close enough to smell me, but far away enough to keep his hands off of me, because all he could think of was how he wanted to rip my clothes off.  </li>
            <li>I had grow so tired of \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; scents that were too strong and overpowering and never felt like \\&quot;me.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>and I have to put very little on at first.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way as the scent is a little strong at first.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> LOL).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Vanilla infused cinnamon sugared butter is what I call this delicious smelling sexy treat.</li>
            <li> I went on a date with told me that I smelled so good he wanted to eat me.  </li>
            <li> It smells so good</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I gave it a benefit of a doubt and tried it on, thinking maybe others might like it and also thinking about one of the product reviewers here who typed this on her headline &amp;#34;SO GOOD</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, with that out of the way, let me say, this stuff is as good as people say.  </li>
            <li> #34;Oh my God, what smells so good?  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that will have the guys drooling (or if you just want to smell good for you)</li>
            <li> The best way i can describe the sent is a sweet cinnamon chocolate candy,  but here is where the problem (or maybe the fun comes in, i hope to to put this to the test in April when I get up with my college sweetheart, LOL), the scent is SCRONG!!!!</li>

            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> this is probably the best beginner&#x27;s perfume to try from LP and was one of my first loves.</li>
            <li> The scent is sexy!</li>
            <li> Okay people, its me Leapy again, with another review!  </li>
            <li> This scent will make you feel sexy!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re doin?&amp;#34; I love it!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and rub the perfume oil on me in the hot pressure points that the instruction card advised, and while i think the perfume smelled amazing, i was not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li> It is just amazing.  </li>
            <li> Let me reiterate, i think the scent smells amazing, but its just SCRONG to my nose, and the reason why it is SCRONG to my nose, is because even though i am the the one that is wearing the perfume, ultimatley the scent is NOT for my nose.  </li>
            <li> That work together creating an AMAZING scent.  </li>
            <li> The vanilla nicely balances the cinnamon and deeper notes.</li>
            <li> guess that&#x27;s why the vanilla is so nice</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m delighted I found Love Potion Fragrances online.</li>
            <li> Their whole line is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Either way, give it time to warm on your skin</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful scent and has only gotten me good comments from those around me.</li>
            <li> It is very strong and long-lasting (hence the perceived &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; price for the size)</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s warm and sexy and</li>
            <li> ideal date-night scent, or really for anytime you want to add some Va Va Voom to your day.&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorites from LPs signature line.</li>
            <li> this ages beautifully, if it doesn&#x27;t seem to suit you on first try give it some time and try it again, these scents are magic truly and can transform into some of your favorites if you give them a chance.</li>
            <li> Even applied very lightly seems to garner attention.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I always get compliments galore when i wear this, but my favorite reaction was when I was standing in line in the store.</li>
            <li> I do have emphasize that this perfume really id so much more than cinnamon however.</li>
            <li> and this smells like anything but cheap smelling!.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Cougar or LFM :)</li>
            <li> I dabbed it on and enjoyed the depth of the scent.</li>
            <li> good God, did it work wonders on him ;)  </li>
            <li> My beautiful bride wears this for &#x27;special occasions&#x27; because she knows how much it affects me.  </li>
            <li> I was NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li> This perfume is more like a cheap incense from the street corners of NYC.</li>
            <li> and you might be surprised at just how great this one is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will just melt right into your skin creating a warm, sexxxxy scent.  </li>
            <li> LP Red is sexy and long-lasting, it is no wonder why this is one of LPMP’s most popular and well-loved scents!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I would like the scent because I am picky with fragrances and do not like strong scents.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want it to be too strong.  </li>
            <li> So, I highly recommend being cautious where you go while wearing this, because it really isn&#x27;t fair.  </li>
            <li> Normally I like to smell whatever I&#x27;m going to be buying,  but the reviews were really good</li>
            <li> The vanilla,dark sugars,amber and cinnamon mix to make this a sweet and sexy scent.</li>
            <li> Potion arrived in a beautiful bag along with several free samples.</li>
            <li> This is a very hot, spicy scent from Love Potions&#x27; signature fragrance line.  </li>
            <li> It is sensuously rich with sweet, elegant vanilla, what I think is brown sugar, woods and resins.</li>
            <li> : Red is great for 99%-100% of people, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> but the cinnamon is really light</li>
            <li> Then it melds with the spicy scent of cinnamon and the smooth amber and resins.  </li>
            <li> This smells like cheap incense sold in streets, like another another reviewer wrote.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and creamy with some spice as well.  </li>
            <li> , you get some free samples, and free shipping on one order per month.  </li>
            <li> I am seeing that a couple of people have said in their reviews that this smells of cheap incense.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that  I would classify it as either incensey or cheap.</li>
            <li> Then I wear it to my yoga class because it was not strong but smells so delicious.  </li>
            <li> I should have lipstick on LOL) just like the other Love Potions</li>
            <li> ~ Extraordinary aphrodisiac, inspires happiness, playfulness, sexual arousal, lust, and is physically vitalizing, familial sense memories, soothing, nurturing, comforting.&lt;br /&gt;AMBER ~ Fertility, luck, riches, sensuality.&lt;br /&gt;PATCHOULI</li>
            <li> The ingredient combo in this works really well together to create a slinky, sexy scent that makes me feel super feminine and confident.</li>
            <li> This is the first ever scent i tried from Love Potion.</li>
            <li> It was love at first smell.  </li>
            <li> This scent was one of the first Love Potion scents I tried.</li>
            <li> The sweet scent in the beginning is so luscious and rich.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this scent, and I can&#x27;t believe how dead sexy it is!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this often, but it&#x27;s my go-to for special occasions, no doubt.  </li>
            <li> Makes you smell good enough to eat!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> on my skin leaving the sweet scent of vanilla lingering all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Smells like cinnamon sugar and good enough to eat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s candy sweet</li>
            <li> This is a very fun scent to wear and the reactions from men are fun to watch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been  loyal LP consumer ever since.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, there are options to add pheromones (although this fragrance works TREMENDOUSLY on its own!)  </li>
            <li> Wear with caution because this one is HOT!</li>
            <li> Exceptional experience especially for a first time customer.</li>
            <li> that I was mesmerizing.</li>
            <li> &quot; (especially with the copulins added), this is a perfume you DO NOT WEAR for your OWN pleasure if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> As it warmed on my skin it changed from more vanilla-cinnamon and apricot to a deep rich amber, cinnamon and vanilla.</li>
            <li> That being said, the base of the fragrance has great vanilla notes, and is warm, sweet, and sexy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because I realized the instruction card was right</li>
            <li> The whole presentation made me feel special</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s certainly worked for me!</li>
            <li> ~ Male sexual stimulation, passion, lust, healing, protection, energy, creativity, psychic powers.&lt;br /&gt;DARK</li>
            <li> First day of wearing the oil....</li>
            <li> The first time I try it on and went to the store...</li>
            <li> love the scent looking to get moor later on husband loves it .lasts</li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t even describe the olfactory poetry that is Love Potion Red.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t know exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I came across Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie almost by accident and the first scent that caught my eye was LP Red.</li>
            <li> Love Potion Red is one of the first perfumes I bought (several years ago)from Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie, and to this day is still one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Not to mention my husband&#x27;s ;)</li>
            <li> This is not as exactly described by the reviewers here.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this, I bought it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only personally encountered one individual who didn&#x27;t care for this on me (but it was my best friend&#x27;s husband on a night we were all going out together, so no worries there.  </li>
            <li> i just received my perfume oil roll on of Love Potion Red.</li>
            <li> Each ingredient combines as supporting cast members to create an overall sophisticated scent that is divine.</li>
            <li> This was one of the first LP scents I ever tried after a friend recommended the line to me.  </li>
            <li> I applied sparingly at first as it was spicy and resiny</li>
            <li> The other thing I love about Love Potion perfumes in general is that they can be worn and enjoyed even by people who are generally bothered by perfume.</li>
            <li> It has a really lasting and lingering scent and smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore Love Potion Red.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much Magickal Perfumerie!</li>
            <li> After it dries down, I get a nice vanilla scent with hint of cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Red from the seller&#x27;s website after finding it first here on Amazon because someone mentioned additional options for customization were available on the website.  </li>
            <li> If the color red did somehow magically acquire an actual scent, I’m positive it would smell like Love Potion Red.</li>
            <li> people were talking to me, adoring me, and swooning.</li>
            <li> It starts off very spicy on my skin</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much because as it combines with your body warmth, the air fills with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went to a school/social PTA event and got unusual attention from some of the dads there.</li>
            <li> I really was looking forward to this.</li>
            <li> I can say this perfume oil is definetley something you would wear in an intimate setting.</li>
            <li> This scent is a most deliciously dark blend and always gets me compliments, not only on the fragrance but in the fact that it is so unique - exactly what I was hoping to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tempered by amber and woods which tend to be some other favorite scents of mine by LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love Potion Red is exactly as its name describes, very, very red.</li>
            <li> and so far its REALLY working!</li>
            <li> At first i was surprised at all the attention I was getting and did not realize that this fragrance was working like</li>
            <li> The only reason I have not given this one a full four stars is my issue with cinnamon, and not the blend itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich and buttery with a dark vein of patchouli running through it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this perfume and everything else created by LPMP.  </li>
            <li> so I feel a little more dressed up when I wear it(Like</li>
            <li> well, when you go DIRECTLY to the seller&#x27;s website the products are about 5 dollars CHEAPER, and it comes with an option to add copulins ( i am not a chemist, but what i gathered the copulins is a natural occuring pheromone that attracts the opposite sex) for an additional 5 dollars, plus you get FREE SAMPLES with your order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In this fragrance that base is enhanced  with wonderful hot cinnamon and brown sugar notes.</li>
            <li> I feel dead sexy when I wear this.</li>
            <li> No, the previous word is NOT A TYPO, i meant what i said, the scent is SCRONG (it&#x27;s beyond strong), it  is very incensy smelling (think Egyptian Musk incense, but not the smell, but the INTENSITY of the smell), the instruction card also states that copulins (while a potent sexual pheremone, it stinks, and you need to allow 10 minutes for this perfume (if you get it with the copulins) to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; on the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also since these types of scents can change and deepen with age, if you do not like it right away, put it away for a while and try it at some later date.</li>
            <li> And the pretty beaded bag it comes in does make you feel a little like you bought an actual magic potion.  </li>
            <li> My significant other loves this as well, and he always seems to want to live in my neck when I wear this particular blend.</li>
            <li> get frequent compliments when I wear this!</li>
            <li> Men go wild over this perfume!</li>
            <li> They are rich and long lasting, but cling close to the skin and don&#x27;t leave obnoxious trails that gag everyone in your wake.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I suggest that anyone woman who wants to seduce that special guy or put the spice back in her romance with her signifigant other ORDER</li>
            <li> Since everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different as is our ability to pick out certain scents, I would say try it and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely suggest if someone&#x27;s starting out with trying fragrances from this company and wanted to know where to begin.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> but with a mature vibe</li>
            <li> me, I get a lot of vanilla, cinnamon, and resins and it reminds me of cool evenings by a fireplace getting cozy with your significant other.</li>
            <li> Since then, I order it directly from the company&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> It is sweet, complex, and drop dead sexy.</li>
            <li> I wore it to work when I first bought it, and the cleaning lady literally stopped what she was doing, walked over and leaned next to me to sniff deeply.  </li>
            <li> LP Red was at first a total departure than what I was used to in a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I believe that is where the \\&quot;power\\&quot; of this perfume will come from, and the raw, strong scent will make sense (to the opposite sex).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like you leave a trail in your wake, with people stopping, heads turning, and just general distraction when you walk by.  </li>
            <li> BUT at this price, it *is* quite reasonable and a very rich, gourmand type scent that to my nose actually smells rather expensive.</li>
            <li> The oil is very intense and a little goes</li>
            <li> He later told me he tried to keep himself 3 feet away at all times, close enough to smell me, but far away enough to keep his hands off of me, because all he could think of was how he wanted to rip my clothes off.  </li>
            <li> I had grow so tired of \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; scents that were too strong and overpowering and never felt like \\&quot;me.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> and I have to put very little on at first.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way as the scent is a little strong at first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gotten compliments while wearing it, and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very long lasting.</li>
            <li> A little foodie, a little perfumey and spicy HOT</li>
            <li> I am a little sensitive to the cinnamon</li>
            <li> a long time ,has a spicy dmell</li>
            <li> I can smell it all they long.</li>
            <li> a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hate department store perfumes; wearing Love Potion Red is an entirely different experience.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t just open up the bottle and start rolling this little ball all over yourself.  </li>
            <li> This scent for me is a more fall or cold weather scent as it&#x27;s got a little spice to it, I also like it as an evening scent.</li>
            <li> I had never really used artisan scents before and just did not know what to think.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some strange voodoo in that little roll on...</li>
            <li> And you have the option of buying $5 trial size of bottles of other fragrances you want to try.  </li>
            <li> THIS (and no, I am NOT a paid spokesperson, you can read all my other reviews), there is something here with this company potions that they put in their perfumes.  </li>
            <li> (we havent seen each other in about 15 years), once i go out on that date, with this perfume oil, I will come and update my rating with a number 5 or a lower rating if it does not produce the desired results.</li>
            <li> All their signature scents have a rich, deep, sensuous base of Vanilla, Amber and Patchouli.</li>
            <li> perfume comes in a small, roll on tube that is a little smaller than a lipstick.</li>
            <li> I was completely tired of the normal everyday perfumes and was looking for a change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a mixture of spicy ingredients: VANILLA, AMBER, PATCHOULI, CINNAMON ,DARK SUGARS ,WOODS, RESINS</li>
            <li> By the way, the instruction card STRAIGHT UP STATES that this scent is NOT to be worn, at work or a casual event; it advises that this scent is strictly to use when you want to SEDUCE.</li>
            <li> , now that i got all the logistics, out of the way, let me get down to the scent.</li>
            <li> When I first received this perfume I was a little disappointed to see it was delivered in a &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34; bottle, instead of a regular spray bottle, but after using it I understand why!</li>
            <li> Almost 30 bucks gone to waste.</li>
            <li> It comes in a Roll on type of bottle and it&#x27;s an oil base (they also available in spray form on the website).  </li>
            <li> The oil base dry out very fast.  </li>
            <li> Well, when you order directly from the website, the perfume comes in this enchanting drawstring pouch (mine was gold with gold beading at the bottom, i mean  the pouch makes you feel like some type of temptress that has a secret power that others are not privy to...</li>
            <li> It even says that if you wear this scent for reasons other than the intended use, it can have a NEGATIVE feedback.</li>
            <li> I became so addicted to the stuff, I had to buy another as soon as the bottle was half empty.</li>
            <li> One guy moved his chair few feet away from me in class &amp; at work, my male co-worker gave me a really weird look who never spoke to me for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a small drop tap on the body part.  </li>
            <li> There are a few negative reviews, and there&#x27;s truth to the idea that you can&#x27;t please everybody.  </li>
            <li> Just a small dab does it for me, and it lasts all day until I shower.  </li>
            <li> I learned the hard way, and I must say I became an LP &amp;#34;believer&amp;#34; afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The worse part, I can&#x27;t even return it, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I only got unpleasant reactions from males.</li>
            <li> usually apply behind my ears and on my wrists, the &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; notes slowly disappear - thankfully! -</li>
            <li> Sadly for me, my skin amplifies the smell of cinnamon whenever I try to wear a cinnamon heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> I just read the negative reviews on this and all I can think is that the &amp;#34;user&amp;#34; over-applied the scent (which can happen unless you read the application tips!)</li>
            <li> He was weak in the knees.  </li>
            <li> A little weird, but I couldn&#x27;t blame her!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend went crazy over it.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t remember writing a review on Amazon before, but I had to say something about this, this is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the first ever scent i tried from Love Potion. Let me tell you I&#x27;ve already finished up three bottles of this. i love the scent, it&#x27;s warm and sexy and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;Add some cops too and OMG!!!</li>
            <li> This is incredible yummy cinammony goodness! The vanilla nicely balances the cinnamon and deeper notes. Makes you smell good enough to eat!&lt;br /&gt;I get frequent compliments when I wear this!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments from guys when I wear this product - and I love it!  I knew it was something to keep on me at all times when I walked into a meeting and one of the guys said \\&quot;you smell like candy\\&quot;; and said yum.  Another guy I went on a date with told me that I smelled so good he wanted to eat me.  Hilarious!  I did notice that not too many females are attracted to the sent; I&#x27;ve had comments that I smell like incense.  Who cares what the women think...guys love it!  I love it!  I will definitely continue to order!</li>
            <li> TO SAY THIS ATTRACTS MALE INTEREST IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!  Dunno if it&#x27;s the pheremones or just the yummy scent --But do not wear this stuff if you want to be alone!</li>
            <li> Speaking as a guy, this is one of the sexiest scents I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  My beautiful bride wears this for &#x27;special occasions&#x27; because she knows how much it affects me.  Beautiful, spicy scent!</li>
            <li> Love Potion: Red is great for 99%-100% of people, I&#x27;d say. I&#x27;m probably in the 1% that it still needs to grow on, but admittedly, I&#x27;m not someone who likes even the hint of cinnamon in anything. That being said, the base of the fragrance has great vanilla notes, and is warm, sweet, and sexy. I have gotten compliments while wearing it, and it&#x27;s long lasting. I keep huffing my arm whenever I swipe it on. It&#x27;s one I would absolutely suggest if someone&#x27;s starting out with trying fragrances from this company and wanted to know where to begin. I know it&#x27;s a staple of a lot of the customers, so that also has to say something. One thing I will add about this is to let it age. It&#x27;s not that the notes change, but the way they meld together deepens, as will your appreciation of it. I know that&#x27;s certainly worked for me!</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of Red Lace which is the pheromone-enhanced version&lt;br /&gt;of LP Red with the Lace phero mix added to it. Scent-wise, this is&lt;br /&gt;very yummy. Vanilla and cinnamon but the cinnamon is really light&lt;br /&gt;for me. It just tempers the vanilla so it&#x27;s not the same ol&#x27; vanilla&lt;br /&gt;scent that has oversaturated the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent makeup is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VANILLA ~ Extraordinary aphrodisiac, inspires happiness, playfulness, sexual arousal, lust, and is physically vitalizing, familial sense memories, soothing, nurturing, comforting.&lt;br /&gt;AMBER ~ Fertility, luck, riches, sensuality.&lt;br /&gt;PATCHOULI ~ Soothes and uplifts, sensual, sexually stimulating, lust, fertility, money.&lt;br /&gt;CINNAMON ~ Male sexual stimulation, passion, lust, healing, protection, energy, creativity, psychic powers.&lt;br /&gt;DARK SUGARS ~ Attracts love, luck, sweetness, riches, lust inducing.&lt;br /&gt;WOODS ~ Enhances perception of beauty, love, sensuality, money, luck, hex-breaking.&lt;br /&gt;RESINS ~ Sensual, sexually stimulating, lust, fertility, money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess that&#x27;s why the vanilla is so nice and mellow-- it&#x27;s tempered by amber and woods which tend to be some other favorite scents of mine by LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, unless you hate cinnamon or vanilla this is probably the best beginner&#x27;s perfume to try from LP and was one of my first loves.</li>
            <li> If the color red did somehow magically acquire an actual scent, I’m positive it would smell like Love Potion Red. When I apply the oil it warms up on my skin it blooms beautifully over time – the cinnamon and vanilla stand out the most. I also love layering this with the OCCO blends. LP Red is sexy and long-lasting, it is no wonder why this is one of LPMP’s most popular and well-loved scents!</li>
            <li> When I first received this perfume I was a little disappointed to see it was delivered in a &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34; bottle, instead of a regular spray bottle, but after using it I understand why! The oil is very intense and a little goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply behind my ears and on my wrists, the &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; notes slowly disappear - thankfully! - on my skin leaving the sweet scent of vanilla lingering all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> This is a very hot, spicy scent from Love Potions&#x27; signature fragrance line.  All their signature scents have a rich, deep, sensuous base of Vanilla, Amber and Patchouli. In this fragrance that base is enhanced  with wonderful hot cinnamon and brown sugar notes. A little foodie, a little perfumey and spicy HOT sexy.&lt;br /&gt;An ideal date-night scent, or really for anytime you want to add some Va Va Voom to your day.&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorites from LPs signature line. I feel dead sexy when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this vanilla scent to pack such a punch but I was pleasantly surprised. It has a really lasting and lingering scent and smells good enough to eat!</li>
            <li> The scent is sexy! Smells like cinnamon sugar and good enough to eat. Men go wild over this perfume! It&#x27;s also very long lasting.</li>
            <li> perfume comes in a small, roll on tube that is a little smaller than a lipstick. A little bit goes a long way as the scent is a little strong at first.&lt;br /&gt;The smell reminds me of incense. Pachouli and amber resin mostly. I only dab one dot in the middle of my chest and then rub it in with my wrists. Even applied very lightly seems to garner attention.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to spice things up and so far its REALLY working!</li>
            <li> Potion arrived in a beautiful bag along with several free samples. Shipping was on time! You can definitely smell the vanilla along with some spice. First day of wearing the oil.... My boyfriend went crazy over it. I had a man stop me while shopping to say he just had to know my name..that I was mesmerizing. I had women at lunch drool over my clothing, jewelry....seemed as if everywhere I turned people were talking to me, adoring me, and swooning. Thanks so much Magickal Perfumerie! Would definitely buy again and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Normally I like to smell whatever I&#x27;m going to be buying,  but the reviews were really good so I tried it. I was NOT disappointed! Wow. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after looking for an alternative for chemical fragrances.  I didn&#x27;t know if I would like the scent because I am picky with fragrances and do not like strong scents.  The first time I try it on and went to the store...everyone in the store seems so eager to help me.  Then I wear it to my yoga class because it was not strong but smells so delicious.  Ever since I have been wearing it I noticed that my husband keeps wanting to snuggle up to me all the time.  At first i was surprised at all the attention I was getting and did not realize that this fragrance was working like magic.&lt;br /&gt;This is now my all time go to fragrance..I do with they will make it in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is interesting. I haven&#x27;t used it just yet, but I will keep you posted..lol</li>
            <li> This scent for me is a more fall or cold weather scent as it&#x27;s got a little spice to it, I also like it as an evening scent. It&#x27;s candy sweet but with a mature vibe so I feel a little more dressed up when I wear it(Like I should have lipstick on LOL) just like the other Love Potions this ages beautifully, if it doesn&#x27;t seem to suit you on first try give it some time and try it again, these scents are magic truly and can transform into some of your favorites if you give them a chance.</li>
            <li> Exceptional experience especially for a first time customer. The package was exquisite and exceeded my expectations. They also included free samples which are all so good that I want all of them! The whole presentation made me feel special and I&#x27;m delighted I found Love Potion Fragrances online. Thank you for the lingering scents and the experience, I will order again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore Love Potion Red. It starts off very spicy on my skin and I have to put very little on at first. After it dries down, I get a nice vanilla scent with hint of cinnamon. I am a little sensitive to the cinnamon but the irritation goes away after a couple of hours. This is a very fun scent to wear and the reactions from men are fun to watch.</li>
            <li> I have two bottles of this. It smells so good I don&#x27;t want to ever run out. I alway get compliments when I wear this. Well, except from my spouse, but everyone else likes it :)</li>
            <li> love the scent looking to get moor later on husband loves it .lasts a long time ,has a spicy dmell</li>
            <li> Words can&#x27;t even describe the olfactory poetry that is Love Potion Red. It is sweet, complex, and drop dead sexy. Just absolutely beautiful. The other thing I love about Love Potion perfumes in general is that they can be worn and enjoyed even by people who are generally bothered by perfume. They are rich and long lasting, but cling close to the skin and don&#x27;t leave obnoxious trails that gag everyone in your wake. I hate department store perfumes; wearing Love Potion Red is an entirely different experience.</li>
            <li> I bought Love Potion: Red from the seller&#x27;s website after finding it first here on Amazon because someone mentioned additional options for customization were available on the website.  I love, love, love it.  The sweet scent in the beginning is so luscious and rich.  Then it melds with the spicy scent of cinnamon and the smooth amber and resins.  It is just amazing.  A co-worker came up to me to talk to me and took a deep breath.  He said \\&quot;Something smells good\\&quot; and then he told me that I smelled like Christmas.  One reviewer mentioned that it smelled like incense and the amber and resins do smell a bit like incense but I happen to like that about it.</li>
            <li> I was completely tired of the normal everyday perfumes and was looking for a change. I just didn&#x27;t know exactly what I was looking for. I came across Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie almost by accident and the first scent that caught my eye was LP Red. This scent is a most deliciously dark blend and always gets me compliments, not only on the fragrance but in the fact that it is so unique - exactly what I was hoping to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me, I get a lot of vanilla, cinnamon, and resins and it reminds me of cool evenings by a fireplace getting cozy with your significant other. It&#x27;s comforting and sensual all at the same time. I became so addicted to the stuff, I had to buy another as soon as the bottle was half empty. And don&#x27;t let the bottle size fool you.  This roll-on oil LASTS and you don&#x27;t need much because as it combines with your body warmth, the air fills with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this perfume and everything else created by LPMP.  The customer service has been awesome and every purchase has arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I just read the negative reviews on this and all I can think is that the &amp;#34;user&amp;#34; over-applied the scent (which can happen unless you read the application tips!) You don&#x27;t just open up the bottle and start rolling this little ball all over yourself.  It is very strong and long-lasting (hence the perceived &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; price for the size) And if you choose to add pheromones or cops to this or ANY LP scent, then you MUST operate under the &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; rule.  I learned the hard way, and I must say I became an LP &amp;#34;believer&amp;#34; afterwards.  I happen to like this LP Red scent and I got it with added Cops &amp;#34;just for the heck of it&amp;#34;.  Let&#x27;s just say I forgot I had put it on earlier in the day - I went to a school/social PTA event and got unusual attention from some of the dads there. And I was WITH my husband at the time. Very awkward for everyone concerned.  So I definitely think there is a &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; to the formulation, but as with all &amp;#34;experiments&amp;#34;, the independent variable is the WEARER... everything from overdoing the application to wearing it in inappropriate situations.  And... if you DON&#x27;T care for this scent don&#x27;t discount the entire line... there is something for everyone.</li>
            <li> I really was looking forward to this. This smells like cheap incense sold in streets, like another another reviewer wrote. I don&#x27;t remember writing a review on Amazon before, but I had to say something about this, this is terrible. The worse part, I can&#x27;t even return it, what a waste of money. Almost 30 bucks gone to waste.</li>
            <li> This scent is just so gorgeous!  It turns heads not only because it is a great scent with good throw, but also because it is SEXY.  It is smooth and creamy with some spice as well.  So nice!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  The oil base dry out very fast.  Smell wonderful.  I use it regularly.  Just a small drop tap on the body part.  I can smell it all they long.</li>
            <li> This scent is for the daring. Vanilla infused cinnamon sugared butter is what I call this delicious smelling sexy treat. My significant other loves this as well, and he always seems to want to live in my neck when I wear this particular blend. Wear with caution because this one is HOT!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect cool-weather sex bomb!!  I absolutely LOVE this scent, and I can&#x27;t believe how dead sexy it is!!  I catch myself wondering \\&quot;mmm, what smells so good?\\&quot; and it&#x27;s ME!!  This is pheromone-free (unless you choose to add pheros) but you&#x27;d never know it - it attracts like nothing else!!  I will never let myself run out of this!!</li>
            <li> Love Potion Red is one of the first perfumes I bought (several years ago)from Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie, and to this day is still one of my favorites. Not to mention my husband&#x27;s ;) The vanilla,dark sugars,amber and cinnamon mix to make this a sweet and sexy scent. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a sensual scent that will capture attention!</li>
            <li> This perfume is more like a cheap incense from the street corners of NYC. Nonetheless, I gave it a benefit of a doubt and tried it on, thinking maybe others might like it and also thinking about one of the product reviewers here who typed this on her headline &amp;#34;SO GOOD IT IS SCARY&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I only got unpleasant reactions from males. No hits. No compliments at all. One guy moved his chair few feet away from me in class &amp; at work, my male co-worker gave me a really weird look who never spoke to me for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is going back. This is not as exactly described by the reviewers here.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this, I bought it through Amazon.  Since then, I order it directly from the company&#x27;s website.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there are options to add pheromones (although this fragrance works TREMENDOUSLY on its own!)  It&#x27;s also cheaper, you get some free samples, and free shipping on one order per month.  And you have the option of buying $5 trial size of bottles of other fragrances you want to try.  And the pretty beaded bag it comes in does make you feel a little like you bought an actual magic potion.  There&#x27;s some strange voodoo in that little roll on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, with that out of the way, let me say, this stuff is as good as people say.  There are a few negative reviews, and there&#x27;s truth to the idea that you can&#x27;t please everybody.  But this is probably the closest you will ever get.  I&#x27;ve only personally encountered one individual who didn&#x27;t care for this on me (but it was my best friend&#x27;s husband on a night we were all going out together, so no worries there.  My friend, however, adored it on me).  I wore it to work when I first bought it, and the cleaning lady literally stopped what she was doing, walked over and leaned next to me to sniff deeply.  A little weird, but I couldn&#x27;t blame her!  Sometimes I&#x27;ll catch a whiff of myself and think, &amp;#34;Oh my God, what smells so good?  Oh, wait, that&#x27;s ME!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve seen the effect at places like the grocery store and gas station, and it&#x27;s something you can see and feel.  It&#x27;s almost like you leave a trail in your wake, with people stopping, heads turning, and just general distraction when you walk by.  I don&#x27;t use this often, but it&#x27;s my go-to for special occasions, no doubt.  Just earlier this week, I wore it while out hiking with a guy I&#x27;ve had a thing for, and good God, did it work wonders on him ;)  Ladies, picture the man on the cover of any romance novel...that&#x27;s him.  Sexy, ripped, untamable lumberjack with a restless soul and a wandering eye.  He was weak in the knees.  He later told me he tried to keep himself 3 feet away at all times, close enough to smell me, but far away enough to keep his hands off of me, because all he could think of was how he wanted to rip my clothes off.  Said my smell &amp;#34;just wasn&#x27;t fair.&amp;#34;  (It&#x27;s not!)  And I have the blend WITHOUT the added pheromones!!!!  So, I highly recommend being cautious where you go while wearing this, because it really isn&#x27;t fair.  Though it isn&#x27;t listed in the fragrance list, I&#x27;d swear it&#x27;s made with Kryptonite.</li>
            <li> Okay people, its me Leapy again, with another review!  Sooooooooooo.....i just received my perfume oil roll on of Love Potion Red. Please NOTE: I DID NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON. Why? well, when you go DIRECTLY to the seller&#x27;s website the products are about 5 dollars CHEAPER, and it comes with an option to add copulins ( i am not a chemist, but what i gathered the copulins is a natural occuring pheromone that attracts the opposite sex) for an additional 5 dollars, plus you get FREE SAMPLES with your order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now that i got all the logistics, out of the way, let me get down to the scent. Well, when you order directly from the website, the perfume comes in this enchanting drawstring pouch (mine was gold with gold beading at the bottom, i mean  the pouch makes you feel like some type of temptress that has a secret power that others are not privy to...LOL). Also the perfume oil comes with an \\&quot;instruction card\\&quot; that looks like a bookmark, and it advises you on the use of the oils and sprays. By the way, the instruction card STRAIGHT UP STATES that this scent is NOT to be worn, at work or a casual event; it advises that this scent is strictly to use when you want to SEDUCE. It even says that if you wear this scent for reasons other than the intended use, it can have a NEGATIVE feedback. After applying it (i had to try it on to see how it smell :-)), I see why they advise such caution. Let&#x27;s get this straight, the scent smells great ( I paid the extra money to have copulins added).  The best way i can describe the sent is a sweet cinnamon chocolate candy,  but here is where the problem (or maybe the fun comes in, i hope to to put this to the test in April when I get up with my college sweetheart, LOL), the scent is SCRONG!!!!, No, the previous word is NOT A TYPO, i meant what i said, the scent is SCRONG (it&#x27;s beyond strong), it  is very incensy smelling (think Egyptian Musk incense, but not the smell, but the INTENSITY of the smell), the instruction card also states that copulins (while a potent sexual pheremone, it stinks, and you need to allow 10 minutes for this perfume (if you get it with the copulins) to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I followed the directions and rub the perfume oil on me in the hot pressure points that the instruction card advised, and while i think the perfume smelled amazing, i was not overly impressed.  You may ask why i am giving this 4 stars, and I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed or \\&quot;blown\\&quot; away by the scent? It&#x27;s because I realized the instruction card was right, THIS IS NOT a perfume you put on \\&quot;just because\\&quot; (especially with the copulins added), this is a perfume you DO NOT WEAR for your OWN pleasure if that makes sense. This is a perfume you wear (as a woman) to attract the opposite sex, so it makes sense that I would not be BLOWN away by the scent, because the scent is NOT for my pleasure, it is for the opposite sex (males) pleasure.  Let me reiterate, i think the scent smells amazing, but its just SCRONG to my nose, and the reason why it is SCRONG to my nose, is because even though i am the the one that is wearing the perfume, ultimatley the scent is NOT for my nose.  Bottom line, I suggest that anyone woman who wants to seduce that special guy or put the spice back in her romance with her signifigant other ORDER THIS (and no, I am NOT a paid spokesperson, you can read all my other reviews), there is something here with this company potions that they put in their perfumes.  I can say this perfume oil is definetley something you would wear in an intimate setting. I believe that is where the \\&quot;power\\&quot; of this perfume will come from, and the raw, strong scent will make sense (to the opposite sex).  I am supposed to meet up with my college sweetheart and I plan to put this on, when we go out (we havent seen each other in about 15 years), once i go out on that date, with this perfume oil, I will come and update my rating with a number 5 or a lower rating if it does not produce the desired results. So stay tuned. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I applied the perfume oil when i got it which was around 6:00pm today, and i can still smell it on my skin (its not overbearing or repulsive though).tay tuned. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I applied the perfume oil when i got it which was around 6:00pm today, and i can still smell it on my skin (its not overbearing or repulsive though).</li>
            <li> The ingredient combo in this works really well together to create a slinky, sexy scent that makes me feel super feminine and confident. Each ingredient combines as supporting cast members to create an overall sophisticated scent that is divine. I don&#x27;t want to be without this!</li>
            <li> This was one of the first LP scents I ever tried after a friend recommended the line to me.  I had grow so tired of \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; scents that were too strong and overpowering and never felt like \\&quot;me.\\&quot;  LP Red was at first a total departure than what I was used to in a fragrance.  It comes in a Roll on type of bottle and it&#x27;s an oil base (they also available in spray form on the website).  It was love at first smell.  I applied sparingly at first as it was spicy and resiny and I didn&#x27;t want it to be too strong.  It just kept smelling better and better.  It&#x27;s got a mixture of spicy ingredients: VANILLA, AMBER, PATCHOULI, CINNAMON ,DARK SUGARS ,WOODS, RESINS That work together creating an AMAZING scent.  I&#x27;ve been  loyal LP consumer ever since.  Their whole line is wonderful.  There are tons of scents to choose from and there&#x27;s a signature scent for everyone.  They will even blend for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will just melt right into your skin creating a warm, sexxxxy scent.  If you&#x27;re looking for something that will have the guys drooling (or if you just want to smell good for you) LP red is a must try.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This is a deep, cinnamon candy scent. It&#x27;s very rich and buttery with a dark vein of patchouli running through it. Just a small dab does it for me, and it lasts all day until I shower.  I always get compliments galore when i wear this, but my favorite reaction was when I was standing in line in the store. the man in front of me kept sniffing over his shoulder and gradually worked his way around until he was facing my direction. Then when it was his turn to check out, he took one last big sniff and faced the cash register!!</li>
            <li> Love Potion Red is exactly as its name describes, very, very red. Sadly for me, my skin amplifies the smell of cinnamon whenever I try to wear a cinnamon heavy fragrance. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I LOVE cinnamon, it simply does not wear well on my skin. I do have emphasize that this perfume really id so much more than cinnamon however. It is sensuously rich with sweet, elegant vanilla, what I think is brown sugar, woods and resins. The only reason I have not given this one a full four stars is my issue with cinnamon, and not the blend itself. I am seeing that a couple of people have said in their reviews that this smells of cheap incense. I do not feel that  I would classify it as either incensey or cheap. I know incensey fragrances and this smells like anything but cheap smelling!. BUT at this price, it *is* quite reasonable and a very rich, gourmand type scent that to my nose actually smells rather expensive. Just not for my skin is all. By all means do try it.</li>
            <li> This scent will make you feel sexy! Whenever I wear it and pass by a mirror, I turn into &#x27;Joey Tribbiani&#x27; and ask myself &amp;#34;How you&#x27;re doin?&amp;#34; I love it! It boosts your confidence and makes you feel sexy!&lt;br /&gt;If you visit this seller&#x27;s site, you can ask them to boost this scent with any phero you&#x27;d like like. I would recommend Cougar or LFM :)</li>
            <li> This scent was one of the first Love Potion scents I tried. I had never really used artisan scents before and just did not know what to think. I dabbed it on and enjoyed the depth of the scent. As it warmed on my skin it changed from more vanilla-cinnamon and apricot to a deep rich amber, cinnamon and vanilla. The patchouli behaves on me but some say it amps on them and this is what I think caused the smell of incense for the one. It is a wonderful scent and has only gotten me good comments from those around me. Since everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different as is our ability to pick out certain scents, I would say try it and see if you like it. Also since these types of scents can change and deepen with age, if you do not like it right away, put it away for a while and try it at some later date. Either way, give it time to warm on your skin and you might be surprised at just how great this one is. For me this one is a winner and I will always try to have some on hand.</li>
