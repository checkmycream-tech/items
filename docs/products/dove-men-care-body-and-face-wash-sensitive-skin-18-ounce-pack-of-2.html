            <li>Dove is the best!</li>
            <li>This one is perfect!</li>
            <li>and it works great!</li>
            <li>even though it says non scented, it still smells and works great!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s texture, or lack thereof, work good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>Good value</li>
            <li>Makes sense right!!!!</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant and light odor to it, but it wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Very happy shopping at a time, the goods is very good, use is convenient, next time will come again, thank you</li>
            <li>still need 2 more words!</li>
            <li>Vitamin A (Retinol or Retinyl Palmitate) can effectively speed cell turnover.</li>
            <li>Nice to have one bottle for hair, face &amp; body.</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>By far, this is the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Dove&#x27;s men bodywash, as far as I can tell, is the best out there.</li>
            <li>(might need to work on the labeling), it does one thing phenomenally well; cleanse your skin without overdrying it.    </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it comes in a 2-Pack.  </li>
            <li>This is quite possibly the best body wash I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>BUT I hope it can smell better.</li>
            <li>This product says \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; all over it, but has a STRONG perfume smell - fragrance is listed as an ingredient.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t give a perfect rating unless a product deserves it, but I was exceptionally pleased.  </li>
            <li>Thanks in part to this body wash my skin is in amazing condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy this body wash.</li>
            <li>I like it because it makes me feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-does have scent (not bad though)</li>
            <li>This was one of the better Dove products particularly for those of us that don&#x27;t want to smell like a street hood.</li>
            <li>Okay, this does have a minor scent to it, but it&#x27;s an very very light earthy smell.</li>
            <li>The only men&#x27;s body wash I&#x27;ve been able to find that doesn&#x27;t have an overly strong smell, which I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li>The color scheme is nice and the bottle is easy to handle without slipping out of my hands.</li>
            <li>The Unilever rep was very understanding and has issued free coupons to reimburse me for the coast of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it is the first time in my life I have been able to stand such a scent, as it is relatively mild once out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and it was purchased with a group of things that I needed fast.</li>
            <li>I have tried many conventional types of wash, some of which I may enjoy, that cause a reaction.</li>
            <li>I can only ever find this size bottle at Target; with &#x27;Subscribe and Save&#x27; discount on top of a dollar discount coupon from Amazon, this was a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it only sits on top protecting your skin.</li>
            <li>It does exactly that.</li>
            <li>like I said I can&#x27;t find this exact one in any store), and I go through about four of these 18oz bottles a year.</li>
            <li>Package and large amount</li>
            <li>My husband felt it was a little too &amp;#34;strong smelling&amp;#34; but I know I liked it.  </li>
            <li>The price at the store and Amazon&#x27;s advertised price is not very different but you can order this product and have it delivered as needed, which is a huge blessing when it is doctor recommended</li>
            <li>(you name it), BUT those ingredients really don&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make much difference</li>
            <li>how much bottled water you drink if you take 2 showers a day in chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out from the stuff,</li>
            <li>very well&lt;</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants a scrub or deep clean \\&quot;rich\\&quot; lather.</li>
            <li>I love the slight scent it has too</li>
            <li>Just to start with, I&#x27;m typically not the type to use Dove bodywash, though my fiancee is a huge fan of the female version.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin per se but the mildness of both</li>
            <li>These are larger sized containers and the pack of two makes it fairly economical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands - Old Spice, Axe, plain Dove bar soap.</li>
            <li>I imagine this would be just as good for other dry skin conditions such as eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works the same without the pretty smell.</li>
            <li>As a result you have clean skin that has remained well hydrated due to the fact that all of the water, chemicals like chlorine, air pollution, and harmful UV rays have not penetrated your skin.</li>
            <li>YOU DON&#x27;T NEED TO USE \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; OILS which aren&#x27;t natural because they aren&#x27;t naturally part of your skin (with the exception of squalane, still wouldn&#x27;t be natural unless it was already there).</li>
            <li>So far, this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>but I really like the look of the graphic design and industrial design of the product itself.</li>
            <li>We found that out the next morning as I was getting ready.</li>
            <li>Simplify your life and beautify your skin by not destroying it.</li>
            <li>No flakes, soft hair.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I am always trying to find products that do not irritate.</li>
            <li>Dove Men Sensitive works for me, with no skin reaction.</li>
            <li>This Product - Dove Men with Care Body and Face Wash, Sensitive Skin, 18 ounce</li>
            <li>B004DBS91O Dove Men with Care Body and Face Wash, Sensitive Skin, 18-Ounce</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo at Target because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was told that a fragrance is added to \\&quot;mask\\&quot; the naturally occurring smell of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband cause his skin is so sensitive</li>
            <li>I mean hates the scents on most soaps that I use.  </li>
            <li>The upside down orientation of the nozzle helps with this tremendously as does the shape of the bottle, I assume.</li>
            <li>BUT the reality is you don&#x27;t really need to have that flaky dry,</li>
            <li>I can only use sensitive skin soaps.</li>
            <li>Okay there are some game changers...</li>
            <li>Namely, that the unscented bodywash did contain a fragrance (malfa or malta or something like that), but it was intended only to mask/neutralize the natural odors of the ingredients and definitely shouldn&#x27;t have come across as a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; odor in use, so...  </li>
            <li>Does a great job of hydrating my skin in the cold winter months!</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, and very dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Does a great job of hydrating my skin in the cold winter months!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and very dry.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, even if it is slightly misguiding when it says &amp;#34;Scent-Free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, due to a pregnancy and the associated hypersensitivity to smells that come along with it, I had to give up my Old Spice Denali bodywash and went in search of an unscented one.</li>
            <li> The only minus, though I personally don&#x27;t mind, is that it is advertised as \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; yet a scent is clearly apparent.  </li>
            <li> So...Wasn&#x27;t too surprised to get out of the shower only to find my fiancee on the other side of the apartment and every single balcony door open.  </li>
            <li> When the bath soap is getting low it also seems to do well at getting the last bits out unlike a lot of other brands I&#x27;ve tried where you have to pound the thing to get the last quarter of liquid out.</li>
            <li> I smell good and my skin does not react badly to it when it has before to other smelly or colored body washes/shampoos.</li>
            <li> That being said, the scent did seem to dissipate quickly and left only a faint odor after 15 minutes and no detectable scent within 30, but still.  </li>
            <li> So it lasts long and still works great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel dry or itchy or anything.</li>
            <li> It obviously wouldn&#x27;t work for our needs, so I&#x27;m back to basics with a plain, unscented bar of soap.</li>
            <li> pack was only slightly discounted as compared to buying in store, but with shipping options and other items bought at the same time it was a steal.</li>
            <li> You are simply damaging the outer surface of your skin and breaking down</li>
            <li> You are just trying to draw moisture out of the air and into your skin making it HEAVY and WET that is GROSS and definately going to have a DRYING EFFECT on your skin over the long run!</li>
            <li> Your skin is your largest organ and it absorbs too many bad things already.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about body wash.</li>
            <li> I checked Amazon and was surprised and relieved that they had it, and it is cheaper or approximately the same price as it was in store.</li>
            <li> Unlike other emollients like alcohol derived ingredients (glycerin, glycol etc), Petrolatum doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper online than in stores (compared to the other flavors,</li>
            <li> I should have removed one star for the fact that it does have a scent as others have mentioned, but due to how well it is for my psoriasis, I will give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;-Lowest amount of skin drying compared to every other product I have used&lt;br /&gt;-Smells</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make any extremely noticeable difference when compared to the other versions of Dove Men&#x27;s body wash that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So there are those active ingredients which promote exfoliation...</li>
            <li> Despite the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; label, while using the bodywash in the shower, the stuff has a very heavy fragrance, not really any different in strength than my usual Denali.</li>
            <li> All over dried my skin or irritated.</li>
            <li> Turns out Dove unscented, isn&#x27;t; at least, not exactly.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the next time I went to buy it at Target, they no longer carried it!</li>
            <li> FDA complaint, anyone?</li>
            <li> This is really wrong, and is totally false advertising.  </li>
            <li> BUT that is what&#x27;s wrong with 100% of face washes out there.</li>
            <li> Like a faint aloe smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Package of two) is difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if we just wound up with a bad bottle or if that&#x27;s just how the stuff works/smells, but.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was one of the better Dove products particularly for those of us that don&#x27;t want to smell like a street hood. I am disapointed that it is not on the shelves at any store in town.</li>
            <li> This body wash was recommended to me by my dermatologist - as part of a regiment for both acne and eczema. Now, I can see why it was recommended. By far, this is the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried many brands - Old Spice, Axe, plain Dove bar soap. All over dried my skin or irritated. This one doesn&#x27;t, and also hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, and hydrates my skin. Thanks in part to this body wash my skin is in amazing condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack was only slightly discounted as compared to buying in store, but with shipping options and other items bought at the same time it was a steal. I can only ever find this size bottle at Target; with &#x27;Subscribe and Save&#x27; discount on top of a dollar discount coupon from Amazon, this was a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality outer box and quality sealed plastic in side...almost seems wasteful to double package...but regardless, quality in every department.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite choosy about my hygienic products -- toothpastes, soaps, washes and so on. In an effort to find a bath wash that wasn&#x27;t too obnoxious or coarse in it&#x27;s ingredients, I&#x27;ve been through a couple brands. Knowing this, this one came as a gift from my girlfriend at the time. So far, this is one of my favorites. I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin per se but the mildness of both it&#x27;s fragrance and it&#x27;s texture, or lack thereof, work good for my skin. The only minus, though I personally don&#x27;t mind, is that it is advertised as \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; yet a scent is clearly apparent.  It has no impact on the actual relevance of the product as a cleansing agent but I really like the look of the graphic design and industrial design of the product itself. The color scheme is nice and the bottle is easy to handle without slipping out of my hands. When the bath soap is getting low it also seems to do well at getting the last bits out unlike a lot of other brands I&#x27;ve tried where you have to pound the thing to get the last quarter of liquid out. The upside down orientation of the nozzle helps with this tremendously as does the shape of the bottle, I assume. Pretty good!</li>
            <li> Just to start with, I&#x27;m typically not the type to use Dove bodywash, though my fiancee is a huge fan of the female version.  However, due to a pregnancy and the associated hypersensitivity to smells that come along with it, I had to give up my Old Spice Denali bodywash and went in search of an unscented one. My fiancee sent me to the store with \\&quot;advice\\&quot; to pick up a bottle of Dove unscented bodywash.  Turns out Dove unscented, isn&#x27;t; at least, not exactly.  We found that out the next morning as I was getting ready. Despite the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; label, while using the bodywash in the shower, the stuff has a very heavy fragrance, not really any different in strength than my usual Denali. So...Wasn&#x27;t too surprised to get out of the shower only to find my fiancee on the other side of the apartment and every single balcony door open.  That being said, the scent did seem to dissipate quickly and left only a faint odor after 15 minutes and no detectable scent within 30, but still.  After a call to Unilever, customer service told me what April discovered. Namely, that the unscented bodywash did contain a fragrance (malfa or malta or something like that), but it was intended only to mask/neutralize the natural odors of the ingredients and definitely shouldn&#x27;t have come across as a \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; odor in use, so...  I don&#x27;t know if we just wound up with a bad bottle or if that&#x27;s just how the stuff works/smells, but. It obviously wouldn&#x27;t work for our needs, so I&#x27;m back to basics with a plain, unscented bar of soap.</li>
            <li> The simplicity of this product! These days skincare products are jam-packed with different ingredients to add this benifit or that benefit to your skin (you name it), BUT those ingredients really don&#x27;t make a difference. While this product does have a scent and I don&#x27;t know about the micromoisture effect it claims (might need to work on the labeling), it does one thing phenomenally well; cleanse your skin without overdrying it.    Okay there are some game changers...Vitamin A (Retinol or Retinyl Palmitate) can effectively speed cell turnover. Glycolic Acid and Salicylic Acid are Beta Hydroxy Acids that increase cell turnover too (exoliating by penetrating the skin). So there are those active ingredients which promote exfoliation...BUT the reality is you don&#x27;t really need to have that flaky dry, plastered feeling everytime you want to cleanse. Everyone wants a scrub or deep clean \\&quot;rich\\&quot; lather. BUT that is what&#x27;s wrong with 100% of face washes out there. You are simply damaging the outer surface of your skin and breaking down it&#x27;s defense barrier similar to using an imbalanced PH product (Sebamed scientifically proved that). The answer all lies within one ingredient, one that Sebamed never discovered. One we&#x27;ve been told never to use!    Petrolatum. Unlike other emollients like alcohol derived ingredients (glycerin, glycol etc), Petrolatum doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin it only sits on top protecting your skin. In a wash the Petrolatum keeps detergents like SLS from penetrating and damaging your skin&#x27;s hydrating lipid barrier. As a result you have clean skin that has remained well hydrated due to the fact that all of the water, chemicals like chlorine, air pollution, and harmful UV rays have not penetrated your skin. It doesn&#x27;t make much difference how much bottled water you drink if you take 2 showers a day in chemicals. Your skin is your largest organ and it absorbs too many bad things already. Protect it! Makes sense right!!!! FINALLY A SKINCARE COMPANY FIGURED IT OUT...EUREKA! (I&#x27;m not talking bout the vaccum) YOU DON&#x27;T NEED TO USE \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; OILS which aren&#x27;t natural because they aren&#x27;t naturally part of your skin (with the exception of squalane, still wouldn&#x27;t be natural unless it was already there). They make 1)people break out 2) sticky skin 3) unbearable shine. And as for all of those moisturizers what&#x27;s actually beneficial about them? You are just trying to draw moisture out of the air and into your skin making it HEAVY and WET that is GROSS and definately going to have a DRYING EFFECT on your skin over the long run! Take charge! Simplify your life and beautify your skin by not destroying it.</li>
            <li> Dove&#x27;s men bodywash, as far as I can tell, is the best out there. I don&#x27;t need my bodywash to be drenched in perfumes, I just need it to work. It does exactly that.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT unscented, it has a men&#x27;s scent to it...However, it is the first time in my life I have been able to stand such a scent, as it is relatively mild once out of the shower. I have not broken out from the stuff, either.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am a man with a short haircut, and it works as a shampoo for me. No flakes, soft hair. Nice to have one bottle for hair, face &amp; body.</li>
            <li> This product says \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; all over it, but has a STRONG perfume smell - fragrance is listed as an ingredient. If you call, they will tell you that it is a \\&quot;masking scent\\&quot; - yes, I call that scented. I don&#x27;t find it to be any milder than the regularly scented body washes.</li>
            <li> Very happy shopping at a time, the goods is very good, use is convenient, next time will come again, thank you</li>
            <li> Okay, this does have a minor scent to it, but it&#x27;s an very very light earthy smell. Like a faint aloe smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t find this in stores and it&#x27;s the only body wash that doesn&#x27;t leave me scratching like a fiend when I hop out of the shower. My skin is very sensitive, and very dry. This stuff is the best for those with skin like mine. It&#x27;s cheaper online than in stores (compared to the other flavors, like I said I can&#x27;t find this exact one in any store), and I go through about four of these 18oz bottles a year. So it lasts long and still works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only shower gel I will [hopefully] ever use. Highly recommend, even if it is slightly misguiding when it says &amp;#34;Scent-Free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> For some reason the stores have stopped carrying this.  My wife hates and I mean hates the scents on most soaps that I use.  This unscented solves that problem.  Works the same without the pretty smell.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this body wash. I have sensitive skin, so I am always trying to find products that do not irritate. I have tried many conventional types of wash, some of which I may enjoy, that cause a reaction. Dove Men Sensitive works for me, with no skin reaction. It may not be truly unscented, but the fragrance is not overpowering. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Product - Dove Men with Care Body and Face Wash, Sensitive Skin, 18 ounce (Package of two) is difficult to find in stores.  The price at the store and Amazon&#x27;s advertised price is not very different but you can order this product and have it delivered as needed, which is a huge blessing when it is doctor recommended and you cannot find it at the store.  I love the fact that it comes in a 2-Pack.  By the time he has used all of the product, or almost all of it, it is time for another shipment.  Amazon is the way to go if you are in a situation that you cannot do without!  I purchase almost everything from Amazon.com!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Rebecca Stewart&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004DBS91O Dove Men with Care Body and Face Wash, Sensitive Skin, 18-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> The only men&#x27;s body wash I&#x27;ve been able to find that doesn&#x27;t have an overly strong smell, which I can&#x27;t stand. These are larger sized containers and the pack of two makes it fairly economical.</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the best body wash I have ever used.  I usually don&#x27;t give a perfect rating unless a product deserves it, but I was exceptionally pleased.  I should have removed one star for the fact that it does have a scent as others have mentioned, but due to how well it is for my psoriasis, I will give it 5 stars.  I imagine this would be just as good for other dry skin conditions such as eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Foams very well&lt;br /&gt;-Lowest amount of skin drying compared to every other product I have used&lt;br /&gt;-Smells well&lt;br /&gt;-Good Package and large amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-should let set for 2 minutes to allow product to set in&lt;br /&gt;-does have scent (not bad though)</li>
            <li> Does a great job of hydrating my skin in the cold winter months! Dove is the best! Good price too.</li>
            <li> I like it because it makes me feel comfortable. I don&#x27;t feel dry or itchy or anything. BUT I hope it can smell better.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo at Target because I have sensitive skin and this finally has proven to be a shampoo that I can tolerate. Unfortunately, the next time I went to buy it at Target, they no longer carried it! I checked Amazon and was surprised and relieved that they had it, and it is cheaper or approximately the same price as it was in store.</li>
            <li> Good value and I can not find this in a y store in my area. I can only use sensitive skin soaps. Even some of them give me a rash. This one is perfect!</li>
            <li> My husband felt it was a little too &amp;#34;strong smelling&amp;#34; but I know I liked it.  Came quickly and it was purchased with a group of things that I needed fast.</li>
            <li> Called Unilever/Dover regarding the fragrance.  I was told that a fragrance is added to \\&quot;mask\\&quot; the naturally occurring smell of the ingredients.  This is really wrong, and is totally false advertising.  The Unilever rep was very understanding and has issued free coupons to reimburse me for the coast of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I think Unilever should not market this product as unscented. FDA complaint, anyone?</li>
            <li> Not much to say about body wash. I smell good and my skin does not react badly to it when it has before to other smelly or colored body washes/shampoos. It works where others have not. Would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> Hope they don&#x27;t stop making this one.  To meet the word requirement----Hope they don&#x27;t stop making this one.  still need 2 more words!</li>
            <li> would give it zero if i could. since when does an UNSCENTED product have FRAGRANCE listed?</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant and light odor to it, but it wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I had hoped. I have sensitive skin and I still have to moisturize after I take a shower. It didn&#x27;t make any extremely noticeable difference when compared to the other versions of Dove Men&#x27;s body wash that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband cause his skin is so sensitive and it works great! I love the slight scent it has too even though it says non scented, it still smells and works great!</li>
