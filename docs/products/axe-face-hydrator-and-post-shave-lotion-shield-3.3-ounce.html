            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a nice scent, noticeable but not overwhelming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Face Hydrator and Post-Shave Lotion does a nice job.</li>
            <li>While this is not greasy as in oily, it has some kind of slippery silicone feeling to it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the disaster with my son&#x27;s skin, I decided to try the lotion on my own skin and see how it worked.  </li>
            <li>but cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like Heinz ketchup.  </li>
            <li>And it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and smells good.</li>
            <li>, It works well, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, sticky or smelly!</li>
            <li>I applied this product on my face, first thing I noticed was that it did not smell great.  </li>
            <li>When applied it feel very smooth and luxurious.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells so good and has a gel/lotion texture to it and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>However, it felt okay on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love that you don&#x27;t feel like you have a layer of oily lotion on after applying.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot better than alcohol</li>
            <li>and he makes sure he never runs out.</li>
            <li>(the scent and feel is much better than lotion)</li>
            <li>this stuff helped my face feel more elastic after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most Axe products</li>
            <li>are the things that I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ingenious.  </li>
            <li>: Why is this better?</li>
            <li>Why is thicker ketchup better?  </li>
            <li>The cream is light, silky and spreads very easily.</li>
            <li>Its fragrance is not too strong like so many Axe products.</li>
            <li>Face Hydrator and Post-Shave Lotion is easy to use - you can use it in the morning, at night, or any time you shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the items that to me has the strong axe smell.</li>
            <li>He says it works fine and doesn&#x27;t cause any adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li>As with the Axe Shied face wash, this style of packaging is sleek and easy to dispense without wasting product, and bottle seems to be designed to be comfortable to handle with the side grips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve posted positive comments on Axe chilled products and this is another that I&#x27;ve tried and liked.  </li>
            <li>This would be a perfect product for sensitive skin if they dropped the fragrance completely.</li>
            <li>This aftershave lotion has a nice scent and is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is a nice moisturizer that can be used over the whole face.  </li>
            <li>Axe Face Hydrator Post Shave Lotion is designed to work as a Day and Night Moisturizer leaving your skin feeling smooth all day and night.</li>
            <li>I would say this is a light to mid-weight lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>I also used the lotion after shaving my bikini line, and once again my skin was smooth with no bumps or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The AXE product line is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This stuff not only smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li>Then, I had a chance to try this Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Lotion for free through Amazon Vine.  </li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>SO a good scent for young people.</li>
            <li>Instead, I feel my face cool and smooth.</li>
            <li>Has a nice and pleasant manly scent that is not to strong over overpowering (I am highly sensitive to chemical smells and things and for some reason I seem to be immunie to AXE and that&#x27;s something for the plus column) - I also have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After trying everything from Astringent cleaners, bump creams, and witch hazel to treat and prevent razor bumps, I found the right ELECTRIC trimmer (NOT RAZOR!), the [[ASIN:B000BBF4KO Andis Professional Styliner II Personal Trimmer (26700)]] (through Amazon!), and the perfect after shave moisturizer/gel, which is this Axe product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, they are both nice cool and soothing after shaves, not like the old alcohol based stinging ones.  </li>
            <li>It also has good ingredients such as cucumber and jojoba.</li>
            <li>Even the dispenser is kinda cool.  </li>
            <li>His skin sensitive and eczema are not conducive to a nice feeling after shaving.</li>
            <li>It does have that familiar \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; fragrance, which I can&#x27;t accurately describe other than to say it is \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; and quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It really does a great job of keeping your face feeling hydrated and smooth long after your done shaving.</li>
            <li>I was extremely brand loyal, as I thought it worked great for soothing my skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li>A tiny bit goes a long way, so there is excellent value.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to irritants, and my face breaks out with many natural-seeming ingredients (like lavender oil, witch hazel and citrus oil).</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of moisturizing, which is something that is appreciated after the rough winter we&#x27;ve had here in New England.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a lot so this should last him about 2 months of more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving his softer skin.</li>
            <li>Hence, using a more alluring scent on my face can make me feel young again.  </li>
            <li>Hours later, I&#x27;m more comfortable as well.  </li>
            <li>One push of the head dispenses just the right amount of lotion for me to apply to my face after a shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much, so one bottle will last a while and the pump top lets you easily get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Main difference that I could detect was the scent, Axe having a somewhat more masculine scent.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with this product and would definitely get again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer and will continue to use it, and would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Axe products since they first hit the market.</li>
            <li>The problem is that he&#x27;s just not one to take the time to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>i personally like the gel better</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would use again and probably buy... but would get the cooling gel first.</li>
            <li>I cannot say better, but certainly equally.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients-wise, again, I am hugely impressed, and surprised Axe doesn&#x27;t make a big deal out of the quality, skin-soothing compounds they add: grape seed extract, cucumber extract, bamboo extract, Vitamins A and E, jojoba seed extract, green tea extract, a form of willow bark, and, of course, a lot of glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and fresh long after the shave.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is a creamy white color, almost pearly, and with a \\&quot;generic\\&quot; Axe smell which is not too strong and which I found goes well with a lot of their products.  </li>
            <li>My teenage son has very sensitive skin, so there aren&#x27;t many products he can use on his face without him breaking out.</li>
            <li>Well, I bought it since it was cheap and wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>For me it was too moist, so much</li>
            <li>My brother has been using this faithfully every day and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>It was a torture really.</li>
            <li>In fact, I didn&#x27;t really smell anything.</li>
            <li>But even as a post-shave lotion, if you touch your face, it gets on your hands, and it is very slippery stuff.  </li>
            <li>Because of his oily skin, he doesn&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot;, but he does sometimes have irritation from shaving.  </li>
            <li>I really like this post shave lotion and hydrate by Axe.</li>
            <li>Axe is much thicker/stiffer than Nivea, and I prefer this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get the whole axe scent deal, some of their products have a strong scent which I don&#x27;t like while others are minor</li>
            <li>One of my frustrations with my old Nivea routine was getting the right amount of lotion out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>- Duh!? :P</li>
            <li>The scent was a little more manly than the Dove product, but still pretty fey if you ask me.</li>
            <li>The scent is solid and clean.  </li>
            <li>Only good thing about this product is that it gets your face hydrated for few hours</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dries and just leaves a faint good smell that&#x27;s fresh and manly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by my husband.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is thin, goes on smoothly, and is absorbed fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, I question the addition of fragrance to a product designed for sensitive skin, as most skin reactions are due to added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is chock-full of more antioxidants than any formulation I&#x27;ve seen besides the Paula&#x27;s Choice stuff (which is not available in stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t even use the names people normally recognize them as (ie - Tocopherol for Vitamin E).</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband who normally likes Axe products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had to learn to shave every day (the RIGHT WAY) and use this Axe product 3-4 times a day to prevent razor bumps, and it&#x27;s now a part of my daily</li>
            <li>He also says that it leaves his skin feeling very soft after shaving, so this is a product I will be buying for him again and again.</li>
            <li>Or maybe when marketing to men, mentioning actual ingredients isn&#x27;t done. ;)</li>
            <li>This product comes out white and feels a bit greasy slimy at first-</li>
            <li>He has had no problems with the product and he normally has sensitive skin, so according to him everyone should try this</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>There is also only one notable skin irritant in this Axe product - the fragrance - but the scent is mild enough, and far enough down the list of ingredients, that I can use this on my face and be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to pick a favorite between this and the Dove product, but I would say if you are a fan of Axe and have been looking for an after shave balm, this will probably meet or exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li>I have an oily and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>prefer the sensitive formula of Dove men&#x27;s post shave lotion, even the Dove hydrate, just because the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a masculine scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves his skin soft and gets rid of</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, but have no problem using this product.</li>
            <li>Shave directly AFTER you shower and stroke the electric trimmer in the direction your hair grows, never against.</li>
            <li>If you do not have sensitive skin, then this product should work well for you.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put too much on, or the next time you run that razor, you may be shaving the tops off of your pimples.  </li>
            <li>For years, I have been using Nivea Post-Shave Balm [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by this</li>
            <li>Even with the higher price for future purchases, I have decided that I am not going back to Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, if you have minor razor burn, it is very soothing and cooling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young male with soft and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t that strong - it&#x27;s not nearly as strong as traditional alcohol based aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I can&#x27;t really use it on my dry hands.  </li>
            <li>Like its competitor, this Axe product only needs a little dab applied to the fingers to be able to massage into the skin and cover one&#x27;s whole face with just a few strokes.</li>
            <li>I much prefer something to completely absorb in and you don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s there (other than it is moisturizing).</li>
            <li>short, if you have sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out, this product may cause some bumps and irritation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i guess i have sensitive skin, but ONLY when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li>likes moisturizers and aftershave, but is frequently put off the scent of the former (too feminine) or the strength of the latter</li>
            <li>I use this also after shaving to reduce irritation due to shaving and mainly at night as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The scent is hard to describe, but it is mild.</li>
            <li>No more trying to get just the right amount out of a bottle by tipping it and shaking it.  </li>
            <li>It smooths dry and irritated skin and has a non-irritating formula for men with sensitive</li>
            <li>The product leaves a faint oily residue, but it is quite comfortable and not unlike normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>scent, alas, is a bit strong.</li>
            <li>The lotion is especially formulated for those of use who have sensitive or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Because of this it has almost no added fragrance</li>
            <li>it is a little pricey for what it does and how much you get.</li>
            <li>It really does feel like it&#x27;s relieving a lot of little cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As with the Axe Shied face wash, this style of packaging is sleek and easy to dispense without wasting product, and bottle seems to be designed to be comfortable to handle with the side grips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted positive comments on Axe chilled products and this is another that I&#x27;ve tried and liked.  </li>
            <li> This would be a perfect product for sensitive skin if they dropped the fragrance completely.</li>
            <li> This aftershave lotion has a nice scent and is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is a nice moisturizer that can be used over the whole face.  </li>
            <li> Axe Face Hydrator Post Shave Lotion is designed to work as a Day and Night Moisturizer leaving your skin feeling smooth all day and night.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a light to mid-weight lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> I also used the lotion after shaving my bikini line, and once again my skin was smooth with no bumps or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The AXE product line is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This stuff not only smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li> Then, I had a chance to try this Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Lotion for free through Amazon Vine.  </li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> SO a good scent for young people.</li>
            <li> Instead, I feel my face cool and smooth.</li>
            <li> Has a nice and pleasant manly scent that is not to strong over overpowering (I am highly sensitive to chemical smells and things and for some reason I seem to be immunie to AXE and that&#x27;s something for the plus column) - I also have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After trying everything from Astringent cleaners, bump creams, and witch hazel to treat and prevent razor bumps, I found the right ELECTRIC trimmer (NOT RAZOR!), the [[ASIN:B000BBF4KO Andis Professional Styliner II Personal Trimmer (26700)]] (through Amazon!), and the perfect after shave moisturizer/gel, which is this Axe product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, they are both nice cool and soothing after shaves, not like the old alcohol based stinging ones.  </li>
            <li> It also has good ingredients such as cucumber and jojoba.</li>
            <li> Even the dispenser is kinda cool.  </li>
            <li> His skin sensitive and eczema are not conducive to a nice feeling after shaving.</li>
            <li> It does have that familiar \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; fragrance, which I can&#x27;t accurately describe other than to say it is \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; and quite pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It really does a great job of keeping your face feeling hydrated and smooth long after your done shaving.</li>
            <li> I was extremely brand loyal, as I thought it worked great for soothing my skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way, so there is excellent value.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to irritants, and my face breaks out with many natural-seeming ingredients (like lavender oil, witch hazel and citrus oil).</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of moisturizing, which is something that is appreciated after the rough winter we&#x27;ve had here in New England.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot so this should last him about 2 months of more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving his softer skin.</li>
            <li> Hence, using a more alluring scent on my face can make me feel young again.  </li>
            <li> Hours later, I&#x27;m more comfortable as well.  </li>
            <li> One push of the head dispenses just the right amount of lotion for me to apply to my face after a shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much, so one bottle will last a while and the pump top lets you easily get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Main difference that I could detect was the scent, Axe having a somewhat more masculine scent.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with this product and would definitely get again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer and will continue to use it, and would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Axe products since they first hit the market.</li>
            <li> The problem is that he&#x27;s just not one to take the time to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> i personally like the gel better</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would use again and probably buy... but would get the cooling gel first.</li>
            <li> I cannot say better, but certainly equally.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients-wise, again, I am hugely impressed, and surprised Axe doesn&#x27;t make a big deal out of the quality, skin-soothing compounds they add: grape seed extract, cucumber extract, bamboo extract, Vitamins A and E, jojoba seed extract, green tea extract, a form of willow bark, and, of course, a lot of glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and fresh long after the shave.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is a creamy white color, almost pearly, and with a \\&quot;generic\\&quot; Axe smell which is not too strong and which I found goes well with a lot of their products.  </li>
            <li> My teenage son has very sensitive skin, so there aren&#x27;t many products he can use on his face without him breaking out.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought it since it was cheap and wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For me it was too moist, so much</li>
            <li> My brother has been using this faithfully every day and really likes it.  </li>
            <li> It was a torture really.</li>
            <li> In fact, I didn&#x27;t really smell anything.</li>
            <li> But even as a post-shave lotion, if you touch your face, it gets on your hands, and it is very slippery stuff.  </li>
            <li> Because of his oily skin, he doesn&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot;, but he does sometimes have irritation from shaving.  </li>
            <li> I really like this post shave lotion and hydrate by Axe.</li>
            <li> Axe is much thicker/stiffer than Nivea, and I prefer this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get the whole axe scent deal, some of their products have a strong scent which I don&#x27;t like while others are minor</li>
            <li> One of my frustrations with my old Nivea routine was getting the right amount of lotion out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> - Duh!? :P</li>
            <li> The scent was a little more manly than the Dove product, but still pretty fey if you ask me.</li>
            <li> The scent is solid and clean.  </li>
            <li> Only good thing about this product is that it gets your face hydrated for few hours</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dries and just leaves a faint good smell that&#x27;s fresh and manly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by my husband.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thin, goes on smoothly, and is absorbed fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, I question the addition of fragrance to a product designed for sensitive skin, as most skin reactions are due to added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is chock-full of more antioxidants than any formulation I&#x27;ve seen besides the Paula&#x27;s Choice stuff (which is not available in stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even use the names people normally recognize them as (ie - Tocopherol for Vitamin E).</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who normally likes Axe products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to learn to shave every day (the RIGHT WAY) and use this Axe product 3-4 times a day to prevent razor bumps, and it&#x27;s now a part of my daily</li>
            <li> He also says that it leaves his skin feeling very soft after shaving, so this is a product I will be buying for him again and again.</li>
            <li> Or maybe when marketing to men, mentioning actual ingredients isn&#x27;t done. ;)</li>
            <li> This product comes out white and feels a bit greasy slimy at first-</li>
            <li> He has had no problems with the product and he normally has sensitive skin, so according to him everyone should try this</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> There is also only one notable skin irritant in this Axe product - the fragrance - but the scent is mild enough, and far enough down the list of ingredients, that I can use this on my face and be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to pick a favorite between this and the Dove product, but I would say if you are a fan of Axe and have been looking for an after shave balm, this will probably meet or exceed your expectations.</li>
            <li> I have an oily and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> prefer the sensitive formula of Dove men&#x27;s post shave lotion, even the Dove hydrate, just because the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a masculine scent.</li>
            <li> It leaves his skin soft and gets rid of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, but have no problem using this product.</li>
            <li> Shave directly AFTER you shower and stroke the electric trimmer in the direction your hair grows, never against.</li>
            <li> If you do not have sensitive skin, then this product should work well for you.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put too much on, or the next time you run that razor, you may be shaving the tops off of your pimples.  </li>
            <li> For years, I have been using Nivea Post-Shave Balm [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by this</li>
            <li> Even with the higher price for future purchases, I have decided that I am not going back to Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, if you have minor razor burn, it is very soothing and cooling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young male with soft and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t that strong - it&#x27;s not nearly as strong as traditional alcohol based aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I can&#x27;t really use it on my dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Like its competitor, this Axe product only needs a little dab applied to the fingers to be able to massage into the skin and cover one&#x27;s whole face with just a few strokes.</li>
            <li> I much prefer something to completely absorb in and you don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s there (other than it is moisturizing).</li>
            <li> short, if you have sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out, this product may cause some bumps and irritation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i guess i have sensitive skin, but ONLY when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li> likes moisturizers and aftershave, but is frequently put off the scent of the former (too feminine) or the strength of the latter</li>
            <li> I use this also after shaving to reduce irritation due to shaving and mainly at night as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The scent is hard to describe, but it is mild.</li>
            <li> No more trying to get just the right amount out of a bottle by tipping it and shaking it.  </li>
            <li> It smooths dry and irritated skin and has a non-irritating formula for men with sensitive</li>
            <li> The product leaves a faint oily residue, but it is quite comfortable and not unlike normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> scent, alas, is a bit strong.</li>
            <li> The lotion is especially formulated for those of use who have sensitive or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Because of this it has almost no added fragrance</li>
            <li> it is a little pricey for what it does and how much you get.</li>
            <li> It really does feel like it&#x27;s relieving a lot of little cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent for this post shave lotion/aftershave didn&#x27;t last quite as long as he noticed the face wash lasting on his skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; or the fragrance, but something really did a number on his chin and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally a product that moisturizes dry skin AND acts as a post-shave lotion.</li>
            <li> It is relatively thin and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> This shave lotion is somewhat thin and has a slippery consistency, and a mild scent.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and shaving (however it&#x27;s done) is always a little traumatic.</li>
            <li> scent is a little like suntan lotion, in a masculine way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly in the target demographic for Axe, which I believe is younger and hipper than I,</li>
            <li> First off i have to say axe has stepped up there game by providing us guys with face products...</li>
            <li> and I think this helps the skin to recover well after shaving, making the next shave that little bit easier.</li>
            <li> This felt a little cooler going on and ever so slightly greasier (though hardly what I would call \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; in the first place).</li>
            <li> Next day, I started to get few breakouts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> His solution: to wet his hands and apply a bit of the lotion to his face.</li>
            <li> on like a wet soap.  </li>
            <li> It does have a little stronger fragrance then other products, but being a teenager, it&#x27;s something he actually prefers.</li>
            <li> leave the little plug in the pump opening in an effort to help keep the antioxidants and anti-irritants stable for as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little of the lotion goes a long way over my face.</li>
            <li> Both my guys like it - one is 17 and the other is 45.  </li>
            <li> He has always used other Axe products but had never tried the face hydrator / post shave lotion before, since trying it</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t masculine enough that I feel weird using this as my nightly moisturizer (my day moisturizer has sunscreen in it;</li>
            <li> Shave Balm, Active Comfort System, 3.3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]].  </li>
            <li> It tones down the scent (think \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; vs. \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;) while still retaining the lotion&#x27;s benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Add in the pump, the scent, and the thickness, and Axe is the winner hands down.</li>
            <li> I noticed less redness after shaving almost immediately after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it made a mess as there was little substance to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After few hours, my face got greasy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting and keeps the face from feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> He used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> I had to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave my legs when I realized I had missed a few spots shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Some things just ARE what they ARE, and are not worthy of excessive thought.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> (I usually do when I have to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave)</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Mach 3 razor lately), and there&#x27;s no irritation from the shave (I tend to have that issue).  </li>
            <li> so he doesn&#x27;t have painful red spots on his face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is thin and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> So, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product, it&#x27;s just poor user compliance.</li>
            <li> This morning I used the AXE after shave and I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I hate greasy products.  </li>
            <li> I found this aspect really annoying.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Well, I bought it since it was cheap and wanted to try something different. I have been using kyoku oil control lotion and found this in a grocery store on sale and tried it.  I have an oily and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied this product on my face, first thing I noticed was that it did not smell great.  It has a generic scent which I did not like. However, it felt okay on my skin.  After few hours, my face got greasy.  Next day, I started to get few breakouts on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do not like this product and I would not recommend this product to those with oily/sensitive face.  Only good thing about this product is that it gets your face hydrated for few hours and it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This aftershave lotion has a nice scent and is very soothing.  This lotion is a nice moisturizer that can be used over the whole face.  Pleased with this product and would definitely get again.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic facial moisturizer. It is chock-full of more antioxidants than any formulation I&#x27;ve seen besides the Paula&#x27;s Choice stuff (which is not available in stores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to irritants, and my face breaks out with many natural-seeming ingredients (like lavender oil, witch hazel and citrus oil). There is also only one notable skin irritant in this Axe product - the fragrance - but the scent is mild enough, and far enough down the list of ingredients, that I can use this on my face and be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave the little plug in the pump opening in an effort to help keep the antioxidants and anti-irritants stable for as long as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of the lotion goes a long way over my face. The cream is light, silky and spreads very easily. The scent isn&#x27;t masculine enough that I feel weird using this as my nightly moisturizer (my day moisturizer has sunscreen in it; this doesn&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients-wise, again, I am hugely impressed, and surprised Axe doesn&#x27;t make a big deal out of the quality, skin-soothing compounds they add: grape seed extract, cucumber extract, bamboo extract, Vitamins A and E, jojoba seed extract, green tea extract, a form of willow bark, and, of course, a lot of glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t even use the names people normally recognize them as (ie - Tocopherol for Vitamin E). They must figure that the lotion speaks for itself as an aftershaving soother, without having to crow about it. Or maybe when marketing to men, mentioning actual ingredients isn&#x27;t done. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I am female and use this for nighttime moisturizing, after my cleanser, toner and exfoliation creams. This would be a perfect product for sensitive skin if they dropped the fragrance completely. Five stars anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s but had the chance to try this out so I did. I really don&#x27;t get the whole axe scent deal, some of their products have a strong scent which I don&#x27;t like while others are minor and I do like them. This is one of the items that to me has the strong axe smell. Also, it&#x27;s \\&quot;hydrate\\&quot; which means it&#x27;s extra moist. For me it was too moist, so much so it made a mess as there was little substance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the sensitive formula of Dove men&#x27;s post shave lotion, even the Dove hydrate, just because the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I&#x27;m passing on this.</li>
            <li> The Axe post shave lotion really is good. Goes on ease, relieves the burn associated with shaving and smells good. The scent is not overpowering to the wearer either, so I like that a lot. Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Axe Face Hydrator Post Shave Lotion, is a great addition to your Axe collection. The lotion is especially formulated for those of use who have sensitive or dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Because of this it has almost no added fragrance what so ever so there are no added perfumes that will irritate your skin. I noticed less redness after shaving almost immediately after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Axe Face Hydrator Post Shave Lotion is designed to work as a Day and Night Moisturizer leaving your skin feeling smooth all day and night. I absolutely love this moisturizer and will continue to use it, and would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Main difference that I could detect was the scent, Axe having a somewhat more masculine scent.  Otherwise, they are both nice cool and soothing after shaves, not like the old alcohol based stinging ones.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a light to mid-weight lotion. Its fragrance is not too strong like so many Axe products. It has a masculine scent. The scent is hard to describe, but it is mild. It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin very soft. It is non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Axe products since they first hit the market. While the Axe products I&#x27;ve used always did the job, we all know the best thing about them is the scent and this one is no exception. I have sensitive skin and shaving (however it&#x27;s done) is always a little traumatic. I get red splotches on my neck and it burns quite a bit as well. The AXE Face Hydrator and Post Shave Lotion, Shield soothes the burn and leaves the skin moist and smelling great.</li>
            <li> The AXE Face Hydrator and Post Shave lotion has a pleasant aroma and goes on without a sticky or greasy feeling. It doesn&#x27;t sting and keeps the face from feeling dried out. Nice product.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and works in well. Has a nice and pleasant manly scent that is not to strong over overpowering (I am highly sensitive to chemical smells and things and for some reason I seem to be immunie to AXE and that&#x27;s something for the plus column) - I also have pretty sensitive skin and I have no quirks about this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Soothes Skin&lt;br /&gt;Rubs in Well&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant Aroma&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None - Duh!? :P</li>
            <li> Axe Face Hydrator and Post-Shave Lotion has a non-greasy formula that moisturizes your skin after shaving.  It smooths dry and irritated skin and has a non-irritating formula for men with sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe Face Hydrator and Post-Shave Lotion is easy to use - you can use it in the morning, at night, or any time you shave. It does an excellent job of moisturizing, which is something that is appreciated after the rough winter we&#x27;ve had here in New England.  My brother has been using this faithfully every day and really likes it.  He shaves at night but still feels like his skin is being moisturized during the day.  The lotion has a nice scent, noticeable but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe Face Hydrator and Post-Shave Lotion does a nice job.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who normally likes Axe products.  He used it a few times.  He says it works fine and doesn&#x27;t cause any adverse reactions.  The smell is pleasant.  The problem is that he&#x27;s just not one to take the time to use it consistently.  So, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product, it&#x27;s just poor user compliance.</li>
            <li> As I wrote in my review of [[ASIN:B00A0J0A8I Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Post Shave Balm, 3.4 Ounce]], I don&#x27;t have a regular shaving routine, so I&#x27;ve been mixing blade/gel, blade/foam, electric/dry and electric/wet shaves with this and the Dove product. Like its competitor, this Axe product only needs a little dab applied to the fingers to be able to massage into the skin and cover one&#x27;s whole face with just a few strokes. This felt a little cooler going on and ever so slightly greasier (though hardly what I would call \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; in the first place). The scent was a little more manly than the Dove product, but still pretty fey if you ask me. It definitely made my skin feel softer to the touch and I think this helps the skin to recover well after shaving, making the next shave that little bit easier. Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to pick a favorite between this and the Dove product, but I would say if you are a fan of Axe and have been looking for an after shave balm, this will probably meet or exceed your expectations. I like it.</li>
            <li> Review by my husband, since he used it! John: \\&quot;I wet shave, and my skin is fairly sensitive. This is wonderful! My skin feels smooth and fresh long after the shave. It is odorless, It works well, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy, sticky or smelly! Plus, if you have minor razor burn, it is very soothing and cooling. This is now part of my daily shaving routine.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This after-shave lotion is simply amazing. I&#x27;m a young male with soft and sensitive skin. Before, I use a \\&quot;generic\\&quot; after-shave product. It was a torture really. I felt like I just applied rubbing alcohol on my face and I totally felt my face burning. This morning I used the AXE after shave and I was shocked. No burning feeling at all. Instead, I feel my face cool and smooth. The \\&quot;minty\\&quot; feeling lasted for almost an hour. The scent is not strong at all. In fact, I didn&#x27;t really smell anything. Very very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> First off i have to say axe has stepped up there game by providing us guys with face products...this stuff smells so good and has a gel/lotion texture to it and absorbs quickly. When applied it feel very smooth and luxurious. It also has good ingredients such as cucumber and jojoba. I use this also after shaving to reduce irritation due to shaving and mainly at night as a moisturizer.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> The title is a quote from my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes moisturizers and aftershave, but is frequently put off the scent of the former (too feminine) or the strength of the latter (overpowering.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s a fan of the entire AXE line, and the Hydrator and Post Shave Lotion didn&#x27;t disappoint. It leaves his skin soft and gets rid of post-shave irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent, alas, is a bit strong. His solution: to wet his hands and apply a bit of the lotion to his face. It tones down the scent (think \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; vs. \\&quot;perfume\\&quot;) while still retaining the lotion&#x27;s benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with the price? A definite win/win.</li>
            <li> As a moisturizing lotion, I found this works excellent.  It is relatively thin and absorbs quickly.  A tiny bit goes a long way, so there is excellent value.  Even the dispenser is kinda cool.  The lotion itself is a creamy white color, almost pearly, and with a \\&quot;generic\\&quot; Axe smell which is not too strong and which I found goes well with a lot of their products.  It has glycerin and a lot of plant extracts in it which I like in a good hydrating moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only 3 stars?  I hate greasy products.  While this is not greasy as in oily, it has some kind of slippery silicone feeling to it.  Thus, I can&#x27;t really use it on my dry hands.  But even as a post-shave lotion, if you touch your face, it gets on your hands, and it is very slippery stuff.  It&#x27;s like everything it touches becomes teflon/silicone coated.  I found this aspect really annoying.  I much prefer something to completely absorb in and you don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s there (other than it is moisturizing).</li>
            <li> This AXE lotion is suppose to be used after you&#x27;ve shaved to reduce irritation and moisturize. It does what it is suppose to. Overall, great product. I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, but have no problem using this product. It is thin and not greasy at all. Shortly after applying, it is dry/absorbed. Love that you don&#x27;t feel like you have a layer of oily lotion on after applying. It is smooth and smells good. If you&#x27;re on the fence, I say give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product comes out white and feels a bit greasy slimy at first- it&#x27;s a lot better than alcohol though - there&#x27;s no burn.  Both my guys like it - one is 17 and the other is 45.  It rubs into skin and leaves it feeling moisturized.  The scent isn&#x27;t that strong - it&#x27;s not nearly as strong as traditional alcohol based aftershave.  It&#x27;s dries and just leaves a faint good smell that&#x27;s fresh and manly.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much, so one bottle will last a while and the pump top lets you easily get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The man of the house is partial to Axe and recently tried the face wash from this \\&quot;Shield\\&quot; line which is designed for sensitive skin. The scent for this post shave lotion/aftershave didn&#x27;t last quite as long as he noticed the face wash lasting on his skin.  He mentions that this aftershave moisturizes and makes his skin feel soothed.  As with the Axe Shied face wash, this style of packaging is sleek and easy to dispense without wasting product, and bottle seems to be designed to be comfortable to handle with the side grips.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this daily not only for shaving but also as a moisturizer.  He has always used other Axe products but had never tried the face hydrator / post shave lotion before, since trying it he now has to have it and he makes sure he never runs out. He has had no problems with the product and he normally has sensitive skin, so according to him everyone should try this and he raves about it.  Highly recommended by my husband.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American, and I feel like I have the nappiest hair on Earth. Proud of it, but maaaan the razor bumps after a shave! After trying everything from Astringent cleaners, bump creams, and witch hazel to treat and prevent razor bumps, I found the right ELECTRIC trimmer (NOT RAZOR!), the [[ASIN:B000BBF4KO Andis Professional Styliner II Personal Trimmer (26700)]] (through Amazon!), and the perfect after shave moisturizer/gel, which is this Axe product. Smells great and the razor bumps are now gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had to learn to shave every day (the RIGHT WAY) and use this Axe product 3-4 times a day to prevent razor bumps, and it&#x27;s now a part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product. It&#x27;s worth it. And buy an Andis trimmer. Shave directly AFTER you shower and stroke the electric trimmer in the direction your hair grows, never against.</li>
            <li> My son has oily skin that is prone to breaking out.  Because of his oily skin, he doesn&#x27;t really need a \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot;, but he does sometimes have irritation from shaving.  This shave lotion is somewhat thin and has a slippery consistency, and a mild scent.  However, it did break my son&#x27;s skin out.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was the \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; or the fragrance, but something really did a number on his chin and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the disaster with my son&#x27;s skin, I decided to try the lotion on my own skin and see how it worked.  I had to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave my legs when I realized I had missed a few spots shaving in the shower.  I used the lotion on my legs afterward, and I had no irritation or bumps afterward (I usually do when I have to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shave) I also used the lotion after shaving my bikini line, and once again my skin was smooth with no bumps or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you have sensitive skin that is prone to breaking out, this product may cause some bumps and irritation.  If you do not have sensitive skin, then this product should work well for you.</li>
            <li> The AXE product line is fantastic.  All of their products rock.  This one leaves his skin smelling good and and softer than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot so this should last him about 2 months of more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m loving his softer skin.</li>
            <li> My teenage son has very sensitive skin, so there aren&#x27;t many products he can use on his face without him breaking out. This is one of the products that he can use. It does have a little stronger fragrance then other products, but being a teenager, it&#x27;s something he actually prefers. He also says that it leaves his skin feeling very soft after shaving, so this is a product I will be buying for him again and again.</li>
            <li> so i have this item and the afftershave gel. i personally like the gel better (the scent and feel is much better than lotion) but all in all this does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i guess i have sensitive skin, but ONLY when it comes to shaving. not sunburns, nor anything else. this stuff helped my face feel more elastic after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would use again and probably buy... but would get the cooling gel first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve posted positive comments on Axe chilled products and this is another that I&#x27;ve tried and liked.  The scent is solid and clean.  Just don&#x27;t put too much on, or the next time you run that razor, you may be shaving the tops off of your pimples.  Feels like it&#x27;s healing damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on like a wet soap.  but cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> I really like this post shave lotion and hydrate by Axe. It really does a great job of keeping your face feeling hydrated and smooth long after your done shaving. It is very easy to apply and has a great smell.  Like most Axe products it is a little pricey for what it does and how much you get.</li>
            <li> My son is just starting to shave, so I gave him this with a fancy razor. His skin sensitive and eczema are not conducive to a nice feeling after shaving. This stuff not only smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin. It soothes and moisturizes his skin so he doesn&#x27;t have painful red spots on his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a little like suntan lotion, in a masculine way. My son says that all his friends like it. SO a good scent for young people.</li>
            <li> This product is used after shaving, as a moisturizer and to reduce irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thin, goes on smoothly, and is absorbed fairly quickly.  There is no greasy or oily look to the skin after application.  It does have that familiar \\&quot;Axe\\&quot; fragrance, which I can&#x27;t accurately describe other than to say it is \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; and quite pleasant.  However, I question the addition of fragrance to a product designed for sensitive skin, as most skin reactions are due to added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> For years, I have been using Nivea Post-Shave Balm [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm, Active Comfort System, 3.3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]].  I was extremely brand loyal, as I thought it worked great for soothing my skin after shaving.  Then, I had a chance to try this Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Lotion for free through Amazon Vine.  WOW!  Even with the higher price for future purchases, I have decided that I am not going back to Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the things that I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Portion-Control Pump: Ingenious.  One of my frustrations with my old Nivea routine was getting the right amount of lotion out of the bottle.  This Axe pump is amazing!  One push of the head dispenses just the right amount of lotion for me to apply to my face after a shave.  No more trying to get just the right amount out of a bottle by tipping it and shaking it.  This pump alone is enough to make me choose Axe over Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Great Scent: I&#x27;m not exactly in the target demographic for Axe, which I believe is younger and hipper than I, though at 41, I am likely on the cusp of midlife crisis.  Hence, using a more alluring scent on my face can make me feel young again.  Then, I can rat out my chest hairs and buy a convertible sports car to drive around town while blasting Huey Lewis and the News.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Thicker: Why is this better? I don&#x27;t know.  It&#x27;s kind of like Heinz ketchup.  Why is thicker ketchup better?  Some things just ARE what they ARE, and are not worthy of excessive thought.  Axe is much thicker/stiffer than Nivea, and I prefer this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Soothing/Refreshing: Compared to Nivea, I think it serves the purpose equally.  I cannot say better, but certainly equally.  Add in the pump, the scent, and the thickness, and Axe is the winner hands down.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that moisturizes dry skin AND acts as a post-shave lotion. And it has a nice scent. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this every day for several weeks now, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my ingrown hairs are essentially eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just rub this into my face after I shave (I&#x27;ve been using a Gillette Mach 3 razor lately), and there&#x27;s no irritation from the shave (I tend to have that issue).  The product leaves a faint oily residue, but it is quite comfortable and not unlike normal moisturizer.  Hours later, I&#x27;m more comfortable as well.  It really does feel like it&#x27;s relieving a lot of little cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product quality is excellent, but the value for the product is merely &#x27;good&#x27;, hence the four stars.  I would buy this product.</li>
