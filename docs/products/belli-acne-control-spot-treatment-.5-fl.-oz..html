            <li>And who cares when you get great looking skin!!</li>
            <li>In addition, it smells great (this coming from the prego who wanted to vomit at the smell of almost anything!).</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>It goes on all &#x27;mmm.. tea tree oil... how pleasant!&#x27;</li>
            <li>So happy</li>
            <li>Great spot treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s non-toxic</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it ever has please never stop selling this!!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t very nice, but you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li>The product is very effective.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>It is not the best thing I have tried since being pregnant , but it does help!</li>
            <li>good quallity</li>
            <li>and it does a good job of cleaning off oil and make up.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Love this line of products!</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also safe to use under makeup or moisturizer!</li>
            <li>My face has cleared up in 6 days and my complexion is much much MUCH better!</li>
            <li>It worked so well, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, that I intend to use it even after I have the baby!</li>
            <li>It would be amazing - if you can get passed the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 days and the product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if I can use it again.  </li>
            <li>I would let the face wash sit on my skin for a minute or two (kind of like a face mask)</li>
            <li>, when I read most of the rviews about this product most of the people were complaining about the price, which is a lot for the size!</li>
            <li>As many women often do, I experienced the dreaded return of acne in my first trimester of pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I seemed to have more breakouts when I used it than when I went without.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I love that I can continue to use it when my husband and I decide to have kids.</li>
            <li>put on at night and in the morning spots look better.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for use during pregnancy as its ingredients are safe (unlike every anti-acne product I was using before).  </li>
            <li>Love Belli products, but</li>
            <li>However, it is safe during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this, now I can go out without being embarrassed and ashamed.</li>
            <li>I gave belli one more try and bought this spot treatment</li>
            <li>and it helps to control it better than the face wash.</li>
            <li>so I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I used it at night and all the acne look much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this works fine for some people, but my skin didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>my actually be in better condition now being pregnant!</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m happy my skin is clear</li>
            <li>smells great and really clears up acne during pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have every kind of pimple there is, right now including cystic, whiteheads, blackheads, plugged pores.  </li>
            <li>I found it worked best using it every other day.</li>
            <li>It also comes out of the tube very quickly</li>
            <li>I was so happy to have found a brand that was developed specifically for pregnant women.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I looked up many sites for more natural and safe remedies</li>
            <li>Of course I have read everything about every product available and have been hesitant to use anything because of the chemicals that should be avoided.</li>
            <li>Another good option is Burt&#x27;s Bees herbal acne stick, made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I also use the Belli lactic acid face wash and like it equally as much as this product but feel the spot treatment is clearing my acne more than the face wash.</li>
            <li>I am nearing the end of my first trimester and have been struggling with more blemishes than normal, mostly concentrated on my chin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 4 months pregnant and at about 2 months</li>
            <li>I bought this for my pregnant wife.</li>
            <li>and then quickly evaporates into sulfur STANK.</li>
            <li>If I were pregnant, there&#x27;s just no way.</li>
            <li>I got this because I was breaking out while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>It definitely made me feel better that I was able to apply something to my face to provide any relief from the acne.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t gonna try anything because of being pregnant, then I saw this that was made for pregnant women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Belli Acne Control Spot Treatment works pretty much just as well as benzoyl peroxide and is also considered safe for pregnant women.</li>
            <li>With few options out there for pregnant women, this was a great find.</li>
            <li>you have large blemishes you&#x27;ll have to use it during the evening and morning to make sure it really clears it</li>
            <li>This definitely is a useful product to have when harsher acne treatments are not an option.</li>
            <li>now if I could find something to make clothes fit normally!</li>
            <li>I broke out for the first time since I was 16 when I got pregnant.</li>
            <li>I also wear it under my make up otherwise the oils take over right away.</li>
            <li>Ok ladies, I have hormonal acne, which I had prior to getting pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Some may consider this an unfair review as I actually love the product and it is very effective when used as an all-over preventative treatment.  </li>
            <li>But it really zapped my zits!</li>
            <li>its pretty drying.</li>
            <li>only thing that has mostly cleared my pregnancy acne.</li>
            <li>After ONE NIGHT of covering most of my back with the spot treatment, I noticed a 50% reduction in the size &amp; severity of the pimples.</li>
            <li>I first got belli&#x27;s face wash and scrub but had no improvement.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product for any woman struggling with blemishes, pregnant or not.</li>
            <li>and it works great at clearing up small blemishes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m putting it pretty much all over my face after I put lotion on since I have pimples everywhere.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind spending a lil bit more money as long as I get what I need and</li>
            <li>I am not totally clear, but it is so much better.</li>
            <li>I still have a long way to go until I&#x27;m totally clear, but I bet that in a couple of weeks my skin will be as good as new.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin, when I became pregnant I started using this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and have dealt with mild adult acne for years.</li>
            <li>It made my skin break out more and became dry and patchy.  </li>
            <li>One of the main ingredients is Sulfur!  </li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had amazing results since starting the system only six days ago.</li>
            <li>my face absolutely erupted like I&#x27;ve never seen before in my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really give this product 2 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bummer because this product really did help blemishes--but IT STANKS.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really help my acne, just sort of inflames it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>You can blame it on my enhanced sense of smell, but I really can&#x27;t stand it, and since it isn&#x27;t making any noticeable improvements on my skin, I will not use anymore.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be effective but only with daily use.</li>
            <li>Not that it&#x27;s a super product because I am use to using advance skincare products and can see dramatic difference, but it&#x27;s a good maintainer.</li>
            <li>I have been using it sparingly because it can dry out my face easily</li>
            <li>Like most pregnant women, I am breaking out like crazy and I needed something safe for my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>with being so limited with what you can use in pregnancy this product is GREAT for trouble spots.</li>
            <li>I started getting breakouts several years ago, and I tried many over the counter facial meds, and some worked for a while then stopped working.</li>
            <li>but it does cause a bit of a mess and more product comes out than desired.</li>
            <li>and I read that Belli was a highly recommended</li>
            <li>In addition, it didn&#x27;t really work all that well for my early pregnancy acne.</li>
            <li>It really helped to clear up my skin and could be worn at all times of the day and night (even under makeup).</li>
            <li>I found this and the facial wash and figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll see how it works and write a new review, but</li>
            <li>Nearly $12 of new packaging on a $13 product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive stomach or a heightened sense of smell during pregnancy, look elsewhere for a pregnancy-safe spot treatment!  </li>
            <li>I use the scrub first, then the facial wash, then this spot treatment.</li>
            <li>My acne disappeared completely!</li>
            <li>and I was very excited about since I am having a lot of breakouts during my pregnancy, when I open the container to use it the top it was broken!</li>
            <li>Love this product apply a little to the area literally gone the next day</li>
            <li>I tried to go completely &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; when I found out I was pregnant and threw out all of my other acne products.  </li>
            <li>Also didn&#x27;t seem to clear my skin</li>
            <li>I have tried every natural thing I can find including tea tree oil, lotions with oils in them, face washes, etc.</li>
            <li>I am currently using the Belli cleanser and acne spot treatment and it is really helping me with my acne.</li>
            <li>I have not had any issues with drying like the product warns about, but if you have sensitive skin, I would use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>I can not fully fault the Belli line since I have been using strong prescription meds to control my acne over the past decade.  </li>
            <li>Too bad - because it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li>I have been searching high and low for anything that works.  </li>
            <li>Loved this cream the first time I bought it, but my recent shipment came in a broken tube so I lost half the product.</li>
            <li>To top it off, everything that I had previously used was off the table, due to the medications that are in them.  </li>
            <li>It helps to lessen the size but has not stopped new acne from popping up on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>but it did significantly help me and its not too expensive so its worth a try.</li>
            <li>Instead of having the cystic or white head acne, I&#x27;m only getting a few tiny little blemishes that aren&#x27;t visiable under good make up (and barely noticable without).  </li>
            <li>The top was broken, leak everywhere, going to return it</li>
            <li>They were less like raging volcanoes and more like dark red spots.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I could no longer use my normal products as I wanted something safe for my baby, so I bought this on a whim with Bella Bee foaming facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I do smell the sulfur slightly but it works so it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>The nozzle part came off with the cap the first time I used it and the content dried up before I could use it for a second time.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t want to be on anti-biotics long term because of the major side effects</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You can blame it on my enhanced sense of smell, but I really can&#x27;t stand it, and since it isn&#x27;t making any noticeable improvements on my skin, I will not use anymore.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be effective but only with daily use.</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s a super product because I am use to using advance skincare products and can see dramatic difference, but it&#x27;s a good maintainer.</li>
            <li> I have been using it sparingly because it can dry out my face easily</li>
            <li> Like most pregnant women, I am breaking out like crazy and I needed something safe for my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> with being so limited with what you can use in pregnancy this product is GREAT for trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I started getting breakouts several years ago, and I tried many over the counter facial meds, and some worked for a while then stopped working.</li>
            <li> but it does cause a bit of a mess and more product comes out than desired.</li>
            <li> and I read that Belli was a highly recommended</li>
            <li> In addition, it didn&#x27;t really work all that well for my early pregnancy acne.</li>
            <li> It really helped to clear up my skin and could be worn at all times of the day and night (even under makeup).</li>
            <li> I found this and the facial wash and figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll see how it works and write a new review, but</li>
            <li> Nearly $12 of new packaging on a $13 product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive stomach or a heightened sense of smell during pregnancy, look elsewhere for a pregnancy-safe spot treatment!  </li>
            <li> I use the scrub first, then the facial wash, then this spot treatment.</li>
            <li> My acne disappeared completely!</li>
            <li> and I was very excited about since I am having a lot of breakouts during my pregnancy, when I open the container to use it the top it was broken!</li>
            <li> Love this product apply a little to the area literally gone the next day</li>
            <li> I tried to go completely &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; when I found out I was pregnant and threw out all of my other acne products.  </li>
            <li> Also didn&#x27;t seem to clear my skin</li>
            <li> I have tried every natural thing I can find including tea tree oil, lotions with oils in them, face washes, etc.</li>
            <li> I am currently using the Belli cleanser and acne spot treatment and it is really helping me with my acne.</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with drying like the product warns about, but if you have sensitive skin, I would use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I can not fully fault the Belli line since I have been using strong prescription meds to control my acne over the past decade.  </li>
            <li> Too bad - because it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for anything that works.  </li>
            <li> Loved this cream the first time I bought it, but my recent shipment came in a broken tube so I lost half the product.</li>
            <li> To top it off, everything that I had previously used was off the table, due to the medications that are in them.  </li>
            <li> It helps to lessen the size but has not stopped new acne from popping up on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> but it did significantly help me and its not too expensive so its worth a try.</li>
            <li> Instead of having the cystic or white head acne, I&#x27;m only getting a few tiny little blemishes that aren&#x27;t visiable under good make up (and barely noticable without).  </li>
            <li> The top was broken, leak everywhere, going to return it</li>
            <li> They were less like raging volcanoes and more like dark red spots.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I could no longer use my normal products as I wanted something safe for my baby, so I bought this on a whim with Bella Bee foaming facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I do smell the sulfur slightly but it works so it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The nozzle part came off with the cap the first time I used it and the content dried up before I could use it for a second time.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t want to be on anti-biotics long term because of the major side effects</li>
            <li> and it took a month and a half to clear up the reaction spots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne and when I got pregnant it got worse.</li>
            <li> Really was not effective for me at all.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t dried out my face so far.</li>
            <li> and then I will get a pimple, but it was few and far between.</li>
            <li> so if you put it on your entire face its going to get very dry!</li>
            <li> All this seemed to do was dry out my skin, but had no affect on the acne.</li>
            <li> The sulphur in this treatment smells like rotten eggs on your face, not something you want wafts of when you are already barely keeping anything down!</li>
            <li> I finally went out the other day without having to spend a half an hour covering up the numerous pimples on my face!</li>
            <li> But I found the same products - both this spot treatment and the facial cleanser - on Amazon for a lower price and anxiously gave them a try.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time finding a non-toxic acne cream.</li>
            <li> i am very dissapointed about paying 17 dollars for a broken container.</li>
            <li> I am really not fond of this product though.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying it if they feel it may help them, just because I didnt see results from this doesn&#x27;t mean the next person will have the same experience.</li>
            <li> I had horrible acne when I was pregnant, especially in the first trimester.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t really leave an unpleasant film on my skin.</li>
            <li> There was some unknown mucus-like liquid outside the small paper box of this tube.</li>
            <li> so I tried other prescription meds that believe it or not</li>
            <li> Not exactly the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> But not sure about long-term effect - I received it yesterday and only used once.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One less thing to stress about during my pregnancy...</li>
            <li> Cleared my skin in less than 1 week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pregnant</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a big waste of money for me, since the poor quality container didn&#x27;t even give me the chance to use the product!</li>
            <li> I am still breaking out, but these products help me maintain or at least dry up existing acne.</li>
            <li> It can be a little over drying</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> , didn&#x27;t work and actually made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> I just got this product a few hours ago delivered</li>
            <li> The few spots that I was having issues with have virtually disappeared.</li>
            <li> I just got this about 5 days ago and since the 2nd night I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic decrease in the inflammation and pimples.</li>
            <li> product is a little expensive but definitely works on prenatal acne.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m worried it will dry out, poor packaging.</li>
            <li> Smells like sulfer (rotten eggs) so a little hard to ignore with pregnancy sense of smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny tube, and it&#x27;s difficult to not have everything spurt out when you are trying to use it.</li>
            <li> actually wrote to the company about this because while it is understandable that as time progresses, there will be some price increases, doubling the price to cover packaging is absurd.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I had to for this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is from the cream or the hormones balancing out.  </li>
            <li> I suggested that if they keep this insane price increase permanent that they at least offer the product in larger value sizes because the little tube doesn&#x27;t last very long as an all over treatment.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived leaking all over inside its cap due to a broken nosel tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such terrible acne until my pregnancy, but this really helped.</li>
            <li> Some people complained of the smell, but I did not find it to be overpowering or offensive.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a serious acne treatment this is not your brand.</li>
            <li> The worst pregnancy symptom I have suffered both times has been ridiculous acne on my back &amp; shoulders which lasts into the 3rd trimester.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because after about 3 weeks of use, the tip of the bottle has cracked at the base and now the product comes out the side instead of the tip... Not a huge deal</li>
            <li> It gave me these horrible red, dry, scaly patches when I had applied it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so sad that I had to look so horrible during the first few months of my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> It does not blend in well, and I think my skin looks worse in the places I apply this.  </li>
            <li> but it keeps it from getting worse and dries up any oils.</li>
            <li> messy and broken!!</li>
            <li> Who knew that pregnancy could cause you to break out worse than a teenager?!  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> But unable to use any salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, I was at a loss with what to do about it.</li>
            <li> sadly, it did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t too bad, but definitely not pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd pregnancy and the worst acne I have ever had, and I&#x27;ve had it bad.</li>
            <li> Go to the Este Lauder counter and they&#x27;ll take care of you, don&#x27;t waste your time on this terrible product.</li>
            <li> Used during the beginning of my pregancy when my hormones were crazy and my face was breaking out like a teenager...</li>
            <li> unfortunately this one did not help my pregnancy acne &#x3D;(.</li>
            <li> but this made my skin angry!</li>
            <li> The product does have a faint sulphur odor, and it is a bit pricey, but the product WORKS!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product it seem to make the breakouts worse!</li>
            <li> Although I like the product itself, the unpacking experience was really unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad.  </li>
            <li> This smells bad</li>
            <li> When i get bad acne spots (</li>
            <li> I go through periods of really bad skin to this day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad acne</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars because it wasn&#x27;t bad, it just didn&#x27;t do anything to help me.</li>
            <li> once a month :-()I</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing horrible pregnancy acne in my t-zone.  </li>

            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> I had the worst acne after switching to this treatment.  </li>
            <li> It was awful!  </li>
            <li> It has been about one month of using the Belli wash and this spot treatment, and my skin has gone through the worst break out since about 10 years!  </li>
            <li> Smells awful &amp; doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but the acne was so horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Item shipped completely defective and empty. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> All this seemed to do was dry out my skin, but had no affect on the acne. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Amazing! So happy I found something that works during my pregnancy! Love this line of products!</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time finding a non-toxic acne cream. I found Bella to use during my pregnancy. The nozzle part came off with the cap the first time I used it and the content dried up before I could use it for a second time. The treatment worked alright the one time that I sued it. Overall, it was a big waste of money for me, since the poor quality container didn&#x27;t even give me the chance to use the product!</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing horrible pregnancy acne in my t-zone.  I have been searching high and low for anything that works.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice and I this product works.  But it smells like rotten eggs.  One of the main ingredients is Sulfur!  It smells so bad.  I honestly don&#x27;t know if I can use it again.  The stench is awful, just terrible - and it&#x27;s on your face and might get on your pillow or clothes and stink them up too.  It would be amazing - if you can get passed the smell.</li>
            <li> Pair this with the Cleanser for best results!  One less thing to stress about during my pregnancy...now if I could find something to make clothes fit normally!</li>
            <li> Great spot treatment. Smells like sulfer (rotten eggs) so a little hard to ignore with pregnancy sense of smell. But it really zapped my zits!</li>
            <li> smells great and really clears up acne during pregnant. product is a little expensive but definitely works on prenatal acne.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive stomach or a heightened sense of smell during pregnancy, look elsewhere for a pregnancy-safe spot treatment!  The sulphur in this treatment smells like rotten eggs on your face, not something you want wafts of when you are already barely keeping anything down!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive acne prone skin, when I became pregnant I started using this and it works great at clearing up small blemishes! It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have large blemishes you&#x27;ll have to use it during the evening and morning to make sure it really clears it up.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also safe to use under makeup or moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This coated my skin with a layer of...something. The smell wasn&#x27;t noticeable but I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt on my face. In addition, it didn&#x27;t really work all that well for my early pregnancy acne. I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and have dealt with mild adult acne for years. This worsened with my pregnancy. I&#x27;m sure this works fine for some people, but my skin didn&#x27;t like it. I seemed to have more breakouts when I used it than when I went without.</li>
            <li> Cleared my skin in less than 1 week. I was breaking out everywhere! thank you pregnancy hormones... I use this product all over my face but I add an equal part of moisturizer with it (cetaphil) then apply to my skin...its pretty drying.</li>
            <li> My pregnancy acne is at a level 10. I&#x27;m 4 months pregnant and at about 2 months my face absolutely erupted like I&#x27;ve never seen before in my life. I have acne everywhere, forehead, eyebrows, chin, nose, ears, yes in my earlobes! I have tried every natural thing I can find including tea tree oil, lotions with oils in them, face washes, etc. nothing has worked at all. I have every kind of pimple there is, right now including cystic, whiteheads, blackheads, plugged pores.  I haven&#x27;t had a day of relief in 2 months. I just got this about 5 days ago and since the 2nd night I&#x27;ve noticed a dramatic decrease in the inflammation and pimples. I finally went out the other day without having to spend a half an hour covering up the numerous pimples on my face! I don&#x27;t know if it will work for everyone but it did significantly help me and its not too expensive so its worth a try. I do smell the sulfur slightly but it works so it really doesn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;m putting it pretty much all over my face after I put lotion on since I have pimples everywhere. It hasn&#x27;t dried out my face so far. I&#x27;m very happy I found this. I also use the Belli lactic acid face wash and like it equally as much as this product but feel the spot treatment is clearing my acne more than the face wash.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t use it alone...I also use it along with the Belli Pre Treatment Scrub and the Belli Acne Clearing Facial Wash. I use the scrub first, then the facial wash, then this spot treatment. The scrub instructions said to use it 2-3 times per week but I use it every day, along with the face wash and this spot treatment. I&#x27;ve had amazing results since starting the system only six days ago. I started getting breakouts several years ago, and I tried many over the counter facial meds, and some worked for a while then stopped working. So I went to the doctor and I tried several prescriptions. The only one that worked was a low dose of anti-biotics. But I didn&#x27;t want to be on anti-biotics long term because of the major side effects so I tried other prescription meds that believe it or not, didn&#x27;t work and actually made my acne worse. So I did some research and found Belli and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m not pregnant but I love that I can continue to use it when my husband and I decide to have kids. My face has cleared up in 6 days and my complexion is much much MUCH better! The smell isn&#x27;t very nice, but you&#x27;ll get used to it. And who cares when you get great looking skin!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived leaking all over inside its cap due to a broken nosel tube.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind spending a lil bit more money as long as I get what I need and good quallity, when I read most of the rviews about this product most of the people were complaining about the price, which is a lot for the size! I just got this product a few hours ago delivered and I was very excited about since I am having a lot of breakouts during my pregnancy, when I open the container to use it the top it was broken! messy and broken!! I am still gonna use it because I need this product and I&#x27;ll see how it works and write a new review, but i am very dissapointed about paying 17 dollars for a broken container.</li>
            <li> only thing that has mostly cleared my pregnancy acne. put on at night and in the morning spots look better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I had horrible acne when I was pregnant, especially in the first trimester. My doctor said not tousle anything with salicylic acid, so I tried this cream. It did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pregnant wife. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, she&#x27;s had to cut back on using it, could be the hormones being so out of whack. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s non-toxic and it has helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really give this product 2 1/2 stars. It&#x27;s by no means a miracle for my acne. It helps to lessen the size but has not stopped new acne from popping up on a daily basis. Who knew that pregnancy could cause you to break out worse than a teenager?!  I&#x27;m going to the dermatologist to see if a topical antibiotic will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for use during pregnancy as its ingredients are safe (unlike every anti-acne product I was using before).  It made my skin break out more and became dry and patchy.  I now use Este Lauder overnight treatment and Este Lauder cucumber face lotion day and night.  Instead of having the cystic or white head acne, I&#x27;m only getting a few tiny little blemishes that aren&#x27;t visiable under good make up (and barely noticable without).  Go to the Este Lauder counter and they&#x27;ll take care of you, don&#x27;t waste your time on this terrible product.</li>
            <li> I broke out for the first time since I was 16 when I got pregnant. This product has saved my life in the 1st and 2nd trimester.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bummer because this product really did help blemishes--but IT STANKS. It goes on all &#x27;mmm.. tea tree oil... how pleasant!&#x27; and then quickly evaporates into sulfur STANK. Like - rotten egg nastiness. If I were pregnant, there&#x27;s just no way. Too bad - because it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li> Really was not effective for me at all. It&#x27;s a tiny tube, and it&#x27;s difficult to not have everything spurt out when you are trying to use it. Also didn&#x27;t seem to clear my skin that well. Didn&#x27;t see any difference when I used this as opposed to just using the face wash and exfoliation cream.  I like the face wash, but would skip this step in the future.</li>
            <li> With few options out there for pregnant women, this was a great find. I&#x27;ve never had such terrible acne until my pregnancy, but this really helped. I found it worked best using it every other day. The smell wasn&#x27;t too bad, but definitely not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have been using it sparingly because it can dry out my face easily but when i do need it, pimples are smaller faster!</li>
            <li> Loved this cream the first time I bought it, but my recent shipment came in a broken tube so I lost half the product. Some people complained of the smell, but I did not find it to be overpowering or offensive. This definitely is a useful product to have when harsher acne treatments are not an option.</li>
            <li> Some may consider this an unfair review as I actually love the product and it is very effective when used as an all-over preventative treatment.  However, the last time I ordered this (several tubes at once, about 4 months ago), it had different packaging and the price was $13.01. Yes, that&#x27;s a difference of $11.88 based on today&#x27;s price.  Nearly $12 of new packaging on a $13 product. In case this is not totally clear:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PRICE HAS DOUBLED AND THE PRODUCT IS THE SAME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually wrote to the company about this because while it is understandable that as time progresses, there will be some price increases, doubling the price to cover packaging is absurd.  I suggested that if they keep this insane price increase permanent that they at least offer the product in larger value sizes because the little tube doesn&#x27;t last very long as an all over treatment.  I got a form letter back which did not address the price increase but said they&#x27;d pass my idea onto their development team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BELLI please rethink this before you alienate all your customers.</li>
            <li> This smells bad and I&#x27;m sort of allergic to it. Doesn&#x27;t really help my acne, just sort of inflames it. It also comes out of the tube very quickly I will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I tried to go completely &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; when I found out I was pregnant and threw out all of my other acne products.  I was so happy to have found a brand that was developed specifically for pregnant women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue is this treatment does not work at all on acne.  I had the worst acne after switching to this treatment.  I was breaking out everywhere and this product didn&#x27;t even help shorten the lifespan of my acne.  I eventually went to my dermatologist who said this product was useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so sad that I had to look so horrible during the first few months of my pregnancy.  If you are looking for a serious acne treatment this is not your brand.</li>
            <li> Love Belli products, but unfortunately this one did not help my pregnancy acne &#x3D;(. Very disappointed. The acne face wash is a must, though!</li>
            <li> The product seems to be effective but only with daily use. However, it is safe during my pregnancy. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Like most pregnant women, I am breaking out like crazy and I needed something safe for my pregnancy. I looked up many sites for more natural and safe remedies and I read that Belli was a highly recommended so I thought I had nothing to lose. I am currently using the Belli cleanser and acne spot treatment and it is really helping me with my acne. Not that it&#x27;s a super product because I am use to using advance skincare products and can see dramatic difference, but it&#x27;s a good maintainer. I am still breaking out, but these products help me maintain or at least dry up existing acne.</li>
            <li> As many women often do, I experienced the dreaded return of acne in my first trimester of pregnancy.  It was awful!  To top it off, everything that I had previously used was off the table, due to the medications that are in them.  After reading a ton of reviews, I went ahead and made this purchase, along with the face wash. I am SO glad I did. It really helped to clear up my skin and could be worn at all times of the day and night (even under makeup). It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t really leave an unpleasant film on my skin. I would let the face wash sit on my skin for a minute or two (kind of like a face mask) and it worked wonders. In addition, it smells great (this coming from the prego who wanted to vomit at the smell of almost anything!). I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product apply a little to the area literally gone the next day</li>
            <li> with being so limited with what you can use in pregnancy this product is GREAT for trouble spots. combine this with aveeno makeup removing wipes my skin my actually be in better condition now being pregnant!</li>
            <li> It has been about one month of using the Belli wash and this spot treatment, and my skin has gone through the worst break out since about 10 years!  I can not fully fault the Belli line since I have been using strong prescription meds to control my acne over the past decade.  I like the face wash, and I will keep using it.  I am really not fond of this product though.  It does not blend in well, and I think my skin looks worse in the places I apply this.  I recommend the wash, but not this spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin but this made my skin angry! It gave me these horrible red, dry, scaly patches when I had applied it and it took a month and a half to clear up the reaction spots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne and when I got pregnant it got worse. Unfortunately I could no longer use my normal products as I wanted something safe for my baby, so I bought this on a whim with Bella Bee foaming facial cleanser. My skin looks better than it ever has please never stop selling this!! I will continue to use both products after baby is born.</li>
            <li> Smells awful &amp; doesn&#x27;t work. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Ok ladies, I have hormonal acne, which I had prior to getting pregnant.  So, once I had to stop using my pre-pregnancy products my face exploded with pimples, thus I decided to buy this. I had very high hopes for it.  Well, I used it for about a week, and the smell is horrendous.  You can blame it on my enhanced sense of smell, but I really can&#x27;t stand it, and since it isn&#x27;t making any noticeable improvements on my skin, I will not use anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 16 weeks into my 2nd pregnancy. The worst pregnancy symptom I have suffered both times has been ridiculous acne on my back &amp; shoulders which lasts into the 3rd trimester. Not exactly the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; I was hoping for. But unable to use any salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, I was at a loss with what to do about it. I finally saw \\&quot;Belli\\&quot; products in a Motherhood maternity store, and was intrigued. But I found the same products - both this spot treatment and the facial cleanser - on Amazon for a lower price and anxiously gave them a try.&lt;br /&gt; After ONE NIGHT of covering most of my back with the spot treatment, I noticed a 50% reduction in the size &amp; severity of the pimples. They were less like raging volcanoes and more like dark red spots. I still have a long way to go until I&#x27;m totally clear, but I bet that in a couple of weeks my skin will be as good as new. The product does have a faint sulphur odor, and it is a bit pricey, but the product WORKS!</li>
            <li> This product gets the job done. When i get bad acne spots ( once a month :-()I have been using this spot treatment and it clears my blemish up in a day or two!! I would not reccommend putting this product all over your face-- only where the acne is. It has sulfur in it and dries out the problem area( this is how it gets rid of the blemish) so if you put it on your entire face its going to get very dry!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product it seem to make the breakouts worse! Don&#x27;t bother with this just use the face wash!</li>
            <li> The top was broken, leak everywhere, going to return it</li>
            <li> I got this because I was breaking out while I was pregnant. It worked so well, better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used, that I intend to use it even after I have the baby! Great product!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I had to for this product.Cleared up my skin within two days. I would recommend to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice (and may be on my third refill) during my pregnancy.  I am now on my 7th month and my face has totally improved.  Not sure if this is from the cream or the hormones balancing out.  I did notice improvement after I did start using the cream and leaving my face wash on my face (like a mask) in the shower for a minute or two.  It definitely made me feel better that I was able to apply something to my face to provide any relief from the acne.</li>
            <li> I am at my 12 week pregnancy and I bought this product based on the reviews I&#x27;ve read. My acne disappeared completely! I totally recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Belli Acne Control Spot Treatment works pretty much just as well as benzoyl peroxide and is also considered safe for pregnant women. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because after about 3 weeks of use, the tip of the bottle has cracked at the base and now the product comes out the side instead of the tip... Not a huge deal but it does cause a bit of a mess and more product comes out than desired. Still, I&#x27;m happy my skin is clear and I&#x27;m not harming my baby!</li>
            <li> I have had acne since about 12. I am now 36 I go through periods of really bad skin to this day. Only retain A clears it up, nothing over the counter. I had no hope for this item but the acne was so horrible I had to try. It actually worked for me. I am not totally clear, but it is so much better. I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product. I have used for 2 weeks now and think I will continue to see improvement.This is my 3rd pregnancy and the worst acne I have ever had, and I&#x27;ve had it bad. I wasn&#x27;t gonna try anything because of being pregnant, then I saw this that was made for pregnant women. So glad I tried this, now I can go out without being embarrassed and ashamed.</li>
            <li> Used during the beginning of my pregancy when my hormones were crazy and my face was breaking out like a teenager...sadly, it did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad acne this pregnancy and NOTHING has worked. I even tried \\&quot;normal\\&quot; face washes to see if something stronger would work. But it didn&#x27;t so I figured I mightcas well stick with the safer options if it was all the same. I first got belli&#x27;s face wash and scrub but had no improvement. I gave belli one more try and bought this spot treatment and it helps to control it better than the face wash. I still have acne but it keeps it from getting worse and dries up any oils. I also wear it under my make up otherwise the oils take over right away. It can be a little over drying so I still use the belli scrub a couple times a week and they work well together. I ended up sticking with the brand Simple&#x27;s foaming cleanser and it does a good job of cleaning off oil and make up.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with it is that the tube broke! The tip is stuck in the cap and I&#x27;m worried it will dry out, poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I gave this product three stars because it wasn&#x27;t bad, it just didn&#x27;t do anything to help me. I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying it if they feel it may help them, just because I didnt see results from this doesn&#x27;t mean the next person will have the same experience. But I have since found something that does work for me so I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I have never been a person who struggles with acne. Every now and then I will get a pimple, but it was few and far between. I am nearing the end of my first trimester and have been struggling with more blemishes than normal, mostly concentrated on my chin. Of course I have read everything about every product available and have been hesitant to use anything because of the chemicals that should be avoided. I found this and the facial wash and figured it was worth a try. It&#x27;s been 2 days and the product is absolutely amazing. The few spots that I was having issues with have virtually disappeared. I have not had any issues with drying like the product warns about, but if you have sensitive skin, I would use it sparingly. I highly recommend the product for any woman struggling with blemishes, pregnant or not.</li>
            <li> It is not the best thing I have tried since being pregnant , but it does help! I will buy again. Another good option is Burt&#x27;s Bees herbal acne stick, made with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The product is very effective. I used it at night and all the acne look much better. But not sure about long-term effect - I received it yesterday and only used once.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is that it was gross when I unpacked it. There was some unknown mucus-like liquid outside the small paper box of this tube. I guess it got stained by something else before packing. Although I like the product itself, the unpacking experience was really unpleasant.</li>
