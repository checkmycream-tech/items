            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had read many reviews where others out there who are in to body piercings</li>

            <li>Just mix with your favorite creams to boost the benefits.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Adorable!</li>
            <li>I purchased Emu oil for the very first time via Dr Adorable</li>
            <li>I began using around areas where I had smile lines and just to be on the safe side around my eyes to help with he prevention of crows feet.  </li>
            <li>This is my first bottle and I will purchase 2 more before I evaluate it to have healed the scar.</li>
            <li>(Original Review)</li>
            <li>Pure and easily absorbable.</li>
            <li>It heals sores and cuts fast and it smooth scars.</li>
            <li>so I really had nothing to compare it with when I wrote my original review.  </li>
            <li>I was searching the internet about essential oils that help diminish dark spots, and have seen many positive reviews about Emu oil being great for that.</li>
            <li>Add in the fact this specific oil from Dr. Adorable is triple-refined, pure and organic.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a smell, which is nice, so it doesn&#x27;t overpower any other fragrances.</li>
            <li>I will start by giving this oil a five star credit because I put it on my damaged spot and it did feel a little smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Prompt shipment &amp; reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I received it very promptly- today-</li>
            <li>and I believe if I use it everyday I will most likely see a progressing difference in that spot  for the better.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, No smell from product.....</li>
            <li>I really like the Emu oil.</li>
            <li>A+ to the seller for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be more similar to the natural oils that skin produces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>This has taken beauty to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more in the future</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I even recommend using your daily moisturizer and adding a drop or two of EMU oil if you are not willing to use it on its own.  </li>
            <li>by day 3 his nose was like soft and moist like a puppy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I bought a 2 oz bottle of this oil to heal some wounds my dog caused by raking the skin off the back of my wrist or hand when he wants to get my attention.</li>
            <li>Wow they got soft and the calloses disappeared in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>She called a couple of days later to say how it really worked</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this as a natural way to moisturize my hair and my face.</li>
            <li>so far no complaints from her ...</li>
            <li>no smell..makes my shin feel soft..</li>
            <li>It can also be rubbed directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>I had recently had a clarity moment and decided to get three body piercings all done at the exact same time.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few days, I did not find anything special about it.</li>
            <li>It works really well on my dry skin</li>
            <li>Very please with this product; it, too, goes with my other oils in my body butters &amp; moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the use of this product not just for helping heal piercings, but also as a nightly or every other night facial regimen.</li>
            <li>I am very disappointed now with Dr Adorable as I have many of their products that now I must question the purity of.    </li>
            <li>People have complimented me on how clear my skin looks and ask what products I use and think I must have spent a fortune.  </li>

            <li> People have complimented me on how clear my skin looks and ask what products I use and think I must have spent a fortune.  </li>
            <li> I have only had it one day so far, so I can&#x27;t attest to claims that it removes dark spots, but we will see.</li>
            <li> If anything if you are not satisfied, you have only wasted a few dollars versus hundreds that many already spend when it comes to facial cosmetics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to the new Emu Oil I purchased from a reputable company, the Emu Oil from Dr Adorable is disgustingly GREASY to say the least.</li>
            <li> Feels greasy on my skin and takes a long time to adsorb.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to moisturize my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I hope to see diminishing dark spots and plan to do a future review once I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Updated Review (4-13-15)  Ran out of my usual Emo oil and because of the reputation Dr. Adorable is acquiring online for fake or mislabeled products, I decided to try Emu Oil from another company with hundreds of reviews and no accusations of fraud.   </li>
            <li> It works entirely if you put a little work into researching the optimal way to formulate and use this oil.</li>
            <li> The Emu Oil I purchased from the other company is luxurious and moisturizing with absolutely no greasy residue.   </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it is a dropper &amp; can&#x27;t seep out out of the container like other ones I have used for traveling.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works, however, it seems to do all it says, although I&#x27;ve only used it for my hair and some pain relief to my knee joints.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with natural oils drying out the skin on my face i.e. coconut oil and olive oil (both extra virgin and cold expeller pressed).</li>
            <li> It is oily  , and it does leave a residue on your hair along with a slight smell after a while , I gave it to our daughter to use I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixing with Jamaican Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little miracle in a jar.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed a few drops into my trouble areas.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, I was anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how different the quality is.    </li>
            <li> Basically sped up the healing process and in all honesty I had never experienced any pain while healing.  </li>
            <li> She had tried dozens of expensive and prescription lotions to no avail but this did the trick.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well this product worked.  </li>
            <li> I am shocked there are some that claim this oil doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I need.. thx you..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the thicker emu oil but still an effective product.  I use it for my hair, face &amp; body.  Love it is a dropper &amp; can&#x27;t seep out out of the container like other ones I have used for traveling.</li>
            <li> This oil is a must have if  you&#x27;re stretching your ears. Would happily purchase again. Thanks Dr. Adorable!</li>
            <li> My doctor told me this was a blood thinner, after a procedure I applied it and it thinned my skinn and bruised me..</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! Not sure how it works, however, it seems to do all it says, although I&#x27;ve only used it for my hair and some pain relief to my knee joints. Seems to work! Fascinating!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My wife&#x27;s feet build up callouses that crack and she has used superglue for several years to seal the cracks shut and release the pain. I bought a 2 oz bottle of this oil to heal some wounds my dog caused by raking the skin off the back of my wrist or hand when he wants to get my attention. They cleared up and healed in only 3-4 days so I thought of trying this on the wife&#x27;s feet. Wow they got soft and the calloses disappeared in a couple of days. She had tried dozens of expensive and prescription lotions to no avail but this did the trick. We told this to our visiting nurse and the nurse said she also had the same problem. We had her take off her shoes and wipe some on. She called a couple of days later to say how it really worked so I ordered a 1 oz bottle as a gift. A little goes a long way. Everyone should know about this.</li>
            <li> Nice oil, good absorption, probably better than advertised!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this as a natural way to moisturize my hair and my face. I have had issues with natural oils drying out the skin on my face i.e. coconut oil and olive oil (both extra virgin and cold expeller pressed). I thought this oil might be different because it is an animal fat rather than a vegetable fat. I thought it might be more similar to the natural oils that skin produces. After using it for a few days, I did not find anything special about it. Feels greasy on my skin and takes a long time to adsorb. It did nothing to moisturize my dry hands. Now I have been using organic cocoa butter on my face. It is solid at room temperature so I scrape some into my hand and melt it between my fingers before applying it. It works really well on my dry skin and I have not had any issues with break outs. I recommend skipping this and trying that instead.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  It did not moisturize or heal skin as it claims.  I wish I could get a refund!</li>
            <li> Very please with this product; it, too, goes with my other oils in my body butters &amp; moisturizers.  Prompt shipment &amp; reasonable price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Have not used this enough yet to have an opinion</li>
            <li> It is oily  , and it does leave a residue on your hair along with a slight smell after a while , I gave it to our daughter to use I well wait for her to get a better opinion about it  , so far no complaints from her ...</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it on my daughters skin and my hair</li>
            <li> Works really good. I&#x27;m mixing with Jamaican Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a non-believer before trying this product out.  I had recently had a clarity moment and decided to get three body piercings all done at the exact same time. I knew I was in for quite a ride.  I had read many reviews where others out there who are in to body piercings recommended this product.  I was shocked at how well this product worked.  Basically sped up the healing process and in all honesty I had never experienced any pain while healing.  I highly recommend the use of this product not just for helping heal piercings, but also as a nightly or every other night facial regimen. This has taken beauty to a whole new level.  I began using around areas where I had smile lines and just to be on the safe side around my eyes to help with he prevention of crows feet.  People have complimented me on how clear my skin looks and ask what products I use and think I must have spent a fortune.  This stuff is a little miracle in a jar.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  I even recommend using your daily moisturizer and adding a drop or two of EMU oil if you are not willing to use it on its own.  If anything if you are not satisfied, you have only wasted a few dollars versus hundreds that many already spend when it comes to facial cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Healing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;MH</li>
            <li> Came In a timely manner..no smell..makes my shin feel soft..aborbs well</li>
            <li> Beautiful product. Hydrating and healing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help me at all.</li>
            <li> Order was shipped very quickly! Product does wonders for my hair!!</li>
            <li> I will start by giving this oil a five star credit because I put it on my damaged spot and it did feel a little smooth and comfortable. I received it very promptly- today- and I believe if I use it everyday I will most likely see a progressing difference in that spot  for the better. This is my first bottle and I will purchase 2 more before I evaluate it to have healed the scar. It feels good on my skin. I do like it. I just received it.  Feels good. Give it try like I am doing. recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great size, and just as described.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  Will definitely purchase more in the future</li>
            <li> I used this product on my dog&#x27;s nose to help heal the cracking and dryness.  It&#x27;s worked like a charm..by day 3 his nose was like soft and moist like a puppy&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Updated Review (4-13-15)  Ran out of my usual Emo oil and because of the reputation Dr. Adorable is acquiring online for fake or mislabeled products, I decided to try Emu Oil from another company with hundreds of reviews and no accusations of fraud.

It works entirely if you put a little work into researching the optimal way to formulate and use this oil. I use it in lip balms and lotions and the moisturizing power cannot be beat. Add in the fact this specific oil from Dr. Adorable is triple-refined, pure and organic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I use on my piercings to aide in healing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Pure and easily absorbable. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for hair growth and it works wonders on the skin. You mix this with a carrier oil and rub on the scalp for hair growth. It can also be rubbed directly on the skin. It heals sores and cuts fast and it smooth scars. Just mix with your favorite creams to boost the benefits.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, No smell from product.....I like the fact that this oil bottle has the medicine dropper top bcit&#x27;s easy for me to apply to my temples &amp; edges in which I&#x27;m trying this product for hair growth!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Use on everything from skin irritations to cracks in the skin on my fingers or heels</li>
            <li> I really like the Emu oil. I was searching the internet about essential oils that help diminish dark spots, and have seen many positive reviews about Emu oil being great for that. When I received this product, I was anxious to try it. I have only had it one day so far, so I can&#x27;t attest to claims that it removes dark spots, but we will see. I rubbed a few drops into my trouble areas. I didn&#x27;t experience redness or irritation, so that is already a big plus for me. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell, which is nice, so it doesn&#x27;t overpower any other fragrances. I hope to see diminishing dark spots and plan to do a future review once I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months. It arrived on time and nicely packaged. A+ to the seller for fast shipping.</li>
