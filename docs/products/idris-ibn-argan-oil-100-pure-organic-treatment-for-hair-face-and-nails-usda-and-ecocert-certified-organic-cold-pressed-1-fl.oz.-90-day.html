            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results of using this on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I found this product on Amazon and it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This product is awesome!  </li>
            <li>but this has given me the best results.</li>
            <li>Great for Wintertime skin!</li>
            <li>It is great!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li>It soothes and smoothes--my hands also feel wonderful after I use them to apply the oil.  </li>
            <li>Great customer service!!..</li>
            <li>Keep up the excellent work.</li>
            <li>I am extremely impressed with Idris Ibn Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>Cactus seed oil is probably the best in terms of wrinkle therapy ($$$$), and jojoba oil is the best for night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I found that using Argon oil in the summer is ideal for me.</li>
            <li>Beautiful for Hair - Face - Skin - Nails</li>
            <li>Great consistency and smell.  </li>
            <li>With this great product, using twice a week, problem  resolved.</li>
            <li>So I tried Idris Ibn Argan Oil on my face and the Nuface toner and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for my cuticles, as well.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>good product, good price!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>I even look better in the morning!!</li>
            <li>This product is very nice.  </li>
            <li>This oil is a very nice moisturizer, non-greasy, and absorbs well into the skin.  </li>
            <li>A superior all around beauty product.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is good too, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well if I didn&#x27;t just come out of the shower/bath</li>
            <li>The great thing about argan oil is that it&#x27;s affordable compared to cactus seed oil and really effective as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I was also impressed by the customer service and quick delivery of the product.</li>
            <li>My arthritic fingers love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this oil!  </li>
            <li>Idris Ibn Argan Oil is everything they say it is &amp; more!  </li>
            <li>I Love It!</li>
            <li>My skin is silky smooth and the cats don&#x27;t mind it on their paws or fur !!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is the best price I have seen for 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li>It is light, non-greasy and feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li>this product was amazing.</li>
            <li>this amazing product available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked how this company discloses its source and shows its certification.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It also makes a nice lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how Idris Iban makes money at this price point, but I&#x27;m thrilled that they can</li>
            <li>Great supplier, fair price, prompt service, pure organic oil.  </li>
            <li>Another plus is it has a light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>But 100% argan oil is the best for day time use because it&#x27;s very light and it absorbs rapidly and completely into the skin.</li>
            <li>smell is very light nutty scent.</li>
            <li>This product arrived very quickly, was well packaged, and even included a nice note from the seller.</li>
            <li>There is a very light &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell but nothing overwhelming or that could be smelled by others.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I searched Amazon and found this one.  </li>
            <li>I also love that is not greasy, so I can apply this whenever I wanted and not just at night.  </li>
            <li>Hand cream is okay in the winter but not sweaty summer.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased by having smooth skin!</li>
            <li>I truly did love this product it helped my hair</li>
            <li>Of the argan oils I&#x27;ve tried, Idris Ibn Argan Oil belongs at the top of the list.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>The company that sent it to me is was outstanding.  </li>
            <li>and I wish them good success.</li>
            <li>I will definately buy more and recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many products</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face and my skin feels better than it ever has.  </li>
            <li>I love this argan oil...</li>
            <li>Love using it on my face and lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily to the touch after a couple of seconds it disappears into your skin to do its magic and leave your skin feeling like satin.</li>
            <li>I use it all over my face, also on earlobes, neck, d√©colletage, cuticles, top of my hands, and in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil is a blessing in this type of environment and enriches my skin by restoring it to a dewy, glowingly healthy appearance.  </li>
            <li>sure you use Idris Ibn branded argan oil.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin quickly absorbs the oil, and it works amazingly well under make-up.  </li>
            <li>It also helps to define the lines of my hair style and group the hair in a more becoming way.</li>
            <li>My friends (without me prompting them) have commented on how lovely my skin and eyelashes look lately, and, that that to me is wonderful confirmation of how effective the Argan Oil is.</li>
            <li>no body and easily frizzes.</li>
            <li>but I noticed results very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Since my hair is fine, I shampoo with a non-sulfate shampoo (I use Nano Works from Pureology)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to know that ordinary people benefit by producing the oil in Morocco, and the organic certification seems superior to some products found in health food stores that sometimes have chemicals added.</li>
            <li>I have been using this Argan Oil for a little over a month now and am very happy with how smooth it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that my skin has seen a huge difference since using the oil.  </li>
            <li>The oil had a light aroma and it did not leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, I&#x27;ll luck out and stay stretch mark free.</li>
            <li>so I tried it and my hair was tangle free.  </li>
            <li>I also use this on.my cuticles and they are smooth and never need grooming during manicures.  </li>
            <li>I use it primarily on my face and eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Idris Ibn offered a free bottle to write a customer review, but if I didn&#x27;t like the product, I wouldn&#x27;t want another bottle anyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in seeing if i notice any improvements in the look of my skin, i.e. fine lines etc, but no matter what i like the way it makes my skin feel, and thats whats most important to me.  </li>
            <li>Same amount massaged onto my face after cleansing...very nice!</li>
            <li>It is totally natural and it absorbs beautifully, leaving skin silky soft and fine lines softened too.  </li>
            <li>It is a moisturizing non fragrance oil with nice light natural smell.</li>
            <li>And way cheaper and knowing it&#x27;s all natural makes it even better!</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of Idris Ibn argan oil as a gift, and now will order more, because it&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever found for my dry skin, especially troublesome areas on the face.  </li>
            <li>I do use more oil than in the directions as I have so much hair.</li>
            <li>I began using it and absolutely fell in love with</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all, which was a concern of mine,after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>( but, that&#x27;s not a bad thing).  </li>
            <li>I have been faithfully applying the oil since I was 3 months pregnant and no stretch marks yet.</li>
            <li>No greasy feeling and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>As a surprise bonus, I definitely can see that after using this product my eyelashes are more healthy and have started to grow longer.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and has no odor or taste.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more : )</li>
            <li>I use about 3 drops and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>When I wake up, my skin is soft and smooth (which is nice when you&#x27;ve been up most of the night working on some homework you&#x27;ve put off until the last minute).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really compare it to other brands, but I have had a good experience with this product!</li>
            <li>Product absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I had a couple of questions about the oil and received a response very quickly, The seller was very helpful, and even sent me another bottle.</li>
            <li>and i really see a difference in my skin!!</li>
            <li>there is little to no fragrance which also made me happy.  </li>
            <li>Although an oil, it is extremely light and absorbs into the skin much faster than some.  </li>
            <li>My 62 year old skin has never felt softer and more nourished.</li>
            <li>It also acts as a moisturizing solution and helps keep the skin reinvigorated and fresh.</li>
            <li>I also use about 2 drops rubbed into my palms and smoothed into my damp, freshly washed hair when I don&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li>i threw a few drops in the ends of my hair too, very nice.  </li>
            <li>It has the right certifications which includes USDA Organic which is what I look for when buying anything organic.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy, is absorbed quickly, does not have an odor, and makes my skin feel silky smooth not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first of all, i gave 4 stars of 5 ONLY because I&#x27;ve only had this product for 5 days, but that being said, the first time i used it i loved it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the long-term benefits, but my first impressions are that it is easily absorbed into my skin....not too oily.  </li>
            <li>I must mention that I like IDRIS IBN Argan oil because it is 100% pure organic essence!</li>
            <li>Also the company is clearly run by people who understand good service with a human touch.  </li>
            <li>I also have to say that the shipping was super fast on this order.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old and have always had fine hair in texture...</li>
            <li>I am sure that I keep using Argon oil for not only summer but all seasons.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using argan oil</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>Since this is my first experience with argan oil</li>
            <li>The only oil needed to achieve healthy skin and hair.</li>
            <li>My tbody tone is getting more evev especially my face.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing!  </li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle from Idris Ibn and was pleased with the quality which was equal to what I had bought in Morocco.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It should also come in a amber glass bottle because it&#x27;s light sensitive,</li>
            <li>but it is great to use during the winter months for that extra hydration dry skin needs.  </li>
            <li>I particularly enjoy the way it makes my, usually, dry skin feel smooth and look refreshed.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality organic oil that is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Immediately after application my skin feels soft and smooth and the fine lines actually disappear.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a good, natural facial moisturizer to use over night that wouldn&#x27;t a)irritate my sensitive skin or b)cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products on my extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li>Ibn Argan Oil - 100% Pure Organic Treatment for Face, Hair, and Nails - USDA and ECOCERT Certified (</li>
            <li>This stuff was definitely pure oil</li>
            <li>I chose Idris Ibn Argon Oil because it is 100% pure</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and only used a couple of drops for my hair and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>First, I have found that adding protein to my hair every so often has restored the shine that has been diminishing over the years as I&#x27;ve gotten older (I use Neutral Color Protein Filler from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply).</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle there because my guide recommended it very highly.  </li>
            <li>I really like the non-oily feel of Argan oil and wanted to try it out after seeing their promotion.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>That is why I wanted 100% argan along with being organic at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Having said that I did finish the bottle because I had paid for it, but I used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an outdoors women and really feel that the Argan Oil is really countering the effects of wind and sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A friend commented how much her skin had improved with the use of Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>i can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced - 100%</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and no wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t really speak to it&#x27;s ability to combat dryness and/or lines, but I can say that it moisturizes well without making my skin look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Second, I have found that using Argon oil as well gives my hair even more shine and makes it soft and silky without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>, I apply this oil and my skin instantly feels and looks so much better, after using it for almost 2 weeks, my skin has stayed soft and suptle, even before I apply it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different natural oils on my face, including emu oil, jojoba oil, cactus seed oil, shea butter, mineral oil etc.</li>
            <li>I also have the one by Josie maran and this is just as good if not better!</li>
            <li>Acne is apparently caused not only by shortage of water but also by shortage of appropriate oil component.</li>
            <li>My 68 yr old dry skin stays hydrated better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more of this product in the future.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone, regardless of age and skin type, who values health and desires youthful looking skin.  </li>
            <li>Hair is softer, curlier, and more manageable, especially the grey hair.  </li>
            <li>When I lived in a dry environment, it was not a problem, but since moving to the Houston area, I have had many issues, especially during the humid months.</li>
            <li>I put it on last because I think it may be an effective carrier oil to bring some of the less absorbable products deeper into the epidermis (sort of like how hyaluronic acid works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just received my argan oil from this new supplier.</li>
            <li>I live in the Midwest where horrendous winter weather wreaks havoc with my skin.  </li>
            <li>(i have super dry skin)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to name sellers, but suffice to say that most of the cheap \\&quot;100% argan oil\\&quot; you find on eBay is fake.</li>
            <li>the directions recommend 1-2 drops to apply to face, and the first time i did this, but personally i have increased it to 3-4, as the smaller amount just didn&#x27;t seem to be enough, the oil is so light and non greasy  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product, unsure, of how my sensitive skin would react to a new product...AND...it works wonders.</li>
            <li>It can be useful for dry skin treatment.</li>
            <li>I am an avid fan of natural facial oils.</li>
            <li>pure argan oil really helped with this problem; my skin is no longer so dry and thin.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>After reading several positive reviews of argan oil</li>
            <li>Goes on very easily, just a few drops goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>At the time I purchased there was a promotional price which I appreciated, but after trying it I would pay the regular price.  </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t nearly the chore it has been until now.  </li>
            <li>Somewhat helpful on dry-patches on skin so far.  </li>
            <li>Just remember that this is a natural oil and will smell earthy,</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and it works well to hydrate without  clogging pores.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or pore clogging.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my skin so soft, like silk.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old</li>
            <li>I hope to give some to my daughter so she keeps her young looking skin.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft, and the feel was non greasy.</li>
            <li>and I like it, so far.</li>
            <li>My husband has eczema on his back and we&#x27;ve experimented and put some on a particular &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I highly suggest you try it now that winter is approaching.</li>
            <li>SEAMS TO CALM DOWN MY FRIZZYS</li>
            <li>Even though it is summer right now I have done a lot of house cleaning which has left my hands very dry.  </li>
            <li>This oil hydrated and left my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>also use it on my hair, and again only a small amount needed to help stop the frizz and keeps it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry from being a flight attendant  and using Retin-A .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t yet say whether it has helped clear up my moderate, college stress-induced acne, but it sure hasn&#x27;t made it any worse.</li>
            <li>It is not too oily and has a pleasant, very faint smell.  </li>
            <li>I have &#x27;mature&#x27;, dry skin and after only a week, this product has made my skin soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li>Pure Organic Argan Oil - USDA Certified - bottled in dark color with expiration date on their label.</li>
            <li>I researched and found that those products that are not 100% oil really have a very small amount of pure argan oil.  </li>
            <li>Ever since my late fifties, I have noticed a significant change in my skin - not only dryer, but thinner - almost like parchment.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and this oil has been a God send.</li>
            <li>100% argan oil.no greasy and has a slight nutty smell,one way to check that is pure argan oil is apply on a burn or injury and can not feel a burning,it you feel it,its not argan oil</li>
            <li>This has a slight golden tint and subtle scent, as it should, and glides right on.  </li>
            <li>It helped clear up a dry, flaky patch on my chin</li>
            <li>my lines around the eyes are much softened and less visible.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, sensitive skin and while using, I do not have any flaking or tightness.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Josie Maran product which is much more expensive and does not support any social cause.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results of using this on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon and it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  </li>
            <li> but this has given me the best results.</li>
            <li> Great for Wintertime skin!</li>
            <li> It is great!  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> It soothes and smoothes--my hands also feel wonderful after I use them to apply the oil.  </li>
            <li> Great customer service!!..</li>
            <li> Keep up the excellent work.</li>
            <li> I am extremely impressed with Idris Ibn Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> Cactus seed oil is probably the best in terms of wrinkle therapy ($$$$), and jojoba oil is the best for night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I found that using Argon oil in the summer is ideal for me.</li>
            <li> Beautiful for Hair - Face - Skin - Nails</li>
            <li> Great consistency and smell.  </li>
            <li> With this great product, using twice a week, problem  resolved.</li>
            <li> So I tried Idris Ibn Argan Oil on my face and the Nuface toner and it works great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for my cuticles, as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> good product, good price!</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> I even look better in the morning!!</li>
            <li> This product is very nice.  </li>
            <li> This oil is a very nice moisturizer, non-greasy, and absorbs well into the skin.  </li>
            <li> A superior all around beauty product.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is good too, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well if I didn&#x27;t just come out of the shower/bath</li>
            <li> The great thing about argan oil is that it&#x27;s affordable compared to cactus seed oil and really effective as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I was also impressed by the customer service and quick delivery of the product.</li>
            <li> My arthritic fingers love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil!  </li>
            <li> Idris Ibn Argan Oil is everything they say it is &amp; more!  </li>
            <li> I Love It!</li>
            <li> My skin is silky smooth and the cats don&#x27;t mind it on their paws or fur !!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best price I have seen for 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li> It is light, non-greasy and feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li> this product was amazing.</li>
            <li> this amazing product available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked how this company discloses its source and shows its certification.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It also makes a nice lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how Idris Iban makes money at this price point, but I&#x27;m thrilled that they can</li>
            <li> Great supplier, fair price, prompt service, pure organic oil.  </li>
            <li> Another plus is it has a light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> But 100% argan oil is the best for day time use because it&#x27;s very light and it absorbs rapidly and completely into the skin.</li>
            <li> smell is very light nutty scent.</li>
            <li> This product arrived very quickly, was well packaged, and even included a nice note from the seller.</li>
            <li> There is a very light &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell but nothing overwhelming or that could be smelled by others.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I searched Amazon and found this one.  </li>
            <li> I also love that is not greasy, so I can apply this whenever I wanted and not just at night.  </li>
            <li> Hand cream is okay in the winter but not sweaty summer.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased by having smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I truly did love this product it helped my hair</li>
            <li> Of the argan oils I&#x27;ve tried, Idris Ibn Argan Oil belongs at the top of the list.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> The company that sent it to me is was outstanding.  </li>
            <li> and I wish them good success.</li>
            <li> I will definately buy more and recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried many products</li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face and my skin feels better than it ever has.  </li>
            <li> I love this argan oil...</li>
            <li> Love using it on my face and lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily to the touch after a couple of seconds it disappears into your skin to do its magic and leave your skin feeling like satin.</li>
            <li> I use it all over my face, also on earlobes, neck, d√©colletage, cuticles, top of my hands, and in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil is a blessing in this type of environment and enriches my skin by restoring it to a dewy, glowingly healthy appearance.  </li>
            <li> sure you use Idris Ibn branded argan oil.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin quickly absorbs the oil, and it works amazingly well under make-up.  </li>
            <li> It also helps to define the lines of my hair style and group the hair in a more becoming way.</li>
            <li> My friends (without me prompting them) have commented on how lovely my skin and eyelashes look lately, and, that that to me is wonderful confirmation of how effective the Argan Oil is.</li>
            <li> no body and easily frizzes.</li>
            <li> but I noticed results very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Since my hair is fine, I shampoo with a non-sulfate shampoo (I use Nano Works from Pureology)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to know that ordinary people benefit by producing the oil in Morocco, and the organic certification seems superior to some products found in health food stores that sometimes have chemicals added.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Argan Oil for a little over a month now and am very happy with how smooth it leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that my skin has seen a huge difference since using the oil.  </li>
            <li> The oil had a light aroma and it did not leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, I&#x27;ll luck out and stay stretch mark free.</li>
            <li> so I tried it and my hair was tangle free.  </li>
            <li> I also use this on.my cuticles and they are smooth and never need grooming during manicures.  </li>
            <li> I use it primarily on my face and eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Idris Ibn offered a free bottle to write a customer review, but if I didn&#x27;t like the product, I wouldn&#x27;t want another bottle anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in seeing if i notice any improvements in the look of my skin, i.e. fine lines etc, but no matter what i like the way it makes my skin feel, and thats whats most important to me.  </li>
            <li> Same amount massaged onto my face after cleansing...very nice!</li>
            <li> It is totally natural and it absorbs beautifully, leaving skin silky soft and fine lines softened too.  </li>
            <li> It is a moisturizing non fragrance oil with nice light natural smell.</li>
            <li> And way cheaper and knowing it&#x27;s all natural makes it even better!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Idris Ibn argan oil as a gift, and now will order more, because it&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever found for my dry skin, especially troublesome areas on the face.  </li>
            <li> I do use more oil than in the directions as I have so much hair.</li>
            <li> I began using it and absolutely fell in love with</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all, which was a concern of mine,after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> ( but, that&#x27;s not a bad thing).  </li>
            <li> I have been faithfully applying the oil since I was 3 months pregnant and no stretch marks yet.</li>
            <li> No greasy feeling and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> As a surprise bonus, I definitely can see that after using this product my eyelashes are more healthy and have started to grow longer.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and has no odor or taste.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more : )</li>
            <li> I use about 3 drops and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> When I wake up, my skin is soft and smooth (which is nice when you&#x27;ve been up most of the night working on some homework you&#x27;ve put off until the last minute).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really compare it to other brands, but I have had a good experience with this product!</li>
            <li> Product absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of questions about the oil and received a response very quickly, The seller was very helpful, and even sent me another bottle.</li>
            <li> and i really see a difference in my skin!!</li>
            <li> there is little to no fragrance which also made me happy.  </li>
            <li> Although an oil, it is extremely light and absorbs into the skin much faster than some.  </li>
            <li> My 62 year old skin has never felt softer and more nourished.</li>
            <li> It also acts as a moisturizing solution and helps keep the skin reinvigorated and fresh.</li>
            <li> I also use about 2 drops rubbed into my palms and smoothed into my damp, freshly washed hair when I don&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
            <li> i threw a few drops in the ends of my hair too, very nice.  </li>
            <li> It has the right certifications which includes USDA Organic which is what I look for when buying anything organic.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy, is absorbed quickly, does not have an odor, and makes my skin feel silky smooth not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first of all, i gave 4 stars of 5 ONLY because I&#x27;ve only had this product for 5 days, but that being said, the first time i used it i loved it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the long-term benefits, but my first impressions are that it is easily absorbed into my skin....not too oily.  </li>
            <li> I must mention that I like IDRIS IBN Argan oil because it is 100% pure organic essence!</li>
            <li> Also the company is clearly run by people who understand good service with a human touch.  </li>
            <li> I also have to say that the shipping was super fast on this order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old and have always had fine hair in texture...</li>
            <li> I am sure that I keep using Argon oil for not only summer but all seasons.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using argan oil</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth...</li>
            <li> Since this is my first experience with argan oil</li>
            <li> The only oil needed to achieve healthy skin and hair.</li>
            <li> My tbody tone is getting more evev especially my face.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing!  </li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle from Idris Ibn and was pleased with the quality which was equal to what I had bought in Morocco.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It should also come in a amber glass bottle because it&#x27;s light sensitive,</li>
            <li> but it is great to use during the winter months for that extra hydration dry skin needs.  </li>
            <li> I particularly enjoy the way it makes my, usually, dry skin feel smooth and look refreshed.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality organic oil that is definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after application my skin feels soft and smooth and the fine lines actually disappear.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good, natural facial moisturizer to use over night that wouldn&#x27;t a)irritate my sensitive skin or b)cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products on my extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> Ibn Argan Oil - 100% Pure Organic Treatment for Face, Hair, and Nails - USDA and ECOCERT Certified (</li>
            <li> This stuff was definitely pure oil</li>
            <li> I chose Idris Ibn Argon Oil because it is 100% pure</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and only used a couple of drops for my hair and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> First, I have found that adding protein to my hair every so often has restored the shine that has been diminishing over the years as I&#x27;ve gotten older (I use Neutral Color Protein Filler from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply).</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle there because my guide recommended it very highly.  </li>
            <li> I really like the non-oily feel of Argan oil and wanted to try it out after seeing their promotion.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> That is why I wanted 100% argan along with being organic at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Having said that I did finish the bottle because I had paid for it, but I used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an outdoors women and really feel that the Argan Oil is really countering the effects of wind and sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A friend commented how much her skin had improved with the use of Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> i can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced - 100%</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and no wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t really speak to it&#x27;s ability to combat dryness and/or lines, but I can say that it moisturizes well without making my skin look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Second, I have found that using Argon oil as well gives my hair even more shine and makes it soft and silky without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> , I apply this oil and my skin instantly feels and looks so much better, after using it for almost 2 weeks, my skin has stayed soft and suptle, even before I apply it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different natural oils on my face, including emu oil, jojoba oil, cactus seed oil, shea butter, mineral oil etc.</li>
            <li> I also have the one by Josie maran and this is just as good if not better!</li>
            <li> Acne is apparently caused not only by shortage of water but also by shortage of appropriate oil component.</li>
            <li> My 68 yr old dry skin stays hydrated better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more of this product in the future.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone, regardless of age and skin type, who values health and desires youthful looking skin.  </li>
            <li> Hair is softer, curlier, and more manageable, especially the grey hair.  </li>
            <li> When I lived in a dry environment, it was not a problem, but since moving to the Houston area, I have had many issues, especially during the humid months.</li>
            <li> I put it on last because I think it may be an effective carrier oil to bring some of the less absorbable products deeper into the epidermis (sort of like how hyaluronic acid works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just received my argan oil from this new supplier.</li>
            <li> I live in the Midwest where horrendous winter weather wreaks havoc with my skin.  </li>
            <li> (i have super dry skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to name sellers, but suffice to say that most of the cheap \\&quot;100% argan oil\\&quot; you find on eBay is fake.</li>
            <li> the directions recommend 1-2 drops to apply to face, and the first time i did this, but personally i have increased it to 3-4, as the smaller amount just didn&#x27;t seem to be enough, the oil is so light and non greasy  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product, unsure, of how my sensitive skin would react to a new product...AND...it works wonders.</li>
            <li> It can be useful for dry skin treatment.</li>
            <li> I am an avid fan of natural facial oils.</li>
            <li> pure argan oil really helped with this problem; my skin is no longer so dry and thin.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> After reading several positive reviews of argan oil</li>
            <li> Goes on very easily, just a few drops goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> At the time I purchased there was a promotional price which I appreciated, but after trying it I would pay the regular price.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t nearly the chore it has been until now.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat helpful on dry-patches on skin so far.  </li>
            <li> Just remember that this is a natural oil and will smell earthy,</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and it works well to hydrate without  clogging pores.</li>
            <li> Not heavy or pore clogging.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my skin so soft, like silk.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old</li>
            <li> I hope to give some to my daughter so she keeps her young looking skin.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My skin was soft, and the feel was non greasy.</li>
            <li> and I like it, so far.</li>
            <li> My husband has eczema on his back and we&#x27;ve experimented and put some on a particular &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I highly suggest you try it now that winter is approaching.</li>
            <li> SEAMS TO CALM DOWN MY FRIZZYS</li>
            <li> Even though it is summer right now I have done a lot of house cleaning which has left my hands very dry.  </li>
            <li> This oil hydrated and left my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> also use it on my hair, and again only a small amount needed to help stop the frizz and keeps it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry from being a flight attendant  and using Retin-A .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t yet say whether it has helped clear up my moderate, college stress-induced acne, but it sure hasn&#x27;t made it any worse.</li>
            <li> It is not too oily and has a pleasant, very faint smell.  </li>
            <li> I have &#x27;mature&#x27;, dry skin and after only a week, this product has made my skin soft and glowing.  </li>
            <li> Pure Organic Argan Oil - USDA Certified - bottled in dark color with expiration date on their label.</li>
            <li> I researched and found that those products that are not 100% oil really have a very small amount of pure argan oil.  </li>
            <li> Ever since my late fifties, I have noticed a significant change in my skin - not only dryer, but thinner - almost like parchment.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and this oil has been a God send.</li>
            <li> 100% argan oil.no greasy and has a slight nutty smell,one way to check that is pure argan oil is apply on a burn or injury and can not feel a burning,it you feel it,its not argan oil</li>
            <li> This has a slight golden tint and subtle scent, as it should, and glides right on.  </li>
            <li> It helped clear up a dry, flaky patch on my chin</li>
            <li> my lines around the eyes are much softened and less visible.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, sensitive skin and while using, I do not have any flaking or tightness.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Josie Maran product which is much more expensive and does not support any social cause.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and it hydrates the skin very well.</li>
            <li> Having dry skin was one of my major concerns for a long time.</li>
            <li> Prior to that, I spent a lot of money on numerous facial moisturizers in an attempt to find the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for over 20 years and wash and blow dry it daily.</li>
            <li> I can apply it anywhere without irritation, such as around the eyes, using normal precaution such as closing the eyes (well duh,</li>
            <li> The cost was way too expensive for me and most times they had other things added to the oil.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using it under make-up but tried it and could not be happier with the smooth results.  </li>
            <li> Something he hadn&#x27;t done for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have just had it for a few days so its too early to see any results.  </li>
            <li> and my pores are wide open.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other argan oil before this, and I see no reason to look for a different one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m due October 2nd.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and has a very light scent that is not at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has the extremely dry skin that comes with aging.</li>
            <li> even though i have dry skin, i don&#x27;t like the idea of feeling like my skin is greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>

            <li> I had dry patches on my face that have gone away.  </li>
            <li> Dry elbows no longer dry.  </li>
            <li> The oil is just what the dry skin is looking for.</li>
            <li> but the 1 ounce seems to go a long way than I expected</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry and brittle in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> Recently I was having serious skin trouble caused by frequent and red acne around my forehead and chin.</li>
            <li> I have dry and thick medium length grey/black hair and this Argan oil product gives me a natural looking sheen.</li>
            <li> Have been using a few drops on hair after shampooing for several weeks.  </li>
            <li> I found a few similar products, but the substantial discount offered with this one won me over.</li>
            <li> Today as I sat in the  hair salon with their harsh lighting, i looked up and saw a younger me.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> does have a smell, but it isn&#x27;t strong or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My dry, flaky skin is already smoother and less flaky.</li>
            <li> IT IS SO LITE, AND A LITTLE GO&#x27;S A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so I can not compare it to any other products.</li>
            <li> Deeply moisturizing, with no oil slick.  </li>
            <li> Other products were colorless, odorless and oily.  </li>
            <li> i have bought other brands of argan oil</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for - Get it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other products.</li>
            <li> AND IT DOES NOT WEIGHT IT DOWN.</li>
            <li> I had to turn it down to the lowest setting it worked so well.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is not very viscous and has a subtle amber/gold tint (not clear like water).</li>
            <li> I did some research, and found that it is not uncommon for argan oil to be mixed with other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It did make my skin/hair feel softer; however, I couldn&#x27;t tell a dramatic difference, or really any difference before using it (as opposed to any other oils) and the smell was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, something i have had problems with in the past with other face moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your skin oily, however if you put it on your hair, it my leave it a little oily.</li>
            <li> RUB IT AROUND A LITTLE AND PUT IT IN MY HAIR</li>
            <li> I have skin color change due to small burn and use this product to recover.</li>
            <li> A few drops go along way.  </li>
            <li> every 3-4 months really dried my hair out.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried a few.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with cheaper products as you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> I just use Idris Ibn argan oil for few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I live in cold climate.  </li>
            <li> This includes to the point that there is very little argan oil in the product.  </li>
            <li> I use it very little on my hands and arms after shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil as a moisturizer for the past year.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 months</li>
            <li> The winter months have been brutal where I live, which has made my skin so dry, at times to the point of where it itches and burns</li>
            <li> It rids the skin of the ashen grey film that is prevalent with this skin disorder.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past two weeks and can already see &amp; feel a difference!</li>
            <li> It is not too oily and only has a very faint smell which isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> I have also found that I like using it on my face and hands during this cold dry weather as it hydrates without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> If you compare the smell of this oil to a drug store brand that has perfume and other things added to it, you probably WILL be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> If not, you&#x27;ve got fake argan oil.</li>
            <li> It does not stain or leave any nasty marks like the other</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to work, not even very expensive salon treatments.  </li>
            <li> so bad it was embarassing.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a terrible smell, just not how I want my hair or skin to smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like the non-oily feel of Argan oil and wanted to try it out after seeing their promotion. I liked how this company discloses its source and shows its certification. I didn&#x27;t realize where it comes from until reading this listing.</li>
            <li> Just received my argan oil from this new supplier. Great supplier, fair price, prompt service, pure organic oil.  My arthritic fingers love it!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product. My 62 year old skin has never felt softer and more nourished. I would recommend this product to anyone who has the extremely dry skin that comes with aging. Ever since my late fifties, I have noticed a significant change in my skin - not only dryer, but thinner - almost like parchment. Idris Ibn pure argan oil really helped with this problem; my skin is no longer so dry and thin.[[ASIN:B00D5KVDOE Idris Ibn Argan Oil - 100% Pure Organic Treatment for Face, Hair, and Nails - USDA and ECOCERT Certified (1 fl. oz.) - Product of Morocco, 90 Day Money-Back Gurantee]]</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the Argan Oil. I have only been using it a week and already I am seeing results. My skin feels so much softer and smoother. I was also impressed by the customer service and quick delivery of the product. It was sent to me immediately after I ordered it. I would highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> I recently heard of the benefits of argan oil.  I did some research, and found that it is not uncommon for argan oil to be mixed with other ingredients.  This includes to the point that there is very little argan oil in the product.  That is why I wanted 100% argan along with being organic at a reasonable price.  I&#x27;m glad I searched Amazon and found this one.  It has the right certifications which includes USDA Organic which is what I look for when buying anything organic.  At the time I purchased there was a promotional price which I appreciated, but after trying it I would pay the regular price.  I&#x27;m very happy with the results of using this on my hands.  My hands get very dry and brittle in the winter months.  Even though it is summer right now I have done a lot of house cleaning which has left my hands very dry.  This oil hydrated and left my skin very soft.  I also love that is not greasy, so I can apply this whenever I wanted and not just at night.  Another plus is it has a light pleasant scent.  I have not tried any other argan oil before this, and I see no reason to look for a different one.  I will have to come back to add to my review during winter to tell of the results on my hands.</li>
            <li> Having dry skin was one of my major concerns for a long time. Hand cream is okay in the winter but not sweaty summer. I started to use Argon oil in the summer and I found that using Argon oil in the summer is ideal for me. I use it very little on my hands and arms after shower. I have been pleased by having smooth skin! I am sure that I keep using Argon oil for not only summer but all seasons. I must mention that I like IDRIS IBN Argan oil because it is 100% pure organic essence!</li>
            <li> I truly did love this product it helped my hair and I noticed improvements in my skin I plan to order again!</li>
            <li> This stuff was definitely pure oil but it is great to use during the winter months for that extra hydration dry skin needs.  good product, good price!</li>
            <li> first of all, i gave 4 stars of 5 ONLY because I&#x27;ve only had this product for 5 days, but that being said, the first time i used it i loved it! i was a bit worried about it being an oil, thinking it would feel greasy, even though i have dry skin, i don&#x27;t like the idea of feeling like my skin is greasy.  the directions recommend 1-2 drops to apply to face, and the first time i did this, but personally i have increased it to 3-4, as the smaller amount just didn&#x27;t seem to be enough, the oil is so light and non greasy  (i have super dry skin) there is little to no fragrance which also made me happy.  i threw a few drops in the ends of my hair too, very nice.  I&#x27;m interested in seeing if i notice any improvements in the look of my skin, i.e. fine lines etc, but no matter what i like the way it makes my skin feel, and thats whats most important to me.  and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, something i have had problems with in the past with other face moisturizers.</li>
            <li> The oil had a light aroma and it did not leave my skin feeling greasy.  This is my first time using argan oil so I can not compare it to any other products.</li>
            <li> I have dry and thick medium length grey/black hair and this Argan oil product gives me a natural looking sheen. It also helps to define the lines of my hair style and group the hair in a more becoming way. I am sold on this product. I do use more oil than in the directions as I have so much hair.</li>
            <li> I researched the benefits of Argan Oil and started to look for it in health and beauty stores locally.  The cost was way too expensive for me and most times they had other things added to the oil.  I researched and found that those products that are not 100% oil really have a very small amount of pure argan oil.  I found this product on Amazon and it is perfect.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and use it for everything.  My hair nails skin.  A few drops go along way.  I also use it on my eyebrows and it seems to help them thicken up after years of abuse with waxing. I will definitely purchase more of this product in the future.  This is the best price I have seen for 100% pure oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil as a moisturizer for the past year. Prior to that, I spent a lot of money on numerous facial moisturizers in an attempt to find the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; moisturizer. After reading several positive reviews of argan oil I decided to order a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; moisturizer. Of the argan oils I&#x27;ve tried, Idris Ibn Argan Oil belongs at the top of the list. It is not heavy, is absorbed quickly, does not have an odor, and makes my skin feel silky smooth not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  It is totally natural and it absorbs beautifully, leaving skin silky soft and fine lines softened too.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products on my extremely dry hair. Nothing seemed to work, not even very expensive salon treatments.  Then my daughter suggested this product and I&#x27;m in love.  I have been growing my layers in my hair out and getting perms every 3-4 months really dried my hair out.  My last perm fried my hair so bad it was embarassing.  So I tried Idris Ibn Argan Oil.  With just one use, my hair has drastically changed.  My hair looked instantly healthier and styling it wasn&#x27;t nearly the chore it has been until now.  I can&#x27;t wait until my next treatment.</li>
            <li> Received my Idris Ibn Argan Oil a week ago.  Every night I  look forward to washing my face and applying this oil.  My skin feels so soft and smooth...I only wish I found this sooner!</li>
            <li> 1. smell is very light nutty scent. The smell disappears once the oil is absorb by the skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. the consistency is almost like water. It does not leave your skin oily, however if you put it on your hair, it my leave it a little oily.</li>
            <li> Have been using a few drops on hair after shampooing for several weeks.  Hair is softer, curlier, and more manageable, especially the grey hair.  I plan to try the oil on my face too.</li>
            <li> This is the only oil I can use on my face without breaking out. You only need a small amount and it hydrates the skin very well. I use it at night as a night moisturizer and during the day under my sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my hair, and again only a small amount needed to help stop the frizz and keeps it soft and smooth. Essential for summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old and have always had fine hair in texture...no body and easily frizzes. I have colored my hair for over 20 years and wash and blow dry it daily. When I lived in a dry environment, it was not a problem, but since moving to the Houston area, I have had many issues, especially during the humid months. I tried just about everything, but nothing helped....until NOW. I have discovered TWO things. First, I have found that adding protein to my hair every so often has restored the shine that has been diminishing over the years as I&#x27;ve gotten older (I use Neutral Color Protein Filler from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply). Second, I have found that using Argon oil as well gives my hair even more shine and makes it soft and silky without that greasy feeling. Since my hair is fine, I shampoo with a non-sulfate shampoo (I use Nano Works from Pureology) and then I add several drops of the argon oil to my conditioner before adding the conditioner. After rinsing, I also put one drop of oil in my hands, rub them together, then spread it through my hair. I chose Idris Ibn Argon Oil because it is 100% pure and it comes in a smaller bottle which keeps it fresher. I have also found that I like using it on my face and hands during this cold dry weather as it hydrates without that greasy feeling. PS. Since using the protein and the oil, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hubby likes to rub his fingers through my hair. Something he hadn&#x27;t done for a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a bigger bottle but the 1 ounce seems to go a long way than I expected</li>
            <li> It did make my skin/hair feel softer; however, I couldn&#x27;t tell a dramatic difference, or really any difference before using it (as opposed to any other oils) and the smell was not pleasant. It wasn&#x27;t a terrible smell, just not how I want my hair or skin to smell. Having said that I did finish the bottle because I had paid for it, but I used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended Argan oil during pregnancy. I have been faithfully applying the oil since I was 3 months pregnant and no stretch marks yet. My skin feels silky and hydrated. I will definitely continue use of Idris Ibn after I deliver, not only to my belly but for my hands, hair, and entire body. I love it! I&#x27;m due October 2nd. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll luck out and stay stretch mark free. I&#x27;ll follow up after my angel arrives. Thanks for a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did research on Argan oil and read &amp;#34; it is well known for its antioxidant and hydrating properties, both of which can be beneficial to the skin. Argan oil uses against stretch marks can help reduce them, together with providing anti-aging benefits for the skin. Women may find that applying Argan oil during pregnancy helps reduce stretch marks later on.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Argan oil uses for stretch marks stop the breakdown of collagen and elastin, two elements which contribute to the elasticity of the skin. It also acts as a moisturizing solution and helps keep the skin reinvigorated and fresh. Argan oil uses for stretch marks aid in the rejuvenation of both elastin and collagen and helps prevent the degeneration process which takes place at the cellular level.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My hair was chemicaly damaged, this oil brought it back to life. I would repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I also have the one by Josie maran and this is just as good if not better! And way cheaper and knowing it&#x27;s all natural makes it even better! I use it as a face moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t break me out ! I have really dry skin and this works for me , I would recommend for dry skin</li>
            <li> Just received this order about a week ago and have been using it ever since. Love it! My 68 yr old dry skin stays hydrated better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve used before. Will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this wonderful product. I love how it feels on my skin. No greasy feeling and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> IT IS SO LITE, AND A LITTLE GO&#x27;S A LONG WAY. I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO TAKE MY MAKEUP OFF AT NIGHT, TO PUT THIS ON, I ONLY WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS ALONG TIME AGO. I ALSO PUT A COUPLE OF DROPS ON MY PALM RUB IT AROUND A LITTLE AND PUT IT IN MY HAIR SEAMS TO CALM DOWN MY FRIZZYS AND IT DOES NOT WEIGHT IT DOWN. I GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 5 STAR RATING. I</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good, natural facial moisturizer to use over night that wouldn&#x27;t a)irritate my sensitive skin or b)cost an arm and a leg. I found a few similar products, but the substantial discount offered with this one won me over. Since this is my first experience with argan oil I can&#x27;t really compare it to other brands, but I have had a good experience with this product! I have used this for about two weeks to moisturize my face and neck before I go to bed at night. When I wake up, my skin is soft and smooth (which is nice when you&#x27;ve been up most of the night working on some homework you&#x27;ve put off until the last minute). It helped clear up a dry, flaky patch on my chin I had been battling for a couple of weeks. I can&#x27;t yet say whether it has helped clear up my moderate, college stress-induced acne, but it sure hasn&#x27;t made it any worse. It also makes a nice lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;This does have a smell, but it isn&#x27;t strong or unpleasant. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Heard a lot about Argan oil before I decided to purchase.  I have to say that my skin has seen a huge difference since using the oil.  I had dry patches on my face that have gone away.  Dry elbows no longer dry.  Highly recommend!  Will always keep on hand.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I will definitely continue to use Argan Oil in the future.  I live in cold climate.  JJ</li>
            <li> I have just had it for a few days so its too early to see any results.  Preliminary results on hair are okay...easy to wash out.  Somewhat helpful on dry-patches on skin so far.  The company that sent it to me is was outstanding.  It was well packaged and arrived soon after I ordered it and was followed up with delivery confirmation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past two weeks and can already see &amp; feel a difference! I&#x27;m an outdoors women and really feel that the Argan Oil is really countering the effects of wind and sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara from Pasadena</li>
            <li> A friend commented how much her skin had improved with the use of Argan oil.  I decided to give it a try and found Idris Ibn.  This product is very nice.  Directions on the bottle recommend a couple of drops to the face but I have found 4-5 is needed.  This oil is a very nice moisturizer, non-greasy, and absorbs well into the skin.  Don&#x27;t hesitate!</li>
            <li> A superior all around beauty product. The only oil needed to achieve healthy skin and hair. As a sufferer of discoid lupus disorder, this oil product is a must. It rids the skin of the ashen grey film that is prevalent with this skin disorder. Thank you Idris Ibn.</li>
            <li> Received my Idris Ibn argan oil, (speedy-quick), and tried it out immediately!  I can&#x27;t comment on the long-term benefits, but my first impressions are that it is easily absorbed into my skin....not too oily.  The smell is not bad at all, which was a concern of mine,after reading some of the reviews.  If you compare the smell of this oil to a drug store brand that has perfume and other things added to it, you probably WILL be disappointed.  Just remember that this is a natural oil and will smell earthy, ( but, that&#x27;s not a bad thing).  I followed the directions and only used a couple of drops for my hair and it worked fine.  Same amount massaged onto my face after cleansing...very nice!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality organic oil that is definitely worth the price.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and it works well to hydrate without  clogging pores.</li>
            <li> Great consistency and smell.  Goes on very easily, just a few drops goes a long way.  My wife loves it.  Also the company is clearly run by people who understand good service with a human touch.  Highly recommended and I wish them good success.</li>
            <li> I just srarted using it i can really see the difference.My tbody tone is getting more evev especially my face.I will definately buy more and recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for 2 months and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results.  I use this oil before bedtime and when I wake in the morning my lines around the eyes are much softened and less visible.  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;My age is 62 and I have tried many products but this has given me the best results.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry from being a flight attendant  and using Retin-A . IDRIS IBN Argan oil has been a life saver. It&#x27;s soothing and  it doesn&#x27;t  make me break out. I love it!! Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Recently I was having serious skin trouble caused by frequent and red acne around my forehead and chin. Acne is apparently caused not only by shortage of water but also by shortage of appropriate oil component. With this great product, using twice a week, problem  resolved. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Deeply moisturizing, with no oil slick.  Product absorbed quickly. Can be used in the morning or at night. Great for Wintertime skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 months and I just love it.  I live in a very dry climate and this oil has been a God send. Beautiful for Hair - Face - Skin - Nails</li>
            <li> I bought the Nuface Trinity Facial Toning Device and I used their gel but it didn&#x27;t feel like it was working and I used it at it&#x27;s highest level.  Then I tried it with Aloe Vera and water and oil and nothing seemed to be working that well, and Nuface was set on the highest setting.  My sister was using Idris Ibn Argan oil for her hair so I tried it and my hair was tangle free.  So I tried Idris Ibn Argan Oil on my face and the Nuface toner and it works great.  I had to turn it down to the lowest setting it worked so well.  My sagging chin is getting tighter.  It is great!  thank you&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006HTPL8Y Nuface Trinity Facial Toning Device White color]]</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, unsure, of how my sensitive skin would react to a new product...AND...it works wonders. Although an oil, it is extremely light and absorbs into the skin much faster than some.  I particularly enjoy the way it makes my, usually, dry skin feel smooth and look refreshed.  There is a very light &amp;#34;almond&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell but nothing overwhelming or that could be smelled by others. I would recommend product to friends and plan to make this my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because I would have rather received a bigger bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Argan Oil for a little over a month now and am very happy with how smooth it leaves my skin.  I use it on my face and my skin feels better than it ever has.  It is not too oily and only has a very faint smell which isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> Finally found an Argan Oil that lives up to it&#x27;s reviews.  And I&#x27;ve tried a few.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with cheaper products as you get what you pay for.  This is the real thing!  Other products were colorless, odorless and oily.  This has a slight golden tint and subtle scent, as it should, and glides right on.  Not heavy or pore clogging.  Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I have just started to use this product on my face.  It soothes and smoothes--my hands also feel wonderful after I use them to apply the oil.  The oil is just what the dry skin is looking for.</li>
            <li> I was recently in Morocco and visited the cooperative where Argan Oil was produced.  I bought a bottle there because my guide recommended it very highly.  When I came back home I began using it and absolutely fell in love with it&#x27;s purity and smoothness and the kindness it showed to my skin.  As soon as I finished my supply I ordered a bottle from Idris Ibn and was pleased with the quality which was equal to what I had bought in Morocco.  I&#x27;m a total convert and use nothing else on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Renae</li>
            <li> It is a moisturizing non fragrance oil with nice light natural smell. It can be useful for dry skin treatment. I have skin color change due to small burn and use this product to recover. I am still evaluating its performance as skin tone solution. Well packaged and arrived on time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil...it leaves my skin so soft, like silk. The winter months have been brutal where I live, which has made my skin so dry, at times to the point of where it itches and burns, I apply this oil and my skin instantly feels and looks so much better, after using it for almost 2 weeks, my skin has stayed soft and suptle, even before I apply it. I also have to say that the shipping was super fast on this order. I had a couple of questions about the oil and received a response very quickly, The seller was very helpful, and even sent me another bottle. Great customer service!!..I will definitely be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I have been using argan oil for three years and I am often asked how I look so.young.  I am 70 years old and I do not have any wrinkles or crows feet.  I also use this on.my cuticles and they are smooth and never need grooming during manicures.  I had been using the Josie Maran product which is much more expensive and does not support any social cause.  I will now order this argan oil exclusively.  Keep up the excellent work.</li>
            <li> I chose to give this Argan Oil five stars because I have been using it for a week now and i really see a difference in my skin!! Today as I sat in the  hair salon with their harsh lighting, i looked up and saw a younger me.  It is light, non-greasy and feels great on the skin.  I hope to give some to my daughter so she keeps her young looking skin.</li>
            <li> i have bought other brands of argan oil and i can assure you it is 100% argan oil.no greasy and has a slight nutty smell,one way to check that is pure argan oil is apply on a burn or injury and can not feel a burning,it you feel it,its not argan oil and i did the test with this and i felt relief.you can trust in this brand</li>
            <li> I recently saw my sister, and she had this Idris Ibn Argon oil. I used it and could not believe how by skin reacted to it. Wow. My skin was soft, and the feel was non greasy. this product was amazing. I highly suggest you try it now that winter is approaching.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Idris Ibn argan oil as a gift, and now will order more, because it&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever found for my dry skin, especially troublesome areas on the face.  I can apply it anywhere without irritation, such as around the eyes, using normal precaution such as closing the eyes (well duh, I suppose..)&lt;br /&gt;It works well on the hands and arms too. It&#x27;s great to know that ordinary people benefit by producing the oil in Morocco, and the organic certification seems superior to some products found in health food stores that sometimes have chemicals added.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil!  I use it primarily on my face and eyelashes.  Immediately after application my skin feels soft and smooth and the fine lines actually disappear.  As a surprise bonus, I definitely can see that after using this product my eyelashes are more healthy and have started to grow longer.  My friends (without me prompting them) have commented on how lovely my skin and eyelashes look lately, and, that that to me is wonderful confirmation of how effective the Argan Oil is.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  It is not too oily and has a pleasant, very faint smell.  Have tried on my face and hair, and the only reason I gave 4 stars vs. 5 is that it makes my hair slighly oily.  Love using it on my face and lips.</li>
            <li> I just use Idris Ibn argan oil for few days. I like the result this product comes out. My hair look healthier than before. I will continue to use this product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Idris Ibn Argan Oil is everything they say it is &amp; more!  It&#x27;s not oily to the touch after a couple of seconds it disappears into your skin to do its magic and leave your skin feeling like satin. It is reasonably priced - 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil - USDA Certified - bottled in dark color with expiration date on their label. What more can you ask for - Get it you will not be disappointed. I Love It!</li>
            <li> I am extremely impressed with Idris Ibn Argan Oil.  I use it all over my face, also on earlobes, neck, d√©colletage, cuticles, top of my hands, and in my hair.  I use it sparingly because a little goes a long way.  I love the way my skin quickly absorbs the oil, and it works amazingly well under make-up.  I was skeptical about using it under make-up but tried it and could not be happier with the smooth results.  I live in the Midwest where horrendous winter weather wreaks havoc with my skin.  Argan Oil is a blessing in this type of environment and enriches my skin by restoring it to a dewy, glowingly healthy appearance.  An added plus is its USDA organic seal.  I highly recommend this product to anyone, regardless of age and skin type, who values health and desires youthful looking skin.  Definitely a five-star product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this oil !  I&#x27;ve used it on my cuticles,  body, eyes, lips, face,  hair,  cats paws !!  Absorbs quickly and has no odor or taste.  My skin is silky smooth and the cats don&#x27;t mind it on their paws or fur !! Will definitely be purchasing more : )</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;mature&#x27;, dry skin and after only a week, this product has made my skin soft and glowing.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days but I noticed results very quickly.  My dry, flaky skin is already smoother and less flaky.</li>
            <li> This product arrived very quickly, was well packaged, and even included a nice note from the seller. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I like it, so far. I have oily skin and no wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t really speak to it&#x27;s ability to combat dryness and/or lines, but I can say that it moisturizes well without making my skin look or feel greasy. It absorbs well and has a very light scent that is not at all unpleasant. It&#x27;s great for my cuticles, as well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it for both my face and my nails. It does not stain or leave any nasty marks like the other products.&lt;br /&gt;Pam.</li>
            <li> I am an avid fan of natural facial oils. I&#x27;ve tried many different natural oils on my face, including emu oil, jojoba oil, cactus seed oil, shea butter, mineral oil etc. Cactus seed oil is probably the best in terms of wrinkle therapy ($$$$), and jojoba oil is the best for night time moisturizer. But 100% argan oil is the best for day time use because it&#x27;s very light and it absorbs rapidly and completely into the skin. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and it doesn&#x27;t leave a shine like some of the heavier oils (I&#x27;m looking at you, emu oil!). For day time, I like to put the cactus seed oil around the eye and mouth area and finish off with the argan oil around the rest of my face. I don&#x27;t use any other products. Jojoba oil is good too, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb as well if I didn&#x27;t just come out of the shower/bath and my pores are wide open. The great thing about argan oil is that it&#x27;s affordable compared to cactus seed oil and really effective as a moisturizer. It can also be used in combination with whatever else you&#x27;re putting on your face. I put it on last because I think it may be an effective carrier oil to bring some of the less absorbable products deeper into the epidermis (sort of like how hyaluronic acid works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use Idris Ibn branded argan oil. I&#x27;ve tried to get so-called \\&quot;100%\\&quot; argan oil from ebay. I&#x27;m not going to name sellers, but suffice to say that most of the cheap \\&quot;100% argan oil\\&quot; you find on eBay is fake. Argan oil is not very viscous and has a subtle amber/gold tint (not clear like water). It should also come in a amber glass bottle because it&#x27;s light sensitive, If not, you&#x27;ve got fake argan oil. I don&#x27;t even know how Idris Iban makes money at this price point, but I&#x27;m thrilled that they can and they&#x27;re making this amazing product available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: Idris Ibn offered a free bottle to write a customer review, but if I didn&#x27;t like the product, I wouldn&#x27;t want another bottle anyway. It&#x27;s good stuff. Get it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.  I even look better in the morning!!</li>
            <li> See improvement on my skin .. Good</li>
            <li> I use this Argan oil on my face in the morning and at night.(I also use a moisturizer after applying) I have extremely dry, sensitive skin and while using, I do not have any flaking or tightness. I use about 3 drops and it absorbs quickly. I also use about 2 drops rubbed into my palms and smoothed into my damp, freshly washed hair when I don&#x27;t use conditioner. My hair is shiny and not flyaway. My husband has eczema on his back and we&#x27;ve experimented and put some on a particular &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; area for about 3 days. He&#x27;s noticed improvement with his troublesome itching! This is the second brand I&#x27;ve tried and will continue with this.</li>
