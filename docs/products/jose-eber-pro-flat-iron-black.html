            <li>My wife loved it and the dual voltage worked perfectly in Europe.</li>

            <li>This is a great straightener and my BFF who has a Chi</li>
            <li>Does not perform with the sleekness I had experienced in the demo.</li>
            <li>but this iron is amazing!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much at a fair,</li>
            <li>Does not straighten as good as I thought it would, but does add shine to your hair.</li>
            <li>The packaging was good the box had warranty and a virtual instruction kinda thing which helps in what and what not to do with it.</li>

            <li>and i got it today on Saturday amazing.</li>
            <li>i have kind of wavey hair</li>
            <li>I let them show me how to use it &amp; of course I liked it.</li>
            <li>Very cool, and use beautiful and original quality</li>
            <li>best off all, the round corners make it SO easy to curl my fine hair and it lasts, no lie, ALL DAY!!!!</li>
            <li>the great part is that it is not so hot that it burns your hair!</li>
            <li>This is a great straightener, it&#x27;s light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>loved this staightener so much and felt I got such a great deal that I ended up ordering one for my daughter, my mom, my best friend and my sister-in-law.....</li>
            <li>Great flat iron at an amazing price!</li>
            <li>Then when my friend &amp; I said we were just gonna sell it on Ebay, the sales lady caught a huge attitude with us!</li>
            <li>HUGE SCAM!</li>
            <li>Works magic on my frizzy unruly locks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>but it does an okay job.</li>
            <li>but it worked okay for a bit then my hair started getting all ughh looking and by an hour</li>
            <li>After using this product every day for 2-3 weeks, I was told by my hairdresser that my hair is in *better</li>
            <li>I was able to register it for the lifetime warranty so that was a bonus.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>I was almost talked into buying one at the mall for nearly 25% more, but I was glad to find it instead on amazon!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really feel like the upgrade I was expecting or paid for, I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full $100 they were asking at the store!.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s ok, it does the work, it does get my hair straight after like 3 or 4 passes, the plastic seems cheap</li>
            <li>This flat iron is the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I saw the demo at a local fair, they were selling it for $250</li>
            <li>everything i have no hairspray on either and its still soft and nice.</li>
            <li>this flat iron is a good deal especially with the price, all of you should buy it if your looking for a good one..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel super hot and does not burn my fine hair.....</li>
            <li>does not compare to the Jose eber curling rods at all... doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d have something to fall back on or someone to contact in the event of a defective product, no need, this thing is awesome and best of all, through Amazon I got it for 1/4 the price of the fair price, for the exact same item, the exact same item, not rip off, not similar, not knock-off, not last years model, the exact same item!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife like it  very much when she use it at first time, and she ordered another one for her mother.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is smaller than I had visualized but it is very effective.</li>
            <li>well all in all, total of 5 Jose Eber Pro Series Straighteners for $250, the total amount they wanted for just one at the local fair!!!</li>
            <li>This is my first review ever.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron i put on my hair therapy</li>
            <li>pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li>I could normally not afford such a good one</li>
            <li>and it made it straight and its still straight</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>fantastic product and reccomend others in the market for a flat iron should get one.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic flat iron that delivers!</li>
            <li>The reason I got this one was mainly because of the dual voltage thing.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace an old straightener and have had to go back to my old straightener as it still works better and is 4 years old.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is great for frizzy thick hair.</li>
            <li>It takes a little minute heat up, but leaves your hair silky, shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>This is the same exact brand and very high quality.</li>
            <li>and i heard it makes your hair feel very silky and soft ...</li>
            <li>and yeah, it does get your hair straight and smooth, but not as well as my previous \\&quot;Hair art H3000\\&quot; straightner.</li>
            <li>far prefers the Jose Eber to hers!</li>
            <li>When I was stopped at the mall to be show this product I wasn&#x27;t interested at all, I already have a flat iron.</li>
            <li>i got it really early</li>
            <li>it felt a lot silky and so soft</li>
            <li>first let it dry and stared going through my hair</li>
            <li>Small but mighty is all I can say.</li>
            <li>Be careful: the iron does get incredibly hot and it can burn your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it heats up quick, doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s pulling at my hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after using it.</li>
            <li>(there is only one setting); other than that, I recommend it highly.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s not hard like other straightners I&#x27;ve seen, if you don&#x27;t need a dual voltage flat iron, go for the \\&quot;Hair art</li>
            <li> I used to have regular flat iron from walmart</li>
            <li> I bought this same flat iron at a mall kiosk for $100.00 3 years ago.</li>

            <li> ive had this flat iron for about 4years</li>
            <li> Does this flat iron has moving blades to curl hairv</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m careful, even lasts through the end of the next day, with minor touch ups, i&#x27;ve never had another straightner do that......</li>
            <li> Not much to say than what&#x27;s already been said.</li>
            <li> And so was I until I drop it and burned it in Europe due to a baaaad voltage adapter!</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it took me awhile to straighten.</li>
            <li> in case something went wrong,</li>
            <li> Just buy it, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> my ends would curl up and it felt disgusting when i touched it...</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This flat iron is the best I have tried so far. I could normally not afford such a good one but it was a really great buy on Amazon. I wish it had a variable temperature setting (there is only one setting); other than that, I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Not much to say than what&#x27;s already been said. This is a great straightener and my BFF who has a Chi far prefers the Jose Eber to hers! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic flat iron that delivers! Works magic on my frizzy unruly locks. fantastic product and reccomend others in the market for a flat iron should get one.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever bought!! Doesn&#x27;t feel super hot and does not burn my fine hair.....best off all, the round corners make it SO easy to curl my fine hair and it lasts, no lie, ALL DAY!!!! If I&#x27;m careful, even lasts through the end of the next day, with minor touch ups, i&#x27;ve never had another straightner do that......I saw the demo at a local fair, they were selling it for $250 but I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much at a fair, in case something went wrong, who would I contact??? So I went through Amazon so I&#x27;d have something to fall back on or someone to contact in the event of a defective product, no need, this thing is awesome and best of all, through Amazon I got it for 1/4 the price of the fair price, for the exact same item, the exact same item, not rip off, not similar, not knock-off, not last years model, the exact same item!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I loved this staightener so much and felt I got such a great deal that I ended up ordering one for my daughter, my mom, my best friend and my sister-in-law.....basically got 4, well all in all, total of 5 Jose Eber Pro Series Straighteners for $250, the total amount they wanted for just one at the local fair!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is smaller than I had visualized but it is very effective. You only have to go through once. Small but mighty is all I can say.</li>
            <li> I just got the straightner and yeah, it does get your hair straight and smooth, but not as well as my previous \\&quot;Hair art H3000\\&quot; straightner. The reason I got this one was mainly because of the dual voltage thing. I did lots of research, read reviews, watched reviews on youtube and it looked like it worked perfectly, in my case, it&#x27;s ok, it does the work, it does get my hair straight after like 3 or 4 passes, the plastic seems cheap and it&#x27;s not hard like other straightners I&#x27;ve seen, if you don&#x27;t need a dual voltage flat iron, go for the \\&quot;Hair art H3000\\&quot; I think it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had it and nothing will surpass it, in my local beauty salon that&#x27;s the one they&#x27;ve been using for over 5 years! And so was I until I drop it and burned it in Europe due to a baaaad voltage adapter! I think I might get another one and use the \\&quot;José Eber\\&quot; just for traveling.</li>
            <li> Love it would buy it again!</li>
            <li> I received this product about a week ago and was very excited to try a Jose Eber product after hearing rave reviews! This is a great straightener, it&#x27;s light weight and easy to use. There is only one heat setting which is the only downfall about it. Otherwise, it heats up quick, doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s pulling at my hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after using it. I would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> does not compare to the Jose eber curling rods at all... doesn&#x27;t get very hot. Bought to replace an old straightener and have had to go back to my old straightener as it still works better and is 4 years old.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works incredibly well. I was almost talked into buying one at the mall for nearly 25% more, but I was glad to find it instead on amazon! Be careful: the iron does get incredibly hot and it can burn your fingers if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> (According to my daughter)&lt;br /&gt;If you have any doubts on purchasing this item, I assure you this is one of the best straighteners around.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> ive had this flat iron for about 4years and it still works great! the great part is that it is not so hot that it burns your hair! AND theres no hassle of having to set a temp all the time! it also makes beautiful curls! I&#x27;m currently looking into buying another flat iron and a curling iron! I will NEVER buy another brand again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I have a really terrific flatiron but I wanted one to leave at my summer home , so I purchased this one. Not as efficient as I&#x27;d like, but it does an okay job. If you only buy one flatiron, I would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Does not straighten as good as I thought it would, but does add shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have regular flat iron from walmart but it worked okay for a bit then my hair started getting all ughh looking and by an hour my ends would curl up and it felt disgusting when i touched it... but this iron is amazing! i got it really early i was supposed to get it on Thursday and i got it today on Saturday amazing. The packaging was good the box had warranty and a virtual instruction kinda thing which helps in what and what not to do with it. pretty straight forward. Love this flat iron i put on my hair therapy first let it dry and stared going through my hair and i heard it makes your hair feel very silky and soft ... it felt a lot silky and so soft no joke this flat iron is a good deal especially with the price, all of you should buy it if your looking for a good one.. i have kind of wavey hair and it made it straight and its still straight and Ive been outside and everything i have no hairspray on either and its still soft and nice. Really impressed with it. My hair feels amazing !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great buy! I bought this same flat iron at a mall kiosk for $100.00 3 years ago. I found it on Amazon for $22.00. This is the same exact brand and very high quality. MSRP on the box is $265. 00. Go figure. You won&#x27;t find a deal like this anywhere. This is my first review ever. Just buy it, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very cool, and use beautiful and original quality</li>
            <li> Works great! Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great for frizzy thick hair. It takes a little minute heat up, but leaves your hair silky, shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> When I was stopped at the mall to be show this product I wasn&#x27;t interested at all, I already have a flat iron. I let them show me how to use it &amp; of course I liked it. I was talked into buying it ($159) may I add! I brought it home &amp; used it the next day and I could smell it burning my hair! Took it back to the cart at the mall for a refund &amp; they denied me! Lady tried the Iron on my hair to see if she could smell the burning hair &amp; claimed she couldn&#x27;t even though I could! Then when my friend &amp; I said we were just gonna sell it on Ebay, the sales lady caught a huge attitude with us! DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT! HUGE SCAM! IT WILL BURN YOU HAIR! IT BURNT MINE &amp; I COULD STILL SMELL THE BURNT HAIR 3 DAYS LATER! WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> Does this flat iron has moving blades to curl hairv</li>
            <li> Does not perform with the sleekness I had experienced in the demo. Wish it had adjustable temperature settings. It doesn&#x27;t really feel like the upgrade I was expecting or paid for, I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t pay the full $100 they were asking at the store!. Boo.</li>
            <li> Not the same quality I was expecting.</li>
            <li> My wife like it  very much when she use it at first time, and she ordered another one for her mother. As per her word &amp;#34;it is the best one I have been using ever since&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After using this product every day for 2-3 weeks, I was told by my hairdresser that my hair is in *better* condition than it&#x27;s been in ages.  This product truly DOES everything it suggests in advertising.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife loved it and the dual voltage worked perfectly in Europe.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> This product did not come with a travel case and took forever to get to my house. Amazon actually had to cancel my order and re-order it. I have thick hair and it took me awhile to straighten. I did not come with a travel bag like some say it did. I was able to register it for the lifetime warranty so that was a bonus.</li>
