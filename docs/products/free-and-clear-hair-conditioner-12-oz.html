            <li>I have resorted to using this to shave with, conditioner makes a great shaving lotion.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>this works for cleaning hair,  great for all of us allergy sufferers.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find a shampoo and conditioner that did not have fragrance and was hypoallergenic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for me.  </li>

            <li>And my skin is happy.</li>
            <li>and I was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Free&amp;Clear and Vanicream products are perfect for me because I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances.</li>
            <li>but it is good at getting the tangles out.  </li>
            <li>Read the ingredients before purchasing to see that this product is good for you.  </li>
            <li>no itching or redness as result of good scalp rub... tried it out on my daughter Earline</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always good when that doesn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner does an alright job for me, not as good as others that I used before I had sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I would find a conditioner that worked great for my hair but the overwhelming perfume would have my scalp burning.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I began over a period of time to have much better hair days!  </li>
            <li>The Free &amp; Clear line is the best, and their conditioner is excellent.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>I got a sample at my dermatologists office and liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner containing no gluten, which is reason purchased.</li>
            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and it spreads well through my hair.</li>
            <li>Conditions my hair very well but the best part is that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>this conditioner is spectacular.</li>
            <li>It is really nice.  </li>
            <li>I have heard no complaints about it, and expect it is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am glad he doesn&#x27;t need prescription stuff as often, since this has worked so nicely.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent conditioner for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have thrown it away and started looking for a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li>It used to be excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this conditioner works well for me</li>
            <li>These products work great for my scalp, I had tried so many products to no avail and I am so happy to find one that actually works!</li>
            <li>Very light.  </li>
            <li>Great price for this large bottle.</li>
            <li>This entire line of products is wonderful and has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>because their products don&#x27;t use masking scents (many &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; hair products still use masking scent).</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>, she&#x27;s three, just to make sure no problems, then on myself...</li>
            <li>product is my favorite hair conditioner and the safest to use, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This did more conditioning.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of problems with itchy scalp (and hair loss) from commercial conditioners, but this brand has been great!</li>
            <li>My wife has become allergic to ingredients used in most shampoos and conditioners as a preservative.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Why do so many soaps and shampoos have to have fragrances added.</li>
            <li>I make sure the Allafia doesn&#x27;t touch my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I still have my stubborn allergy problem but the conditioner has alleviated some of the scalp dryness.</li>
            <li>I used this conditioner for many years.</li>
            <li>My curls and waves are much more defined.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves a bit of a film on my hair, but we buy it because it does NOT give my daughter hives or otherwise disturb her many allergies.</li>
            <li>All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.</li>
            <li>I use more conditioner</li>
            <li>Try it out and review it if you are more picky than I am.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has worked well to keep her skin healthy and her hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>This formula is lovely.</li>
            <li>- okay but would prefer not to use it often.</li>
            <li>still like it better than DE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very clean.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good priced.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely better than any other conditioner I have ever tried at a drug store, probably the best conditioner I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>Great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There are better fragrance free products out there.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is excellent for people who are sensitive to certain fragrances and ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have a very full head of fine, wavy, porous hair.</li>
            <li>Free and Clear has been great</li>
            <li>Very mild and</li>
            <li>Gentle and sensitive ... perfect for people like me who can not use products with lots of chemicals and perfumes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance and have a lot of fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>PLEASE keep stocking it as I have found no other shampoo and conditioner free of these preservatives!!!  </li>
            <li>Works fine for me.</li>
            <li>This really works wonders for him and We have tried so many products!</li>
            <li>Very surprised at how nice this is for a conditioner without many of the additives.  </li>
            <li>and I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting as good of a clean as with normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>Creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any benefit from the sulfate free formula.</li>
            <li>It is wonderfully gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Fragrance and dye free.</li>
            <li>However this is the best free and clear conditioner I have found so far.</li>
            <li>No scent at all and free of salicylates.</li>
            <li>This line of products are great for those of us with sensitivities to chemicals and especially perfumes.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner does a find job of making her hair smooth and taking out the tangles.  </li>
            <li>I am liberal with the amount of conditioner (and also massage it in for a while before rinsing out lightly.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s not as good as far as moisturizing and conditioning the hair, but it seems to do the trick for now.  </li>
            <li>That one is very powerful &amp; needed once/week.</li>
            <li>My oldest child has skin allergies, and this is the only hair product we can successfully use on her.</li>
            <li>have noted the itching to have been reduced significantly, swelling in the area to be reduced</li>
            <li>I am excited that I found a backup that I&#x27;m not allergic to - in case PC ever changes their formula</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the additional money to have such a great change for her.</li>
            <li>I have tried several fragrance-free conditioners and this one is by and far the best</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use anything that contains fragrances, this doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance so that is nice.</li>
            <li>The Free &amp; Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner have been wonderful, providing almost immediate relief from the scalp irritation that they had been dealing with for a long time.  </li>
            <li>In short, however, this is great stuff, the price is right, you won&#x27;t feel greasy in 24 hours, and your hair isn&#x27;t falling out.  </li>
            <li>My hair will still hold a curl, but my ponytail loses its volume, but the shine is impressive.</li>
            <li>This is good for daily use.</li>
            <li>(so far) hasn&#x27;t caused any kind of allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>It was ok, but it didn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li>and I am going to keep using this to see if I can really get much better relief over time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both my daughter and my mother suffer from eczema and we had been looking for shampoo products that would be more gentle on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li>luckily I have discovered that i am not allergic to the leave in conditioner that I have always used</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, I try one of my old conditioners, but if I use them more than one washing in a row, I end up with itchy scalp--but not with Free &amp; Clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her skin is much better since we started using the Free and Clear Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Used with Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and was pleasantly surprised my hair smelled good, did not flatten and no itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>It also weighs down my hair without doing a great job moisturizing it.</li>
            <li>The first fragrance free shampoo and conditioner nice enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>She did like the free and clear shampoo, gel and hairspray and said they were all fine to use, without sodium laurel sufate and would not strip the hair or anything.</li>
            <li>We love all the Vanicream products we have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Many with dandruff just have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will often use a lightly scented shampoo, but then follow up with the Free and Clear Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m back for more Free &amp; Clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was soft amd more managable.(frizzy,very curly hair).</li>
            <li>For me, the need for scent-free conditioner is more important than the need for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Free and Clear Hair Conditioner is a light conditioner for those that have allergies to over the counter shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I also plan on breast feeding and will have to continue this regimen of free and clear products (also use Vanicream for lotion) until I stop as its important not to contaminate your breast milk.</li>
            <li>After using it just two times, my hair is better than its been in years- really really soft, and frizz is almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li>I will continue buying Free &amp; Clear Conditioner and Shampoo forever, so please keep it available and tell the manufacturer not to change or discontinue it.  </li>
            <li>I noticed  significant decrease in my allergy symptoms when I started using it, and the free and clear shampoo.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair feeling nice and smooth but it seems to wear off during the day faster than other stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>right for me.  </li>
            <li>I completely switched my hair products to Free &amp;amp; Clear and love them.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful in that it doesn&#x27;t give me a facial rash as so many other scented regular hair products do.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nice and silky and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>A wonderful conditioner for my thick dry hair and halleluyah fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I love shampoo and the gel, too - finally a gel that doesn&#x27;t cause me any problems and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this item from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I will order the Free &amp; Clear shampoo again, but I will skip this.</li>
            <li>I have been using Free &amp; Clear conditioner and shampoo for almost two years now.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get used to the different feel, but my hair is as healthy as it was using salon organic brands</li>
            <li>As for me, I will continue to use Free &amp; Clear conditioner unless I develop and allergy to one of its ingredients.</li>
            <li>so I was really hoping this one would be the one!</li>
            <li>But my issue with the conditioner is really that it doesn&#x27;t work well!  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that the product is free and clear of irritants.  </li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re looking for shampoo, I wouldn&#x27;t use the one made by Free and Clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, by my experience: DHS Shampoo, Free and Clear conditioner is the power duo for fragrance-free shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for Free &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li>I use Free &amp; Clear shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>So, Free and Clear, please reformulate this product with more of whatever &amp;#34;slippery stuff&amp;#34; you&#x27;re using in it and while you&#x27;re at it, add some sort of shine promoter to it, if possible,  like coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I began experimenting again with Free and Clear Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I bought both the free and clear shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My allergist recommended free and clear products.  </li>
            <li>The old formula is no longer available.</li>
            <li>This product made my scalp itch and flake more than it was prior to using.</li>
            <li>My husband is allergic to fragrances and everyone who stays at our house has to shampoo with Free &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li>My hair is clean, soft, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Free &amp; Clear conditioner and shampoo work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair nice and silky during rinse and soft when dry.  </li>
            <li>It does have a slight scent that I don&#x27;t care for, but it&#x27;s a very good conditioner/rinse that I use daily, but sometimes switch off with the one that comes with the Clairol Natural Instincts hair dye I use.</li>
            <li>Use it out of necessity due to allergies; however, it works fine and seems to be mild on my hair.</li>
            <li>Searching around for a good product for her to use was frustrating until I found Free &amp; Clear!  </li>
            <li>[AS IN:B0006FMK98 Free &amp; Clear Shampoo for Sensitive Skin 12 fl oz (355 ml)]]B0006FMK98 Free &amp; Clear Shampoo for Sensitive Skin 12 fl oz (355 ml)]]</li>
            <li>I was given samples of this brand from an allergy specialist and it is really the only option I found for truly unscented, paraben free, hypoallergenic hygiene products.</li>
            <li>It was much easier to order the product online.</li>
            <li>The DHS shampoo lathers really well and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really condition the hair unless you put a lot in</li>
            <li>But oh how I miss fragrance and the feel of \\&quot;real shampoo\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>YOu absolutely need the cream rinse if you purchase the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, is the flaking is much &#x27;lighter&#x27; and reducing over time as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and you really have to rinse your hair</li>
            <li>I went to Whole Foods instead and bought a bottle of Earth Science for a couple of bucks cheaper.</li>
            <li>Much happier.</li>
            <li>Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so I get even deeper conditioning for my very thirsty locks.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Free &amp; Clear makes my hair soft without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some scalp issues and got this to make sure I wasn&#x27;t irritating things more.</li>
            <li>Still not quite right as a conditioner for those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product without alcohol to dry out your hair!!!</li>
            <li>Free and Clear is useful for psoriasis if you want to remove scale but not leave scalp too dry.</li>
            <li>It is all I use, great value and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using Free and Clear for the lack of irritating chemicals and it leaves my hair nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just different.</li>
            <li>Once I learned that continued use of appliances like flat irons, blow dryers, hot curlers all did damage-and even though products advertised to protect your hair from heat really didn&#x27;t in the long run I gave up on any heat products on my hair and went for old fashioned plastic rollers when I needed more curl and gave up on pin straight hair</li>
            <li>Also, this vendor ships quickly, delivers what was promised, and is relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that my daughter doesn&#x27;t like the smell, but I don&#x27;t really notice a distinct smell.</li>
            <li>An itchy scalp had me trying all types of different hair care products from many different brands.</li>
            <li>I have long, very fine hair, so find I must use just a tiny amount,</li>
            <li>This conditioner feels just like the conditioner I was using before I discovered that fragrances in normal conditioner wreak havoc on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Free &amp; Clear Hair Conditioner for Sensitive Skin, and its companion shampoo, are the only shampoo and conditioner I can use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light conditioner, but it&#x27;s enough that I can comb my hair wet after using it.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely thirsty though - more so than most people&#x27;s hair - so a few times a week I prewash with a few drops of coconut oil, shampoo, then use Free and Clear conditioner</li>
            <li>It is important to avoid all the other soaps, shampoos, conditioners, and lotions on the market.</li>
            <li>The new formula caused itching/rash and makes hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only truly scent free conditioner I&#x27;ve found, and that is critical for me.</li>
            <li>It works well at detangling it and decently well at keeping it soft.</li>
            <li>Conditions, detangles, leaves hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both had itching caused by all the other shampoos/conditioners we tried before we switched to Free &amp; Clear.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair soft and silky and also doesnt leave me  itching and scratching!</li>
            <li>I recently ran out of the Free &amp; Clear and had to use a regular conditioner on her, and she broke out immediately.</li>
            <li>for my daughter who was breaking out with every other shampoo and conditioner, including special salon products.  </li>
            <li>I like the gel too, but go easy on it as it is stiff stuff.</li>
            <li>The Free &amp; Clear left my hair dry.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and hadn&#x27;t been able to use a conditioner for more than a year since realizing how badly it affected my skin.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s body is different, so I certainly cannot speak to how this may work for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little watery, and I&#x27;ve used conditioners that keep my hair softer, but none that are scent free.</li>
            <li>I like the PC better because it&#x27;s thicker and this left my hair a little frizzy on humid days.</li>
            <li>My number one pet peeve with this product is that after I style my hair, I still have to be extremely careful when I run a comb through it because it doesn&#x27;t create that smooth silkiness you get with regular products...</li>
            <li>so far - no itch.  </li>
            <li>This has reduced the itching that fragrance products cause to sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>after a year of suffering from sensitive skin, I found a product that works for me.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my daughter who has extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to work for me as far as controlling itch and reactions.</li>
            <li>Nor does it seem to get better with the common ointments/topicals that one would use..</li>
            <li>far I have used it 4-5 times on my hair.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I don&#x27;t know what to use.</li>
            <li>However the manufacturer recently completely changed the formula.</li>
            <li>I break out in hives if I use anything with fragrance (plus a few fragrance free products) and I had no skin reaction to this one.</li>
            <li>but I ran out and didn&#x27;t want to extra for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this product was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>This has no smell at all for those sensitive noses,  And it works so well on the hair.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by my child&#x27;s dermatologist to treat her sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, my hair is heavier, I use the right amount, it is almost right, better than any other product I have used, but not perfect.  </li>
            <li>A week and a half ago my hair was really dry, and my curls mostly frizz.</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount to tame the fly aways in the winter.</li>
            <li>All of a sudden, in my 50&#x27;s, I developed very sensitive skin and could not use salon products.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other product that is less irritating to me - so this method works great for me.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly massage it into my scalp and it helps to calm my previously itchy-scaly skin.  </li>
            <li>It does, however, seem to dry my hair out too much</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, but not flat.</li>
            <li>I am apparently allergic to all products except this brand.  </li>
            <li>and I pull out hairs if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t making my hair soft enough.  </li>
            <li>It was okay.. not great.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be too gentle and not condition well enough, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li>Thick enough to stay wherever you massage it in, but quick to rinse out!  </li>
            <li>Other than Burts Bees which still has a fragrance there is not much out there for pregnant women to use that does not harm the fetus.</li>
            <li>I initially started using both after I developed skin allergies to undetermined ingredients in traditional and organic hair care products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be prepared that the consistency and texture of this conditioner is far different from what you get with traditional store-bought or salon conditioners.</li>
            <li>very moisturizing without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I find that if I use the Free &amp; Clear Shampoo with a small amount of unscented argan oil, that my hair is pretty manageable without being weighted with irritating products.</li>
            <li>I have really dry hair and sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>After trying multiple brands of dandruff shampoos, conditioners,  and other products for dry scalp this is the first one that I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin or skin conditions are so limited as it is</li>
            <li>I thought it was cheaper, but with an online coupon and free shipping it was only a few cents less.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out in little itchy bumps on my scalp as of yet.  </li>

            <li> Great shampoo and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> this works for cleaning hair,  great for all of us allergy sufferers.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great</li>

            <li> and I was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Free&amp;Clear and Vanicream products are perfect for me because I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances.</li>
            <li> but it is good at getting the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> Read the ingredients before purchasing to see that this product is good for you.  </li>
            <li> no itching or redness as result of good scalp rub... tried it out on my daughter Earline</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always good when that doesn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner does an alright job for me, not as good as others that I used before I had sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I would find a conditioner that worked great for my hair but the overwhelming perfume would have my scalp burning.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I began over a period of time to have much better hair days!  </li>
            <li> The Free &amp; Clear line is the best, and their conditioner is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got a sample at my dermatologists office and liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner containing no gluten, which is reason purchased.</li>
            <li> Looks nice.</li>
            <li> The texture is nice and it spreads well through my hair.</li>
            <li> Conditions my hair very well but the best part is that it&#x27;s fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> this conditioner is spectacular.</li>
            <li> It is really nice.  </li>
            <li> I have heard no complaints about it, and expect it is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am glad he doesn&#x27;t need prescription stuff as often, since this has worked so nicely.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent conditioner for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have thrown it away and started looking for a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> It used to be excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this conditioner works well for me</li>
            <li> These products work great for my scalp, I had tried so many products to no avail and I am so happy to find one that actually works!</li>
            <li> Very light.  </li>
            <li> Great price for this large bottle.</li>
            <li> This entire line of products is wonderful and has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> because their products don&#x27;t use masking scents (many &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; hair products still use masking scent).</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s three, just to make sure no problems, then on myself...</li>
            <li> product is my favorite hair conditioner and the safest to use, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This did more conditioning.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with itchy scalp (and hair loss) from commercial conditioners, but this brand has been great!</li>
            <li> My wife has become allergic to ingredients used in most shampoos and conditioners as a preservative.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Why do so many soaps and shampoos have to have fragrances added.</li>
            <li> I make sure the Allafia doesn&#x27;t touch my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I still have my stubborn allergy problem but the conditioner has alleviated some of the scalp dryness.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner for many years.</li>
            <li> My curls and waves are much more defined.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves a bit of a film on my hair, but we buy it because it does NOT give my daughter hives or otherwise disturb her many allergies.</li>
            <li> All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.</li>
            <li> I use more conditioner</li>
            <li> Try it out and review it if you are more picky than I am.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has worked well to keep her skin healthy and her hair healthy.  </li>
            <li> This formula is lovely.</li>
            <li> - okay but would prefer not to use it often.</li>
            <li> still like it better than DE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very clean.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good priced.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely better than any other conditioner I have ever tried at a drug store, probably the best conditioner I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Great for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There are better fragrance free products out there.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is excellent for people who are sensitive to certain fragrances and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have a very full head of fine, wavy, porous hair.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear has been great</li>
            <li> Very mild and</li>
            <li> Gentle and sensitive ... perfect for people like me who can not use products with lots of chemicals and perfumes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance and have a lot of fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> PLEASE keep stocking it as I have found no other shampoo and conditioner free of these preservatives!!!  </li>
            <li> Works fine for me.</li>
            <li> This really works wonders for him and We have tried so many products!</li>
            <li> Very surprised at how nice this is for a conditioner without many of the additives.  </li>
            <li> and I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting as good of a clean as with normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> Creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any benefit from the sulfate free formula.</li>
            <li> It is wonderfully gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Fragrance and dye free.</li>
            <li> However this is the best free and clear conditioner I have found so far.</li>
            <li> No scent at all and free of salicylates.</li>
            <li> This line of products are great for those of us with sensitivities to chemicals and especially perfumes.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner does a find job of making her hair smooth and taking out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> I am liberal with the amount of conditioner (and also massage it in for a while before rinsing out lightly.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s not as good as far as moisturizing and conditioning the hair, but it seems to do the trick for now.  </li>
            <li> That one is very powerful &amp; needed once/week.</li>
            <li> My oldest child has skin allergies, and this is the only hair product we can successfully use on her.</li>
            <li> have noted the itching to have been reduced significantly, swelling in the area to be reduced</li>
            <li> I am excited that I found a backup that I&#x27;m not allergic to - in case PC ever changes their formula</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the additional money to have such a great change for her.</li>
            <li> I have tried several fragrance-free conditioners and this one is by and far the best</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use anything that contains fragrances, this doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance so that is nice.</li>
            <li> The Free &amp; Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner have been wonderful, providing almost immediate relief from the scalp irritation that they had been dealing with for a long time.  </li>
            <li> In short, however, this is great stuff, the price is right, you won&#x27;t feel greasy in 24 hours, and your hair isn&#x27;t falling out.  </li>
            <li> My hair will still hold a curl, but my ponytail loses its volume, but the shine is impressive.</li>
            <li> This is good for daily use.</li>
            <li> (so far) hasn&#x27;t caused any kind of allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> It was ok, but it didn&#x27;t lather very well</li>
            <li> and I am going to keep using this to see if I can really get much better relief over time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and my mother suffer from eczema and we had been looking for shampoo products that would be more gentle on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li> luckily I have discovered that i am not allergic to the leave in conditioner that I have always used</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, I try one of my old conditioners, but if I use them more than one washing in a row, I end up with itchy scalp--but not with Free &amp; Clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her skin is much better since we started using the Free and Clear Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Used with Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and was pleasantly surprised my hair smelled good, did not flatten and no itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> It also weighs down my hair without doing a great job moisturizing it.</li>
            <li> The first fragrance free shampoo and conditioner nice enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> She did like the free and clear shampoo, gel and hairspray and said they were all fine to use, without sodium laurel sufate and would not strip the hair or anything.</li>
            <li> We love all the Vanicream products we have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Many with dandruff just have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will often use a lightly scented shampoo, but then follow up with the Free and Clear Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m back for more Free &amp; Clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was soft amd more managable.(frizzy,very curly hair).</li>
            <li> For me, the need for scent-free conditioner is more important than the need for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear Hair Conditioner is a light conditioner for those that have allergies to over the counter shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I also plan on breast feeding and will have to continue this regimen of free and clear products (also use Vanicream for lotion) until I stop as its important not to contaminate your breast milk.</li>
            <li> After using it just two times, my hair is better than its been in years- really really soft, and frizz is almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li> I will continue buying Free &amp; Clear Conditioner and Shampoo forever, so please keep it available and tell the manufacturer not to change or discontinue it.  </li>
            <li> I noticed  significant decrease in my allergy symptoms when I started using it, and the free and clear shampoo.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair feeling nice and smooth but it seems to wear off during the day faster than other stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> right for me.  </li>
            <li> I completely switched my hair products to Free &amp;amp; Clear and love them.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful in that it doesn&#x27;t give me a facial rash as so many other scented regular hair products do.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair nice and silky and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A wonderful conditioner for my thick dry hair and halleluyah fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I love shampoo and the gel, too - finally a gel that doesn&#x27;t cause me any problems and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this item from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I will order the Free &amp; Clear shampoo again, but I will skip this.</li>
            <li> I have been using Free &amp; Clear conditioner and shampoo for almost two years now.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get used to the different feel, but my hair is as healthy as it was using salon organic brands</li>
            <li> As for me, I will continue to use Free &amp; Clear conditioner unless I develop and allergy to one of its ingredients.</li>
            <li> so I was really hoping this one would be the one!</li>
            <li> But my issue with the conditioner is really that it doesn&#x27;t work well!  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that the product is free and clear of irritants.  </li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re looking for shampoo, I wouldn&#x27;t use the one made by Free and Clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, by my experience: DHS Shampoo, Free and Clear conditioner is the power duo for fragrance-free shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Free &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li> I use Free &amp; Clear shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> So, Free and Clear, please reformulate this product with more of whatever &amp;#34;slippery stuff&amp;#34; you&#x27;re using in it and while you&#x27;re at it, add some sort of shine promoter to it, if possible,  like coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I began experimenting again with Free and Clear Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I bought both the free and clear shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My allergist recommended free and clear products.  </li>
            <li> The old formula is no longer available.</li>
            <li> This product made my scalp itch and flake more than it was prior to using.</li>
            <li> My husband is allergic to fragrances and everyone who stays at our house has to shampoo with Free &amp; Clear.</li>
            <li> My hair is clean, soft, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Free &amp; Clear conditioner and shampoo work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Keeps hair nice and silky during rinse and soft when dry.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight scent that I don&#x27;t care for, but it&#x27;s a very good conditioner/rinse that I use daily, but sometimes switch off with the one that comes with the Clairol Natural Instincts hair dye I use.</li>
            <li> Use it out of necessity due to allergies; however, it works fine and seems to be mild on my hair.</li>
            <li> Searching around for a good product for her to use was frustrating until I found Free &amp; Clear!  </li>
            <li> [AS IN:B0006FMK98 Free &amp; Clear Shampoo for Sensitive Skin 12 fl oz (355 ml)]]B0006FMK98 Free &amp; Clear Shampoo for Sensitive Skin 12 fl oz (355 ml)]]</li>
            <li> I was given samples of this brand from an allergy specialist and it is really the only option I found for truly unscented, paraben free, hypoallergenic hygiene products.</li>
            <li> It was much easier to order the product online.</li>
            <li> The DHS shampoo lathers really well and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really condition the hair unless you put a lot in</li>
            <li> But oh how I miss fragrance and the feel of \\&quot;real shampoo\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> YOu absolutely need the cream rinse if you purchase the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , is the flaking is much &#x27;lighter&#x27; and reducing over time as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and you really have to rinse your hair</li>
            <li> I went to Whole Foods instead and bought a bottle of Earth Science for a couple of bucks cheaper.</li>
            <li> Much happier.</li>
            <li> Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> so I get even deeper conditioning for my very thirsty locks.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Free &amp; Clear makes my hair soft without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some scalp issues and got this to make sure I wasn&#x27;t irritating things more.</li>
            <li> Still not quite right as a conditioner for those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product without alcohol to dry out your hair!!!</li>
            <li> Free and Clear is useful for psoriasis if you want to remove scale but not leave scalp too dry.</li>
            <li> It is all I use, great value and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using Free and Clear for the lack of irritating chemicals and it leaves my hair nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just different.</li>
            <li> Once I learned that continued use of appliances like flat irons, blow dryers, hot curlers all did damage-and even though products advertised to protect your hair from heat really didn&#x27;t in the long run I gave up on any heat products on my hair and went for old fashioned plastic rollers when I needed more curl and gave up on pin straight hair</li>
            <li> Also, this vendor ships quickly, delivers what was promised, and is relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that my daughter doesn&#x27;t like the smell, but I don&#x27;t really notice a distinct smell.</li>
            <li> An itchy scalp had me trying all types of different hair care products from many different brands.</li>
            <li> I have long, very fine hair, so find I must use just a tiny amount,</li>
            <li> This conditioner feels just like the conditioner I was using before I discovered that fragrances in normal conditioner wreak havoc on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Free &amp; Clear Hair Conditioner for Sensitive Skin, and its companion shampoo, are the only shampoo and conditioner I can use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light conditioner, but it&#x27;s enough that I can comb my hair wet after using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thirsty though - more so than most people&#x27;s hair - so a few times a week I prewash with a few drops of coconut oil, shampoo, then use Free and Clear conditioner</li>
            <li> It is important to avoid all the other soaps, shampoos, conditioners, and lotions on the market.</li>
            <li> The new formula caused itching/rash and makes hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only truly scent free conditioner I&#x27;ve found, and that is critical for me.</li>
            <li> It works well at detangling it and decently well at keeping it soft.</li>
            <li> Conditions, detangles, leaves hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both had itching caused by all the other shampoos/conditioners we tried before we switched to Free &amp; Clear.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my hair soft and silky and also doesnt leave me  itching and scratching!</li>
            <li> I recently ran out of the Free &amp; Clear and had to use a regular conditioner on her, and she broke out immediately.</li>
            <li> for my daughter who was breaking out with every other shampoo and conditioner, including special salon products.  </li>
            <li> I like the gel too, but go easy on it as it is stiff stuff.</li>
            <li> The Free &amp; Clear left my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and hadn&#x27;t been able to use a conditioner for more than a year since realizing how badly it affected my skin.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s body is different, so I certainly cannot speak to how this may work for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little watery, and I&#x27;ve used conditioners that keep my hair softer, but none that are scent free.</li>
            <li> I like the PC better because it&#x27;s thicker and this left my hair a little frizzy on humid days.</li>
            <li> My number one pet peeve with this product is that after I style my hair, I still have to be extremely careful when I run a comb through it because it doesn&#x27;t create that smooth silkiness you get with regular products...</li>
            <li> so far - no itch.  </li>
            <li> This has reduced the itching that fragrance products cause to sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> after a year of suffering from sensitive skin, I found a product that works for me.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my daughter who has extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to work for me as far as controlling itch and reactions.</li>
            <li> Nor does it seem to get better with the common ointments/topicals that one would use..</li>
            <li> far I have used it 4-5 times on my hair.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I don&#x27;t know what to use.</li>
            <li> However the manufacturer recently completely changed the formula.</li>
            <li> I break out in hives if I use anything with fragrance (plus a few fragrance free products) and I had no skin reaction to this one.</li>
            <li> but I ran out and didn&#x27;t want to extra for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this product was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> This has no smell at all for those sensitive noses,  And it works so well on the hair.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my child&#x27;s dermatologist to treat her sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> , my hair is heavier, I use the right amount, it is almost right, better than any other product I have used, but not perfect.  </li>
            <li> A week and a half ago my hair was really dry, and my curls mostly frizz.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount to tame the fly aways in the winter.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden, in my 50&#x27;s, I developed very sensitive skin and could not use salon products.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other product that is less irritating to me - so this method works great for me.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly massage it into my scalp and it helps to calm my previously itchy-scaly skin.  </li>
            <li> It does, however, seem to dry my hair out too much</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, but not flat.</li>
            <li> I am apparently allergic to all products except this brand.  </li>
            <li> and I pull out hairs if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t making my hair soft enough.  </li>
            <li> It was okay.. not great.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be too gentle and not condition well enough, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Thick enough to stay wherever you massage it in, but quick to rinse out!  </li>
            <li> Other than Burts Bees which still has a fragrance there is not much out there for pregnant women to use that does not harm the fetus.</li>
            <li> I initially started using both after I developed skin allergies to undetermined ingredients in traditional and organic hair care products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be prepared that the consistency and texture of this conditioner is far different from what you get with traditional store-bought or salon conditioners.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I find that if I use the Free &amp; Clear Shampoo with a small amount of unscented argan oil, that my hair is pretty manageable without being weighted with irritating products.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair and sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> After trying multiple brands of dandruff shampoos, conditioners,  and other products for dry scalp this is the first one that I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
            <li> People with sensitive skin or skin conditions are so limited as it is</li>
            <li> I thought it was cheaper, but with an online coupon and free shipping it was only a few cents less.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out in little itchy bumps on my scalp as of yet.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not heavy like lots of other conditioners.</li>
            <li> If what you need is unscented, hypoallergenic soap/shampoo/conditioner due to sensitive skin or an allergy, this is it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super sensitive about these things, but after starting to use this I noticed my hair getting drier and drier.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is a little more irritating that I wish it were.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I feel that in the winter, my hair is a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops of essential oils to which I am not allergic when I first get the bottle (I use lavender with the conditioner) to add a little fragrance</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s only 12, and has thick tangley hair, but she doesn&#x27;t use hair dryer to damage/dry out her hair, so I think it will continue to work until she gets older.</li>
            <li> All the high end products at Sephora and Saks are not safe either.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is water so that is not a good sign.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this product for a long time...</li>
            <li> Even with the conditioner, I couldn&#x27;t comb my long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t suds as well as other shampoos, but that seems to be evidence that they didn&#x27;t add extra chemicals to it.</li>
            <li> and I am not constantly wanting to rip my hair out due to the itchiness that I used to have.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dry, itchy, flaky scalp for years.  </li>
            <li> I then just air dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I find the Free and Clear Shampoo a little weak, but the conditioner is plenty thick.  </li>
            <li> Before Using this product, I was always breaking out, itching my dry scalp!</li>
            <li> Of course, would like to have paid less or have a coupon which I hadn&#x27;t looked for but will for next time.</li>
            <li> I used it for one week and my hair became very dry and lost all</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my hair feeling maybe slightly slightly less dry than before I use it, but overall feels not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am careful not to get it in his eyes.</li>
            <li> Although this product does not cause any allergy symptoms, it is not very conditioning.  </li>
            <li> They have minimal ingredients, so fewer things to be allergic to.</li>
            <li> There really is no smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She has short, thick hair, and we find this conditions well enough.</li>
            <li> I cannot and will not use any other shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have not believed it itches totally from the fact it could be psoriasis because it has not responded to the usual meds that would affect it, ie prednisone and methotrexate.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist has sample tubes of the conditioner in his office, for patients to try if they are having problems with other products.  </li>
            <li> Using this with the shampoo instantly gave me tingling all over my body which caused trouble breathing and a severely tight chest.</li>
            <li> After conditioning I used a little bit of Alaffia Everyday Coconut hydrating Conditioner just on the ends and left it in as a leave in.  </li>
            <li> But even with huge amounts of the conditioner, it would be almost impossible to get a comb through my hair, after using.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other conditioners can.  </li>
            <li> She has previously been breaking out due to the body wash and hair product we had been using with fragrance and dyes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I really like this conditioner</li>
            <li> Product made my sensitive scalp worse after using for two weeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> anyway - weighed my hair down</li>
            <li> My hair is healhier, my scalp is less irritated, and my hair stylists compliments my hair every time I get a cut</li>
            <li> The itching on my scalp is a lot less.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get through half a bottle.</li>
            <li> I was using the GBP (?) conditioner, which smells awful, but you can really feel the difference in your hair right away.  </li>
            <li> So, my journey has been an expensive one keeping all the companies rich and myself cash poor trying to find the miracle cure.  </li>
            <li> I have tight curly hair that requires me to use products that irritate my scalp and skin but every once in a while, I give myself a break by using this.</li>
            <li> I had used this in the past and I ended up trying a multitude of other conditioners to try and find one that would perform miracles-there is no conditioner that can do that you are born with what you have and</li>
            <li> after I towel dried my hair as a leave in..</li>
            <li> My hair was actually dried out using the companion shampoo with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy in the hair.</li>
            <li> dried my hair out.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist because I have an itchy reaction to all the usual hair and skin products for sale in drugstores.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice now and it works just as well, if not better than, all the salon brand products I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> My daughter was breaking out on her shoulders/back and around her hairline on her face/neck, with a couple of different expensive conditioners.  </li>
            <li> No more itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> in comparison, using a small dab of the conditioner in the palm of your hand is like using a pound of axle grease.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Paula&#x27;s Choice conditioner</li>
            <li> It takes quite bit on my long hair and does a mediocre job.</li>
            <li> I have hard water</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to come by</li>
            <li> , it looked icky with build up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to make this product work-  cutting back on the heat I use on my hair, etc.  </li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t moisturize thick curly hair the way I wish it would.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My toddler son suffers with dry scalp/ eczema.</li>
            <li> I have an angry patch of psoriasis on my head that had been getting worse over the years.</li>
            <li> Then my scalp became horrible itchy the second day too.  </li>
            <li> I broke out terribly all over my stomach, chest and back.</li>
            <li> Remember to avoid getting your hair dyed and nails done too as acetone (nail polish remover and rubbing alcohol is dangerous to a growing fetus).</li>
            <li> Since I was previously desperate, this was a life savor to me.  </li>
            <li> Now I know why fragrance is added to shampoo and conditioner because the smell is bad.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a really nice conditioner. I got a sample at my dermatologists office and liked it. I have long, very fine hair, so find I must use just a tiny amount, reduced a bit with water.  My hair will still hold a curl, but my ponytail loses its volume, but the shine is impressive. I do alternate with a lighter conditioner on damp days, but then lose the shine.</li>
            <li> My toddler son suffers with dry scalp/ eczema. This really works wonders for him and We have tried so many products! I am careful not to get it in his eyes. I am glad he doesn&#x27;t need prescription stuff as often, since this has worked so nicely. Great stuff! We love all the Vanicream products we have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Although this product does not cause any allergy symptoms, it is not very conditioning.  The first ingredient is water so that is not a good sign.  I used it for one week and my hair became very dry and lost all it&#x27;s shine and luster despite the fact that I get a glaze and deep conditioner every two weeks! I even put some in after I towel dried my hair as a leave in.. no luck. I have resorted to using this to shave with, conditioner makes a great shaving lotion.  luckily I have discovered that i am not allergic to the leave in conditioner that I have always used so I am using that in the shower and as a leave in. My hair dresser read the ingredients and told me that there is no way this product could keep my hair conditioned.  She did like the free and clear shampoo, gel and hairspray and said they were all fine to use, without sodium laurel sufate and would not strip the hair or anything. So I still made out with three of this companies products and I have no reaction to any of them.</li>
            <li> This entire line of products is wonderful and has been a lifesaver. It was recommended by my dermatologist because I have an itchy reaction to all the usual hair and skin products for sale in drugstores. I will use it forever!</li>
            <li> I have problems with every product on the regular store shelves - they make my head itch and burn and sometimes I get rashes.  Free and Clear has been great so far - no itch.  I love shampoo and the gel, too - finally a gel that doesn&#x27;t cause me any problems and leaves my hair shiny. I&#x27;ll be buying this product for a long time...</li>
            <li> Thick enough to stay wherever you massage it in, but quick to rinse out!  I thoroughly massage it into my scalp and it helps to calm my previously itchy-scaly skin.  Recommended by my dermatologist, this conditioner is a life saver, along with the shampoo and styling gel.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dry, itchy, flaky scalp for years.  I recently went to an allergist who recommended this product.  It is pricey, but I don&#x27;t spend all day scratching my head now!  After trying multiple brands of dandruff shampoos, conditioners,  and other products for dry scalp this is the first one that I&#x27;ve found that works.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product without alcohol to dry out your hair!!! I definitely would recommend this to anyone with sensitivities to standard products.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works!  Creamy and smooth.  No scent and no tangles.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am apparently allergic to all products except this brand.  Great shampoo and conditioners.  Recommended to me from my allergist. Great product!</li>
            <li> this works for cleaning hair,  great for all of us allergy sufferers. isn&#x27;t moisturizing or any of that, but jojoba oil helps.</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely. Used with Free &amp; Clear Shampoo and was pleasantly surprised my hair smelled good, did not flatten and no itchy scalp.  Of course, would like to have paid less or have a coupon which I hadn&#x27;t looked for but will for next time.</li>
            <li> The Free &amp; Clear left my hair dry.  I didn&#x27;t see any benefit from the sulfate free formula. Even with the conditioner, I couldn&#x27;t comb my long hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner [[AS IN:B0006FMK98 Free &amp; Clear Shampoo for Sensitive Skin 12 fl oz (355 ml)]]B0006FMK98 Free &amp; Clear Shampoo for Sensitive Skin 12 fl oz (355 ml)]] for my daughter who was breaking out with every other shampoo and conditioner, including special salon products.  This is the only product that keeps her from breaking out.  She ran out and then she started breaking out again.  I think it is worth the additional money to have such a great change for her.</li>
            <li> This has reduced the itching that fragrance products cause to sensitive scalp.  Many with dandruff just have sensitive skin. This product will reduce that while conditioning your hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is excellent for people who are sensitive to certain fragrances and ingredients.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other conditioners can.  Great price for this large bottle.</li>
            <li> These products work great for my scalp, I had tried so many products to no avail and I am so happy to find one that actually works!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this item from a dermatologist. It was much easier to order the product online. It is an excellent conditioner for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because I have problems with scalp acne.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  My hair was actually dried out using the companion shampoo with this conditioner.  I had to apply a spray in conditioner just to comb through my hair.  Now I know why fragrance is added to shampoo and conditioner because the smell is bad.  Yuck!  There was no improvement and actually did some damage to my hair by drying it out.  Save you money and hair and find something else.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Detangled well too!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a little more irritating that I wish it were. It also weighs down my hair without doing a great job moisturizing it. I will order the Free &amp; Clear shampoo again, but I will skip this. I find that if I use the Free &amp; Clear Shampoo with a small amount of unscented argan oil, that my hair is pretty manageable without being weighted with irritating products.</li>
            <li> after a year of suffering from sensitive skin, I found a product that works for me.  I cannot and will not use any other shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using Free &amp; Clear conditioner and shampoo for almost two years now. I initially started using both after I developed skin allergies to undetermined ingredients in traditional and organic hair care products. The smell isn&#x27;t great but that&#x27;s because their products don&#x27;t use masking scents (many &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; hair products still use masking scent). I add a few drops of essential oils to which I am not allergic when I first get the bottle (I use lavender with the conditioner) to add a little fragrance and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared that the consistency and texture of this conditioner is far different from what you get with traditional store-bought or salon conditioners. It&#x27;s not bad, just different. It took me a while to get used to the different feel, but my hair is as healthy as it was using salon organic brands so I can only imagine that it works just as well. I have a very full head of fine, wavy, porous hair. Everyone&#x27;s body is different, so I certainly cannot speak to how this may work for you. As for me, I will continue to use Free &amp; Clear conditioner unless I develop and allergy to one of its ingredients.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner containing no gluten, which is reason purchased. It does have a slight scent that I don&#x27;t care for, but it&#x27;s a very good conditioner/rinse that I use daily, but sometimes switch off with the one that comes with the Clairol Natural Instincts hair dye I use. That one is very powerful &amp; needed once/week. This is good for daily use. Doesn&#x27;t flatten hair at all. Looks nice.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to the smell of perfume scent.  I am very satisfied with this conditioner.  I find the Free and Clear Shampoo a little weak, but the conditioner is plenty thick.  I will often use a lightly scented shampoo, but then follow up with the Free and Clear Conditioner.  The conditioner takes out the shampoo&#x27;s scent.    Also, this vendor ships quickly, delivers what was promised, and is relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Before Using this product, I was always breaking out, itching my dry scalp! This leaves my hair soft and silky and also doesnt leave me  itching and scratching! I love it!</li>
            <li> Just a basic conditioner. it does not provide for a truly deep conditioning but it is good at getting the tangles out.  I use it for my daughter who has extremely sensitive skin.  ONly product I have found that works without breaking her out.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.  Very mild and (so far) hasn&#x27;t caused any kind of allergic reaction.  I was so happy to find a shampoo and conditioner that did not have fragrance and was hypoallergenic.  I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I just grew my hair out and needed something without toxic chemicals.  Read the ingredients before purchasing to see that this product is good for you.  It&#x27;s great for me.  The cream rinse has an odor you would expect for something without a masking fragrance.  I was concerned it would leave my hair feeling greasy or wouldn&#x27;t work.  Free &amp; Clear makes my hair soft without a greasy feel.  In fact, my hair gets that &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; feeling after rinsing, yet controls the tangles.</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo... no itching or redness as result of good scalp rub... tried it out on my daughter Earline, she&#x27;s three, just to make sure no problems, then on myself... we both loved it!!</li>
            <li> My oldest child has skin allergies, and this is the only hair product we can successfully use on her. I recently ran out of the Free &amp; Clear and had to use a regular conditioner on her, and she broke out immediately. So I&#x27;m back for more Free &amp; Clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has short, thick hair, and we find this conditions well enough.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice now and it works just as well, if not better than, all the salon brand products I have used over the years. My hair is healhier, my scalp is less irritated, and my hair stylists compliments my hair every time I get a cut done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is my favorite hair conditioner and the safest to use, in my opinion. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This did more conditioning. It&#x27;s not a bad product it just doesn&#x27;t moisturize thick curly hair the way I wish it would. People with sensitive skin or skin conditions are so limited as it is so I was really hoping this one would be the one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and absolutely love it.  I noticed  significant decrease in my allergy symptoms when I started using it, and the free and clear shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with itchy scalp (and hair loss) from commercial conditioners, but this brand has been great! I can use it every day without any problems. Every once in a while, I try one of my old conditioners, but if I use them more than one washing in a row, I end up with itchy scalp--but not with Free &amp; Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend trying this product if you cannot find anything else to use! In fact, I would use it even if I could!</li>
            <li> In the last year I&#x27;ve discovered a fragrance sensitivity. I completely switched my hair products to Free &amp;amp; Clear and love them. I think if my fragrance sensitivity went away I wouldn&#x27;t switch back! Keeps hair hydrated!</li>
            <li> My wife has become allergic to ingredients used in most shampoos and conditioners as a preservative. Searching around for a good product for her to use was frustrating until I found Free &amp; Clear!  She now uses their products religiously. It has helped her to bring her rashes under control so well that she has shared the product info with her dermatologist so others could benefit from its use.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter at the recommendation of a hair specialist.  It has worked great for her.  Very light.  Very clean.</li>
            <li> I only started using this product after a dermatologist required it, as part of a product elimination process, for a face rash.  (which the product didn&#x27;t help at all for.)  But my issue with the conditioner is really that it doesn&#x27;t work well!  I have fairly thick hair.  But even with huge amounts of the conditioner, it would be almost impossible to get a comb through my hair, after using.  My hair felt sticky, and tacky, after- and the comb would just stick in it.  I appreciate that the product is free and clear of irritants.  But it needs to have something in there that actually conditions!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for people who are allergic to perfumes because it is just what the name says---free of perfume.</li>
            <li> Very good for allergic people.</li>
            <li> I was told to use this in an effort to figure out what I&#x27;m allergic to. It takes quite bit on my long hair and does a mediocre job. My hair is so tangled when I get out of the shower! It takes forever to comb out at that point.</li>
            <li> This product is the best that Ihave tried.  The itching on my scalp is a lot less.  I have not broken out in little itchy bumps on my scalp as of yet.  My hair was soft amd more managable.(frizzy,very curly hair). I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is very good hair conditioner if you have a problem with skin problems. It conditions as well as what I used to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some scalp issues and got this to make sure I wasn&#x27;t irritating things more. With a medicated shampoo my scalp has cleared up. I&#x27;ll keep using Free and Clear for the lack of irritating chemicals and it leaves my hair nice.</li>
            <li> These were perfect. Thank you. My roommate is allergic to perfume and these worked perfectly. She couldn&#x27;t smell a thing!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this conditioner works well for me, it&#x27;s not heavy like lots of other conditioners.</li>
            <li> My daughter was breaking out on her shoulders/back and around her hairline on her face/neck, with a couple of different expensive conditioners.  When we switched to this, her skin definitely cleared up.  I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s not as good as far as moisturizing and conditioning the hair, but it seems to do the trick for now.  She&#x27;s only 12, and has thick tangley hair, but she doesn&#x27;t use hair dryer to damage/dry out her hair, so I think it will continue to work until she gets older.</li>
            <li> Solved a sore head problem.</li>
            <li> The product is meeting my expectations.  Since it doesn&#x27;t have one of the chemicals in it that I&#x27;m allergic too, it is just what I need.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner feels just like the conditioner I was using before I discovered that fragrances in normal conditioner wreak havoc on my scalp. It leaves my hair nice and silky and goes a long way. The texture is nice and it spreads well through my hair. I have tried several fragrance-free conditioners and this one is by and far the best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re looking for shampoo, I wouldn&#x27;t use the one made by Free and Clear. It was ok, but it didn&#x27;t lather very well and I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting as good of a clean as with normal shampoo. The DHS shampoo lathers really well and doesn&#x27;t leave residue. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, by my experience: DHS Shampoo, Free and Clear conditioner is the power duo for fragrance-free shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear is useful for psoriasis if you want to remove scale but not leave scalp too dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only truly scent free conditioner I&#x27;ve found, and that is critical for me. It works well at detangling it and decently well at keeping it soft. It&#x27;s a little watery, and I&#x27;ve used conditioners that keep my hair softer, but none that are scent free. For me, the need for scent-free conditioner is more important than the need for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair and sensitive scalp. I would find a conditioner that worked great for my hair but the overwhelming perfume would have my scalp burning. Thank goodness for Free &amp; Clear. A wonderful conditioner for my thick dry hair and halleluyah fragrance free. Now I want to try the rest of the line and give my psoraisis a break and endulge my thirsty mane.</li>
            <li> Still not quite right as a conditioner for those of us with sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t really condition the hair unless you put a lot in and then it just feels slimmy. But, it&#x27;s the best can find for now.</li>
            <li> But oh how I miss fragrance and the feel of \\&quot;real shampoo\\&quot;.  It does seem to work for me as far as controlling itch and reactions.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Leaves hair soft, but not flat. Great for people with sensitive skin. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have an angry patch of psoriasis on my head that had been getting worse over the years. I have not believed it itches totally from the fact it could be psoriasis because it has not responded to the usual meds that would affect it, ie prednisone and methotrexate. Nor does it seem to get better with the common ointments/topicals that one would use..in fact, sometimes it itches worse!&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if I might have an allergy to the hairproducts I use and am giving this a very good shot.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have used it 4-5 times on my hair. YOu absolutely need the cream rinse if you purchase the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have noted the itching to have been reduced significantly, swelling in the area to be reduced and I am going to keep using this to see if I can really get much better relief over time.&lt;br /&gt;Of note, is the flaking is much &#x27;lighter&#x27; and reducing over time as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will update the longer I use this.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden, in my 50&#x27;s, I developed very sensitive skin and could not use salon products. This product is wonderful. I use Free &amp; Clear shampoo and conditioner. It is wonderfully gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful in that it doesn&#x27;t give me a facial rash as so many other scented regular hair products do. But this conditioner has one flaw, and it&#x27;s a biggie: it doesn&#x27;t condition all that well. My number one pet peeve with this product is that after I style my hair, I still have to be extremely careful when I run a comb through it because it doesn&#x27;t create that smooth silkiness you get with regular products...instead my hair sticks together and catches at the ends and I pull out hairs if I&#x27;m not careful. I thought it was just time for a haircut, but nope...after my trim the ends still stick. So, Free and Clear, please reformulate this product with more of whatever &amp;#34;slippery stuff&amp;#34; you&#x27;re using in it and while you&#x27;re at it, add some sort of shine promoter to it, if possible,  like coconut oil. Then it will be perfect!</li>
            <li> My daughter has severe skin allergy. Her skin is much better since we started using the Free and Clear Shampoo and Conditioner. The only draw back is they are so much more expensive than the regular shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Using this with the shampoo instantly gave me tingling all over my body which caused trouble breathing and a severely tight chest. Had to take benadryl and my albuterol inhaler. I have hand eczema and asthma and almost had to give myself the epi pen because of the severity of this response. My skin is sensitive and I don&#x27;t know what to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super sensitive about these things, but after starting to use this I noticed my hair getting drier and drier.  I was using the GBP (?) conditioner, which smells awful, but you can really feel the difference in your hair right away.  This stuff leaves my hair feeling maybe slightly slightly less dry than before I use it, but overall feels not worth it.</li>
            <li> Just a really good product!!</li>
            <li> Asthmatic wife loves me for using this shampoo. Works fine for me. Why do so many soaps and shampoos have to have fragrances added. This one is the only one allowed in the house and does not trigger off her asthma.</li>
            <li> I have tight curly hair that requires me to use products that irritate my scalp and skin but every once in a while, I give myself a break by using this.</li>
            <li> I had used this in the past and I ended up trying a multitude of other conditioners to try and find one that would perform miracles-there is no conditioner that can do that you are born with what you have and nothing can change that unless you get a chemical treatment or a wig.  So, my journey has been an expensive one keeping all the companies rich and myself cash poor trying to find the miracle cure.  Once I learned that continued use of appliances like flat irons, blow dryers, hot curlers all did damage-and even though products advertised to protect your hair from heat really didn&#x27;t in the long run I gave up on any heat products on my hair and went for old fashioned plastic rollers when I needed more curl and gave up on pin straight hair I began over a period of time to have much better hair days!  But I noticed my hair would get that second day hair smell, it looked icky with build up.  I have hard water and you really have to rinse your hair well which I was doing but still a build up look to my hair second day was horrid.  Then my scalp became horrible itchy the second day too.  I began experimenting again with Free and Clear Conditioner.  I too had the dryness that some reviewers spoke of but I found a remedy for that.  After conditioning I used a little bit of Alaffia Everyday Coconut hydrating Conditioner just on the ends and left it in as a leave in.  I then just air dry my hair.  Bingo!  I make sure the Allafia doesn&#x27;t touch my scalp.  No more itchy scalp.  I just conditioner wash too-I don&#x27;t use the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought both the free and clear shampoo and conditioner.  The shampoo works wonders and I&#x27;d give it 6 stars if they had 6 stars, but in comparison, using a small dab of the conditioner in the palm of your hand is like using a pound of axle grease.  I have thrown it away and started looking for a suitable replacement.</li>
            <li> Very surprised at how nice this is for a conditioner without many of the additives.  Keeps hair nice and silky during rinse and soft when dry.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> It was okay.. not great.  Didn&#x27;t notice any problem with fragrance or an allergic reaction.  It does, however, seem to dry my hair out too much so I gave it a 3.  I&#x27;m still trying to make this product work-  cutting back on the heat I use on my hair, etc.  I&#x27;ve only been using this a couple of weeks.  CB</li>
            <li> Both the conditioner and the matching shampoo are a blessing for people with allergies.</li>
            <li> The Hair Conditioner seems to be everything that was promised. I still have my stubborn allergy problem but the conditioner has alleviated some of the scalp dryness. Seller gave prompt service.</li>
            <li> Free and Clear Hair Conditioner is a light conditioner for those that have allergies to over the counter shampoos and conditioners.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. It provides a non greasy  conditioner to ensure your hair gets conditioned without the fear of breakouts and hives.  It&#x27;s always good when that doesn&#x27;t happen.  This is pretty good priced.  Great for those of us with allergies.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist and plastic surgeon friend recommended using this product during pregnancy. Other than Burts Bees which still has a fragrance there is not much out there for pregnant women to use that does not harm the fetus. It is important to avoid all the other soaps, shampoos, conditioners, and lotions on the market. All the high end products at Sephora and Saks are not safe either. I also plan on breast feeding and will have to continue this regimen of free and clear products (also use Vanicream for lotion) until I stop as its important not to contaminate your breast milk. Remember to avoid getting your hair dyed and nails done too as acetone (nail polish remover and rubbing alcohol is dangerous to a growing fetus).</li>
            <li> My allergist recommended free and clear products.  Quess what - I was allergic to the conditioner.  I did not like it anyway - weighed my hair down and I broke out.  So - it wasen&#x27;t right for me.  (I am a female)</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner for many years. It used to be excellent for sensitive skin. However the manufacturer recently completely changed the formula. The new formula caused itching/rash and makes hair feel like straw. The old formula is no longer available. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Gentle and sensitive ... perfect for people like me who can not use products with lots of chemicals and perfumes.</li>
            <li> Fragrance and dye free. Use it out of necessity due to allergies; however, it works fine and seems to be mild on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t suds as well as other shampoos, but that seems to be evidence that they didn&#x27;t add extra chemicals to it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance and have a lot of fine hair that tangles easily. This provides no body, no shine, and no detangling. You may as well not even bother with conditioner. There are better fragrance free products out there. I couldn&#x27;t even get through half a bottle. I went to Whole Foods instead and bought a bottle of Earth Science for a couple of bucks cheaper. Much happier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light conditioner, but it&#x27;s enough that I can comb my hair wet after using it. I break out in hives if I use anything with fragrance (plus a few fragrance free products) and I had no skin reaction to this one. I usually use Paula&#x27;s Choice conditioner but I ran out and didn&#x27;t want to extra for fast shipping. I like the PC better because it&#x27;s thicker and this left my hair a little frizzy on humid days. I thought it was cheaper, but with an online coupon and free shipping it was only a few cents less. I am excited that I found a backup that I&#x27;m not allergic to - in case PC ever changes their formula (like they did with their shampoo).</li>
            <li> Product made my sensitive scalp worse after using for two weeks. This product made my scalp itch and flake more than it was prior to using.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use anything that contains fragrances, this doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance so that is nice. The conditioner does an alright job for me, not as good as others that I used before I had sensitivity issues. However this is the best free and clear conditioner I have found so far. It does leave my hair feeling nice and smooth but it seems to wear off during the day faster than other stuff I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you can&#x27;t tolerate fragrance, look no further this will get the job done</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and this product was recommended by my dermatologist. It helps to reduce the sting and redness on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Conditions my hair very well but the best part is that it&#x27;s fragrance-free. I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells so this product works great for me.</li>
            <li> this conditioner is spectacular. I have very sensitive skin and hadn&#x27;t been able to use a conditioner for more than a year since realizing how badly it affected my skin. A week and a half ago my hair was really dry, and my curls mostly frizz. After using it just two times, my hair is better than its been in years- really really soft, and frizz is almost nonexistent. My curls and waves are much more defined. And my skin is happy. This is definitely better than any other conditioner I have ever tried at a drug store, probably the best conditioner I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> I was given samples of this brand from an allergy specialist and it is really the only option I found for truly unscented, paraben free, hypoallergenic hygiene products. If what you need is unscented, hypoallergenic soap/shampoo/conditioner due to sensitive skin or an allergy, this is it. It&#x27;s hard to come by and it&#x27;s nothing glamorous but it fits the bill when you&#x27;re trying to avoid potential allergens.</li>
            <li> This has no smell at all for those sensitive noses,  And it works so well on the hair. very moisturizing without weighing it down. It is all I use, great value and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves a bit of a film on my hair, but we buy it because it does NOT give my daughter hives or otherwise disturb her many allergies. So if you are allergic, this stuff may be for you! No scent at all and free of salicylates. Good product.</li>
            <li> Really Fragrance-Free and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free&amp;Clear and Vanicream products are perfect for me because I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances. They have minimal ingredients, so fewer things to be allergic to. And they work well. I use the Hair Gel, Shampoo, Conditioner, Skin Cream, Lite Lotion, Vaniply Ointment, and Liquid Cleanser. All are great products and I am really grateful for the lack of perfumes, masking fragrances, and unneeded botanical ingredients that could cause allergies.</li>
            <li> The first fragrance free shampoo and conditioner nice enough to use every day. There really is no smell. I like the gel too, but go easy on it as it is stiff stuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I really like this conditioner and I am not constantly wanting to rip my hair out due to the itchiness that I used to have. The only problem is that I feel that in the winter, my hair is a bit dry.  I use more conditioner, my hair is heavier, I use the right amount, it is almost right, better than any other product I have used, but not perfect.  That is the reason for the 4 stars.  In short, however, this is great stuff, the price is right, you won&#x27;t feel greasy in 24 hours, and your hair isn&#x27;t falling out.  Since I was previously desperate, this was a life savor to me.  Try it out and review it if you are more picky than I am.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy in the hair.</li>
            <li> This line of products are great for those of us with sensitivities to chemicals and especially perfumes.  It only takes a small amount to tame the fly aways in the winter. I also use the shampoo and hair gel.</li>
            <li> This is not what I wanted. I wanted a shampoo. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would be too gentle and not condition well enough, but boy was I wrong. It conditioned with just a quarter size amount. I have long hair so I applied it and left it  on and I was happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and my mother suffer from eczema and we had been looking for shampoo products that would be more gentle on the scalp.  The Free &amp; Clear shampoo &amp; conditioner have been wonderful, providing almost immediate relief from the scalp irritation that they had been dealing with for a long time.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my child&#x27;s dermatologist to treat her sensitive skin.  She has previously been breaking out due to the body wash and hair product we had been using with fragrance and dyes.  This conditioner has worked well to keep her skin healthy and her hair healthy.  The conditioner does a find job of making her hair smooth and taking out the tangles.  The only issue is that my daughter doesn&#x27;t like the smell, but I don&#x27;t really notice a distinct smell.</li>
            <li> An itchy scalp had me trying all types of different hair care products from many different brands. The Free &amp; Clear line is the best, and their conditioner is excellent. It even works well as a shaving gel/lotion.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve revised my review for their revised formula.) This formula is lovely. Conditions, detangles, leaves hair very soft and silky. I am liberal with the amount of conditioner (and also massage it in for a while before rinsing out lightly.) My hair is extremely thirsty though - more so than most people&#x27;s hair - so a few times a week I prewash with a few drops of coconut oil, shampoo, then use Free and Clear conditioner so I get even deeper conditioning for my very thirsty locks. There&#x27;s no other product that is less irritating to me - so this method works great for me.</li>
            <li> It amazes me that this conditioner is targeted towards \\&quot;chemically-sensitive\\&quot; people. This conditioner has propylene glycol in it which is a known irritant. I broke out terribly all over my stomach, chest and back. My skin became red and swollen. Not for me!</li>
            <li> dried my hair out.  Dr. recommended I use the shampoo &amp; conditioner for scalp - okay but would prefer not to use it often.</li>
            <li> Free &amp; Clear Hair Conditioner for Sensitive Skin, and its companion shampoo, are the only shampoo and conditioner I can use.  I am allergic to formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing agents.  These are preservatives, and are in almost everything.  Thanks to some manufacturers, there ARE a few products out there that those of us with this allergy can use.  Free &amp; Clear conditioner and shampoo work very well for me.  My hair is clean, soft, and manageable.  PLEASE keep stocking it as I have found no other shampoo and conditioner free of these preservatives!!!  My dermatologist has sample tubes of the conditioner in his office, for patients to try if they are having problems with other products.  I will continue buying Free &amp; Clear Conditioner and Shampoo forever, so please keep it available and tell the manufacturer not to change or discontinue it.  THANK YOU, Amazon, for carrying it!</li>
            <li> I was using Desert Essence (DE) conditioner but it wasn&#x27;t making my hair soft enough.  So I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It is really nice.  My hair is much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though sometimes it makes my hair, which is curly by default, a bit frizzy and uncontrollable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like it better than DE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it has no smell whatsoever!</li>
            <li> My wife and I both had itching caused by all the other shampoos/conditioners we tried before we switched to Free &amp; Clear.  It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the conditioner. My husband is allergic to fragrances and everyone who stays at our house has to shampoo with Free &amp; Clear. I have heard no complaints about it, and expect it is a nice conditioner.</li>
