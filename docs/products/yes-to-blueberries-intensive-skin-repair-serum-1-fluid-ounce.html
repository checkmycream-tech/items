            <li>I don&#x27;t agree with the &#x27;sticky&#x27; comments - i find it absorbs perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a seriously awesome product...</li>
            <li>However, let me tell you the best way to use it and see results.</li>
            <li>however, the Say Yes Grapefruit CC cream is great!</li>
            <li>and I am largely very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>purchased this, the cleanser and moisturizer and the 3 products were perfectly together.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>Great product...absorbs quickly....not greasy!  </li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>(this was surprising!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoothed out my skin wonderfully and it feels good going on and under my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent product, and fairly inexpensive considering it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I think they work great together.</li>

            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>I use it under another moisturizer and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>and it is great alone under makeup, no caking and creasing</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be on your way to amazing skin in no time!</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with this product and will keep using it for sure.  </li>
            <li>This works great and smells good too.</li>
            <li>Pleasant aroma as well.</li>
            <li>Yes to Blueberries has good coverage</li>
            <li>Blueberries are reported as being a good source of antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>I think the author must have been paid to put in a good review.  </li>
            <li>Even used it when derma rolling and didn&#x27;t do any good.  </li>
            <li>It did smell good and didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>Is good feeling</li>
            <li>It will moisturize it and smooth out your skin - it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>consistency is good; it&#x27;s what I expect from a serum.  </li>
            <li>I would consider using just it and the eye cream, if that weren&#x27;t where the good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50s with a number of wrinkles along with some acne (life just isn&#x27;t fair sometimes.)</li>
            <li>(And I don&#x27;t have that super awesome glowy type of skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is light and pleasant and the price here on Amazon is a deal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has some great benefits with dedicated use, but here&#x27;s the problem:  </li>
            <li>it sort of stood on the top of my skin and the smell isn&#x27;t that great either.</li>
            <li>and I love them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for two weeks now and my skin looks better than it has in a while!</li>
            <li>It would be even better if it smelled like blueberries!  </li>
            <li>My skin looks nice.</li>
            <li>The price was nice, took its time getting here.</li>
            <li>It smells and feels nice, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li>It looks yucky but feels nice when I put it on.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and</li>
            <li>I am loving it.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice going on and my skin needed some help.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a far from perfect, all-over sort of solution, because of the consistency.</li>
            <li>My one year old beagle thinks this stuff is the greatest.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the softness and light, airy feeling of the Blueberries LIne!!</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>But I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>**LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could better describe the change to you.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Probably would love it more</li>
            <li>Ok, I just needed an anti aging serum that didn&#x27;t have Retin-A because that is not recommended when you are trying to conceive.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer was okay</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product of all time.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems with this product and feel like my skin looks better from using it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>, I like Neutrogena &amp; RoC better....</li>
            <li>Absolutely, Love all Yes To Products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I love the combination.  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li>But it evened out my skin tone quite well for the most part.</li>
            <li>I personally love it.</li>
            <li>It is thinner and has more \\&quot;glide\\&quot; than the lotions.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love yes to, so</li>
            <li>what can I say, I love this too.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the texture of my skin - this product absorbs well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for many months now.  </li>
            <li>many products cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum</li>
            <li>I love that my skin feels nourished without feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hoping with continued use it will keep getting better.</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>I do like how this doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out like a lot of the more greasy creams</li>
            <li>I also use the Yes to Tomatoes moisturizer on top of this, and that seems to work well for me</li>
            <li>The fragrance does not bother me, although it would be nice if it were fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>After a month I asked family members and a couple friends which side of my face looked better.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light serum with pleasant scent of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Ever since i started using this, my skin is clear and feels great.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 5 stars because it is by far the best serum I&#x27;ve found, and I have purchased many products that were very costly.</li>
            <li>Product is light and refreshing to use.  </li>
            <li>While it comes in a plastic pump bottle, the pumps are well-designed and it&#x27;s easy to control the amount of product dispensed.     </li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly -</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not cause more breakouts.</li>
            <li>However, the product \\&quot;balls up\\&quot; under the moderately light pressure I apply when massaging a moisturizer into my skin.</li>
            <li>I took away a third star because I believe that this company is greatly overstating the serum&#x27;s antioxidant properties.</li>
            <li>I find it makes my skin more receptive to morning shaving and for this alone it is well worth your consideration.</li>
            <li>and if I put my make-up on immediately after it I apply it it peels and flakes preventing me from applying my make-up smoothly.</li>
            <li>My skin had been going through some mid-life changes and I received a free sample of this product.  </li>
            <li>I really hoped it would be effective.</li>
            <li>The results confirmed what I saw myself.</li>
            <li>Many gave a good review, just a personal preference.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product--the ingredient list is impressive, the price is right, and it is about as natural as you can get.</li>
            <li>Price is right for a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you pair it with the right cleansers and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This is exciting, ya&#x27;ll!  </li>
            <li>I liked this product more than the others in the line, such as the face wash and day lotion.  </li>
            <li>You want to get rid of all the deep dirt to clear the way for this awesome stuff to work.</li>
            <li>My cheeks were always bright red</li>
            <li>and even then you don&#x27;t need a full pump</li>
            <li>But I will know more after I get thru a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Overall, good, but not for day.</li>
            <li>Sweet to your skin.</li>
            <li>looking.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it to amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li>Anyone who uses the YES line, please give me some suggestions for a good alternate.</li>
            <li>I won a bag full of the Yes products and this was included.</li>
            <li>Seems like it uses natural ingredients and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>, maybe 1/2 a pump&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I love the price and the natural indgrediants list.  </li>
            <li>It feels fresh and soothing upon application, but that&#x27;s the extent of it.  </li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and has a healthy look to it</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>- why do most companies assume mature women (I&#x27;m 51) need greasy products?  </li>
            <li>I wish it worked as good for me as it did for some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I hope it works for you, but for me, I could find no benefit from the product other than feeling and smelling good when I applied it.</li>
            <li>As such, I do not find it suitable for daytime use.    </li>
            <li>Definitely a must with a organic line for a regular regimen with great results.</li>
            <li>I have chemical sensitivity and the fragrance of this mostly natural product was to strong for my face.  </li>
            <li>This serum is a very light color with no hint of purple or blue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product but it might be  for older skin.</li>
            <li>This does a great job and is safe for women in my predicament (y&#x27;know, old enough to worry about lines and young enough to have babies).</li>
            <li>That also happened to me the first time I used them together.  </li>
            <li>I am a faithful Yes to, Inc. user and love most of their products, especially since I only buy cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li>As it&#x27;s a serum, I expect to be able to layer it underneath my daily moisturizer, and the packaging states that I can do so.</li>
            <li>I could tell by the first day that it was working.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks refreshed, younger, healthy.      </li>
            <li>Does exactly as the label advertises.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better and although I do use retinoids once or twice a week, I noticed the difference after starting with this product (which I use twice a day).</li>
            <li>I really like this serum!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick, it goes on easily and it feels so nice on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need a little more time with it to rate it accurately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not sure if my skin looks better or not, but I&#x27;ll continue using it as it had such a good review on the show.  </li>
            <li>Amazing, I put this on my thin hand skin, and then put Amlactin on top.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t totally put my finger on it, but it just makes my skin look nice and feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, the consistency issue isn&#x27;t a dealbreaker for me because it works very well in the places I need it most.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very sticky and leaves a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>I really did want it to work for me).</li>
            <li>I do use it at night, but again, I find it very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cucumber products</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is really nauseating.  </li>
            <li>I was very hopeful when I ordered this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My skin is not breaking out as much and</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>My complexion looks very even</li>
            <li>No pablum products, absorbs fast and no sticky feeling afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I am 39, and spent too many hours in the sun in my teens.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like this really moisturize my face</li>
            <li>acne on a monthly basis - thanks to hormones</li>
            <li>I also use the heavy night moisturizer in this line at night which gives you a nice glow in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Good product, not too sticky, not too thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, the first bottle that was shipped to me had already been opened and was dirty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products from this line that made a better impression.  </li>
            <li>While this is presumably because people don&#x27;t want their faces to look like Violet Beauregarde&#x27;s in Willy Wonka, it leads me to question the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that it is \\&quot;rich in antioxidants such as...</li>
            <li>Use it as a regiment daily, clean your skin thoroughly, and drink lots of water.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations, because, God forgive me-</li>
            <li>Instead of absorbing entirely into my skin, at least some portion of it sits on top and dries all shiny, like egg whites, then balls up when I try to put anything on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No improvement from the &amp;#34;Yes Skin Repair Serum&amp;#34; as most voted no difference, a couple even picked the other half of my face as the one that looked better.</li>
            <li>They looked 10 years older then</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for approximately 3 months and am happy with the results thus far.</li>
            <li>So far, I think I like it better than the other product I&#x27;ve used as an anti-aging serum.  </li>
            <li>After a few uses, it had my skin glowing and more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I am really surprised to say how much I</li>
            <li>So I try to eat well and not put too many harsh chemicals in or on my body.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at Walmart and it was relatively new to that store</li>
            <li>Better yet my fiancé (not even knowing that I&#x27;ve been working hard on this for 3 weeks) said that I&#x27;ve been looking really</li>
            <li>I used this product every day, twice a day, until the bottle was empty and I can honestly say I saw no real change.  </li>
            <li>(you only need a tiny amount) and makes your skin feel tight in a good way.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out what to do with my old lady skin with teenager attitude forEVER!</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s rich in other antioxidants</li>
            <li>I would love to review this item, but since Amazon could NOT simply send both items OF THE SAME ORDER to the SAME ADDRESS, I will never know.  </li>
            <li>I ultimately didn&#x27;t take away the final star because of its otherwise impressive ingredient list.(For the record, I have purchased two bottles of this serum at two different stores approximately two months apart.</li>
            <li>This product really rehydrates especially  when you live in AZ.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I really have to rub this product around on the palm of my hand to break down the consistency before I smooth larger amounts of it across my cheeks, nose, forehead, or neck.</li>
            <li>Glowing, clear, like I&#x27;m in my 20s again.</li>
            <li>sometimes natural products just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I like the Neutrogena Clincal old lady cream, but have you ever read the label?  </li>
            <li>Why not try a product made naturally with blueberries?  </li>
            <li>but it looks and smells like old candle wax.</li>
            <li>nearly all the pimples are gone.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smelly fruity or natural at all.  </li>
            <li>I only use it at night because it takes a while to really sink into the skin</li>
            <li>I suggest anyone with acne, mature skin, or lots of sun exposure apply this every night underneath a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It has worked well for my early 40s skin.  </li>
            <li>There are no artificial fragrances, so I think it is just a new experience for some people who are used to the usual highly perfumed lotions.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it five stars is the scent is a little bit strong.</li>
            <li>It causes my moisturizer (which has a high SPF...maybe related?)</li>
            <li>I have unbelievably sensitive skin - it is sensitive to touch, so when I use regular lotions that you have to rub in, I break out.</li>
            <li>Just a light moisturizer is necessary, nothing heavy.</li>
            <li>This makes my normal skin look shiny and feel a bit sticky, regardless of how much or how little I use.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used the Yes to Blueberries Skin repair serum</li>
            <li>Recently I went to the dermatologist who diagnosed me with adult acne rosacea and prescribed Metronidazole which lightened the pimples a bit  but were still there</li>
            <li>It is now gonig on 3 weeks and there is barely any redness and</li>
            <li>This is only day 3 and my hands are smoother and softer and don&#x27;t look like old lady hands anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin as it is, but I also need products to help with aging since my skin is loosing its younger capabilities.</li>
            <li>Be careful that you don&#x27;t rub it in too much or it balls up.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and looks younger.</li>
            <li>I am a 43 year old female w/combination skin.</li>
            <li>I was using a variety of different creams but with all my daily hand washing and sanitizing my hands looks old and wrinkly.  </li>
            <li>, I found a few more wrinkles pop into the mix in the last few months.</li>
            <li>Even though I never  had much of an acne problem before my 40s, I began having big boil like (slight exaggeration</li>
    </ol>

            <li> , it&#x27;s perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product...absorbs quickly....not greasy!  </li>
            <li> Awesome.</li>
            <li> (this was surprising!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoothed out my skin wonderfully and it feels good going on and under my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent product, and fairly inexpensive considering it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I think they work great together.</li>
            <li> I will say her skin looks great</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Is smells great</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> I use it under another moisturizer and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> and it is great alone under makeup, no caking and creasing</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be on your way to amazing skin in no time!</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product and will keep using it for sure.  </li>
            <li> This works great and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Pleasant aroma as well.</li>
            <li> Yes to Blueberries has good coverage</li>
            <li> Blueberries are reported as being a good source of antioxidants.  </li>
            <li> I think the author must have been paid to put in a good review.  </li>
            <li> Even used it when derma rolling and didn&#x27;t do any good.  </li>
            <li> It did smell good and didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Is good feeling</li>
            <li> It will moisturize it and smooth out your skin - it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> consistency is good; it&#x27;s what I expect from a serum.  </li>
            <li> I would consider using just it and the eye cream, if that weren&#x27;t where the good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s with a number of wrinkles along with some acne (life just isn&#x27;t fair sometimes.)</li>
            <li> (And I don&#x27;t have that super awesome glowy type of skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell is light and pleasant and the price here on Amazon is a deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has some great benefits with dedicated use, but here&#x27;s the problem:  </li>
            <li> it sort of stood on the top of my skin and the smell isn&#x27;t that great either.</li>
            <li> and I love them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two weeks now and my skin looks better than it has in a while!</li>
            <li> It would be even better if it smelled like blueberries!  </li>
            <li> My skin looks nice.</li>
            <li> The price was nice, took its time getting here.</li>
            <li> It smells and feels nice, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li> It looks yucky but feels nice when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and</li>
            <li> I am loving it.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> It feels nice going on and my skin needed some help.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a far from perfect, all-over sort of solution, because of the consistency.</li>
            <li> My one year old beagle thinks this stuff is the greatest.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the softness and light, airy feeling of the Blueberries LIne!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> But I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> **LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could better describe the change to you.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Probably would love it more</li>
            <li> Ok, I just needed an anti aging serum that didn&#x27;t have Retin-A because that is not recommended when you are trying to conceive.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was okay</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product of all time.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with this product and feel like my skin looks better from using it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> , I like Neutrogena &amp; RoC better....</li>
            <li> Absolutely, Love all Yes To Products that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I love the combination.  </li>
            <li> and my skin looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li> But it evened out my skin tone quite well for the most part.</li>
            <li> I personally love it.</li>
            <li> It is thinner and has more \\&quot;glide\\&quot; than the lotions.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> better products out there.</li>
            <li> I love yes to, so</li>
            <li> what can I say, I love this too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the texture of my skin - this product absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for many months now.  </li>
            <li> many products cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> I love this serum</li>
            <li> I love that my skin feels nourished without feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hoping with continued use it will keep getting better.</li>
            <li> I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do like how this doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out like a lot of the more greasy creams</li>
            <li> I also use the Yes to Tomatoes moisturizer on top of this, and that seems to work well for me</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not bother me, although it would be nice if it were fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> After a month I asked family members and a couple friends which side of my face looked better.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light serum with pleasant scent of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Ever since i started using this, my skin is clear and feels great.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is by far the best serum I&#x27;ve found, and I have purchased many products that were very costly.</li>
            <li> Product is light and refreshing to use.  </li>
            <li> While it comes in a plastic pump bottle, the pumps are well-designed and it&#x27;s easy to control the amount of product dispensed.     </li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly -</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not cause more breakouts.</li>
            <li> However, the product \\&quot;balls up\\&quot; under the moderately light pressure I apply when massaging a moisturizer into my skin.</li>
            <li> I took away a third star because I believe that this company is greatly overstating the serum&#x27;s antioxidant properties.</li>
            <li> I find it makes my skin more receptive to morning shaving and for this alone it is well worth your consideration.</li>
            <li> and if I put my make-up on immediately after it I apply it it peels and flakes preventing me from applying my make-up smoothly.</li>
            <li> My skin had been going through some mid-life changes and I received a free sample of this product.  </li>
            <li> I really hoped it would be effective.</li>
            <li> The results confirmed what I saw myself.</li>
            <li> Many gave a good review, just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product--the ingredient list is impressive, the price is right, and it is about as natural as you can get.</li>
            <li> Price is right for a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you pair it with the right cleansers and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This is exciting, ya&#x27;ll!  </li>
            <li> I liked this product more than the others in the line, such as the face wash and day lotion.  </li>
            <li> You want to get rid of all the deep dirt to clear the way for this awesome stuff to work.</li>
            <li> My cheeks were always bright red</li>
            <li> and even then you don&#x27;t need a full pump</li>
            <li> But I will know more after I get thru a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Overall, good, but not for day.</li>
            <li> Sweet to your skin.</li>
            <li> looking.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it to amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Anyone who uses the YES line, please give me some suggestions for a good alternate.</li>
            <li> I won a bag full of the Yes products and this was included.</li>
            <li> Seems like it uses natural ingredients and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> , maybe 1/2 a pump&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> I love the price and the natural indgrediants list.  </li>
            <li> It feels fresh and soothing upon application, but that&#x27;s the extent of it.  </li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and has a healthy look to it</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> - why do most companies assume mature women (I&#x27;m 51) need greasy products?  </li>
            <li> I wish it worked as good for me as it did for some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I hope it works for you, but for me, I could find no benefit from the product other than feeling and smelling good when I applied it.</li>
            <li> As such, I do not find it suitable for daytime use.    </li>
            <li> Definitely a must with a organic line for a regular regimen with great results.</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivity and the fragrance of this mostly natural product was to strong for my face.  </li>
            <li> This serum is a very light color with no hint of purple or blue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product but it might be  for older skin.</li>
            <li> This does a great job and is safe for women in my predicament (y&#x27;know, old enough to worry about lines and young enough to have babies).</li>
            <li> That also happened to me the first time I used them together.  </li>
            <li> I am a faithful Yes to, Inc. user and love most of their products, especially since I only buy cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li> As it&#x27;s a serum, I expect to be able to layer it underneath my daily moisturizer, and the packaging states that I can do so.</li>
            <li> I could tell by the first day that it was working.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks refreshed, younger, healthy.      </li>
            <li> Does exactly as the label advertises.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better and although I do use retinoids once or twice a week, I noticed the difference after starting with this product (which I use twice a day).</li>
            <li> I really like this serum!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick, it goes on easily and it feels so nice on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need a little more time with it to rate it accurately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure if my skin looks better or not, but I&#x27;ll continue using it as it had such a good review on the show.  </li>
            <li> Amazing, I put this on my thin hand skin, and then put Amlactin on top.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t totally put my finger on it, but it just makes my skin look nice and feel soft.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, the consistency issue isn&#x27;t a dealbreaker for me because it works very well in the places I need it most.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very sticky and leaves a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I really did want it to work for me).</li>
            <li> I do use it at night, but again, I find it very sticky.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cucumber products</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is really nauseating.  </li>
            <li> I was very hopeful when I ordered this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My skin is not breaking out as much and</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> My complexion looks very even</li>
            <li> No pablum products, absorbs fast and no sticky feeling afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I am 39, and spent too many hours in the sun in my teens.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this really moisturize my face</li>
            <li> acne on a monthly basis - thanks to hormones</li>
            <li> I also use the heavy night moisturizer in this line at night which gives you a nice glow in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Good product, not too sticky, not too thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, the first bottle that was shipped to me had already been opened and was dirty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products from this line that made a better impression.  </li>
            <li> While this is presumably because people don&#x27;t want their faces to look like Violet Beauregarde&#x27;s in Willy Wonka, it leads me to question the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that it is \\&quot;rich in antioxidants such as...</li>
            <li> Use it as a regiment daily, clean your skin thoroughly, and drink lots of water.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations, because, God forgive me-</li>
            <li> Instead of absorbing entirely into my skin, at least some portion of it sits on top and dries all shiny, like egg whites, then balls up when I try to put anything on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No improvement from the &amp;#34;Yes Skin Repair Serum&amp;#34; as most voted no difference, a couple even picked the other half of my face as the one that looked better.</li>
            <li> They looked 10 years older then</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 months and am happy with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> So far, I think I like it better than the other product I&#x27;ve used as an anti-aging serum.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, it had my skin glowing and more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I am really surprised to say how much I</li>
            <li> So I try to eat well and not put too many harsh chemicals in or on my body.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart and it was relatively new to that store</li>
            <li> Better yet my fiancé (not even knowing that I&#x27;ve been working hard on this for 3 weeks) said that I&#x27;ve been looking really</li>
            <li> I used this product every day, twice a day, until the bottle was empty and I can honestly say I saw no real change.  </li>
            <li> (you only need a tiny amount) and makes your skin feel tight in a good way.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out what to do with my old lady skin with teenager attitude forEVER!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s rich in other antioxidants</li>
            <li> I would love to review this item, but since Amazon could NOT simply send both items OF THE SAME ORDER to the SAME ADDRESS, I will never know.  </li>
            <li> I ultimately didn&#x27;t take away the final star because of its otherwise impressive ingredient list.(For the record, I have purchased two bottles of this serum at two different stores approximately two months apart.</li>
            <li> This product really rehydrates especially  when you live in AZ.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I really have to rub this product around on the palm of my hand to break down the consistency before I smooth larger amounts of it across my cheeks, nose, forehead, or neck.</li>
            <li> Glowing, clear, like I&#x27;m in my 20s again.</li>
            <li> sometimes natural products just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I like the Neutrogena Clincal old lady cream, but have you ever read the label?  </li>
            <li> Why not try a product made naturally with blueberries?  </li>
            <li> but it looks and smells like old candle wax.</li>
            <li> nearly all the pimples are gone.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smelly fruity or natural at all.  </li>
            <li> I only use it at night because it takes a while to really sink into the skin</li>
            <li> I suggest anyone with acne, mature skin, or lots of sun exposure apply this every night underneath a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It has worked well for my early 40s skin.  </li>
            <li> There are no artificial fragrances, so I think it is just a new experience for some people who are used to the usual highly perfumed lotions.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it five stars is the scent is a little bit strong.</li>
            <li> It causes my moisturizer (which has a high SPF...maybe related?)</li>
            <li> I have unbelievably sensitive skin - it is sensitive to touch, so when I use regular lotions that you have to rub in, I break out.</li>
            <li> Just a light moisturizer is necessary, nothing heavy.</li>
            <li> This makes my normal skin look shiny and feel a bit sticky, regardless of how much or how little I use.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used the Yes to Blueberries Skin repair serum</li>
            <li> Recently I went to the dermatologist who diagnosed me with adult acne rosacea and prescribed Metronidazole which lightened the pimples a bit  but were still there</li>
            <li> It is now gonig on 3 weeks and there is barely any redness and</li>
            <li> This is only day 3 and my hands are smoother and softer and don&#x27;t look like old lady hands anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin as it is, but I also need products to help with aging since my skin is loosing its younger capabilities.</li>
            <li> Be careful that you don&#x27;t rub it in too much or it balls up.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and looks younger.</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old female w/combination skin.</li>
            <li> I was using a variety of different creams but with all my daily hand washing and sanitizing my hands looks old and wrinkly.  </li>
            <li> , I found a few more wrinkles pop into the mix in the last few months.</li>
            <li> Even though I never  had much of an acne problem before my 40s, I began having big boil like (slight exaggeration</li>
            <li> I feel this line leaves a little bit of an oily film on my face, though, and I attribute that to the fact that this is made for older skin.  </li>
            <li> Hauschka or other Swiss/German natural brands.</li>
            <li> I do not know how long this would last, perhaps the same since they are both 1 fl oz.</li>
            <li> No more breakouts since I started using, I am in my forties so this is very welcome!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> My skin is quite normal, so it dried it out.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that a product made with some great natural ingredients has to ruin it for people like myself with all the stinky perfume.  </li>
            <li> After cleaning my face, I applied this serum, which left a strange &amp;#34;sheen&amp;#34; to my skin (no biggie, but my face felt sticky for a long time), did not moisturize at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant type of stickiness though, at least this sticky feeling doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as other products have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sweating in it all night...&lt;br /&gt;Stuff sits like a greasy thick film on my face and neck till I wash it off in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe as I live in the tropics it is not suitable, but they might warn that it will never get absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great but for the first time, I don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li> Any that are left are not very visible.  </li>
            <li> Well, she asked if five weeks would be too long for me to wait...  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and normally cannot use a serum because it is just too irritating.  </li>
            <li> While one reviewer wrote that this serum is very watery, I found it to be excessively thick and of a gloppy texture.</li>
            <li> It takes long to dry</li>
            <li> and I do not have this problem with any of the other serums I have used in recent months.</li>
            <li> I could not emulsify it in my hand prior to applying it to my face as I can with other serums, moisturizers, etc.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin so dry that it now chaffed</li>
            <li> It also goes on sticky and takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> you have extremely dry skin, I would imagine you would want to use the accompanying YTB day or night cream afterwards, but for me, I don&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Single.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if mine was an old product or not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s, I felt I needed an intensive moisture regimen, but I have too many questions about the chemicals/ingredients in my old products (Olay Regenerist, which is also a Proctor &amp; Gamble company and P&amp;G is notorious for their exceptionally cruel tests involving animals).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m staring down the barrel of 40 and am starting to see Father Time beating me on the face with his aging stick.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to be helping my skin after only a day and a half using it.  </li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve seen with natural household cleaning products.  </li>
            <li> * this stuff after only a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived promptly and as expected.</li>
            <li> the money spent.</li>
            <li> I also feels that to wet in the face</li>
            <li> No real complaints though, just wish it got here a bit quicker like the rest of my purchases</li>
            <li> I have used a few different moisturizers over it.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t look carefully because I thought it said $6.00, but it was $16--I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it for that price.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is causing my skin to look younger, but it seems to keep me moisturized after washing at night and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if this \\&quot;balling up\\&quot; is due to a thickening agent contained in the formulation.</li>
            <li> Other comments:    </li>
            <li> Again, perhaps this is due to the xanthan gum.    </li>
            <li> But I have to agree with other reviewers:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review the other products separately, but here is my take on the serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and look for other products within this line.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to dry</li>
            <li> Although, just like other negative feedbacks have mentioned, it does make my face feel sticky for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it on half of my face&#x27;s problem areas and leave the other side of my face without any cream.</li>
            <li> People either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> But other than that my face hasn&#x27;t dried out (even during the winter months)</li>
            <li> I know some of the reviews say that when they use this in combination with the Blueberry serum it turns into a sticky mess.  </li>
            <li> see some reviewers have complained about the strange smell.</li>
            <li> They work even in hot climates or cold ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling sticky and greasy and I would break out worse than I already do.</li>
            <li> one was waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve been out for a couple of weeks and have been using the heavy night cream for day and night but no breakouts from that either.  </li>
            <li> You see dramatic improvement in minutes and last all day.</li>
            <li> but the texture is not very nice (sticky and it takes some effort to absorb it into the skin).</li>
            <li> However, I have been unable to use it during the day, as advertised, only at night.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, considering it is only an ounce.</li>
            <li> This serum is thin in texture and goes on rather wet.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed enough with it to buy it again.</li>
            <li> not sure why Dr. Oz endorses it.  </li>
            <li> But, leaves the skin silky smooth...wish it was half the $19.99 price tag, though!!</li>
            <li> I look less tired, my skin evens out, the bags disappear.</li>
            <li> Take it from me--I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> You just put a very thin layer on and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> I dislike it all, but I dislike the serum and the eye cream least.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have residual acne scars and unevenness of the skin, this stuff isn&#x27;t a cure</li>
            <li> I think this serum smells like blueberry cheesecake, and the results around my eyes - where I apply it in very small dots - are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seriously tones up the skin on your face.</li>
            <li> Plus the smell is a little off putting and the consistency is weird.</li>
            <li> This leads me to conclude that I did not simply get a bad batch.)    </li>
            <li> Not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s probably not really good for you.      </li>
            <li> But to those consumers who use makeup, this serum is indeed not a good choice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only 32, but do to having to deal with the stress of a sick parent</li>
            <li> Warning to all: If you choose to buy this product, buy it from a retailer that stands behind its products and its customers.</li>
            <li> So things were worse than what I started with.      </li>
            <li> I find it very sticky, and I can&#x27;t use it under makeup - makes the makeup cake and looks awful.</li>
            <li> My skin is beginning to look worse ad worse every.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical it would work for me because of my age (36) as reading the reviews I was under the impression all the greats ones were from people in their 20s.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin would look worse without it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> awful,-- nothing like blueberries -- although other products in the line do smell worse.  </li>
            <li> I applied it very thinly and felt it made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I decided to return because I was unhappy with the feel of this product and the scent.</li>
            <li> I had to wash it off because it was literally making me sick.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> so I hate looking at my hands all day.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I know some of the reviews say that when they use this in combination with the Blueberry serum it turns into a sticky mess.  That also happened to me the first time I used them together.  The way to avoid that is to use the serum and then wait about 5 minutes for the serum to absorb and then use the moisturizer...and even then you don&#x27;t need a full pump, maybe 1/2 a pump&#x27;s worth.  I think they work great together.</li>
            <li> Makes a difference!!!  I love this serum.  I actually bought it by mistake.  I thought I was buying the night moisturizer.  (the bottle looks the same).  But I am so glad I did.  I will use this all the time.  It&#x27;s smoothed out my skin wonderfully and it feels good going on and under my moisturizer.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well but the texture is not very nice (sticky and it takes some effort to absorb it into the skin).</li>
            <li> I like they way it goes on my skin after I use my MicroNeedle. But I will know more after I get thru a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product when I bought the entire YTB line.  I am a faithful Yes to, Inc. user and love most of their products, especially since I only buy cruelty-free.  I liked this product more than the others in the line, such as the face wash and day lotion.  I applied it very thinly and felt it made a difference.  The scent is wonderful too.  I feel this line leaves a little bit of an oily film on my face, though, and I attribute that to the fact that this is made for older skin.  I am only 31 so I think I need to wait longer to appreciate this product.  At this stage in my life, I think the YTC, YTT, and YTCucumbers products definitely suffice for my skin.</li>
            <li> Yes to Blueberries has good coverage (you only need a tiny amount) and makes your skin feel tight in a good way. However, I have been unable to use it during the day, as advertised, only at night. It causes my moisturizer (which has a high SPF...maybe related?) to peel off all over like I put eraser shavings on my face. Gross. Not a good feeling. I am not sure if it is causing my skin to look younger, but it seems to keep me moisturized after washing at night and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. Overall, good, but not for day.</li>
            <li> I love the price and the natural indgrediants list.  However be warned that this does ball up and flake on your skin.  I found it to be gross and it was enough to make me not to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised to say how much I **LOVE LOVE LOVE*** this stuff after only a few days of use.  I&#x27;m staring down the barrel of 40 and am starting to see Father Time beating me on the face with his aging stick.  I didn&#x27;t really have high expectations, because, God forgive me- sometimes natural products just don&#x27;t work.  At least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve seen with natural household cleaning products.  Sometimes a sister needs to use a chemical.     So I try to eat well and not put too many harsh chemicals in or on my body.  I like the Neutrogena Clincal old lady cream, but have you ever read the label?  Lots of stuff on there that&#x27;s probably not really good for you.      That&#x27;s what brought me to the Yes to Carrots line.  So far I&#x27;ve only used the Yes to Blueberries Skin repair serum and I love it.  My skin looks nice. I wish I could better describe the change to you.  Dewy?  Brighter?  Smaller pores?  I can&#x27;t totally put my finger on it, but it just makes my skin look nice and feel soft.  The ingredient list is awesome- plant derived awesomeness.      I do break out still, so I&#x27;m also going to try the Yes to Tomatoes line.  I think the combination of the tomato line with the blueberry line will be the ticket for me.  This is exciting, ya&#x27;ll!  I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out what to do with my old lady skin with teenager attitude forEVER!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. It is expensive, considering it is only an ounce. But, leaves the skin silky smooth...wish it was half the $19.99 price tag, though!!</li>
            <li> Why not try a product made naturally with blueberries?  Blueberries are reported as being a good source of antioxidants.  This product was recommended by Dr. Oz.  So far, I think I like it better than the other product I&#x27;ve used as an anti-aging serum.  It is also cheaper.  Product smells like blueberries.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I put this on my thin hand skin, and then put Amlactin on top. I&#x27;m at the age where my hand&#x27;s  skin makes me look 65 but the rest of me looks 40, so I hate looking at my hands all day. This stuff is a miracle!</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this because of a review in a magazine.  I think the author must have been paid to put in a good review.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference with my skin tone, texture or anything.  Even used it when derma rolling and didn&#x27;t do any good.  For me it was just an extra product on my face.  It did smell good and didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Probably would love it more but it&#x27;s very sticky and leaves a residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products from this line that made a better impression.  I don&#x27;t agree with the &#x27;sticky&#x27; comments - i find it absorbs perfectly. I don&#x27;t see a whit of difference in my skin after 3 weeks of daily use. It feels fresh and soothing upon application, but that&#x27;s the extent of it.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell, and thankfully it doesn&#x27;t linger.  I&#x27;ll take my serum dollars elsewhere next time.</li>
            <li> This serum is thin in texture and goes on rather wet.  It takes a little time to dry so you can&#x27;t immediately apply your moisturizer.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell either.</li>
            <li> Good product, not too sticky, not too thick. Have seen some improvement with my skin. Price is right for a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product--the ingredient list is impressive, the price is right, and it is about as natural as you can get. As it&#x27;s a serum, I expect to be able to layer it underneath my daily moisturizer, and the packaging states that I can do so. However, the product \\&quot;balls up\\&quot; under the moderately light pressure I apply when massaging a moisturizer into my skin. This happens whether I apply the moisturizer immediately or 10+ minutes following the serum application (when it has had time to fully absorb), and I do not have this problem with any of the other serums I have used in recent months. I am wondering if this \\&quot;balling up\\&quot; is due to a thickening agent contained in the formulation. Maybe it&#x27;s the xanthan gum?    Other comments:    (1) The antioxidant properties of blueberries--namely the anthocyanins--are what make blueberries a deep purplish-blue. Juice that comes from unpeeled blueberries is a very deep shade of purple. This serum is a very light color with no hint of purple or blue. As such, I&#x27;m guessing that the anthocyanin-rich skins never made it into the juice and therefore the serum. While this is presumably because people don&#x27;t want their faces to look like Violet Beauregarde&#x27;s in Willy Wonka, it leads me to question the manufacturer&#x27;s claim that it is \\&quot;rich in antioxidants such as...Anthocyanins...\\&quot; Maybe it&#x27;s rich in other antioxidants (it claims to be), but this anthocyanin issue makes me second-guess the company&#x27;s statements.    (2) While one reviewer wrote that this serum is very watery, I found it to be excessively thick and of a gloppy texture. I could not emulsify it in my hand prior to applying it to my face as I can with other serums, moisturizers, etc. Again, perhaps this is due to the xanthan gum.    (3) This makes my normal skin look shiny and feel a bit sticky, regardless of how much or how little I use. As such, I do not find it suitable for daytime use.    (4) While it comes in a plastic pump bottle, the pumps are well-designed and it&#x27;s easy to control the amount of product dispensed.     I took away one star because it wouldn&#x27;t layer under various moisturizers I tried to layer it with. I took away a second star because it left my skin feeling sticky and looking shiny. I took away a third star because I believe that this company is greatly overstating the serum&#x27;s antioxidant properties. I ultimately didn&#x27;t take away the final star because of its otherwise impressive ingredient list.(For the record, I have purchased two bottles of this serum at two different stores approximately two months apart. (See! I really did want it to work for me). This leads me to conclude that I did not simply get a bad batch.)    UPDATE: I purchased this item at my local Target Store. Warning to all: If you choose to buy this product, buy it from a retailer that stands behind its products and its customers. Walmart honors (without question) customer returns of opened skin care products, but Target won&#x27;t honor any product return--even if it&#x27;s defective--once it&#x27;s been opened. Take it from me--I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart and it was relatively new to that store so I am not sure if mine was an old product or not but it looks and smells like old candle wax. I am not impressed enough with it to buy it again.</li>
            <li> The item arrived promptly and as expected. It is an excellent product, and fairly inexpensive considering it&#x27;s effectiveness. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Ok, I just needed an anti aging serum that didn&#x27;t have Retin-A because that is not recommended when you are trying to conceive. This does a great job and is safe for women in my predicament (y&#x27;know, old enough to worry about lines and young enough to have babies).</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was okay but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin. I wish it worked as good for me as it did for some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I never had skin problems.  I always got compliments on my \\&quot;clear\\&quot; skin.  Something chagned when I got to my thirties.  My cheeks were always bright red and I now had acne that no over the counter cleansers were helping, in fact, I became allergic to over the counter acne cleansers, to the point that my face would swell up.      Recently I went to the dermatologist who diagnosed me with adult acne rosacea and prescribed Metronidazole which lightened the pimples a bit  but were still there and it made my skin so dry that it now chaffed and my cheeks were a brighter red.  So things were worse than what I started with.      I stopped using it and decided to try Yes to Blueberries Intensive Skin Repair Serum along with the overnight hydrating cream.  I could tell by the first day that it was working.  My skin looked lighter and the pimples had already started to vanish.      It is now gonig on 3 weeks and there is barely any redness and nearly all the pimples are gone.  Any that are left are not very visible.  My skin looks refreshed, younger, healthy.      This is my favorite product of all time.  It saved my skin.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and swears by it. I will say her skin looks great so if it is this product then i will keep her supplied with it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before &amp; love it. It arrived with a faulty pump. It takes a lot to get any product out.</li>
            <li> This is a seriously awesome product... However, let me tell you the best way to use it and see results. Begin by deep cleaning your skin with an at home facial.. so that means scrub, steam, cleanse, and mask.. THEN begin this regiment. You want to get rid of all the deep dirt to clear the way for this awesome stuff to work. Continue to do a weekly at home facial and use this stuff every morning and night. My skin is actually glowing. (And I don&#x27;t have that super awesome glowy type of skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works so well that my colleagues have been asking me what has changed and my friends have told me that I&#x27;m glowing. Better yet my fiancé (not even knowing that I&#x27;ve been working hard on this for 3 weeks) said that I&#x27;ve been looking really pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, this works. Use it as a regiment daily, clean your skin thoroughly, and drink lots of water. You&#x27;ll be on your way to amazing skin in no time!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and normally cannot use a serum because it is just too irritating.  I have had no problems with this product and feel like my skin looks better from using it.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is the scent is a little bit strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, I like Neutrogena &amp; RoC better....however, the Say Yes Grapefruit CC cream is great!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something for my hands.  I was using a variety of different creams but with all my daily hand washing and sanitizing my hands looks old and wrinkly.  They looked 10 years older then the rest of me.  I read about Yes To Blueberries and decided to try it.  I had to go on and write a review because after two days of using the Daily Repairing Moisturizer and the Intensive Skin Repair Serum I already see a difference.  This is only day 3 and my hands are smoother and softer and don&#x27;t look like old lady hands anymore.  I am so impressed with this product and will keep using it for sure.  I ordered it on a Friday and got it Monday just like I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40s, I felt I needed an intensive moisture regimen, but I have too many questions about the chemicals/ingredients in my old products (Olay Regenerist, which is also a Proctor &amp; Gamble company and P&amp;G is notorious for their exceptionally cruel tests involving animals). I switched to YTB products after a friend my age recommended them and I am largely very happy with the results. I think this serum smells like blueberry cheesecake, and the results around my eyes - where I apply it in very small dots - are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I really have to rub this product around on the palm of my hand to break down the consistency before I smooth larger amounts of it across my cheeks, nose, forehead, or neck. Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t spread evenly and it will flake off - which utterly defeats the appearance of the mineral-based foundation and powder I like to use. I think the answer is to use this serum only around my eyes, and then use a different YTB product elsewhere on my face. Ultimately, the consistency issue isn&#x27;t a dealbreaker for me because it works very well in the places I need it most. But I have to agree with other reviewers: it&#x27;s a far from perfect, all-over sort of solution, because of the consistency.</li>
            <li> My one year old beagle thinks this stuff is the greatest.  It must smell like blueberry to her as she will lick it off my face everytime I use it.  I think it is working, when I can keep it awary from the pup.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell any difference yet, but I&#x27;ve only used it for about 2 weeks.  I find it very sticky, and I can&#x27;t use it under makeup - makes the makeup cake and looks awful. I do use it at night, but again, I find it very sticky.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, Love all Yes To Products that I have tried.  I really enjoy the softness and light, airy feeling of the Blueberries LIne!!</li>
            <li> I *so* wanted to like this product but I threw it out after one use.  I really like the cucumber products this company makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like a high-SPF sunscreen, it didn&#x27;t sink in immediately, but sat on the surface of my skin looking milky.  When it eventually sunk in, it left a tacky/sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really nauseating.  It doesn&#x27;t smelly fruity or natural at all.  I had to wash it off because it was literally making me sick.</li>
            <li> Sweet to your skin. I bought for my wife and find myself using it. I find it makes my skin more receptive to morning shaving and for this alone it is well worth your consideration.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin (I&#x27;m 26). It&#x27;s not a bad product but it might be  for older skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Does exactly as the label advertises. I look less tired, my skin evens out, the bags disappear. Great product. Worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night.  It&#x27;s light and feels good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, the first bottle that was shipped to me had already been opened and was dirty looking.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it to amazon for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Is good feeling but I feel I like the moister. I also feels that to wet in the face It takes long to dry</li>
            <li> The price was nice, took its time getting here. No real complaints though, just wish it got here a bit quicker like the rest of my purchases</li>
            <li> I do not like the aroma or feel of this serum. Many gave a good review, just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> This product really rehydrates especially  when you live in AZ.</li>
            <li> It crumbles when you apply any lotion. Plus the smell is a little off putting and the consistency is weird.</li>
            <li> I have unbelievably sensitive skin - it is sensitive to touch, so when I use regular lotions that you have to rub in, I break out. This is the ONLY thing i&#x27;ve found that moisturizes my skin without making it break out.  You just put a very thin layer on and let it dry.  It will moisturize it and smooth out your skin - it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful when I ordered this. I know the reviews are very mixed. People either love it or hate it. I was very disappointed. It left my skin feeling sticky and greasy and I would break out worse than I already do. I have naturally oily skin as it is, but I also need products to help with aging since my skin is loosing its younger capabilities. This line of products does not work for me and I do not recommend it for anyone with oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li> This works great and smells good too. Definitely a must with a organic line for a regular regimen with great results.</li>
            <li> I see no difference after 4 weeks of use. Anyone who uses the YES line, please give me some suggestions for a good alternate.</li>
            <li> It smells and feels nice, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything. It also goes on sticky and takes a while to dry. I use it at night; it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would work well under make up.</li>
            <li> I use this serum every night and morning with the Yes To Blueberries face wipes.  I love the combination.  Be careful that you don&#x27;t rub it in too much or it balls up.  But other than that my face hasn&#x27;t dried out (even during the winter months) and my skin looks better than ever.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I decided to return because I was unhappy with the feel of this product and the scent. I was looking for a vitamin serum, to replace dermalogica multivitamin serum, to use alone or in addition to skincare routine. After cleaning my face, I applied this serum, which left a strange &amp;#34;sheen&amp;#34; to my skin (no biggie, but my face felt sticky for a long time), did not moisturize at all (this was surprising!) and I could smell the fragrance until I washed it off. To me, it reminded me of children&#x27;s chewable Tylenol that I used to take as a kid. When I attempted to use in the morning, under Nars tinted moisturizer, I saw that the serum had turned to a gel-like substance and started to get peely. This was the final deciding factor, this could not perform as the lower price, vitamin serum that I was hoping to replace dermalogica.( For the price, amount of product, I&#x27;ll go back to dermalogica, which ended up lasting close to 9 months). I do not know how long this would last, perhaps the same since they are both 1 fl oz.</li>
            <li> This product soothed my skin although I didn&#x27;t like the filmy residue it sometimes left. But it evened out my skin tone quite well for the most part. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing but I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of people complaining about how this doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it&#x27;s a serum NOT a moisturizer. Yes it does have some moisturizing benefits but moisturization is not its purpose. It is supposed to be combined with a moisturizer in order to pack your skin with antioxidants and nutrients that promote cell turnover. I personally love it. I only use it at night because it takes a while to really sink into the skin and if I put my make-up on immediately after it I apply it it peels and flakes preventing me from applying my make-up smoothly. It is having a big impact on my skin combined with the Yes to Blueberries moisturizer, eye cream, and face oil. My skin is not breaking out as much and my post acne inflammation is leaving quicker. I suggest anyone with acne, mature skin, or lots of sun exposure apply this every night underneath a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the entire moisturizing portion of this line yesterday morning, including the serum, the eye cream, the eye roller, the day cream, and the night cream.  I started using it as soon as I got it home.  I&#x27;m sure it has some great benefits with dedicated use, but here&#x27;s the problem:  I can&#x27;t stand to keep using it!  I dislike it all, but I dislike the serum and the eye cream least.  I&#x27;ll review the other products separately, but here is my take on the serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is good; it&#x27;s what I expect from a serum.  It is thinner and has more \\&quot;glide\\&quot; than the lotions.  It does seem to be helping my skin after only a day and a half using it.  I would consider using just it and the eye cream, if that weren&#x27;t where the good ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells awful,-- nothing like blueberries -- although other products in the line do smell worse.  Instead of absorbing entirely into my skin, at least some portion of it sits on top and dries all shiny, like egg whites, then balls up when I try to put anything on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll go back to synthetic-heavy lines like L&#x27;Oreal (although after reading another review here, I will NOT be trying Olay again, if I do!).  I do know I will not continue using Yes To Blueberries.  I&#x27;m stopping on my way home from work, today, and getting something else.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin is so soft and looks younger.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 3 months and am happy with the results thus far. I will continue to use and look for other products within this line.</li>
            <li> only problem with yes is you cannot use it with another moisturizer it peels off the same with a concealer i only use it at night  by itself</li>
            <li> Arrived with a faulty pump - almost no product comes out and a bunch has leaked out of the bottom.</li>
            <li> no big deal.  not sure why Dr. Oz endorses it.  won&#x27;t buy it again for that price.  better products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need a little more time with it to rate it accurately.</li>
            <li> purchased this, the cleanser and moisturizer and the 3 products were perfectly together. My skin feels so soft and has a healthy look to it and that is saying a lot for being 59. Smell is light and pleasant and the price here on Amazon is a deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for a while and I love them! Especially this serum. Ever since i started using this, my skin is clear and feels great. Just make sure you pair it with the right cleansers and moisturizers. Just a light moisturizer is necessary, nothing heavy. Is smells great and i will be using it for quite a while. I even stocked up and bought an extra one!</li>
            <li> My skin had been going through some mid-life changes and I received a free sample of this product.  After a few uses, it had my skin glowing and more vibrant.  I am hooked.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I was skeptical it would work for me because of my age (36) as reading the reviews I was under the impression all the greats ones were from people in their 20s. But it worked! My skin looks better and although I do use retinoids once or twice a week, I noticed the difference after starting with this product (which I use twice a day).</li>
            <li> I would love to review this item, but since Amazon could NOT simply send both items OF THE SAME ORDER to the SAME ADDRESS, I will never know.  And the incompetant people that they have working the phones?  Well, she asked if five weeks would be too long for me to wait...  Unreal.  I&#x27;ll be buying on eBay from now on when possible.</li>
            <li> check the label for ingredients then check cucumbers, tomatoes etc, guess what?&lt;br /&gt;All the ingredients in the different boxes are the same!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love yes to, so what can I say, I love this too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two weeks now and my skin looks better than it has in a while! I noticed the change within days, actually. It&#x27;s not too thick, it goes on easily and it feels so nice on the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only 32, but do to having to deal with the stress of a sick parent, I found a few more wrinkles pop into the mix in the last few months. So, I tried this stuff at the recommendation of one of my friends. I&#x27;ve since gone back to get the cleaner and the two eye treatments. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I won a bag full of the Yes products and this was included. I&#x27;m in my 50s with a number of wrinkles along with some acne (life just isn&#x27;t fair sometimes.) I really like this product. It looks yucky but feels nice when I put it on. It absorbs quickly and does not cause more breakouts. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and plan to keep using it. I use it under another moisturizer and it works great for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes me look ten years younger. It seriously tones up the skin on your face. Will continue to buy this serum from now on!</li>
            <li> Love the texture of my skin - this product absorbs well. My complexion looks very even - I use in conjunction with the moisturizer and night cream..</li>
            <li> I saw it on Dr Oz and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for many months now.  I&#x27;m really not sure if my skin looks better or not, but I&#x27;ll continue using it as it had such a good review on the show.  Maybe my skin would look worse without it!</li>
            <li> Sticky texture, and cloying, long-lasting smell that irritates me all day. Yuck. It&#x27;s going back to CVS.</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old female w/combination skin. I&#x27;m prone to oiliness in the T zone and dryness on my cheeks. My skin is very sensitive and many products cause me to break out.  I love this serum, it&#x27;s perfect for my skin. It absorbs very quickly - I use about 1/2 pump on my face and 1/2 pump on my neck.  I love that my skin feels nourished without feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have extremely dry skin, I would imagine you would want to use the accompanying YTB day or night cream afterwards, but for me, I don&#x27;t need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some reviewers have complained about the strange smell. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with it.  There are no artificial fragrances, so I think it is just a new experience for some people who are used to the usual highly perfumed lotions. I believe that may be the same for people who don&#x27;t like the consistency. This is a serum - NOT a lotion.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is by far the best serum I&#x27;ve found, and I have purchased many products that were very costly.</li>
            <li> Second order for me -- recommended to my friends.  Product is light and refreshing to use.  Pleasant aroma as well.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and fruity.&lt;br /&gt;Prefer Weleda, Dr.Hauschka or other Swiss/German natural brands. They work even in hot climates or cold ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweating in it all night...&lt;br /&gt;Stuff sits like a greasy thick film on my face and neck till I wash it off in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe as I live in the tropics it is not suitable, but they might warn that it will never get absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li> No pablum products, absorbs fast and no sticky feeling afterwards.  You see dramatic improvement in minutes and last all day.</li>
            <li> Great product...absorbs quickly....not greasy!  It would be even better if it smelled like blueberries!  I would recommend this product for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have residual acne scars and unevenness of the skin, this stuff isn&#x27;t a cure all but I have noticed an improvement in the overall texture and tone of my skin. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks but I&#x27;m hoping with continued use it will keep getting better. Also I have combination skin and this doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> I used this product every day, twice a day, until the bottle was empty and I can honestly say I saw no real change.  I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I am 39, and spent too many hours in the sun in my teens. My skin is beginning to look worse ad worse every. Single. Day. :( I  have been using Yes to Blueberries eye cream and face serum for 2 days and I kid you not I can see a difference. I don&#x27;t know why but I have NOT had the flaking and balling up that others have. (I have used products like that and I dislike them too!) I have used a few different moisturizers over it. Night cream, day cream with and without SPF. The smell is not great but for the first time, I don&#x27;t care! My skin looks amazing! Glowing, clear, like I&#x27;m in my 20s again. It is definitely worth a try. I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this really moisturize my face it sort of stood on the top of my skin and the smell isn&#x27;t that great either. I would not buy again</li>
            <li> This Repair serum did work for me. I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six months now - I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference.  What I like about it is it&#x27;s not greasy - why do most companies assume mature women (I&#x27;m 51) need greasy products?  I do like how this doesn&#x27;t seem to make me break out like a lot of the more greasy creams do.  I also use the Yes to Tomatoes moisturizer on top of this, and that seems to work well for me - I&#x27;m still on the fence about the Blueberries product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to people who have oily skin.  My skin is quite normal, so it dried it out.  I bought two, one for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas stocking, and one for myself.  I think it was overpriced though--I guess I didn&#x27;t look carefully because I thought it said $6.00, but it was $16--I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it for that price.</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivity and the fragrance of this mostly natural product was to strong for my face.  I am very disappointed that a product made with some great natural ingredients has to ruin it for people like myself with all the stinky perfume.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> yeah, buy it.  you will see a difference in your skin and it is great alone under makeup, no caking and creasing</li>
            <li> No more breakouts since I started using, I am in my forties so this is very welcome!&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum! It has worked well for my early 40s skin.  It leaves a nice glow.  I also use the heavy night moisturizer in this line at night which gives you a nice glow in the morning.  I was worried it would cause breakouts since that seems to be a problem for me now. Even though I never  had much of an acne problem before my 40s, I began having big boil like (slight exaggeration but that is what they feel like) acne on a monthly basis - thanks to hormones I assume.  I have not had any since I started using this product.  The fragrance does not bother me, although it would be nice if it were fragrance free.  I&#x27;m ordering another bottle of this serum - I&#x27;ve been out for a couple of weeks and have been using the heavy night cream for day and night but no breakouts from that either.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> I really hoped it would be effective. Seems like it uses natural ingredients and has a nice smell. It feels nice going on and my skin needed some help. I decided to try it on half of my face&#x27;s problem areas and leave the other side of my face without any cream. After a month I asked family members and a couple friends which side of my face looked better. The results confirmed what I saw myself. No improvement from the &amp;#34;Yes Skin Repair Serum&amp;#34; as most voted no difference, a couple even picked the other half of my face as the one that looked better. If you buy it I hope it works for you, but for me, I could find no benefit from the product other than feeling and smelling good when I applied it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light serum with pleasant scent of natural ingredients. I really love it. Although, just like other negative feedbacks have mentioned, it does make my face feel sticky for the entire day. It&#x27;s not unpleasant type of stickiness though, at least this sticky feeling doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as other products have. But to those consumers who use makeup, this serum is indeed not a good choice.</li>
