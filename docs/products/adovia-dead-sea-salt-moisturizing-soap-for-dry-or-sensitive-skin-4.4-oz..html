            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li>easily does it wash off the skin- Very easily.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and squeaky clean!!!!</li>
            <li>The packaging is very nice, and I was really looking forward to my nighttime pampering routine.</li>
            <li>this soap was sent to me to try out, I was very excited.  </li>
            <li>I feel really clean and smell amazing.</li>
            <li>It rinses off easily and left my skin with a delightful, healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable.</li>
            <li>This soap gives my skin a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I could feel the mositure and my face felt very clean.  </li>
            <li>and he said after his first use that his skin felt good.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, feels great, leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would say I love the strong fragrance and how well it lathers with my mesh sponge.</li>
            <li>And it washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue so we know for sure impurities are being washed off.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is mild yet nice.  </li>
            <li>It actually does a good job moisturizing--my skin looked and felt good--</li>
            <li>We now know that it isn’t good for your skin and that the tightness is actually where the soap took the “good” oils from the skin.</li>
            <li>I do not mind the smell although it is a bit strong but it kind of reminds me of clean laundry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh, almost kind of an ivory scent.</li>
            <li>it was so tiny it fit inside the palm of my hand , and I was still able to close my hand and make a fist !!!</li>
            <li>so clean &amp; refreshed!  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found something fragrance free in a bar form.</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also a hefty, solid bar that&#x27;s incredibly long-lasting.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it as well as the way it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I purchased two bars and hopefully this brand stays available online for many life times.</li>
            <li>I do primarily use this on my face, more than my body.</li>
            <li>A great natural soap for your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that it did leave my face squeaky clean to the touch and with a very light moisturized feeling.</li>
            <li>I have tried the mud soap &amp; liked it a lot, but WOW, I love this soap!</li>
            <li>It is very kind to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it.</li>
            <li>I only have good things to say about this soap!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that my skin continued to look bright and healthy for over 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent-almost non-existent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any complaints about Dove soap, but the Adovia soap seems to clean my face better.</li>
            <li>Very fresh, very clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>No residue,  clean refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so strong that I had a reaction - sneezing and itching - as soon as I started using it.</li>
            <li>As someone who can have some sensitivity to strong perfumes, this was a bit of a concern.</li>
            <li>When I opened the Amazon box, the scent was so strong it took my breath away.</li>
            <li>When I opened the soap package, it was equally as strong.</li>
            <li>(I even asked family members if they felt it was too strong.)</li>
            <li>If you have an aversion to strong scents, this is your warning.</li>
            <li>My husband shaves his head bald and many do not remember that the scalp is skin that needs special care as it secrets</li>
            <li>When I opened the box for the first time, the scent was strong, but I liked the scent.</li>
            <li>I have a dead sea salt mask I used before and was happy to be offered to try Adovia&#x27;s bar soap made with dead sea salt at a great discount and I am happily reporting back to say this is a very nice feeling on my aging skin!</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I used the soap on my babies too!</li>
            <li>Last night she told me that it is the best soap she ever tried and that she really loves it hopes I buy more of it.</li>
            <li>Good soap makes my skin very soft just wished it had a nice clean fresh smell there</li>
            <li>Pretty packaging, a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>It lathered fine, not a lot of suds.  </li>
            <li>This particular bar of soap has a strong, but good, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Okay ... At first I was thinking, &amp;#34;Yay!</li>
            <li>For me this is Huge.  </li>
            <li>To start, I am a huge fan of bar soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already a huge fan of adovia products and when I had the opportunity to review this item</li>
            <li>So, yes, this is fragrance free, however, there is still a smell to it.</li>
            <li>Overall we are all happy with these soaps.</li>
            <li>but I go it for free from Tomoson to test and review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth film on your skin for a while.</li>
            <li>This soap fit easily into the palm of my hand and glides over my skin creating a light, clean, fragrant lather.  </li>
            <li>Free soap.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Your fingers don&#x27;t slide over smooth, its a bumpy ride.</li>
            <li>and when I returned the whole bathroom smelled so nice.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t feel anything but smooth, supple skin after you wash with this.</li>
            <li>Not literally - they filled the order that I placed.</li>
            <li>In addition, it&#x27;s great for washing away make up residue that may have gotten left over by your makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>Before I could even open the packaging I was happy with the way that it smelled.</li>
            <li>An important ingredient in skin cell protection&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy soaps with salt in them.</li>
            <li>Adovia made a great product and I look forward to my daily showers</li>
            <li>It is indeed fragrant free.</li>
            <li>Feels just like cheap motel room soaps do to me on my skin and hands after you use it.</li>
            <li>and he liked it so much he had me buy one for him.  </li>
            <li>I am impressed with the Dead Shea Salt Soap.</li>
            <li>but if I can had it with Whitening material it will be fabulous</li>
            <li>Since it fits all skin types it will fit all the needs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fragrance free</li>
            <li>The company sent me a free sample to try</li>
            <li>I am very happy with your product, Dead Sea Salt Soap.  </li>
            <li>Because I only take baths, not showers, I also let the soap float in the tub, and it is working great.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin hydrated and fragrant free is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>The lather of this soap was fair for a natural soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair, sensitive skinned redhead.</li>
            <li>I bought three bars and will buy more since I have dry to normal skin-- great product!</li>
            <li>I am out in the drying sun often right now and am glad that I have a product that counteracts that dryness so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is fresh and clean smelling without being overwhelming or too girly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s stil good and does what It needs to giving you a clean and soft feeling experience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too drying, but really leaves your face feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The lather is so rich and smooth</li>
            <li>I received a free product to review for my blog, and I am never disappointed by Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After rinsing, just like on my face, the result was squeaky clean yet lightly</li>
            <li>After rinsing, just like on my face, the result was squeaky clean yet lightly</li>
            <li>Rich and lots of suds.  </li>

            <li>This product has a nice fragrance (strong as you open the box but mild and soothing when you use it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has a nice fragrance (strong as you open the box but mild and soothing when you use it in the shower).  </li>
            <li>I use this soap on my toddler because it is fragrance and chemical free and pure!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great price point for a 100% genuine dead sea salt soap</li>
            <li>, I love that it is natural and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has Dead Sea Minerals and salts that are really good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Not to mild and not to overpowering either.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to get to try out the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap.</li>
            <li>Dissolves rather quickly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too mild.</li>
            <li>This face/body bar is very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals , its very easy to work with and nose a excellent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>I know many people like this soap and even saw some videos where they used it directly on the face!!</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t like to have a nice soothing but not &#x27;too strong&#x27;  fragrance after use, you might not be as pleased with this product&amp;#34;; however, that seems absurd, who does not want smell nice and let the lather from this product soothe your skin?</li>
            <li>In general, I really liked this</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For budgetary reasons, I normally use some of the more popular drug store facial cleansers, but I&#x27;ve never really felt that they do a great job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li>With this soap my skin really felt clean, smooth and nourished after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall he liked it and said he would use it to clean his face and scalp daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had to order a second bar of soap, my daughter loved it so much I gave it to her!</li>
            <li>This soap has a mild fragrance, which I liked, but I wish it was little better in moisturizing.</li>
            <li>it has a very light, natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>scent is so pretty and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>It does clean very well,although it dries my skin like hell!</li>
            <li>The fragrance of the soap is quite refreshing, though a little more fragrance than I usually enjoy in my soap.</li>
            <li>My skin just LOVES this soap &amp; their amazing facial mask!</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Salt Soap feels great on my skin and lathers well.</li>
            <li>Because the product actually works and makes my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally use this kind of soap on my face, so I can&#x27;t attest to that at all, but I think it would work well.</li>
            <li>I cam across Adovia Mineral Skincare Moisturizing Soap Bar and decided it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>so I figured it was worth a try.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I have had the opportunity to try several products by Adovia and have liked them all.  </li>
            <li>This soap is a healthier soap with less-toxic ingredients than the others you buy at the store, so it is worth a shot.  </li>

            <li>I believe price should not be a option for healthy glowing natural skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adovia so far has surprised me with their all natural products by really giving me wonderful results!</li>
            <li>After using this soap one time, I noticed a difference in how soft my skin was, and how well I was able to retain the moisturizer that I applied afterward.</li>

            <li>Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap made my skin feel so soft, and very clean.</li>
            <li>skin is very clean and soft</li>
            <li>I first received Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap the very first thing that I did was check the fragrance.</li>
            <li>price point is right up my alley.</li>
            <li>Just the right</li>
            <li>so it picks up the right amount of product evenly.</li>
            <li>I find that most Adovia products are mild enough and do not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>Great - no more itchy skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its true because thanks to vitamin c serums I haven&#x27;t have that issue.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>These were remarkable products but not readily available in the USA.  </li>
            <li>I usually have oily to combo skin and this works great on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The soap has a strong, fresh, and clean fragrance that I could smell before I even had the box open!</li>
            <li>This product is a traditional soap, lathers well, goes on smooth and washes off fine.</li>
            <li>Certainly wished that I found this soap years ago!  </li>
            <li>Very mild soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The soap does not dry out my skin at all like most soaps do.</li>
            <li>I packed my bar into my suitcase for my recent beach vacation and it was such a great thing to do.</li>
            <li>Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial Cleanser</li>
            <li>Not just any bar soap that you can buy at the supermarket will do, it has to be one that has more natural ingredients and not too much perfume, like the bar from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have previously tried their Mud Soap which i loved using it.</li>
            <li>I love to use this with my Clarisonic because it distributes more evenly than a liquid or cream soap, All I do is dampen the brush dead and than turn it on the bar</li>
            <li>Adovia’s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I’d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love to use this on my legs after I shave so that not only are they clean, but they are also super soft.</li>
            <li>It was gentle enough for me to be comfortable using it on my face and the scent was light and fresh.</li>
            <li>soap does as promised and is very very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very gentle on the skin ..</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li>Feels very fresh and clean after using it to wash my face, and its not tight or dry, I love it</li>
            <li>great on my skin and is hard milled</li>
            <li>This soap is easy to use and really makes my skin feel soft and helps keep my skin hydrated!</li>
            <li>Adovia makes outstanding facial cleaning soaps that are all natural, free from fragrances &amp; leaves my face &amp; neck feeling so</li>
            <li>you can feel the diffrent from the first week.</li>
            <li>The bar is and off white color and has “ADOVIA” stamped on the top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now just under a week, and my skin is clearing up fast!</li>
            <li>It does seem to clean and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out your skin (but..by its very nature, it is going to remove things from the top layers of your skin-which may include oils and moisture to some degree).</li>
            <li>and the price is based on what you are willing to spend and how you use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;There is no residue left on the skin like many of the store bought soaps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would recommend this soap much more than regular bars of soap</li>
            <li>First the smell, because I always start with the smell.</li>
            <li>My face was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>For me it has really made a difference!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, I will admit.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the only con I can see with it</li>
            <li>and I feel like I smell pretty after I use it.</li>
            <li>Most likely.</li>
            <li>I was only able to use it the one time and had to remove it from our shower.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve noticed fewer shave-bumps since I started using this (which was the whole reason for getting it), but I docked a star because of the filmy feeling.</li>
            <li>let it set out before first use and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was kinda eery at first using a soap that has salt in it , and one that is for the face and body.</li>
            <li>Its important to take care of your body, and if that involves spending the money that is all natural for your body I am all in.</li>
            <li>I love this soap not just a regular bar soap.</li>
            <li>bar of soap arrived to my house from my Amazon order and I opened up the box to see a lovely blue colored bar of soap.</li>
            <li>Now it is soft smooth and</li>
            <li>healthy!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I really do like this product and the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and light.</li>
            <li>This soap has a think lather and leaves your skin soft and smooth, without any residue.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this soap!</li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>thanks !</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week and just love the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>Skin is extremely smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves face smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>I feel totally confident that my skin is being treated and norished without being stripped of my essential skin oils.</li>
            <li>how I loved testing out the Dead Sea Salt Soapfollow for this review.</li>
            <li>, even Cleopatra loved the benefits of the Dead Sea thousands of years ago.</li>
            <li>have been using this soap all over for a few weeks now, and I have nothing but good to say about it.</li>
            <li>I really loved this Dead Sea Salt Soap.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin feels very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Verdict: I HIGHLY recommend this soap to anyone who wants to experience a bar soap with nice fragrance that soothes your skin but feels nothing like a bar soap due to how smooth and soothing it lathers up on your skin.</li>
            <li>This hypoallergenic, natural, and fragrance-free soap was gentle on my skin and did not leave me feeling &amp;#34;dry.&amp;#34;  I would also like to try a version with a natural fragrance such as lavender.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice soap</li>
            <li>It feels soft, clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and clean after every use.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin appear soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Its a soft, and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>face felt soft and clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Most of the really moisturizing bar soaps I&#x27;ve tried have melted away quite easily, especially if left in damp places (like the shower).</li>
            <li>It has a great amount of natural salt from the Dead Sea in it.  </li>
            <li>I try to always start on the positive note before I bring in the yuck factor.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my Dead Sea Salt Soap.  </li>
            <li>when I first tried this soap I wasn’t expecting much.</li>
            <li>It has NO scent (which is fine by me) and it is not antibacterial, so I&#x27;d suggest a wash with your regular soap first then finish up with this for people without sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>Soap is seriously one of my most favorite luxury items.</li>
            <li>There are very few ingredients (a good thing in my opinion).</li>
            <li>I love this product, it feels so natural and the scent is great, although a little stronger than I prefer for my facial skin (I am sensitive to fragrances).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new golden treasure.</li>
            <li>But this stuff blows my normal brand right out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soap leaves skin feeling smooth, not dry..  </li>
            <li>This soap not only lathers well, but it does so easily.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Make the skin feel super soft just like you were at the beach.</li>
            <li>I have always been very particular when it comes to my skin care.</li>
            <li>I my skin tends to get more dry but with this product that di NOT happened.  </li>
            <li>It is unscented and has a mild, natural aroma to it.  </li>
            <li>I normally would not spend that much on a bar of soap, but this soap is definitely worth trying.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Thank you to Adovia Skin Care for allowing me to review their Dead Sea Salt Soap, I am so in love!</li>
            <li>most mothers, I can’t have a new product left in the shower without a child testing it out.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, very long lasting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly strong in this soap, so much so that it constantly fills the room with the scent, even when you aren&#x27;t using it.</li>
            <li>Love it works very well for dry skin</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to know personally how good it is, but I&#x27;ve heard only good things about this product so far (from family).</li>
            <li>I really loved sudsing up my washcloth with this bar of soap, the resulting suds were small, soft and had a very gentle fragrance.</li>
            <li>The texture of the bar of soap is unusual, in that it feels a little bit textured to the touch especially while washing with it, the bar is not shiny like most commercial bar soaps, the look and texture is like a good bar of homemade soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually makes your entire bathroom smell amazing for hours after your shower.</li>
            <li>Some soaps leave your face dry, this one leaves my face feeling fresh, clean and moisturized...</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.&lt;br /&gt;- Great Value and Benefits for A</li>
            <li>Fast forward to last month and her birthday and the thought struck me to look here to see what was available.  </li>
            <li>I like this soap because it cleans really well and seems to be helping with my acne.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>I absolutely would purchase this again, and purchase some for gifts.</li>
            <li>It cleanses gently and there&#x27;s no residue or over-drying.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily on my face and my pores are smaller and my skin looks healthier.  </li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s just as gentle (if not</li>
            <li>Gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get straight to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know how most soaps after you rinse them off, your skin feel rough?</li>
            <li>Thanks for stopping by xxDee</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing and lathers well.</li>
            <li>really easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone.</li>
            <li>The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone.</li>
            <li>It also gently exfoliates your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and rinses off without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li>Has really helped with my dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>This stuff actually makes my whole bathroom smell amazing even hours later!</li>
            <li>It lathers up very well too.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about reusing or recycling much, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it multiple times a day for nearly two weeks straight now, and you&#x27;d hardly be able to tell by looking at it -</li>
            <li>Thanks to that</li>
            <li>Since I always use both bar soap and a body wash every time I take a bath, I look for products which are gentle and wouldn&#x27;t make my skin drier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I have some lingering fragrance on my skin after each use, it isn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li>The soap didn&#x27;t lather as much, but that is given the fact that it lacks all those unnatural ingredients needed in order to get that result.  </li>
            <li>It has a very neutral scent.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that when I am using these products I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>No Irritating Affect To Report.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a smell to the soap at all</li>
            <li>now andmy skin has gotten much softer and subtle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this soap, so much.</li>
            <li>I washed my face gently with a wash.</li>
            <li>This soap is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Even the ones I don&#x27;t care about too much.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>Works very well for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I use them daily and enjoy all of the Adovia products that I have purchased over the years.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t find a con to this soap at all, I did notice a few pimples that popped up a day or so after use</li>
            <li>I have had several opportunities to use this soap and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>This does seem to be a little better than some of the others, but so far, I have not noticed too significant of a difference.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling very clean, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Something that I love because I really detest soaps that melt due to moisture and</li>
            <li>I reviewed this along with other Adovia products and of course I love them all.</li>
            <li>I also use the vitamin C and other products from this line and my skin does look better, reduced crepey skin, firmer skin.</li>
            <li>But if your skin is okay but usually oily, not too many zits, I don&#x27;t actually recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can definitely skip moisturizer on my face when I use it to wash away the day, and I don&#x27;t find my hands drying out nearly as much as they do with normal bar soaps - or even other good ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap left my skin feeling refreshed, hydrated, moisturized and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, though, it doesn&#x27;t linger much on the skin, so I don&#x27;t wind up smelling it all day long.</li>
            <li>My entire body feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea salt products are good in general.</li>
            <li>The scent also lingers a little on your skin (not a lot, but enough to be pleasant and make you feel</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, which is normally dry, but pretty easily moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have used this soap to quickly dry up bug bites, I use it in lieu of other types of soap to rub directly on a bug bite to immediately stop the itching, and the great part is the salt in the soap goes in and dries up the poison that is causing the itch.  </li>
            <li>You were able to put in skin softening ingredients without the harsh chemicals needed and clean and condition the skin at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth; however it also feels dry in some areas.</li>
            <li>I suggest you not use it as your main soap....</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth afterward, especially my face!</li>
            <li>I have tried several different products by Adovia and seriously love them all.</li>
            <li>It is a very decent sized bar of soap that will last most women a long time.</li>
            <li>This type of soap gets used up quickly and I simply cannot afford it.</li>
            <li>I liked Adovia Mineral Skincare Moisturizing Soap Bar very much and continue to use it everyday mainly as a facial soap.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Deeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry Skin</li>

            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box.</li>
            <li>Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This soap left my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I do appreciate that it is a gentle natural product, but it is not the holy grail for me.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my face and body as far as keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>the fact that it&#x27;s natural really makes it noteworthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap is very fragrant and it does leave your skin soft, while cleansing your skin.  </li>
            <li>Im glad that I have had a chance to try a few of the products from the Adovia line and can&#x27;t wait to try more from the Dead Sea Salt line.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, feels clean.</li>
            <li>my skin turn out very ashy and when I started using this soap my skin got that natural glow again.</li>
            <li>Seems like normal soap to me.</li>
            <li>I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia’s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even moisturize with lotion which I normally do.</li>
            <li>I normally will not use a bar soap.</li>
            <li>Sea Salt does contain a lot of minerals and the Dead Sea has been though to have many health and beauty benefits for ages</li>
            <li>My skin does feel a bit cleaner than normal and combined with a face exfoliator</li>
            <li>I really like that Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap leaves my skin feeling clean without leaving a residue like other soaps I tried before.</li>
            <li>As I have dry skin, I personally do not prefer to use soap because it makes my skin more drier.</li>
            <li>I find that after I have used the soap, I will have a slight scent left lingering on my skin, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I love how little packaging they have in comparison to liquid soaps, and I also love that what packaging they do have is usually a box which is biodegradable.</li>
            <li>I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed to purchase a new soap for washing my face because I was using something with sulfates and was still getting acne.  </li>
            <li>If a product doesn&#x27;t live up to what it says it will do, then I say so.</li>
            <li>It smell nice like regular soap and this soap last for a long time i guess because it still in my bathroom!</li>
            <li>It has a mild lather and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry after using it.</li>
            <li>This Dead Sea Salt Soap though was by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>My general preference isn&#x27;t usually bar soap but was kindly sent this soap to test out</li>
            <li>Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mineral Soap is by far the most luxurious soap I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Hence why body washes became so popular a few years back.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>My daughter and wife have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and somewhat plumped.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have sensitive skin or are having problems with bumpy skin or breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>First time I used it I got out the shower actually feeling exfoliated..</li>
            <li>Pricy, small, but okay.</li>
            <li>I normally use dove, because its soft too.</li>
            <li>but I love what it does for my skin, so I will be looking past that.</li>
            <li>I love trying different scents and brands and probably have enough body wash to last a lifetime</li>
            <li>I love this Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap!</li>
            <li>First let me start off by letting you know about some of the key factors of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t care much about it is the smell!</li>
            <li>I find that the price, when compared with similar products, is really reasonable!</li>
            <li>This is literally the first time she has ever commented on a specific shower</li>
            <li>The first time I used this soap, I could feel a difference, especially on my arms and shins.</li>
            <li>WOW ! .&lt;br</li>
            <li>My entire body definitely feels extremely clean</li>
            <li>that is how it feels after I dry my face - Ah!&lt;br /&gt;For those who say it dries out your skin, follow up with a good moisturizer - in fact, the company offers an entire skincare line that complement each other.</li>
            <li>This soap absolutely knocks the other soaps right out of the park!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.&lt;br /&gt;- Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial Cleanser</li>
            <li>works great,my skin feels smooth and doesnt feel like used soap with the typical residue&lt;br /&gt;received for discounted price for my review</li>
            <li>I use this soap with my hands on my face, it keeps my face feeling smooth however; I am not sure if it does much else after that but won&#x27;t be surprise if it has some underlying rejuvenation of skin going on.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this line of products to any woman that wants to keep their dry, or normal to dry skin clean, nourished and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin so am cautious about trying out new soaps, especially on my face, but I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>A soap infused with amazing 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for the sensitive of skins and yet balanced for the oiliest of skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft that my husband noticed, and asked me what was I using.</li>
            <li>Their skin felt so soft</li>
            <li>It is really soft.</li>
            <li>naturally I had picked at and irritated farther.&amp;#34; ONE USE and they were almost gone.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so much cleaner than the facial wash</li>
            <li>The company has a 100% 60 Day, money back guarantee, so you really have nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s gentle enough not to make my skin drier although I can&#x27;t skip the lotion afterwards (</li>
            <li>: Lathers well, rinses off without residue, skin left feeling moisturized the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>So, when I received this soap that is 100% natural with vitamins and minerals , I thought this is something for me.</li>
            <li>However my preferred, since my face is so very highly sensitive to fragrance, is to use it on my body.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the mineral soap.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t harsh and contains more natural ingredients than the slew of unreadable chemical names that you&#x27;ll find on the box of any cleanser at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>Also it leaves your skin feeling hydrate since its all natural</li>
            <li>It cleans without stripping natural oils, and it keeps me from being all stinky-</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this soap</li>
            <li>So Far It Is Working  </li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>By the second day I saw real results.</li>
            <li>I lather my standard shower scrubber with the bar soap, just as I would a liquid wash, and the lather is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not for my picky, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I had no issues at all with this.</li>
            <li>I like that this product is 100% all natural ingredients and is never tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t use bar soaps regularly, I didn&#x27;t really have a place to store this one when I finished with it.  </li>
            <li>My husband even commented on how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more Adovia Dead Sea products.</li>
            <li>I just received this bar of soap an only used it a few times, I love it  </li>
            <li>/it and my hands are pretty dry, they didn&#x27;t get moisturized.</li>
            <li>I feel it is definitely worth the price ($11) because it lasts so long you only have to splurge on it every now and then.&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin reaction, after the first use my skin started to feel hydrated and soft and absolutely NO</li>
            <li>This soap is big and it leaves your skin very soft!</li>
            <li>I do plan on purchasing again in the future and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this dead sea salt at a special price to test for quality and review, I was intrigued.  </li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable compared to other natural soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You feel clean but once you dry off you notice how dry your skin is.</li>
            <li>The soap bar is very large and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I will always buy this as long as the price stays reasonable.</li>
            <li>Many years ago my sister in law had gone to Israel and brought back several items made from the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this soap to rinse squeaky clean - it leaves a slight film of something softening on your skin that soaks right in as soon as it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lather was smooth, not rich enough for me, so it could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>its gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>Today we are lucky as products come out with Dead Sea Salts in them</li>
            <li>I am also very interested in the fact that they use minerals and salt from the Dead Sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By luxury item, I mean something on which I’m willing to spend a little bit more money.</li>
            <li>If you’ve been following me for a while, you know that I have loved Dead Sea Salt products that I have used in the past, well this product is no different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap for any one that has dry, sensitive, or normal skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap lasts for a decent amount of time depending on how you use it; it is a bar soap so it lasts just as long as one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to say anything bad about this product - I absolutely love it, the price is reasonable, and I&#x27;m definitely prepared to order more!</li>
            <li>There are several key things that I look for when it comes to trying a new soap or body wash: scent, lather, how easily it washes off the skin, how my skin feels afterwards (including if my skin feels moisturized or dried out), if I can use it on my face/shave with it and how long the soap lasts.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling smooth and exfoliated with out scratching or itchyness left over from harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>the logo has barely worn smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is left feeling soft and no worries about it leaving a film on my skin.</li>
            <li>What I hadn’t realized is that my 8 year old daughter was using the soap daily too.</li>
            <li>All you have left is a soft, cleansed, and hydrated face.</li>
            <li>for this Price the soap should be human Adult size for the amount of money they are asking for.</li>
            <li>After cleansing my face with it, I noticed that it took several splashes of water to feel like it was completely removed.  </li>
            <li>especially if you live with multiple people. </li>
            <li>The soap moisturizes very well with this dry season approaching.</li>
            <li>Once the soap is open and out of the box the scent becomes less powerful, but still lingers.</li>
            <li>I have seen shea butter soaps that are better for half the price plus the bar design is so plain you would think you bought this from the grocery store</li>
            <li>Thank you again!loved sudsing up my washcloth with this bar of soap, the resulting suds were small, soft and had a very gentle fragrance.</li>
            <li>I open the box to try it in the shower and the smell of it is very gentle and softly perfume-like but not strong.  </li>
            <li>With this Soap, I find that their claims are not only believable but that is has helped to settle down some of my skin problems, yes my recent flare has my rash back on some of my body and my face right now, however the Dead Sea Salt has seemed to settle down the Lupus skin flare up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought the smell was a little overpowering when I first removed it from the box, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering as you use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended especially for the colder months when your skin might dry out the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>normally don&#x27;t rave on about products that I receive to review quite so much, as I am always afraid people will think I am only doing so because I got it free.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new cleanser for a very long time that didn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to break out or dry out.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft, supple and hydrated all day long even on my face under my makeup.</li>
            <li>I have an extreme sensitivity to almost anything that goes on my skin, but I am also recovering from a total thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer and my skin is even more of a mess than normal, and extremely dry.  </li>
            <li>Usually have issues with dry skin itch in colder months and this helped significantly.  </li>
            <li>It will not dry your skin as a traditional bar would.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers quickly and thick.</li>
            <li>Compared to other bar soaps I’ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don’t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have recently shared reviews of other products from this particular brand.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that goes back and forth from dry to oily.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin SO SOFT that my husband and kids noticed i was doing something new without me saying a word about starting  Dead Sea Salt Soap.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and live in a dry climate.</li>

            <li> Has a pleasant smell and not to girly smelling so guys can use it to.</li>
            <li> Seems to moisturize good.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin and feeling good in my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly good size but at $11 a bar</li>
            <li> It did a good job cleaning and hydrating my legs and arms</li>
            <li> /&gt;However this soap was really surprising.  </li>
            <li> I just loved it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good bar of soap for me.</li>

            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t damaged which is good.</li>
            <li> excellent clean fragrance</li>
            <li> The soap is full of great ingredients!</li>
            <li> (however, in colder months, my skin gets exceptionally dry--I probably would need additional moisturizing).</li>
            <li> I find that it works best when rubbed onto a loofah, when it gets super lathery and bubbly</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this soap.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this soap</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going in expecting to be pleased, and I was overwhelmed!</li>
            <li> and I really do love it!</li>
            <li> This product is everything it claims to be and more!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even run out and I&#x27;ve already ordered more!</li>
            <li> The fact that the soap has a beautiful scent is just fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this soap!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, luxurious, and feels amazing.</li>

            <li> The soap smells amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like...</li>
            <li> But this lathers well and feels nice while that&#x27;s going on.</li>
            <li> It really is a nice soap.</li>
            <li> and I will have buying again because my daughters need their own.</li>
            <li> and yes, this is my honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> , it lathers on nice and rinses off completely.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The best way I can describe the scent is to say that it smells really &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> And, even after I use it in the shower, there is still a nice lingering fragrance on my skin after each use.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample from the manufacturer for testing purposes, however, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin smelling nice even after I rinse it off.</li>
            <li> The kind you cant even find in stores anymore</li>
            <li> I am really loving how my skin is looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> It has a nice silkie feel as I soap up and leaves my face so nice.</li>
            <li> Still, there are no adverse side effects and it smells nice and cleans well</li>
            <li> The recipient has used this product before and was thrilled to receive it.</li>
            <li> I always shower with warm water and winter</li>
            <li> Also I felt more relaxed after showering and I loved it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please if their is another kind of this product with Whitening just informed me&lt;br</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to write the best review ever, I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like to use mine with a loofah and create a nice lather that way.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of products from this company and have really liked all of them.</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own .</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very clean!</li>
            <li> It smells great and rinses clean with no film or residue.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free in exchange to test and review the product with my honest opinion!</li>
            <li> Very good, and really does moisturize.  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, can&#x27;t use any product with scent--this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I throughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone seeking a nourishing and effective soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m wondering why I paid 18 dollars for a bar of soap with mostly palm oil in it.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels.</li>
            <li> easily does it wash off the skin- Very easily.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and squeaky clean!!!!</li>
            <li> The packaging is very nice, and I was really looking forward to my nighttime pampering routine.</li>
            <li> this soap was sent to me to try out, I was very excited.  </li>

            <li> It rinses off easily and left my skin with a delightful, healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable.</li>
            <li> This soap gives my skin a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I could feel the mositure and my face felt very clean.  </li>
            <li> and he said after his first use that his skin felt good.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, feels great, leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would say I love the strong fragrance and how well it lathers with my mesh sponge.</li>
            <li> And it washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue so we know for sure impurities are being washed off.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is mild yet nice.  </li>
            <li> It actually does a good job moisturizing--my skin looked and felt good--</li>
            <li> We now know that it isn’t good for your skin and that the tightness is actually where the soap took the “good” oils from the skin.</li>
            <li> I do not mind the smell although it is a bit strong but it kind of reminds me of clean laundry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh, almost kind of an ivory scent.</li>
            <li> it was so tiny it fit inside the palm of my hand , and I was still able to close my hand and make a fist !!!</li>
            <li> so clean &amp; refreshed!  </li>
            <li> I am glad I found something fragrance free in a bar form.</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a hefty, solid bar that&#x27;s incredibly long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it as well as the way it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I purchased two bars and hopefully this brand stays available online for many life times.</li>
            <li> I do primarily use this on my face, more than my body.</li>
            <li> A great natural soap for your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that it did leave my face squeaky clean to the touch and with a very light moisturized feeling.</li>
            <li> I have tried the mud soap &amp; liked it a lot, but WOW, I love this soap!</li>
            <li> It is very kind to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it.</li>
            <li> I only have good things to say about this soap!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that my skin continued to look bright and healthy for over 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent-almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints about Dove soap, but the Adovia soap seems to clean my face better.</li>
            <li> Very fresh, very clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> No residue,  clean refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so strong that I had a reaction - sneezing and itching - as soon as I started using it.</li>
            <li> As someone who can have some sensitivity to strong perfumes, this was a bit of a concern.</li>
            <li> When I opened the Amazon box, the scent was so strong it took my breath away.</li>
            <li> When I opened the soap package, it was equally as strong.</li>
            <li> (I even asked family members if they felt it was too strong.)</li>
            <li> If you have an aversion to strong scents, this is your warning.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head bald and many do not remember that the scalp is skin that needs special care as it secrets</li>
            <li> When I opened the box for the first time, the scent was strong, but I liked the scent.</li>
            <li> I have a dead sea salt mask I used before and was happy to be offered to try Adovia&#x27;s bar soap made with dead sea salt at a great discount and I am happily reporting back to say this is a very nice feeling on my aging skin!</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I used the soap on my babies too!</li>
            <li> Last night she told me that it is the best soap she ever tried and that she really loves it hopes I buy more of it.</li>
            <li> Good soap makes my skin very soft just wished it had a nice clean fresh smell there</li>
            <li> Pretty packaging, a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> It lathered fine, not a lot of suds.  </li>
            <li> This particular bar of soap has a strong, but good, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Okay ... At first I was thinking, &amp;#34;Yay!</li>
            <li> For me this is Huge.  </li>
            <li> To start, I am a huge fan of bar soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a huge fan of adovia products and when I had the opportunity to review this item</li>
            <li> So, yes, this is fragrance free, however, there is still a smell to it.</li>
            <li> Overall we are all happy with these soaps.</li>
            <li> but I go it for free from Tomoson to test and review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth film on your skin for a while.</li>
            <li> This soap fit easily into the palm of my hand and glides over my skin creating a light, clean, fragrant lather.  </li>
            <li> Free soap.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Your fingers don&#x27;t slide over smooth, its a bumpy ride.</li>
            <li> and when I returned the whole bathroom smelled so nice.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t feel anything but smooth, supple skin after you wash with this.</li>
            <li> Not literally - they filled the order that I placed.</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s great for washing away make up residue that may have gotten left over by your makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> Before I could even open the packaging I was happy with the way that it smelled.</li>
            <li> An important ingredient in skin cell protection&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy soaps with salt in them.</li>
            <li> Adovia made a great product and I look forward to my daily showers</li>
            <li> It is indeed fragrant free.</li>
            <li> Feels just like cheap motel room soaps do to me on my skin and hands after you use it.</li>
            <li> and he liked it so much he had me buy one for him.  </li>
            <li> I am impressed with the Dead Shea Salt Soap.</li>
            <li> but if I can had it with Whitening material it will be fabulous</li>
            <li> Since it fits all skin types it will fit all the needs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fragrance free</li>
            <li> The company sent me a free sample to try</li>
            <li> I am very happy with your product, Dead Sea Salt Soap.  </li>
            <li> Because I only take baths, not showers, I also let the soap float in the tub, and it is working great.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin hydrated and fragrant free is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> The lather of this soap was fair for a natural soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair, sensitive skinned redhead.</li>
            <li> I bought three bars and will buy more since I have dry to normal skin-- great product!</li>
            <li> I am out in the drying sun often right now and am glad that I have a product that counteracts that dryness so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is fresh and clean smelling without being overwhelming or too girly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s stil good and does what It needs to giving you a clean and soft feeling experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too drying, but really leaves your face feeling nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The lather is so rich and smooth</li>
            <li> I received a free product to review for my blog, and I am never disappointed by Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After rinsing, just like on my face, the result was squeaky clean yet lightly</li>
            <li> After rinsing, just like on my face, the result was squeaky clean yet lightly</li>

            <li> This product has a nice fragrance (strong as you open the box but mild and soothing when you use it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has a nice fragrance (strong as you open the box but mild and soothing when you use it in the shower).  </li>
            <li> I use this soap on my toddler because it is fragrance and chemical free and pure!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great price point for a 100% genuine dead sea salt soap</li>
            <li> , I love that it is natural and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has Dead Sea Minerals and salts that are really good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Not to mild and not to overpowering either.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to get to try out the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap.</li>
            <li> Dissolves rather quickly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too mild.</li>
            <li> This face/body bar is very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals , its very easy to work with and nose a excellent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I know many people like this soap and even saw some videos where they used it directly on the face!!</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t like to have a nice soothing but not &#x27;too strong&#x27;  fragrance after use, you might not be as pleased with this product&amp;#34;; however, that seems absurd, who does not want smell nice and let the lather from this product soothe your skin?</li>
            <li> In general, I really liked this</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For budgetary reasons, I normally use some of the more popular drug store facial cleansers, but I&#x27;ve never really felt that they do a great job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> With this soap my skin really felt clean, smooth and nourished after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall he liked it and said he would use it to clean his face and scalp daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had to order a second bar of soap, my daughter loved it so much I gave it to her!</li>
            <li> This soap has a mild fragrance, which I liked, but I wish it was little better in moisturizing.</li>
            <li> it has a very light, natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> scent is so pretty and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> It does clean very well,although it dries my skin like hell!</li>
            <li> The fragrance of the soap is quite refreshing, though a little more fragrance than I usually enjoy in my soap.</li>
            <li> My skin just LOVES this soap &amp; their amazing facial mask!</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt Soap feels great on my skin and lathers well.</li>
            <li> Because the product actually works and makes my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally use this kind of soap on my face, so I can&#x27;t attest to that at all, but I think it would work well.</li>
            <li> I cam across Adovia Mineral Skincare Moisturizing Soap Bar and decided it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li> so I figured it was worth a try.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I do, however, feel that it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have had the opportunity to try several products by Adovia and have liked them all.  </li>
            <li> This soap is a healthier soap with less-toxic ingredients than the others you buy at the store, so it is worth a shot.  </li>

            <li> Even with a price of over 10 dollars I think its worth the shot to find a soap to work with.</li>
            <li> I believe price should not be a option for healthy glowing natural skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adovia so far has surprised me with their all natural products by really giving me wonderful results!</li>
            <li> After using this soap one time, I noticed a difference in how soft my skin was, and how well I was able to retain the moisturizer that I applied afterward.</li>

            <li> The areas with the rough patches at my knees and elbows were smooth and nice again.  </li>
            <li> Lathers nicely, is totally fragrance free (love that).  </li>
            <li> I try to always be open and kind with all my reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth trying.</li>

            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft, clean, hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap has a very nice, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the way the soap smells but because of all of the other good things about it, I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap made my skin feel so soft, and very clean.</li>
            <li> skin is very clean and soft</li>
            <li> I first received Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap the very first thing that I did was check the fragrance.</li>
            <li> price point is right up my alley.</li>
            <li> Just the right</li>
            <li> so it picks up the right amount of product evenly.</li>
            <li> I find that most Adovia products are mild enough and do not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Great - no more itchy skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its true because thanks to vitamin c serums I haven&#x27;t have that issue.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> These were remarkable products but not readily available in the USA.  </li>
            <li> I usually have oily to combo skin and this works great on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The soap has a strong, fresh, and clean fragrance that I could smell before I even had the box open!</li>
            <li> This product is a traditional soap, lathers well, goes on smooth and washes off fine.</li>
            <li> Certainly wished that I found this soap years ago!  </li>
            <li> Very mild soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The soap does not dry out my skin at all like most soaps do.</li>
            <li> I packed my bar into my suitcase for my recent beach vacation and it was such a great thing to do.</li>
            <li> Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial Cleanser</li>
            <li> Not just any bar soap that you can buy at the supermarket will do, it has to be one that has more natural ingredients and not too much perfume, like the bar from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have previously tried their Mud Soap which i loved using it.</li>
            <li> I love to use this with my Clarisonic because it distributes more evenly than a liquid or cream soap, All I do is dampen the brush dead and than turn it on the bar</li>
            <li> Adovia’s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I’d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love to use this on my legs after I shave so that not only are they clean, but they are also super soft.</li>
            <li> It was gentle enough for me to be comfortable using it on my face and the scent was light and fresh.</li>
            <li> soap does as promised and is very very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very gentle on the skin ..</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> Feels very fresh and clean after using it to wash my face, and its not tight or dry, I love it</li>
            <li> great on my skin and is hard milled</li>
            <li> This soap is easy to use and really makes my skin feel soft and helps keep my skin hydrated!</li>
            <li> Adovia makes outstanding facial cleaning soaps that are all natural, free from fragrances &amp; leaves my face &amp; neck feeling so</li>
            <li> you can feel the diffrent from the first week.</li>
            <li> The bar is and off white color and has “ADOVIA” stamped on the top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now just under a week, and my skin is clearing up fast!</li>
            <li> It does seem to clean and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out your skin (but..by its very nature, it is going to remove things from the top layers of your skin-which may include oils and moisture to some degree).</li>
            <li> and the price is based on what you are willing to spend and how you use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;There is no residue left on the skin like many of the store bought soaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would recommend this soap much more than regular bars of soap</li>
            <li> First the smell, because I always start with the smell.</li>
            <li> My face was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> For me it has really made a difference!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, I will admit.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the only con I can see with it</li>
            <li> and I feel like I smell pretty after I use it.</li>
            <li> Most likely.</li>
            <li> I was only able to use it the one time and had to remove it from our shower.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve noticed fewer shave-bumps since I started using this (which was the whole reason for getting it), but I docked a star because of the filmy feeling.</li>
            <li> let it set out before first use and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was kinda eery at first using a soap that has salt in it , and one that is for the face and body.</li>
            <li> Its important to take care of your body, and if that involves spending the money that is all natural for your body I am all in.</li>
            <li> I love this soap not just a regular bar soap.</li>
            <li> bar of soap arrived to my house from my Amazon order and I opened up the box to see a lovely blue colored bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Now it is soft smooth and</li>
            <li> healthy!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I really do like this product and the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and light.</li>
            <li> This soap has a think lather and leaves your skin soft and smooth, without any residue.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this soap!</li>
            <li> It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> thanks !</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week and just love the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> Skin is extremely smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Leaves face smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> I feel totally confident that my skin is being treated and norished without being stripped of my essential skin oils.</li>
            <li> how I loved testing out the Dead Sea Salt Soapfollow for this review.</li>
            <li> , even Cleopatra loved the benefits of the Dead Sea thousands of years ago.</li>
            <li> have been using this soap all over for a few weeks now, and I have nothing but good to say about it.</li>
            <li> I really loved this Dead Sea Salt Soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin feels very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Verdict: I HIGHLY recommend this soap to anyone who wants to experience a bar soap with nice fragrance that soothes your skin but feels nothing like a bar soap due to how smooth and soothing it lathers up on your skin.</li>
            <li> This hypoallergenic, natural, and fragrance-free soap was gentle on my skin and did not leave me feeling &amp;#34;dry.&amp;#34;  I would also like to try a version with a natural fragrance such as lavender.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice soap</li>
            <li> It feels soft, clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and clean after every use.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin appear soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Its a soft, and clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> face felt soft and clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Most of the really moisturizing bar soaps I&#x27;ve tried have melted away quite easily, especially if left in damp places (like the shower).</li>
            <li> It has a great amount of natural salt from the Dead Sea in it.  </li>
            <li> I try to always start on the positive note before I bring in the yuck factor.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Dead Sea Salt Soap.  </li>
            <li> when I first tried this soap I wasn’t expecting much.</li>
            <li> It has NO scent (which is fine by me) and it is not antibacterial, so I&#x27;d suggest a wash with your regular soap first then finish up with this for people without sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> Soap is seriously one of my most favorite luxury items.</li>
            <li> There are very few ingredients (a good thing in my opinion).</li>
            <li> I love this product, it feels so natural and the scent is great, although a little stronger than I prefer for my facial skin (I am sensitive to fragrances).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my new golden treasure.</li>
            <li> But this stuff blows my normal brand right out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soap leaves skin feeling smooth, not dry..  </li>
            <li> This soap not only lathers well, but it does so easily.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Make the skin feel super soft just like you were at the beach.</li>
            <li> I have always been very particular when it comes to my skin care.</li>
            <li> I my skin tends to get more dry but with this product that di NOT happened.  </li>
            <li> It is unscented and has a mild, natural aroma to it.  </li>
            <li> I normally would not spend that much on a bar of soap, but this soap is definitely worth trying.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Thank you to Adovia Skin Care for allowing me to review their Dead Sea Salt Soap, I am so in love!</li>
            <li> most mothers, I can’t have a new product left in the shower without a child testing it out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, very long lasting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly strong in this soap, so much so that it constantly fills the room with the scent, even when you aren&#x27;t using it.</li>
            <li> Love it works very well for dry skin</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to know personally how good it is, but I&#x27;ve heard only good things about this product so far (from family).</li>
            <li> I really loved sudsing up my washcloth with this bar of soap, the resulting suds were small, soft and had a very gentle fragrance.</li>
            <li> The texture of the bar of soap is unusual, in that it feels a little bit textured to the touch especially while washing with it, the bar is not shiny like most commercial bar soaps, the look and texture is like a good bar of homemade soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually makes your entire bathroom smell amazing for hours after your shower.</li>
            <li> Some soaps leave your face dry, this one leaves my face feeling fresh, clean and moisturized...</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.&lt;br /&gt;- Great Value and Benefits for A</li>
            <li> Fast forward to last month and her birthday and the thought struck me to look here to see what was available.  </li>
            <li> I like this soap because it cleans really well and seems to be helping with my acne.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> I absolutely would purchase this again, and purchase some for gifts.</li>
            <li> It cleanses gently and there&#x27;s no residue or over-drying.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily on my face and my pores are smaller and my skin looks healthier.  </li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s just as gentle (if not</li>
            <li> Gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get straight to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know how most soaps after you rinse them off, your skin feel rough?</li>
            <li> Thanks for stopping by xxDee</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing and lathers well.</li>
            <li> really easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone.</li>
            <li> The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone.</li>
            <li> It also gently exfoliates your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and rinses off without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li> Has really helped with my dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> This stuff actually makes my whole bathroom smell amazing even hours later!</li>
            <li> It lathers up very well too.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about reusing or recycling much, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it multiple times a day for nearly two weeks straight now, and you&#x27;d hardly be able to tell by looking at it -</li>
            <li> Thanks to that</li>
            <li> Since I always use both bar soap and a body wash every time I take a bath, I look for products which are gentle and wouldn&#x27;t make my skin drier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I have some lingering fragrance on my skin after each use, it isn&#x27;t very noticeable.</li>
            <li> The soap didn&#x27;t lather as much, but that is given the fact that it lacks all those unnatural ingredients needed in order to get that result.  </li>
            <li> It has a very neutral scent.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that when I am using these products I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> No Irritating Affect To Report.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a smell to the soap at all</li>
            <li> now andmy skin has gotten much softer and subtle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this soap, so much.</li>
            <li> I washed my face gently with a wash.</li>
            <li> This soap is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Even the ones I don&#x27;t care about too much.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> Works very well for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I use them daily and enjoy all of the Adovia products that I have purchased over the years.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t find a con to this soap at all, I did notice a few pimples that popped up a day or so after use</li>
            <li> I have had several opportunities to use this soap and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> This does seem to be a little better than some of the others, but so far, I have not noticed too significant of a difference.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling very clean, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Something that I love because I really detest soaps that melt due to moisture and</li>
            <li> I reviewed this along with other Adovia products and of course I love them all.</li>
            <li> I also use the vitamin C and other products from this line and my skin does look better, reduced crepey skin, firmer skin.</li>
            <li> But if your skin is okay but usually oily, not too many zits, I don&#x27;t actually recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can definitely skip moisturizer on my face when I use it to wash away the day, and I don&#x27;t find my hands drying out nearly as much as they do with normal bar soaps - or even other good ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap left my skin feeling refreshed, hydrated, moisturized and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, though, it doesn&#x27;t linger much on the skin, so I don&#x27;t wind up smelling it all day long.</li>
            <li> My entire body feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea salt products are good in general.</li>
            <li> The scent also lingers a little on your skin (not a lot, but enough to be pleasant and make you feel</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, which is normally dry, but pretty easily moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have used this soap to quickly dry up bug bites, I use it in lieu of other types of soap to rub directly on a bug bite to immediately stop the itching, and the great part is the salt in the soap goes in and dries up the poison that is causing the itch.  </li>
            <li> You were able to put in skin softening ingredients without the harsh chemicals needed and clean and condition the skin at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth; however it also feels dry in some areas.</li>
            <li> I suggest you not use it as your main soap....</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth afterward, especially my face!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products by Adovia and seriously love them all.</li>
            <li> It is a very decent sized bar of soap that will last most women a long time.</li>
            <li> This type of soap gets used up quickly and I simply cannot afford it.</li>
            <li> I liked Adovia Mineral Skincare Moisturizing Soap Bar very much and continue to use it everyday mainly as a facial soap.</li>

            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box.</li>
            <li> Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This soap left my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate that it is a gentle natural product, but it is not the holy grail for me.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my face and body as far as keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> the fact that it&#x27;s natural really makes it noteworthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap is very fragrant and it does leave your skin soft, while cleansing your skin.  </li>
            <li> Im glad that I have had a chance to try a few of the products from the Adovia line and can&#x27;t wait to try more from the Dead Sea Salt line.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, feels clean.</li>
            <li> my skin turn out very ashy and when I started using this soap my skin got that natural glow again.</li>
            <li> Seems like normal soap to me.</li>
            <li> I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia’s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even moisturize with lotion which I normally do.</li>
            <li> I normally will not use a bar soap.</li>
            <li> Sea Salt does contain a lot of minerals and the Dead Sea has been though to have many health and beauty benefits for ages</li>
            <li> My skin does feel a bit cleaner than normal and combined with a face exfoliator</li>
            <li> I really like that Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap leaves my skin feeling clean without leaving a residue like other soaps I tried before.</li>
            <li> As I have dry skin, I personally do not prefer to use soap because it makes my skin more drier.</li>
            <li> I find that after I have used the soap, I will have a slight scent left lingering on my skin, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I love how little packaging they have in comparison to liquid soaps, and I also love that what packaging they do have is usually a box which is biodegradable.</li>
            <li> I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed to purchase a new soap for washing my face because I was using something with sulfates and was still getting acne.  </li>
            <li> If a product doesn&#x27;t live up to what it says it will do, then I say so.</li>
            <li> It smell nice like regular soap and this soap last for a long time i guess because it still in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> It has a mild lather and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry after using it.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Salt Soap though was by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> My general preference isn&#x27;t usually bar soap but was kindly sent this soap to test out</li>
            <li> Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mineral Soap is by far the most luxurious soap I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Hence why body washes became so popular a few years back.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter and wife have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and somewhat plumped.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have sensitive skin or are having problems with bumpy skin or breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> First time I used it I got out the shower actually feeling exfoliated..</li>
            <li> Pricy, small, but okay.</li>
            <li> I normally use dove, because its soft too.</li>
            <li> but I love what it does for my skin, so I will be looking past that.</li>
            <li> I love trying different scents and brands and probably have enough body wash to last a lifetime</li>
            <li> I love this Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap!</li>
            <li> First let me start off by letting you know about some of the key factors of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t care much about it is the smell!</li>
            <li> I find that the price, when compared with similar products, is really reasonable!</li>
            <li> This is literally the first time she has ever commented on a specific shower</li>
            <li> The first time I used this soap, I could feel a difference, especially on my arms and shins.</li>
            <li> WOW ! .&lt;br</li>
            <li> My entire body definitely feels extremely clean</li>
            <li> that is how it feels after I dry my face - Ah!&lt;br /&gt;For those who say it dries out your skin, follow up with a good moisturizer - in fact, the company offers an entire skincare line that complement each other.</li>
            <li> This soap absolutely knocks the other soaps right out of the park!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.&lt;br /&gt;- Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial Cleanser</li>
            <li> works great,my skin feels smooth and doesnt feel like used soap with the typical residue&lt;br /&gt;received for discounted price for my review</li>
            <li> I use this soap with my hands on my face, it keeps my face feeling smooth however; I am not sure if it does much else after that but won&#x27;t be surprise if it has some underlying rejuvenation of skin going on.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this line of products to any woman that wants to keep their dry, or normal to dry skin clean, nourished and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so am cautious about trying out new soaps, especially on my face, but I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> A soap infused with amazing 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for the sensitive of skins and yet balanced for the oiliest of skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft that my husband noticed, and asked me what was I using.</li>
            <li> Their skin felt so soft</li>
            <li> It is really soft.</li>
            <li> naturally I had picked at and irritated farther.&amp;#34; ONE USE and they were almost gone.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so much cleaner than the facial wash</li>
            <li> The company has a 100% 60 Day, money back guarantee, so you really have nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s gentle enough not to make my skin drier although I can&#x27;t skip the lotion afterwards (</li>
            <li> : Lathers well, rinses off without residue, skin left feeling moisturized the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> So, when I received this soap that is 100% natural with vitamins and minerals , I thought this is something for me.</li>
            <li> However my preferred, since my face is so very highly sensitive to fragrance, is to use it on my body.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the mineral soap.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh and contains more natural ingredients than the slew of unreadable chemical names that you&#x27;ll find on the box of any cleanser at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> Also it leaves your skin feeling hydrate since its all natural</li>
            <li> It cleans without stripping natural oils, and it keeps me from being all stinky-</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this soap</li>
            <li> So Far It Is Working  </li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> By the second day I saw real results.</li>
            <li> I lather my standard shower scrubber with the bar soap, just as I would a liquid wash, and the lather is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not for my picky, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I had no issues at all with this.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is 100% all natural ingredients and is never tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t use bar soaps regularly, I didn&#x27;t really have a place to store this one when I finished with it.  </li>
            <li> My husband even commented on how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more Adovia Dead Sea products.</li>
            <li> I just received this bar of soap an only used it a few times, I love it  </li>
            <li> /it and my hands are pretty dry, they didn&#x27;t get moisturized.</li>
            <li> I feel it is definitely worth the price ($11) because it lasts so long you only have to splurge on it every now and then.&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin reaction, after the first use my skin started to feel hydrated and soft and absolutely NO</li>
            <li> This soap is big and it leaves your skin very soft!</li>
            <li> I do plan on purchasing again in the future and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this dead sea salt at a special price to test for quality and review, I was intrigued.  </li>
            <li> The price is also very reasonable compared to other natural soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You feel clean but once you dry off you notice how dry your skin is.</li>
            <li> The soap bar is very large and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I will always buy this as long as the price stays reasonable.</li>
            <li> Many years ago my sister in law had gone to Israel and brought back several items made from the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this soap to rinse squeaky clean - it leaves a slight film of something softening on your skin that soaks right in as soon as it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lather was smooth, not rich enough for me, so it could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> its gentle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li> Today we are lucky as products come out with Dead Sea Salts in them</li>
            <li> I am also very interested in the fact that they use minerals and salt from the Dead Sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By luxury item, I mean something on which I’m willing to spend a little bit more money.</li>
            <li> If you’ve been following me for a while, you know that I have loved Dead Sea Salt products that I have used in the past, well this product is no different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recommend Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap for any one that has dry, sensitive, or normal skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap lasts for a decent amount of time depending on how you use it; it is a bar soap so it lasts just as long as one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to say anything bad about this product - I absolutely love it, the price is reasonable, and I&#x27;m definitely prepared to order more!</li>
            <li> There are several key things that I look for when it comes to trying a new soap or body wash: scent, lather, how easily it washes off the skin, how my skin feels afterwards (including if my skin feels moisturized or dried out), if I can use it on my face/shave with it and how long the soap lasts.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling smooth and exfoliated with out scratching or itchyness left over from harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> the logo has barely worn smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is left feeling soft and no worries about it leaving a film on my skin.</li>
            <li> What I hadn’t realized is that my 8 year old daughter was using the soap daily too.</li>
            <li> All you have left is a soft, cleansed, and hydrated face.</li>
            <li> for this Price the soap should be human Adult size for the amount of money they are asking for.</li>
            <li> After cleansing my face with it, I noticed that it took several splashes of water to feel like it was completely removed.  </li>
            <li> especially if you live with multiple people. </li>
            <li> The soap moisturizes very well with this dry season approaching.</li>
            <li> Once the soap is open and out of the box the scent becomes less powerful, but still lingers.</li>
            <li> I have seen shea butter soaps that are better for half the price plus the bar design is so plain you would think you bought this from the grocery store</li>
            <li> Thank you again!loved sudsing up my washcloth with this bar of soap, the resulting suds were small, soft and had a very gentle fragrance.</li>
            <li> I open the box to try it in the shower and the smell of it is very gentle and softly perfume-like but not strong.  </li>
            <li> With this Soap, I find that their claims are not only believable but that is has helped to settle down some of my skin problems, yes my recent flare has my rash back on some of my body and my face right now, however the Dead Sea Salt has seemed to settle down the Lupus skin flare up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was a little overpowering when I first removed it from the box, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering as you use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended especially for the colder months when your skin might dry out the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> normally don&#x27;t rave on about products that I receive to review quite so much, as I am always afraid people will think I am only doing so because I got it free.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new cleanser for a very long time that didn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to break out or dry out.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft, supple and hydrated all day long even on my face under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have an extreme sensitivity to almost anything that goes on my skin, but I am also recovering from a total thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer and my skin is even more of a mess than normal, and extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> Usually have issues with dry skin itch in colder months and this helped significantly.  </li>
            <li> It will not dry your skin as a traditional bar would.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers quickly and thick.</li>
            <li> Compared to other bar soaps I’ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don’t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have recently shared reviews of other products from this particular brand.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that goes back and forth from dry to oily.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin SO SOFT that my husband and kids noticed i was doing something new without me saying a word about starting  Dead Sea Salt Soap.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> oils(that normally slide down the hair shaft).</li>
            <li> After using in once, I noticed the skin on my face wasn’t tight feeling like it is when I use my normal soap.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get the tight skin feeling that you normal have after using soap on your face or body.  </li>
            <li> Soap has not only always dried my skin out but down right irratates it(especially in the winter).  </li>
            <li> I really do like this soap and it seems soothing (I have dry skin and a little psoriasis).  </li>
            <li> I was a tiny bit worried that after using regularly my skin might finally start to dry out, but nope!</li>
            <li> so it last a long time</li>
            <li> long does the soap last-</li>
            <li> It appears that this Adovia Mineral Soap will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It appears that this Adovia Mineral Soap will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually like that because when I use it directly on my legs just for washing it fells like I am exfoliating a little too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’ve used liquid face soap religiously for the past 10 years, at least, not a bar soap, but I am loving the results I’m getting from Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.</li>
            <li> If I use this soap twice daily the drier parts do still get dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t necessarily feel moist, but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry or sore either.</li>
            <li> I have struggled for a lot of my life with dry patches of skin and regular soaps often make the problem worse.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this soap works just like regular soap and kinda dry me out.</li>
            <li> I think for people with less sensitive skin, this product would work.</li>
            <li> I have had such dry skin that it kept me from going to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> I set it on my sink to dry and then put it back in the box.  </li>
            <li> I keep this for my face and my rough elbows, because I want it to last as long as possible.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Salt Soap is made for Normal to Dry Skin  </li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Salt Soap is made for Normal to Dry Skin  </li>
            <li> The bars last a very long time!</li>
            <li> is that it left my skin extremely dry!</li>
            <li> I will freely admit that i am a bit obsessed with soaps and bath products.  </li>
            <li> , I really don&#x27;t have much of a complaint about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It surprised me because it came in a big box for a small product</li>
            <li> I use it after the Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap.</li>
            <li> a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The soap makes her skin feel softer and healthier&lt;</li>
            <li> I now longer have to apply lotion continuously all day long.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE MINOR SKIN ISSUES; THIS SOAP WILL HEAL THOSE ISSUES OVER TIME.</li>
            <li> know the Dead Sea Mud Soap has passed the test for my sensitive skin because it does not irritate my skin when I use it for shaving.</li>
            <li> I am a lover of Adovia products, so naturally this Dead Sea Salt Soap is no exception!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Must keep bar in a dry place, does not do well when left in shower and getting wet.</li>
            <li> Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea</li>
            <li> /&gt; - Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea</li>
            <li> &gt; - Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea</li>
            <li> I assumed that this soap would be gritty like some of the other sea salt soaps</li>
            <li> I was doing some research on the Internet about getting breakouts on my arms and back that were probably due to exercising.</li>
            <li> but it felt different than other cleansers I have used.  </li>
            <li> Has helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have VER DRY skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually after showering I must apply some type of body lotion to my skin to avoid the chalky, ashy look of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> my skin is no longer painfully dry.</li>
            <li> and it will dry out your skin if not followed with some sort of lotion.</li>
            <li> I did like the fact my skin didn&#x27;t dry out when using it.</li>
            <li> When I didn’t moisturize my terribly dry skin on my legs showed dry flaking, so just when too worn out to bother moisturizing, I just hid those legs.</li>
            <li> When I didn’t moisturize my terribly dry skin on my legs showed dry flaking, so just when too worn out to bother moisturizing, I just hid those legs.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin but doesn&#x27;t make it oily either.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel moisturized and helps with my dry skin and cracks.</li>
            <li> skin has always been excessively dry and dryer than any of my friends.</li>
            <li> He has terribly dry skin</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> This soap helped with my all over dry skin.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my face</li>
            <li> it surprises me every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And as for my acne, well, in the month that I have been using the soap I have not had one single flare up.</li>
            <li> This actually surprised me because I usually don&#x27;t use bars of soap on my body because normally they dry my skin out and leave soap scum residue.</li>
            <li> The price came down and I bought several of these bars.</li>
            <li> soap helps to defeat dry skin!</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t drying, nothing like using a soap and have it dry out your face, to the point where you feel like you&#x27;re getting over a sunburn!</li>
            <li> so my skin often has rough dry patches.</li>
            <li> I have Very Dry skin and since using this soap</li>
            <li> , I mean their skin is soft already, but it made their skin feel even softer, and the scent lingered on them for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to only wash once per day, in the morning, because the liquid soap left my face feeling dry and tight, but with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I wash morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I use other bar soaps on my face it is peeling and dry when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been to my doctor for 20 years trying different &amp;#34;Fixes&amp;#34; and so far this  Dead Sea Salt Soap has got every doctor prescribed remedy beat!!!</li>
            <li> Never really noticed any added moisture or anything.  </li>
            <li> $9 a bar is not reasonable to use all the time.😞</li>
            <li> I sometimes have rough itchy skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very reminiscent of &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; smells to me - that really heavy, heady floral-type fragrance.</li>
            <li> Recently I was given the opportunity to review an Adovia&#x27;s product called their Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals.  </li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty</li>
            <li> - Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty&lt;</li>
            <li> - Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.&lt;br /&gt; -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the soap for a few days, however I can feel a difference when I use it instead of Dove.</li>
            <li> I used a different soap that has the dead seas salt plus mud.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using this dead sea salt soap.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve used the soap for about a week now, roughly.</li>
            <li> Will report back in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Soap rather than my standard body wash in the shower.</li>
            <li> recently tried the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I expected a lot about this soap as well.</li>
            <li> have had absolutely no issues with this soap at all, and it is something I give my recommendation on trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slightly expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Their are a few soaps out there made without lye, but their are far few and between.  </li>
            <li> It is for your face and body and has a thick, soft lather-good in the shower.</li>
            <li> Especially on her legs that get dried and itchy from other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> other thing that did surprise a bit was the fact that although it is another dead sea salt product, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily do anything for my acne when I break out.</li>
            <li> When I first heard this product, I thought the soap was going to be rough or grainy because of the &amp;#34;Dead Sea Salt&amp;#34; but, I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt Soap has changed my life in ways I never dreamed possible by completely stopping the normal scaling and flaking and ugly appearance of extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> It was so bad that when I was pregnant I could only use oatmeal based products so that I wouldn&#x27;t break out in a rash all over my body.</li>
            <li> I get really dry irritated skin in the winter and a lot of soaps strip the oil and leave my skin tight and peeling.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered 3 other items.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with hand eczema for a decade now, and this soap does not irritate it like every other soap I have tried.</li>
            <li> I may never use any other cleanser or soap on my face</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is the first product I do not care for due to the scent.  </li>
            <li> but I would have to say that is probably due to the salt pulling the impurities out of my skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave a soap residue on me or peeling like other soaps.</li>
            <li> but it cleans you extremely well and helps repair your skin.</li>
            <li> Cleans like any other bar of soap.</li>
            <li> will never buy another soap again other than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not leave Skin with any residue at all like other soaps tend to.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> and if I use other soaps</li>
            <li> It does dry my skin out a little if I use it morning and night</li>
            <li> Package was a little dusty upon opening, but they had shipped it in a plastic bag so that really helped.</li>
            <li> The problem is some of the products that claim to be Dead Sea Salt products don’t contain enough of the Dead Sea Salt to make a difference at all in your skin.  </li>
            <li> so it fails as a gift-so much so that when it arrived both bars were partially hanging out of a flimsey cardboard package.</li>
            <li> Instanlty revives dead dry skin</li>
            <li> I expected nothing less.</li>
            <li> It arrived late in the delivery process, and when it did we open it and saw it was soooo small , Tiny Bar of soap !</li>
            <li> the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap is doing its job washing and not leaving me too dry!</li>
            <li> bar itself is a little rough because I take it out of the shower</li>
            <li> Especially with my hard water .</li>
            <li> Just wet your brush down run it over the bar of soap and cleanse away!</li>
            <li> /&gt;About the only thing that approaches a negative for me is the scent.</li>
            <li> Theres no soap scum or residue left on your skin.</li>
            <li> Definately Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin a bit not real creamy....</li>
            <li> I mean, you can only imagine how soothing a bar soap has to be to pull that off!</li>
            <li> very good，but a  little bit expensive</li>
            <li> I know that is due to the 26 dead sea minerals which were moisturizing my face</li>
            <li> I also purchase the Black Sea mud bar</li>
            <li> the $11 price tag might be less of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Adovia for the opportunity to review this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; I have a slight addiction to soaps and things that smell</li>
            <li> Seems to have a slight healing capability too.</li>
            <li> I was using previously.</li>
            <li> The opportunities I found where that it did seem a bit drying on my face and did slightly sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> None the less</li>
            <li> Oil is the natural oil base for this soap, which allows for gentle cleansing and moisturizing, without over drying.  </li>
            <li> but it still has a slight smell.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I am slightly disappointed about this soap!</li>
            <li> Not a strong scent, and cleans extremely well.</li>
            <li> With the furnace running all the time and the cold winter air, not to mention the drying effect of the hot tub, my skin is taking a beating this winter.</li>
            <li> the mess it creates.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you feel bogged down like a scented soap.  </li>
            <li> I grew up in the 90s where you were taught that if a face soap didn’t leave your face feeling tight and maybe a little bit red…it just didn’t work.</li>
            <li> After about 4 uses, I no longer need to grab the thick body cream I was using to keep from feeling that dry skin</li>
            <li> A little drying</li>
            <li> After using the Sulfer soap by Adovia, I jumped at the chance to try out this Dead Sea Salt Soap by Adovia.</li>
            <li> This soap contains Dead Sea minerals derived from Dead Sea salt which are, magnesium, sodium, potassium and water.</li>
            <li> If there is a way to shave a few minutes off my morning routine, I&#x27;m all for it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is never a residue with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap</li>
            <li> I hadn’t noticed that leftover residue until I switched to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap</li>
            <li> This is a face/body soap containing a combination of Dead Sea minerals and trace elements derived from Dead Sea Salt. </li>
            <li> I wasted no time in putting this soap to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent-</li>
            <li> you can see, the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Mineral Soap passed all of my tests with flying colors.</li>
            <li> you can see, the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Mineral Soap passed all of my tests with flying colors.</li>
            <li> and I felt so pampered with the dead sea scent.</li>
            <li> Their dead sea mud soap does though so I switch to that when I do break out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about reducing my waste</li>
            <li> My skin feels moisturized but doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s been a film left behind.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try out the dead sea salt soap.</li>
            <li> But this Dead sea salt soap gets my A plus approval.</li>
            <li> so we can experience some of the benefits without traveling to the Dead Sea ourselves.</li>
            <li> did use the Dead Sea Salt Soap on my face once in the shower</li>
            <li> like that it contains Dead Sea Salt with over 21 minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adovia uses minerals from Dead Sea salt - as well as herbs and oils from all over the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well the Adovia Dead Sea Salt soap is no exception.</li>
            <li> I hadn’t considered a dead sea salt soap until I received this one to review.</li>
            <li> I have used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap in the shower for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> It removes my hard-to-clean green tea mud mask, make-up, etc.</li>
            <li> Its probably the dead sea salt, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of it being from the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li> Being in my late sixties not much works.  </li>
            <li> I chose a few things for her</li>
            <li> I recieved the Dead Sea salt soap for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt Soap Review&lt;br /</li>
            <li> There’s no filmy residue left behind on my skin.</li>
            <li> The soap works so well that even a child notices and appreciates the difference in her skin condition after using the soap for a few days.</li>
            <li> One of the articles suggested taking baths in Dead Sea salt.</li>
            <li> The biggest issue I had with it was that it dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> With a salty smell, so maybe we can know that it contains dead sea salt.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt can be used to remove dead skin and promoting heavy skin.</li>
            <li> but it is not strong so it doesn&#x27;t bother me either.</li>
            <li> moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now usually after using anything with Dead Sea Salts in it, I recommend rinsing well and then applying moisturizer… with this soap I recomend rinsing well and the moisturizer is your choice.</li>
            <li> moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now usually after using anything with Dead Sea Salts in it, I recommend rinsing well and then applying moisturizer… with this soap I recomend rinsing well and the moisturizer is your choice.</li>
            <li> I received this for review and considering my past experience with Dead Sea Salt</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, I also hate having to use 2 different soaps one for my body and one for my face.</li>
            <li> You use very little of the soap when in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> The soap is unbelievable..</li>
            <li> It is not drying especially in the harsh harsh winter cold</li>
            <li> I used this soap for the past 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> so I added my usual moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received one bar of the Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Soap to review!  </li>
            <li> I followed my usual regimen of serum and lotion.</li>
            <li> Usually this child doesn’t care what products are in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, worse now in the cold, dry, ohio winter months.</li>
            <li> I like to use this soap for shaving my legs, but it leaves a slight film behind when rinsing off - water beads up on my skin</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry scaly itchy unmanageable skin...LOOK NO MORE!!!!</li>
            <li> Normally people shy away from bar soaps due to their bad rep.  </li>
            <li> my skin reacted so badly to it, that I had little red bumps &amp;#34;Which</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li> I honestly do not think after trying this that I will buy anything else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had broken out really bad after trying a lotion with too much perfume.</li>
            <li> Since it is expensive, I&#x27;m careful to store it so that it isn&#x27;t soaking in water.  </li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t mean something can&#x27;t spark it.</li>
            <li> price is a little expensive, but the soap does the trick and we got to try it for free&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that sounds a little silly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really the manufacturers faults that these products don&#x27;t work for me, it&#x27;s my crazy skin.</li>
            <li> worse--</li>
            <li> Dries my skin out WAY worse than it was before I used this bar of soap.</li>
            <li> It throughrally cleanses your skin from grim, makeup, sebum and yet never stripping your skin from the vital nutrients and oils it needs.</li>
            <li> It smells expensive like a salon or day spa would carry.</li>
            <li> also it&#x27;s too expensive</li>
            <li> There is something else to the scent (faint floral notes?)</li>
            <li> You can even still faintly see the Adovia stamp on the bar.</li>
            <li> You can even still faintly see the Adovia stamp on the bar.</li>
            <li> None of that floral or fake fruit-y smells that a lot of products use.</li>
            <li> But price is absurd for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit expensive</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this soap.  </li>
            <li> I use I still feel dirty after washing.</li>
            <li> A lot of soaps contain lye which is totally horrible for your body and causes serious dryness.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t one bad thing to say about the smell.</li>
            <li> So I am thinking that if I had a really bad break out on my face &amp;#34;Which</li>
            <li> Not impressed, very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I battled nasty acne for years and always seem to be on the verge of a flair up (</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works great,my skin feels smooth and doesnt feel like used soap with the typical residue&lt;br /&gt;received for discounted price for my review</li>
            <li> I like this product.  great on my skin and is hard milled so it last a long time</li>
            <li> Never really noticed any added moisture or anything.  Seems like normal soap to me.</li>
            <li> wonderful soap. It leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Great - no more itchy skin</li>
            <li> I wanted to change up the routine by trying out a bar of soap.  Went on Amazon and found this product. No wonder the reviews are so great, this body soap gets a great lather and leaves your skin very moisturized. If you are thinking about this, stop thinking and buy it! Will be back for more Adovia Dead Sea products.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have ever used.  Rich and lots of suds.  Feels great.  I won&#x27;t use anything else from now on.</li>
            <li> I like this soap because it cleans really well and seems to be helping with my acne. It does dry my skin out a little if I use it morning and night so I have just been using it at night. I like it best for my face, it dries out my body more than I like, so I only use it on my body once or twice a week. It leaves my skin feeling very clean!</li>
            <li> Soap feels great. I use it after the Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap. My entire body definitely feels extremely clean</li>
            <li> It cleans alright.  It cleans all the oil off my skin.  At least it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I have severe eczema and psoriasis so I have to be picky with what I wash my body with.  I only use it for my face now.</li>
            <li> After using the Sulfer soap by Adovia, I jumped at the chance to try out this Dead Sea Salt Soap by Adovia. It&#x27;s moisturizing, luxurious, and feels amazing. It&#x27;s a great purchase and I&#x27;m very happy to have tried it out. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on my skin and rinses clean away. There&#x27;s no scent to it and it doesn&#x27;t melt even sitting in a soap dish. There&#x27;s a reason why this is a luxury soap!</li>
            <li> Love this soap and it smell nice and your body feel good after using, and fast shipping</li>
            <li> The soap is unbelievable.. The lather is amazing... so much so I use it to shave my legs (TMI?) lol First time I used it I got out the shower actually feeling exfoliated.. I hide it so no one else uses it! Love it! Just ordered 3 other items.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice.  Haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to know personally how good it is, but I&#x27;ve heard only good things about this product so far (from family).</li>
            <li> Very impressive soap, it helps with skin irritations. Also helped me with stress. Need a 3 pack or 5 pack. $9 a bar is not reasonable to use all the time.😞</li>
            <li> it left a sticky film on my skin</li>
            <li> Adovia makes outstanding facial cleaning soaps that are all natural, free from fragrances &amp; leaves my face &amp; neck feeling so so clean &amp; refreshed!  My skin just LOVES this soap &amp; their amazing facial mask!</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt Soap feels great on my skin and lathers well. I would recommend using this soap but wish the price was lower. However, I do intend to buy this again.</li>
            <li> So, yes, this is fragrance free, however, there is still a smell to it. It&#x27;s kind of like...no, I can&#x27;t put my finger on it. Like oil or wax or something. I just tested it by washing my hands w/it and my hands are pretty dry, they didn&#x27;t get moisturized. But this lathers well and feels nice while that&#x27;s going on. I don&#x27;t personally use this kind of soap on my face, so I can&#x27;t attest to that at all, but I think it would work well. Package was a little dusty upon opening, but they had shipped it in a plastic bag so that really helped. I got to try this out for free and was in no way paid; my reviews and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it- have sensitive skin, can&#x27;t use any product with scent--this is perfect.  Soap leaves skin feeling smooth, not dry..  Will order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review: Had to order a second bar of soap, my daughter loved it so much I gave it to her!</li>
            <li> I like how this soap feels</li>
            <li> I like this soap, I love that it is natural and fragrance free. I am glad I found something fragrance free in a bar form.</li>
            <li> Certainly wished that I found this soap years ago!  I have dermatitis and this soap leaves my skin feeling great, moisturized and not itching.  I absolutely would purchase this again, and purchase some for gifts.</li>
            <li> It works well. Seems to moisturize good. I&#x27;m not a big fan of bar soaps though</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  My skin feels great!  I will buy this soap again!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so am cautious about trying out new soaps, especially on my face, but I really like this soap. It left my skin feeling very clean, soft and moisturized. I love the fact that it has Dead Sea Minerals and salts that are really good for my skin. I&#x27;m not crazy about the way the soap smells but because of all of the other good things about it, I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Adding another one to the cart  now so I have a spare.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this soap! It has a mild lather and didn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry after using it.</li>
            <li> Does clean my face. Very mild soap for sensitive skin. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I would buy more of this soap if it were not so expensive. It really is a nice soap. Update since my last review. The price came down and I bought several of these bars. It leaves your face and body so moisturized. It just feels wonderful. It lathers up in this wonderful lather. I love everything about it. I will always buy this as long as the price stays reasonable. Maybe they could offer several in a order.</li>
            <li> I just received this bar of soap an only used it a few times, I love it  I only used it on my face an it will be my go to bar for my face . I love the way my face feels afterwards . It does have a tightening effect. I also purchase the Black Sea mud bar but I haven&#x27;t used that yet. I will up date when I use it.</li>
            <li> definitely a staple in my household. I love this soap. I have the best skin I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product - will order again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this soap.  Has helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is unlike any face soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It cleanses gently and there&#x27;s no residue or over-drying. I am very pleased with this soap and I will have buying again because my daughters need their own.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it. I use this soap on my toddler because it is fragrance and chemical free and pure! It is not drying especially in the harsh harsh winter cold we are experiencing.  Arrived very quickly and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this soap for about 2 weeks  so far it&#x27;s great.  After just one use my skin was softer and felt so clean.  I use this primarily on my face and my pores are smaller and my skin looks healthier.  I have combination skin and the oily parts aren&#x27;t as oily as before.  If I use this soap twice daily the drier parts do still get dry.  I bought the acne and mud soaps for my kids to try and their acne is clearing up.  Overall we are all happy with these soaps.</li>
            <li> Have had rosacea since the 1990s from a paba sunscreen and haven&#x27;t found anything that helps. But this helps. My skin appears to be healing after only 3 month&#x27;s use. Some days I go without using powder concealer--I haven&#x27;t done that for 20 years!</li>
            <li> you can feel the diffrent from the first week.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin a bit not real creamy....</li>
            <li> I have a dead sea salt mask I used before and was happy to be offered to try Adovia&#x27;s bar soap made with dead sea salt at a great discount and I am happily reporting back to say this is a very nice feeling on my aging skin! I had been neglecting myself a bit and am making some changes, and I thank the seller for the opportunity to try this - and yes, this is my honest opinion!&lt;br /&gt;You know that squeaky clean feeling of freshness - that is how it feels after I dry my face - Ah!&lt;br /&gt;For those who say it dries out your skin, follow up with a good moisturizer - in fact, the company offers an entire skincare line that complement each other. This too will be on my &#x27;re-purchase&#x27; lsit :)</li>
            <li> I love this soap, I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic! I have really dry skin, worse now in the cold, dry, ohio winter months. This soap is deeply moisturizing and hydrating. It&#x27;s great for people with normal to dry skin. it has a very light, natural fragrance. It smells expensive like a salon or day spa would carry. The soap left my skin feeling refreshed, hydrated, moisturized and squeaky clean. I am happy to recieve this awesome soap to review. It is now my go to soap!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Truly blessed. Astounding!  Instantly healed my skin. So grateful to have discovered this product. This is my new golden treasure. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love this....nice lather &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> This soap is AWESOME. I had been using Dove bar soap. It was ok, but it left a film (I still liked it though). This soap beats it, in my pinion. There is no lasting film yet it&#x27;s just as gentle (if not more so). I have VER DRY skin. From head to toe &amp; this soap is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried. It comes off so well, in the shower, that it makes me feel like we have softer water....u know &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;-like. Anyway, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> love this soap..it&#x27;s the next best thing to the scrub.</li>
            <li> Good soap makes my skin very soft just wished it had a nice clean fresh smell there no smell at all also it&#x27;s too expensive</li>
            <li> I sometimes have rough itchy skin and I am constantly looking for solutions to remedy my unruly skin. I cam across Adovia Mineral Skincare Moisturizing Soap Bar and decided it was worth trying.  It was $11 for a 4.4oz bar but I go it for free from Tomoson to test and review. This soap contains Dead Sea minerals derived from Dead Sea salt which are, magnesium, sodium, potassium and water. This is for any and all skin types. It is promised to clean thoroughly while infusing skin with hydrating minerals.  I open the box to try it in the shower and the smell of it is very gentle and softly perfume-like but not strong.  The bar is and off white color and has “ADOVIA” stamped on the top. The soap lathers quickly and thick. The bar is small, curved and fits perfectly inside your palm. I used this soap on my face and entire body. Immediately, my body felt moisturized and renewed. My skin felt soft, supple and hydrated all day long even on my face under my makeup. This soap left no residue whatsoever. I liked Adovia Mineral Skincare Moisturizing Soap Bar very much and continue to use it everyday mainly as a facial soap. It takes my makeup off and leaves my skin feeling breathable and younger.</li>
            <li> its ok... but it’s not what I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I have struggled with hand eczema for a decade now, and this soap does not irritate it like every other soap I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It&#x27;s fragrance free and leaves no residue. I&#x27;ve ordered twice.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Dead Sea Salt Soap.  It lathers nicely, leaves my skin feeling and looking good, and truly has no odor.  The service from the company was prompt and well packaged.  I am on my second bar and will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a persistent skin condition on my neck for years and after the last flare-up I went looking for something that might help. This soap was recommended on a website, so I read reviews here on Amazon and decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it now just under a week, and my skin is clearing up fast! Because the problem extends to my scalp, I decided to use this soap to wash my hair, too - and it&#x27;s working great. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this along with other Adovia products and of course I love them all. This Dead Sea Salt Soap though was by far my favorite. It left my skin feeling smooth and exfoliated with out scratching or itchyness left over from harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap made my skin feel so soft, and very clean. I really like that Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap leaves my skin feeling clean without leaving a residue like other soaps I tried before. My skin feels so soft that my husband noticed, and asked me what was I using. I liked it so much that I used the soap on my babies too! Their skin felt so soft, I mean their skin is soft already, but it made their skin feel even softer, and the scent lingered on them for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap for any one that has dry, sensitive, or normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap for review purposes. However the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working. my skin is somewhat better</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Excellent performance.  Gentle and moisturizing. Worked well on face and body. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves me feeling super clean, and is unscented.</li>
            <li> Pricy, small, but okay.</li>
            <li> This soap is OK. Not a miracle product. It does seem to clean and it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out your skin (but..by its very nature, it is going to remove things from the top layers of your skin-which may include oils and moisture to some degree). It leaves a smooth film on your skin for a while. I&#x27;d say if you want bar soap that does not appear to have a bunch of chemicals in it that can lightly exfoliate your skin, this is a nice product.</li>
            <li> This soap fit easily into the palm of my hand and glides over my skin creating a light, clean, fragrant lather.  It rinses off easily and left my skin with a delightful, healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually after showering I must apply some type of body lotion to my skin to avoid the chalky, ashy look of dry skin.  I didn&#x27;t apply any lotion after using this soap to test it&#x27;s hydrating ability.  I was pleasantly surprised that my skin continued to look bright and healthy for over 8 hours.  For me this is Huge.  If there is a way to shave a few minutes off my morning routine, I&#x27;m all for it.  I will be purchasing this soap over and over again.</li>
            <li> Cleansing every morning has become a spa like experience thanks to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable. I’ve used liquid face soap religiously for the past 10 years, at least, not a bar soap, but I am loving the results I’m getting from Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I used to only wash once per day, in the morning, because the liquid soap left my face feeling dry and tight, but with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I wash morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is never a residue with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and my face feels refreshingly clean. Adovia’s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I’d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin. I hadn’t noticed that leftover residue until I switched to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and I don’t think I will go back to a liquid cleanser again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point is right up my alley. At $11 a bar, I feel like I am getting this cleanser at a steal. Compared to other bar soaps I’ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don’t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box. I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia’s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin and feeling good in my skin couldn’t come at a better price.</li>
            <li> I use many Adovia products and my hair and skin have been thanking me! The soap moisturizes very well with this dry season approaching. It does not leave a film and keeps my skin moisturized. It has a very mild scent-almost non-existent. No residue and great lather. I would recommend this and any Adovia products as I have reviewed many of them.</li>
            <li> I got this product to review so there is no buyers remorse or monetary loss playing in effect here.This review is 100% unbiased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I go into excruciating details about the cons and benefits of products but; with this product I could not come up with any legitimate cons and the closest thing to a con would be the &amp;#34;price&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;if you don&#x27;t like to have a nice soothing but not &#x27;too strong&#x27;  fragrance after use, you might not be as pleased with this product&amp;#34;; however, that seems absurd, who does not want smell nice and let the lather from this product soothe your skin? No one! and the price is based on what you are willing to spend and how you use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll get straight to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This product has a nice fragrance (strong as you open the box but mild and soothing when you use it in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The lather is so rich and smooth, you forget you are using a bar soap I mean, you can only imagine how soothing a bar soap has to be to pull that off! - it surprises me every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I always feel for soap residue  (as an instinct for whenever I use bar soaps) but never find any, it lathers on nice and rinses off completely.&lt;br /&gt;- The soap lasts for a decent amount of time depending on how you use it; it is a bar soap so it lasts just as long as one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I use this soap with my hands on my face, it keeps my face feeling smooth however; I am not sure if it does much else after that but won&#x27;t be surprise if it has some underlying rejuvenation of skin going on. (my skins pores seem to be more relaxed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: I HIGHLY recommend this soap to anyone who wants to experience a bar soap with nice fragrance that soothes your skin but feels nothing like a bar soap due to how smooth and soothing it lathers up on your skin. Also, if you just need it for facial wash then it is perfect and the $11 price tag might be less of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Adovia for the opportunity to review this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sean D.</li>
            <li> My daughter and wife have very sensitive skin. Regular soaps irritate their skin and make them break out. We have a water softener that helps, but we needed more help. We were given the chance to try the soap. My wife loves it. This is what she says about this great soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light, but nice fragrance&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice lather that makes her skin feel good&lt;br /&gt;There is no residue left on the skin like many of the store bought soaps. We also have a water softener which makes this soap last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The soap makes her skin feel softer and healthier&lt;br /&gt;We see an improvement in my daughter&#x27;s skin. Especially on her legs that get dried and itchy from other soaps.&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little expensive, but the soap does the trick and we got to try it for free&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this soap much more than regular bars of soap</li>
            <li> Okay ... At first I was thinking, &amp;#34;Yay! Free soap.&amp;#34; I have a slight addiction to soaps and things that smell good.&lt;br /&gt; THEN IT ARRIVED IN THE MAIL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I honestly do not think after trying this that I will buy anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First the smell, because I always start with the smell. It smells AMAZING. There isn&#x27;t one bad thing to say about the smell. I think I huffed the box a good five or six times getting myself excited for bath time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Second. You know how most soaps after you rinse them off, your skin feel rough? Your fingers don&#x27;t slide over smooth, its a bumpy ride. This stuff. NOT THE CASE! I swear I feel like a baby. Well my skin does. It is really soft. So the moisturizing capabilities of this stuff is awesome. I normally use dove, because its soft too. But this stuff blows my normal brand right out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Third. Seems to have a slight healing capability too. I had broken out really bad after trying a lotion with too much perfume. my skin reacted so badly to it, that I had little red bumps &amp;#34;Which naturally I had picked at and irritated farther.&amp;#34; ONE USE and they were almost gone. Two days ... they were finished. So I am thinking that if I had a really bad break out on my face &amp;#34;Which I don&#x27;t know if its true because thanks to vitamin c serums I haven&#x27;t have that issue.&amp;#34; But my assumption is that it would work on clearing that up quite well too. IF YOU GUYS TRY IT, and you do have a problem with acne. Please let me know. &amp;#34;I am curious.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All in all this stuff ROCKS! I don&#x27;t like the price tag off 11 dollars a bar ... but I love what it does for my skin, so I will be looking past that. I truthfully LOVE this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thanks for stopping by xxDee</li>
            <li> I will freely admit that i am a bit obsessed with soaps and bath products.  I love trying different scents and brands and probably have enough body wash to last a lifetime (ok so that may be a bit of an overstatement bit I do have alot). My general preference isn&#x27;t usually bar soap but was kindly sent this soap to test out so I figured it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap.This is a face/body soap containing a combination of Dead Sea minerals and trace elements derived from Dead Sea Salt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is an extremely pleasant and fresh scent. Not to mild and not to overpowering either. Just the perfect amount of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing and lathers well. Leaves you clean and smooth without stripping away to many of your skins natural oils. I also really enjoyed that it didn&#x27;t leave any of that funky filmy residue that so many soaps do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fairly good size but at $11 a bar I suggest you not use it as your main soap.... especially if you live with multiple people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give it an 8/10. I throughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone seeking a nourishing and effective soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> There are several key things that I look for when it comes to trying a new soap or body wash: scent, lather, how easily it washes off the skin, how my skin feels afterwards (including if my skin feels moisturized or dried out), if I can use it on my face/shave with it and how long the soap lasts. I wasted no time in putting this soap to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent- This soap smells AMAZING. The best way I can describe the scent is to say that it smells really &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;. There is something else to the scent (faint floral notes?) but I can not place it. I thought the smell was a little overpowering when I first removed it from the box, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering as you use it in the shower. It actually makes your entire bathroom smell amazing for hours after your shower. The scent also lingers a little on your skin (not a lot, but enough to be pleasant and make you feel clean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather- This soap not only lathers well, but it does so easily. You use very little of the soap when in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How easily does it wash off the skin- Very easily. It does not stick to your skin or make you feel like you have to work to rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does my skin feel after using- I feel really clean and smell amazing. The soap does not dry out my skin at all like most soaps do. My skin doesn&#x27;t necessarily feel moist, but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry or sore either. It feels soft, clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I use it on my face/shave with it- Yes! If I use other bar soaps on my face it is peeling and dry when I get out of the shower. I have been using this Adovia Mineral Soap on my face for 2 weeks with no peeling or dryness. It makes my face feel so much cleaner than the facial wash I was using previously. I love it on my face! I have also not had as many breakouts. I have also been using this to shave. Since it lathers so well and is not drying, it makes shaving really easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long does the soap last- Well, I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks now. As of now the bar looks almost the original size. You can even still faintly see the Adovia stamp on the bar. It appears that this Adovia Mineral Soap will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Mineral Soap passed all of my tests with flying colors. The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone. I normally would not spend that much on a bar of soap, but this soap is definitely worth trying. I recommend it!about 2 weeks now. As of now the bar looks almost the original size. You can even still faintly see the Adovia stamp on the bar. It appears that this Adovia Mineral Soap will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Mineral Soap passed all of my tests with flying colors. The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone. I normally would not spend that much on a bar of soap, but this soap is definitely worth trying. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mineral Soap is by far the most luxurious soap I have ever tried. It smells amazing and I felt so pampered with the dead sea scent. The soap bar is very large and will last a long time. I love the 21 minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a product to facilitate review.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap helps to defeat dry skin! I love this soap and cannot say enough good things about it. It smells great and rinses clean with no film or residue. It also gently exfoliates your skin. I started using it on my face but when I saw how much better my skin looked started using it on my whole body. when I first tried this soap I wasn’t expecting much. After using in once, I noticed the skin on my face wasn’t tight feeling like it is when I use my normal soap. My face was soft and smooth. So I tried it on the rest of my body, and what a difference it has made! I now longer have to apply lotion continuously all day long. Once and I’m good to go! my skin is no longer painfully dry. If you have skin issues, give this soap a try and see how it works for you. For me it has really made a difference! Thanks Adovia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I get really dry irritated skin in the winter and a lot of soaps strip the oil and leave my skin tight and peeling.  This does seem to be a little better than some of the others, but so far, I have not noticed too significant of a difference.  I will keep trying it and perhaps revise my review.</li>
            <li> I needed to purchase a new soap for washing my face because I was using something with sulfates and was still getting acne.  I read the reviews and am a believer in products with dead sea minerals, however I don&#x27;t really feel like it is helping with my acne.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s making it worse-- I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s making it better. I may try the sulfur one or I may try something else.  I do appreciate that it is a gentle natural product, but it is not the holy grail for me.</li>
            <li> Very good, and really does moisturize.  But, please consider adding more natural moisturizers.</li>
            <li> OMG! I love this Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap! When I first heard this product, I thought the soap was going to be rough or grainy because of the &amp;#34;Dead Sea Salt&amp;#34; but, I was so wrong. When I opened the box for the first time, the scent was strong, but I liked the scent. It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh, almost kind of an ivory scent. I put it in my shower and left and when I returned the whole bathroom smelled so nice. And, even after I use it in the shower, there is still a nice lingering fragrance on my skin after each use. It lathers very well and rinses off without leaving any residue. My skin feels so soft and smooth afterward, especially my face! Some soaps leave your face dry, this one leaves my face feeling fresh, clean and moisturized... This bar of soap is amazing and it feels great! I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product and recommend it to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Has really helped with my dermatitis.  Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I used this soap for the past 2 weeks. I LOVE the scent and it actually suds nicely--I used a sponge with it and scrubbed my body head to toe! It actually does a good job moisturizing--my skin looked and felt good--I didn&#x27;t even moisturize with lotion which I normally do. The soap is not gritty and your skin feels hydrated and exfoliated. I could even smell the wonderful fragrance on my hands hours later.&lt;br /&gt;It did sting my eyes a bit when I scrubbed my face with it though and my facial skin did still feel a bit taut after showering--so I added my usual moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say I love the strong fragrance and how well it lathers with my mesh sponge. This stuff actually makes my whole bathroom smell amazing even hours later! It did a good job cleaning and hydrating my legs and arms (however, in colder months, my skin gets exceptionally dry--I probably would need additional moisturizing). The opportunities I found where that it did seem a bit drying on my face and did slightly sting my eyes. None the less, it&#x27;s a great price point for a 100% genuine dead sea salt soap and I will continue to use this nutrient dense Adovia product.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample from the manufacturer for testing purposes, however, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, I will admit. I normally will not use a bar soap. I prefer body wash and have used it for years. Then I got the chance to try this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe that something this amazing is just called soap! I love it! The fragrance alone is enough to make me want to use it day after day. I keep this for my face and my rough elbows, because I want it to last as long as possible. It has made a noticeable difference in my elbows and my face is feeling so much more moisturized. I am out in the drying sun often right now and am glad that I have a product that counteracts that dryness so easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t rave on about products that I receive to review quite so much, as I am always afraid people will think I am only doing so because I got it free. That is not the case ever. All my opinions are always 100% my own and totally unbiased. If a product doesn&#x27;t live up to what it says it will do, then I say so. I love this product and the only con I can see with it is it&#x27;s price. I do, however, feel that it is worth the price. I may never use any other cleanser or soap on my face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is so pretty and clean smelling. It isn&#x27;t overpowering at all and I feel like I smell pretty after I use it. I know that sounds a little silly and now I am singing the song that popped into my head as soon as I typed it, but it is the truth. My children love the scent as well and I have to be a meanie and not share the soap with them or it would be gone in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So do I recommend this product? Definitely. Will I buy it in the future? Most likely. Or maybe my hubby will buy it for me! He likes the scent of it as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products by Adovia and seriously love them all. This particular bar of soap has a strong, but good, clean scent. It works very well on my face and body as far as keeping my skin moisturized. This actually surprised me because I usually don&#x27;t use bars of soap on my body because normally they dry my skin out and leave soap scum residue. This soap does neither of those things. It lathers up very well too. I love to use this on my legs after I shave so that not only are they clean, but they are also super soft. The moisture and softness lasts too. I was a tiny bit worried that after using regularly my skin might finally start to dry out, but nope! It continues to moisturize day after day.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing that did surprise a bit was the fact that although it is another dead sea salt product, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily do anything for my acne when I break out. Their dead sea mud soap does though so I switch to that when I do break out.&lt;br /&gt;I do like this soap a lot anyway. I find that it works best when rubbed onto a loofah, when it gets super lathery and bubbly and then I rub it in a circular motion all over. On my face I use a konjac sponge with it and love the way it feels afterward. Wonderful product. Highly recommended especially for the colder months when your skin might dry out the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free product since I am a product tester, in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I have had the opportunity to try several products by Adovia and have liked them all.  Unfortunately this is the first product I do not care for due to the scent.  The fragrance is so strong that I had a reaction - sneezing and itching - as soon as I started using it. I was only able to use it the one time and had to remove it from our shower. However, if fragrances aren&#x27;t a concern for you I would give it a try because out all the reviews I have read regarding this product only a few others have complained about the scent, and most people like the soap.  This soap is a healthier soap with less-toxic ingredients than the others you buy at the store, so it is worth a shot.  The company has a 100% 60 Day, money back guarantee, so you really have nothing to lose.  I will try this soap again when a fragrance-free version comes available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> To start, I am a huge fan of bar soaps. I love how little packaging they have in comparison to liquid soaps, and I also love that what packaging they do have is usually a box which is biodegradable. I&#x27;m all about reducing my waste so I don&#x27;t have to worry about reusing or recycling much, and bar soaps help with that goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m going in expecting to be pleased, and I was overwhelmed! This is hands-down the most moisturizing bar soap I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve used absolutely wonderful, hand-made, cold-processed goat&#x27;s milk soaps. Don&#x27;t expect this soap to rinse squeaky clean - it leaves a slight film of something softening on your skin that soaks right in as soon as it&#x27;s dried. You don&#x27;t feel anything but smooth, supple skin after you wash with this. I can definitely skip moisturizer on my face when I use it to wash away the day, and I don&#x27;t find my hands drying out nearly as much as they do with normal bar soaps - or even other good ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a hefty, solid bar that&#x27;s incredibly long-lasting. Most of the really moisturizing bar soaps I&#x27;ve tried have melted away quite easily, especially if left in damp places (like the shower). This one just keeps going and going...I&#x27;ve used it multiple times a day for nearly two weeks straight now, and you&#x27;d hardly be able to tell by looking at it - the logo has barely worn smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only thing that approaches a negative for me is the scent. It&#x27;s very reminiscent of &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; smells to me - that really heavy, heady floral-type fragrance. It&#x27;s incredibly strong in this soap, so much so that it constantly fills the room with the scent, even when you aren&#x27;t using it. Fortunately, though, it doesn&#x27;t linger much on the skin, so I don&#x27;t wind up smelling it all day long. Thanks to that, I really don&#x27;t have much of a complaint about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it&#x27;s hard to say anything bad about this product - I absolutely love it, the price is reasonable, and I&#x27;m definitely prepared to order more!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, i love the smell and the feel it leaves on my skin. Theres no soap scum or residue left on your skin. its gentle enough for daily use. I would buy it again&lt;br /&gt;www.akreviews.com</li>
            <li> This soap has a mild, pleasant scent. I like to use this soap for shaving my legs, but it leaves a slight film behind when rinsing off - water beads up on my skin and it will dry out your skin if not followed with some sort of lotion. I guess any soap will do that, but I had hoped this one would feel &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; for some reason. For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;ve noticed fewer shave-bumps since I started using this (which was the whole reason for getting it), but I docked a star because of the filmy feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this. I&#x27;m using this only on my face. It&#x27;s not drying at all and my skin feels clean - c l e a n. No residue or slippery feeling.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no scent, which I like. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED THIS SOAP BEFORE AND IT&#x27;S VERY GOOD. IF YOU HAVE MINOR SKIN ISSUES; THIS SOAP WILL HEAL THOSE ISSUES OVER TIME. NOT ABRASIVE AND SOAPS UP GREAT!</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPc91e318a5030977bc1528f6a13986a8d&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel of my skin after using this and the scent is wonderful!!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMc91e318a5030977bc1528f6a13986a8d&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Since I always use both bar soap and a body wash every time I take a bath, I look for products which are gentle and wouldn&#x27;t make my skin drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap has a very nice, fresh scent. I like that it leaves my skin smelling nice even after I rinse it off. I also like that it&#x27;s gentle enough not to make my skin drier although I can&#x27;t skip the lotion afterwards (and I haven&#x27;t found any soap or body wash which can make me not apply lotion after I take a bath). The expiration date at the bottom of the box is also nice since I know that what I&#x27;m using is still okay to use.</li>
            <li> When Adovia sent this to me for feedback, I was expecting something entirely different. Not literally - they filled the order that I placed. But when I read &amp;#34;Dead Sea Salt&amp;#34; I was expecting it to contain some kind of gritty exfoliating product. That wasn&#x27;t the case. This product is a traditional soap, lathers well, goes on smooth and washes off fine. My skin feels moisturized but doesn&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s been a film left behind. In general, I really liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was the fragrance. As someone who can have some sensitivity to strong perfumes, this was a bit of a concern. When I opened the Amazon box, the scent was so strong it took my breath away. When I opened the soap package, it was equally as strong. I placed it in the shower and it lost some of that umph - thank goodness. While I have some lingering fragrance on my skin after each use, it isn&#x27;t very noticeable. (I even asked family members if they felt it was too strong.) If you have fragrance sensitivities, just prepare yourself when you open the box then let it set out before first use and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Lathers well, rinses off without residue, skin left feeling moisturized the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Fragrant upon opening</li>
            <li> I was lucky to get to try out the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap. I love the smell of it as well as the way it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized. I honestly didn&#x27;t find a con to this soap at all, I did notice a few pimples that popped up a day or so after use but I would have to say that is probably due to the salt pulling the impurities out of my skin. I will continue to use this bar of soap and update my blog review once the bar is used up! I have super sensitive skin so knowing I didn&#x27;t have an allergic reaction to this wonderful soap just makes me love it even more. If you would like to read my full review you can do so at the link below  [...]</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, I also hate having to use 2 different soaps one for my body and one for my face. I had the opportunity to try out the dead sea salt soap. I was kinda eery at first using a soap that has salt in it , and one that is for the face and body. But, after trying it out for awhile I notice improvement. My skin looked healthier and cleaner. It didn&#x27;t leave a soap residue on me or peeling like other soaps. I did like the fact my skin didn&#x27;t dry out when using it. That was a big plus, a lot of soap I use I still feel dirty after washing. I peel and I feel like there is soap still on me. So, when I received this soap that is 100% natural with vitamins and minerals , I thought this is something for me. Even with a price of over 10 dollars I think its worth the shot to find a soap to work with. I believe price should not be a option for healthy glowing natural skin. Its important to take care of your body, and if that involves spending the money that is all natural for your body I am all in. I have had friends and family ask me about this soap, I wouldn&#x27;t let them try it , as I feel bar soap is personal to use. I wont even let my husband use my bar soap. But this Dead sea salt soap gets my A plus approval.</li>
            <li> We really love this soap.  It has a great amount of natural salt from the Dead Sea in it.  It smells just like the soap my grandmother used 25 years ago.  While I doubt she was using Adovia Mineral Skin Care Dead Sea Salt Soap, she well may have been because she was an all natural guru before All natural became popular!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used this soap to quickly dry up bug bites, I use it in lieu of other types of soap to rub directly on a bug bite to immediately stop the itching, and the great part is the salt in the soap goes in and dries up the poison that is causing the itch.  One of my favorite uses for this soap is to just wash with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do use Epsom salt on a regular basis to detox the toxins out of my body, this soap is so salty that it is helping detox every time I use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone I know!</li>
            <li> I love this soap not just a regular bar soap. Make the skin feel super soft just like you were at the beach. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it feels so natural and the scent is great, although a little stronger than I prefer for my facial skin (I am sensitive to fragrances).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh how I loved testing out the Dead Sea Salt Soapfollow for this review. If you’ve been following me for a while, you know that I have loved Dead Sea Salt products that I have used in the past, well this product is no different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar of soap arrived to my house from my Amazon order and I opened up the box to see a lovely blue colored bar of soap. The fragrance of the soap is quite refreshing, though a little more fragrance than I usually enjoy in my soap. The texture of the bar of soap is unusual, in that it feels a little bit textured to the touch especially while washing with it, the bar is not shiny like most commercial bar soaps, the look and texture is like a good bar of homemade soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Salt does contain a lot of minerals and the Dead Sea has been though to have many health and beauty benefits for ages, even Cleopatra loved the benefits of the Dead Sea thousands of years ago. Today we are lucky as products come out with Dead Sea Salts in them so we can experience some of the benefits without traveling to the Dead Sea ourselves. The problem is some of the products that claim to be Dead Sea Salt products don’t contain enough of the Dead Sea Salt to make a difference at all in your skin.  With this Soap, I find that their claims are not only believable but that is has helped to settle down some of my skin problems, yes my recent flare has my rash back on some of my body and my face right now, however the Dead Sea Salt has seemed to settle down the Lupus skin flare up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the Dead Sea Salt Soap on my face once in the shower and I have to say that it did leave my face squeaky clean to the touch and with a very light moisturized feeling. However my preferred, since my face is so very highly sensitive to fragrance, is to use it on my body. I really loved sudsing up my washcloth with this bar of soap, the resulting suds were small, soft and had a very gentle fragrance. After rinsing, just like on my face, the result was squeaky clean yet lightly moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now usually after using anything with Dead Sea Salts in it, I recommend rinsing well and then applying moisturizer… with this soap I recomend rinsing well and the moisturizer is your choice. The Dead Sea Salt Soap is made for Normal to Dry Skin  (and of course skin in between). For me? I rinsed well and the I still did moisturize, most of the time. When I didn’t moisturize my terribly dry skin on my legs showed dry flaking, so just when too worn out to bother moisturizing, I just hid those legs. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to Adovia Skin Care for allowing me to review their Dead Sea Salt Soap, I am so in love!

            <li> excellent clean fragrance</li>
            <li> I got this product to review. This review is 100% unbiased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product for my body and not face (since I have a set product for my face). This product has a nice fragrance (strong as you open the box but mild and soothing when you use it in the shower).  I love the way it smells and make you feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather was smooth, not rich enough for me, so it could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it contains Dead Sea Salt with over 21 minerals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I dislike about this product is that it left my skin extremely dry! The value of this product is steep for 1 bar of soap-$11!</li>
            <li> Recently I was given the opportunity to review an Adovia&#x27;s product called their Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals.  Adovia uses minerals from Dead Sea salt - as well as herbs and oils from all over the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to their item descrption it says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item description:&lt;br /&gt;- Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea&lt;br /&gt;- Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty&lt;br /&gt;- Deeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry Skin&lt;br /&gt;- Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.&lt;br /&gt;- Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For budgetary reasons, I normally use some of the more popular drug store facial cleansers, but I&#x27;ve never really felt that they do a great job of cleaning my skin. I was pleasantly surprised by the mineral soap.  Normally people shy away from bar soaps due to their bad rep.  A lot of soaps contain lye which is totally horrible for your body and causes serious dryness.  Their are a few soaps out there made without lye, but their are far few and between.  Hence why body washes became so popular a few years back.  You were able to put in skin softening ingredients without the harsh chemicals needed and clean and condition the skin at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this soap was really surprising.  It isn&#x27;t harsh and contains more natural ingredients than the slew of unreadable chemical names that you&#x27;ll find on the box of any cleanser at your local drug store. The soap didn&#x27;t lather as much, but that is given the fact that it lacks all those unnatural ingredients needed in order to get that result.  My skin does feel a bit cleaner than normal and combined with a face exfoliator it&#x27;s even better.  Also it leaves your skin feeling hydrate since its all natural so you don&#x27;t get the tight skin feeling that you normal have after using soap on your face or body.  In addition, it&#x27;s great for washing away make up residue that may have gotten left over by your makeup remover.  I would say this soap is really gentle to use everyday and the fact that it&#x27;s natural really makes it noteworthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia so far has surprised me with their all natural products by really giving me wonderful results!</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP2e401521ad94305ed0a203113292df73&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&amp;lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this soap was sent to me to try out, I was very excited.  I love bar soaps because I feel like they make your skin feel much softer and I think that the scent lasts a lot longer. Well the Adovia Dead Sea Salt soap is no exception. Before I could even open the packaging I was happy with the way that it smelled. The packaging is very nice, and I was really looking forward to my nighttime pampering routine. I used this soap on my entire body during bath time and for my face.  I assumed that this soap would be gritty like some of the other sea salt soaps but it was not. It was gentle enough for me to be comfortable using it on my face and the scent was light and fresh. After my bath, I have eczema so my skin often has rough dry patches. After using this soap one time, I noticed a difference in how soft my skin was, and how well I was able to retain the moisturizer that I applied afterward. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a soap that is not harsh on the skin, and wants to make your skin feel soft and smooth after use. I will definitely be purchasing this soap again. The price is also very reasonable compared to other natural soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM2e401521ad94305ed0a203113292df73&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Quality , great smelling soap.with amazing ingredients and loads of minerals to keep my skin soft. I packed my bar into my suitcase for my recent beach vacation and it was such a great thing to do. Perfect for all of the sand, salt and chlorine that vacations bring. Pretty packaging, a nice light scent. I love this soap and need to keep it stocked in my pantry. My skin feels great. Add it to a giftbasket for the woman you love.</li>
            <li> I received one bar of the Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Soap to review!  The soap is very fragrant and it does leave your skin soft, while cleansing your skin.  The soap has over twenty six minerals essentials for healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Zinc:  Facilitates skin cell renewal, stimulates Colagen and Elastin synthesis, Anti oxidant properties.&lt;br /&gt;  Bromide:  Relaxing and soothing effect on the skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;  Sodium:  Improves the skin’s metabolism&lt;br /&gt;  Calcium:  An important ingredient in skin cell protection&lt;br /&gt;  Magnesium:  Stimulates protein synthesis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palm Oil is the natural oil base for this soap, which allows for gentle cleansing and moisturizing, without over drying.  The soap is full of great ingredients!</li>
            <li> I received a free product to review for my blog, and I am never disappointed by Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this soap all over for a few weeks now, and I have nothing but good to say about it. It cleans without stripping natural oils, and it keeps me from being all stinky- hey in Arizona you have to watch that in summer;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the light scent of this product, and all of Adovia&#x27;s products really.. it is fresh and clean smelling without being overwhelming or too girly. Just the right scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using their shampoo and conditioner, so it is a great complement for all 3 together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to Adovia for a great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap because I heard a lot of people talk about it this brand&#x27;s product. I must say that I am passed with the results. My skin looks and feels great. I didn&#x27;t have any iterations to it out anything.</li>
            <li> I hadn’t considered a dead sea salt soap until I received this one to review. Now I am hooked! I grew up in the 90s where you were taught that if a face soap didn’t leave your face feeling tight and maybe a little bit red…it just didn’t work. We now know that it isn’t good for your skin and that the tightness is actually where the soap took the “good” oils from the skin. I have always been very particular when it comes to my skin care. I battled nasty acne for years and always seem to be on the verge of a flair up (ACK!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap the very first thing that I did was check the fragrance. I fell in love with it there. It has a very neutral scent. None of that floral or fake fruit-y smells that a lot of products use. It almost reminded me of my grandfather’s shaving cream. The kind you cant even find in stores anymore but he used it for years and years. I just loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it made my face feel. Super clean with just a hint of tightness. No redness. No irritation. Just clean. And as for my acne, well, in the month that I have been using the soap I have not had one single flare up. I am really loving how my skin is looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this to review free of charge, however, all of the opinions are 100% unbiased and completely my own.</li>
            <li> I enjoy soaps with salt in them. Especially with my hard water . I purchased two bars and hopefully this brand stays available online for many life times.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  My wife uses this and she says it&#x27;s one of her favorites. I like its non-scented formulation. We&#x27;ll be buying It again for sure.</li>
            <li> First let me start off by letting you know about some of the key factors of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea&lt;br /&gt; - Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty&lt;br /&gt; - Deeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry Skin&lt;br /&gt; - Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.&lt;br /&gt; - Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have recently shared reviews of other products from this particular brand. I really like the fact that when I am using these products I can see a difference in my skin. With this soap my skin really felt clean, smooth and nourished after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I feel like Adovia prides themselves on making quality products for women who are looking for quality and results in the beauty products that they purchase. I am also very interested in the fact that they use minerals and salt from the Dead Sea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap comes in a sleekly designed box weighing 4.4 oz. It is a very decent sized bar of soap that will last most women a long time. Because the product actually works and makes my skin feel amazing I feel it is definitely worth the price ($11) because it lasts so long you only have to splurge on it every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this line of products to any woman that wants to keep their dry, or normal to dry skin clean, nourished and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have Very Dry skin and since using this soap, I see a great improvement; don&#x27;t scratch myself to death anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap in the shower for a couple weeks. I&#x27;ve used it all over for washing as well as for my face. I like how it fells on my face, washing away just enough oil but not leaving my skin too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the Dead Sea Mud Soap has passed the test for my sensitive skin because it does not irritate my skin when I use it for shaving. I am allergic to most shaving creams, so I use bar soap to shave my legs. Not just any bar soap that you can buy at the supermarket will do, it has to be one that has more natural ingredients and not too much perfume, like the bar from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar itself is a little rough because I take it out of the shower so it dries put in between use. I actually like that because when I use it directly on my legs just for washing it fells like I am exfoliating a little too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap is doing its job washing and not leaving me too dry! It&#x27;s a good bar of soap for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used.  Doesn&#x27;t dry skin but doesn&#x27;t make it oily either.  My face used to be covered with psoriasis.  Now it is soft smooth and healthy!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this soap and I really do love it! I&#x27;ve never found a bar of soap brand or product that I actually liked, I am more into body washes but this was amazing on my skin and proved me wrong for sure! I do plan on purchasing again in the future and I highly recommend. To read my full review you can find it here: [...]</li>
            <li> This soap is the best it&#x27;s makes your skin so soft to the touch it doesn&#x27;t make your skin fell dry..absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received this product in exchange or a review. Regardless all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. It removes my hard-to-clean green tea mud mask, make-up, etc. It leaves my skin smooth; however it also feels dry in some areas. My t area on my face and my chin is prone to dryness while the rest can get a bit oily. Be sure to use a face moisturizer after use and problem solved.</li>
            <li> The Adovia Salt Soap did not work for me it left my skin itchy, felt like bugs crawing on it.</li>
            <li> This product is everything it claims to be and more! My skin feels soft and clean after every use. I haven&#x27;t even run out and I&#x27;ve already ordered more!</li>
            <li> I love this all-natural soap. It makes the skin tingle.  After use, skin feels refreshed, hydrated, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really love how refreshing this soap is. There is a very natural scent to it, no fragrances which is great for people with sensitive skin. It also isn&#x27;t drying, nothing like using a soap and have it dry out your face, to the point where you feel like you&#x27;re getting over a sunburn! This is moisturizing, leaves your face feeling clean, and refreshed. Looking healthy, and moisturized. I do primarily use this on my face, more than my body. I find there is no film, or residue left after using this soap as well.  Product received for review.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my skin. But price is absurd for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced. I have seen shea butter soaps that are better for half the price plus the bar design is so plain you would think you bought this from the grocery store so it fails as a gift-so much so that when it arrived both bars were partially hanging out of a flimsey cardboard package. Definately Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am going to start with I got this product for free in exchange to test and review the product with my honest opinion! I really do like this product and the way it makes my skin feel! Only thing I don&#x27;t care much about it is the smell! Its probably the dead sea salt, I don&#x27;t know. This soap is easy to use and really makes my skin feel soft and helps keep my skin hydrated!</li>
            <li> I’m very impressed with this soap and will continue to use it. Adovia made a great product and I look forward to my daily showers so I can use this soap! The Adovia Dead Sea Salt soap has done all it promised to do, all while leaving a pleasant and clean scent on my skin. My skin is left feeling soft and no worries about it leaving a film on my skin. This infused soap is one I’m glad I had a chance to use. The fact that the soap has a beautiful scent is just fantastic. Im glad that I have had a chance to try a few of the products from the Adovia line and can&#x27;t wait to try more from the Dead Sea Salt line. I find that the price, when compared with similar products, is really reasonable! A lot of these infused soaps cost almost twice what Adovia is selling their product for. This soap absolutely knocks the other soaps right out of the park!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the soap for a few days, however I can feel a difference when I use it instead of Dove. I don&#x27;t have any complaints about Dove soap, but the Adovia soap seems to clean my face better. Guess it&#x27;s the feel you get when rinsing my face off. I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> So Far It Is Working  As Advertised. I Like Its Non-Scented Formulation. No Irritating Affect To Report. I&#x27;ll Buy It Again For Sure.</li>
            <li> I used a different soap that has the dead seas salt plus mud.  I like this soap better.  Lathers better no smell which is great.  I will update once I use it longer.</li>
            <li> With all of my personal skin and hair products laying about, my husband has minimum choices for his skin care. I asked him to try this soap as part of his daily/shaving routine. He first noticed and was happy that it did not have a over the top scent, nothing floral for this guy. My husband shaves his head bald and many do not remember that the scalp is skin that needs special care as it secrets oils(that normally slide down the hair shaft). Dead Sea Salt can be used to remove dead skin and promoting heavy skin. The lather of this soap was fair for a natural soap. It is indeed fragrant free. Rinsed off clean. Overall he liked it and said he would use it to clean his face and scalp daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this product was purchased using a discount and the review is the experience and opinion of my husband and I*</li>
            <li> Dries my skin out WAY worse than it was before I used this bar of soap. Feels just like cheap motel room soaps do to me on my skin and hands after you use it. Not impressed, very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Good soap but I feel it is overpriced.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap. It leaves my skin clean and soft and since there are no harsh chemicals of any kind, I know that I am doing something good for my skin. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> very good，but a  little bit expensive</li>
            <li> This soap left my skin clean and soft. It makes my skin feel moisturized and helps with my dry skin and cracks. It is a very gentle soap that feels great and you can feel that you are really clean. I didn&#x27;t really notice a smell to the soap at all but it cleans you extremely well and helps repair your skin. I received this as a gift to share my experiences  while using this.</li>
            <li> ummm - better than a real face cleanser</li>
            <li> Good facial soap for me. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, feels clean.</li>
            <li> Dries out your skin. Lathers nicely. You feel clean but once you dry off you notice how dry your skin is. Must keep bar in a dry place, does not do well when left in shower and getting wet. Dissolves rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This soap gives my skin a very clean feeling. I don&#x27;t think it dries my skin out more than another type of soap.  I always use lotion afterwards anyway.  Since it is expensive, I&#x27;m careful to store it so that it isn&#x27;t soaking in water.  I like the idea of it being from the Dead Sea.  That&#x27;s part of the charm.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to be all that I expected by the great reviews but I was okay for me. It cleans but for the price I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love the soap. It makes my face feel clean</li>
            <li> Really liked  this product!  It doesn&#x27;t make you feel bogged down like a scented soap.  It&#x27;s somewhat like combining soap w/epsom salts; just a very clean experience!!</li>
            <li> Love the soap. It has a nice silkie feel as I soap up and leaves my face so nice. I will definitely refer this soap to my daughters.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap. Makes my skin appear soft and clean.  update: best soap ever!!</li>
            <li> Good soap with good healthy minerals. Does not smell, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about hash perfumes. Cleans like any other bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap..I have usd it for several weeks now andmy skin has gotten much softer and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit expensive but it doesnt melt away like most soaps and it leaves my skin so soft. I will&lt;br /&gt;buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad. I wanted to use it as acne relief but it&#x27;s too mild. Still, there are no adverse side effects and it smells nice and cleans well so overall I like it.</li>
            <li> I like this soap, so much.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea salt products are good in general. This soap by Adovia is good. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this soap.  I love this soap, feels great, leaves skin feeling soft.  I&#x27;ll be buying this  soap in the future!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, very long lasting</li>
            <li> Being in my late sixties not much works.  I find this soap to be non drying and leaves a barrier of moisture.  My skin feels very soft and somewhat plumped.  I also use the vitamin C and other products from this line and my skin does look better, reduced crepey skin, firmer skin.</li>
            <li> This was the second time I ordered this product.  I will continue to order since this seems to be one of the only things that I have tried for my skin that seems to works.</li>
            <li> The best I have found for my face!</li>
            <li> This hypoallergenic, natural, and fragrance-free soap was gentle on my skin and did not leave me feeling &amp;#34;dry.&amp;#34;  I would also like to try a version with a natural fragrance such as lavender.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very nice soap and I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that goes back and forth from dry to oily. This soap balances my skin well. It dries the oil, but not my skin. It moisturizes it without making it oily. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Feels very fresh and clean after using it to wash my face, and its not tight or dry, I love it</li>
            <li> Cleansing soap that leaves your skin moisturized without being &amp;#34; oily&amp;#34;. I bought three bars and will buy more since I have dry to normal skin-- great product!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift.  The recipient has used this product before and was thrilled to receive it.</li>
            <li> A little drying but sure does clear up your skin! :)</li>
            <li> Many years ago my sister in law had gone to Israel and brought back several items made from the Dead Sea.  These were remarkable products but not readily available in the USA.  Fast forward to last month and her birthday and the thought struck me to look here to see what was available.  WOW.  I chose a few things for her and then a couple of weeks later decided to try the soap.  I have an extreme sensitivity to almost anything that goes on my skin, but I am also recovering from a total thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer and my skin is even more of a mess than normal, and extremely dry.  I have gone through so many soaps, from bat to liquid to &amp;#34;home remedy&amp;#34; that I was about to give up and just be in discomfort all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another soap again other than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No skin reaction, after the first use my skin started to feel hydrated and soft and absolutely NO greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing people have to understand, this is not your flowery soap.  It has NO scent (which is fine by me) and it is not antibacterial, so I&#x27;d suggest a wash with your regular soap first then finish up with this for people without sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> I recieved the Dead Sea salt soap for testing purposes. I&#x27;m already a big fan of Adovia soap. This soap is big and it leaves your skin very soft! I love scents but unfortunately it has no scent but it&#x27;s stil good and does what It needs to giving you a clean and soft feeling experience.</li>
            <li> Adovia does it again!  I&#x27;m already a huge fan of adovia products and when I had the opportunity to review this item I was so pleased this is my honest opinion. I opened the package to find a nice sized white bar soap with zero smell. I washed my face gently with a wash. I could feel the mositure and my face felt very clean.  I followed my usual regimen of serum and lotion. I can see it is keeping my skin hydrated. I usually have oily to combo skin and this works great on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it at night, I haven&#x27;t tried it during the day.  I think it is helping my face look fresher and younger.</li>
            <li> Love It, Very Good Product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using this dead sea salt soap. It has no scent whatsoever. There are very few ingredients (a good thing in my opinion). It is for your face and body and has a thick, soft lather-good in the shower. This product was recommended to me for psoriasis, but it would be great for anyone.It is made in Israel.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Salt Soap Review&lt;br /&gt; - Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea&lt;br /&gt;- Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty&lt;br /&gt;- Deeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry Skin&lt;br /&gt;- Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.&lt;br /&gt;- Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, listen up out there....THIS STUFF SI THE BOMB!!!&lt;br /&gt;1. Instanlty revives dead dry skin&lt;br /&gt;2. Smells great&lt;br /&gt;3. Does not leave Skin with any residue at all like other soaps tend to.&lt;br /&gt;4. Leaves my skin SO SOFT that my husband and kids noticed i was doing something new without me saying a word about starting  Dead Sea Salt Soap.&lt;br /&gt;5. WAY CHEAPER than the Doctor&#x27;s Remedy&#x27;s that do not work as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has always been excessively dry and dryer than any of my friends. My hair is the same way. Soap has not only always dried my skin out but down right irratates it(especially in the winter).  Dead Sea Salt Soap has changed my life in ways I never dreamed possible by completely stopping the normal scaling and flaking and ugly appearance of extremely dry skin and it even reduced itching like I never imagined it could. I have been to my doctor for 20 years trying different &amp;#34;Fixes&amp;#34; and so far this  Dead Sea Salt Soap has got every doctor prescribed remedy beat!!! I give this 5*&#x27;s and my seal of approval. If you suffer from dry scaly itchy unmanageable skin...LOOK NO MORE!!!! You&#x27;ve found a friend who can help!!!!&lt;br /&gt;As Always, thank you for reading and Peace Love and Sunshine!!!</li>
            <li> Soap is seriously one of my most favorite luxury items. By luxury item, I mean something on which I’m willing to spend a little bit more money. I have struggled for a lot of my life with dry patches of skin and regular soaps often make the problem worse.&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the Adovia soap in the mail I was blown away by how awesome the packaging looked and smelled. The soap has a strong, fresh, and clean fragrance that I could smell before I even had the box open! If you have an aversion to strong scents, this is your warning. If you are like me, and love strong scents, this is a great thing! Once the soap is open and out of the box the scent becomes less powerful, but still lingers. I absolutely love the scent of this soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used the soap for about a week now, roughly. By the second day I saw real results. The areas with the rough patches at my knees and elbows were smooth and nice again.  My face feels soft and light. There’s no filmy residue left behind on my skin. My entire body feels clean and refreshed. After my showers the bathroom smells great and the scent lingers on my skin for hours, without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;Like most mothers, I can’t have a new product left in the shower without a child testing it out. What I hadn’t realized is that my 8 year old daughter was using the soap daily too. Last night she told me that it is the best soap she ever tried and that she really loves it hopes I buy more of it. Usually this child doesn’t care what products are in the bathroom. This is literally the first time she has ever commented on a specific shower product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it folks. This soap is the real deal. It does everything Adovia promises it will. The soap works so well that even a child notices and appreciates the difference in her skin condition after using the soap for a few days. And did I mention that it smells great?</li>
            <li> While I was not a fan of the smell of the soap, the scent dissipated soon after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap does as promised and is very very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to [...] to read my full review</li>
            <li> I have tried the mud soap &amp; liked it a lot, but WOW, I love this soap! It is perfect for my skin!</li>
            <li> great product. very gentle on the skin ..</li>
            <li> Used it in the shower this morning.  Lathers nicely, is totally fragrance free (love that).  That&#x27;s all I can say for now.  Am hoping for my skin to retain some moisture.  Will report back in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This soap is so creamy. I&#x27;ve switched to the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Soap rather than my standard body wash in the shower. With the furnace running all the time and the cold winter air, not to mention the drying effect of the hot tub, my skin is taking a beating this winter. The first time I used this soap, I could feel a difference, especially on my arms and shins. After about 4 uses, I no longer need to grab the thick body cream I was using to keep from feeling that dry skin itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice any scent at all. I lather my standard shower scrubber with the bar soap, just as I would a liquid wash, and the lather is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my inspection and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have dry skin and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> I really do like this soap and it seems soothing (I have dry skin and a little psoriasis).  I wish it lathered more.  I like soap that gives a good lather.  But, I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this soap. I let him use mine and he liked it so much he had me buy one for him.  He has terribly dry skin and he said after his first use that his skin felt good. That&#x27;s saying alot coming from him.!!!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the Dead Shea Salt Soap. I always shower with warm water and winter my skin turn out very ashy and when I started using this soap my skin got that natural glow again. Also I felt more relaxed after showering and I loved it. I have very sensitive skin and if I use other soaps I my skin tends to get more dry but with this product that di NOT happened.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell but it is not strong so it doesn&#x27;t bother me either. It surprised me because it came in a big box for a small product but it wasn&#x27;t damaged which is good.</li>
            <li> This soap is working very wonderful on my skin but if I can had it with Whitening material it will be fabulous&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very clean and soft I am very love it&lt;br /&gt;Please if their is another kind of this product with Whitening just informed me&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This soap was purchased as a gift for my husband, and he LOVES it.  He says it rinses so well and even washes his hair with it.  S&amp;H were as stated.</li>
            <li> I was doing some research on the Internet about getting breakouts on my arms and back that were probably due to exercising. One of the articles suggested taking baths in Dead Sea salt. I don&#x27;t like taking baths so decided to give the bar soap a try. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and I love it! My breakouts are gone and my skin feels amazing! I have even started using it on my face. I highly recommend this product if you have sensitive skin or are having problems with bumpy skin or breakouts.</li>
            <li> I try to always be open and kind with all my reviews. Even the ones I don&#x27;t care about too much. I try to always start on the positive note before I bring in the yuck factor. But there are times when the stars and romance meet in perfect harmony and I just love on something so much I just have to go tell it from the roof tops. Adovia has been that perfect beauty find for me this year. I have had the pleasure of trying several of their products and here is the latest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals. A soap infused with amazing 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea. These salts contains over 21 minerals to deeply hydrate, cleanse and balance your skin. It throughrally cleanses your skin from grim, makeup, sebum and yet never stripping your skin from the vital nutrients and oils it needs. Leaving your skin hydrated, moisturized and feeling healthy. It is truly a perfect moisturizing cleaner for all skin types. Gentle enough for the sensitive of skins and yet balanced for the oiliest of skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did I tell you the smell is beautiful. Its a soft, and clean fragrance. Perfect to start off and end your day with. Truly a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know your thinking.... its a bar. No rethink that and give it a try. You will be impressed. It will not dry your skin as a traditional bar would. This is a moisturizing bar and it is made to cleanse and hydrate. All you have left is a soft, cleansed, and hydrated face. The bar thing is actually more of a benefit for this product. We are talking take it to the gym, after a day at the beach, on vacation, poolside, and even add it to the guest room this Summer. Since it fits all skin types it will fit all the needs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying. Satisfaction is guaranteed. You have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I received this for review and considering my past experience with Dead Sea Salt I expected nothing less. It is a great moisturizing soap. It is great for face and body. I do not mind the smell although it is a bit strong but it kind of reminds me of clean laundry.</li>
            <li> As I have dry skin, I personally do not prefer to use soap because it makes my skin more drier. I have previously tried their Mud Soap which i loved using it.That&#x27;s why I expected a lot about this soap as well. To be honest, I am slightly disappointed about this soap! I know many people like this soap and even saw some videos where they used it directly on the face!! I can finally tell you that this soap works just like the regular body soap.It does clean very well,although it dries my skin like hell! I dare to use it on my face though! It smell nice like regular soap and this soap last for a long time i guess because it still in my bathroom! ☺ One more thing I would like to mention that I use to wash my clothes with this soap, lol! and it does clean well and smell good as well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this soap works just like regular soap and kinda dry me out.So I would probably not going to repurchase it again!</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to write the best review ever, I can&#x27;t. This soap has an okay scent but not my favorite. The biggest issue I had with it was that it dried my skin out. I know that it&#x27;s supposed to be a great moisturizing &amp; hydrating soap but for me it was not. I have sensitive skin, which is normally dry, but pretty easily moisturized. I have had problems with bar soaps all my life. It&#x27;s not really the manufacturers faults that these products don&#x27;t work for me, it&#x27;s my crazy skin. I&#x27;m a fair, sensitive skinned redhead. My skin hates a lot of things. Bar soap is one of them. It was so bad that when I was pregnant I could only use oatmeal based products so that I wouldn&#x27;t break out in a rash all over my body. I don&#x27;t have that issue currently (thank God!) but that doesn&#x27;t mean something can&#x27;t spark it. I think for people with less sensitive skin, this product would work. It&#x27;s just not for my picky, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really loved this Dead Sea Salt Soap. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I felt so clean after using it in the shower. I just can&#x27;t justify the cost of the product. This type of soap gets used up quickly and I simply cannot afford it. Otherwise, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I am a lover of Adovia products, so naturally this Dead Sea Salt Soap is no exception!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap size is perfect for use on the face, or even in the shower. I like to use mine with a loofah and create a nice lather that way. I have sensitive skin, and I had no issues at all with this. I find that most Adovia products are mild enough and do not cause any irritation. As I mentioned above I use this in the shower on my body, but also as a facial soap as well. It leaves my skin feeling very soft, clean, hydrated and smooth. I like the fact that I can use this soap all over, makes for a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a fragrant clean sort of scent. I find that after I have used the soap, I will have a slight scent left lingering on my skin, which is nice. I can use my perfumes over it, and not have my perfume scent be mixed with my soap scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had absolutely no issues with this soap at all, and it is something I give my recommendation on trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers up nice and leaves your skin feeling soft. Has a pleasant smell and not to girly smelling so guys can use it to. I have tried a number of products from this company and have really liked all of them.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s winter time here in Chicago, IL. This soap helped with my all over dry skin. I even use it on my face! No break outs! I bought it because the seller gave $5.00 if you bought 3 bars. The bars last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Great soap!! This soap has a think lather and leaves your skin soft and smooth, without any residue. Fragrance free but it still has a slight smell.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this soap! It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great soap...nice fragrance.  Leaves my skin soft and squeaky clean!!!!</li>
            <li> With a salty smell, so maybe we can know that it contains dead sea salt. But if your skin is okay but usually oily, not too many zits, I don&#x27;t actually recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was so disapointed  with this, never got a chance to try it.... It arrived late in the delivery process, and when it did we open it and saw it was soooo small , Tiny Bar of soap ! Omg .... it was so tiny it fit inside the palm of my hand , and I was still able to close my hand and make a fist !!! WOW ! .&lt;br /&gt;No thanks ! for this Price the soap should be human Adult size for the amount of money they are asking for. YEP  RETURNED !</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I noticed a difference the first time I used this soap.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my face would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have to say I do so love Adovia product and this one is very nice. I love they way it smells and cleans. I love to use this with my Clarisonic because it distributes more evenly than a liquid or cream soap, All I do is dampen the brush dead and than turn it on the bar so it picks up the right amount of product evenly. This face/body bar is very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals , its very easy to work with and nose a excellent job of cleaning. The company sent me a free sample to try so I could make an informed review but my opinions are my own . Try is and see if you dont agree</li>
            <li> I recently was sent this product for a review and was expecting a regular &#x27;body soap&#x27; bar. As I read the ingredients and instructions  I discovered you could use this on your face! I have been looking for a new cleanser for a very long time that didn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to break out or dry out. I use it with my clairisonic and it works beautifully. Just wet your brush down run it over the bar of soap and cleanse away! It gives you enough lather for the clairisonic to glide over your skin and leaves you face feeling very clean and nice. I wanted to use it for a while to make sure it didn&#x27;t break out my face and it didn&#x27;t. My face looks better than before using it. I only have good things to say about this soap! Get yourself a lovely soap dish and set it aside for your morning and nightly cleanses. It has a nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li> The soap smells amazing. Very fresh, very clean and not overpowering. It does not  get soggy in the shower after use. Something that I love because I really detest soaps that melt due to moisture and the mess it creates. This soap lathers a lot. Another thing I love. And it washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue so we know for sure impurities are being washed off. I have definitely seen an improvement with the acne on my skin. It has not fully disappeared but it has started clearing up. The redness is easing and those that did scare are lightening. The soap does not give me any extra moisture, so I still resort to my lotion application process of coconut oil and then my regular body lotion as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with your product, Dead Sea Salt Soap.  It is very kind to my sensitive skin. Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> Love it works very well for dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week and just love the way my skin feels.  Usually have issues with dry skin itch in colder months and this helped significantly.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have had such dry skin that it kept me from going to sleep at night.  Since I have started using this soap, I have not had any itching problems at all!  Because I only take baths, not showers, I also let the soap float in the tub, and it is working great.  It is something I will be ordering many times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering why I paid 18 dollars for a bar of soap with mostly palm oil in it. I thought this would be some special sea salt bar from the description.</li>
            <li> Works very well for my combination skin. It&#x27;s not too drying, but really leaves your face feeling nice and clean. The bar last forever too so in my opinion it is a great value. I use them daily and enjoy all of the Adovia products that I have purchased over the years. Great quality products at a very affordable price!</li>
            <li> I have had several opportunities to use this soap and so far I love it. It leaves the skin hydrated and fragrant free is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Skin is extremely smooth and soft.  No residue.  Fragrance is mild yet nice.  Great for showers after swimming and ice hockey when Winter is making skin so dry.  Highly recommend.  Slightly expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin feels very soft and clean.  Would definitely recommend and I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I have always used liquid face soap for cleaning so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this dead sea salt at a special price to test for quality and review, I was intrigued.  It is unscented and has a mild, natural aroma to it.  It lathered fine, not a lot of suds.  After cleansing my face with it, I noticed that it took several splashes of water to feel like it was completely removed.  I know that is due to the 26 dead sea minerals which were moisturizing my face but it felt different than other cleansers I have used.  Not bad....just different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face felt soft and clean afterwards.  I felt no drying effect but did following up with moisturizer as per my regular routine.  I like that this product is 100% all natural ingredients and is never tested on animals.  Since I don&#x27;t use bar soaps regularly, I didn&#x27;t really have a place to store this one when I finished with it.  I set it on my sink to dry and then put it back in the box.  That works okay, it&#x27;s just not as convenient as a pump dispenser I can keep on the shelf.</li>
            <li> This soap has a mild fragrance, which I liked, but I wish it was little better in moisturizing.</li>
            <li> A great natural soap for your skin. No residue,  clean refreshing scent. Love how my skin feels. My husband even commented on how soft my skin felt.</li>
            <li> AMAZING. Not a strong scent, and cleans extremely well. You could use this stuff on babies!</li>
            <li> Leaves face smooth &amp; soft. I have very sensitive skin but this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. Will continue to see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this soap daily and Iam very please how the soap gives a good lather and refreshes my skin. I feel totally confident that my skin is being treated and norished without being stripped of my essential skin oils.</li>
            <li> Workd well. Stopped my break out</li>
