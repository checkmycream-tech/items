            <li>i love this face wash!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how much I love this face cleanser!  </li>
            <li>and I love the Suki line!</li>
            <li>It is best to follow directions and mix with water first or, it feels quite abrasive on your face.  </li>
            <li>I love this scrub!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice refreshing scent, foams nicely, and does a good job of exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li>Smells great and smooth feeling after use.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing</li>
            <li>I got to the bottom of the barrel I decided to try and make my own exfoliant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before you buy this or buy again try making your own exfoliant like I did.</li>
            <li>And my skin looks really nice.</li>
            <li>The scrub cleans pores effectively and is now my go to scrub for 2X a week,</li>
            <li>This is a nice exfoliating cleanser for the face.</li>
            <li>The scrub is made from sugar crystals, so it kind of melts away as you wash your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel good, clean and smell good.....</li>
            <li>, she was very fair and pretty.</li>
            <li>It not only feels and smells good, but if you get a bit on your lips it tastes great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you insist on purchasing a product I really enjoyed using this one, and I recommend it :) good luck</li>
            <li>ingredients are all natural, (3) feels awesome on skin, (4) and lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I must say that I liked it better before.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that so far has worked every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>Its so effective and refreshing, I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it smells so good and so clean.</li>
            <li>At first it seems as if it may be too abrasive but as it melts into your face it feels great.</li>
            <li>It feels so good on your face, smells refreshing, and really works to exfoliate and make your skin look gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I first received a free sample of this cleanser from Birchbox and loved it!</li>
            <li>Love this scrub.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I have been using this product on and off for many years.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like washing your face with a Lemon Drop :)</li>
            <li>The product has come without a seal on the top of the jar, which is inconsistent with how Suki delivers it, and it dries out within a week.</li>
            <li>Smells refreshing as well.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, I found that because I added more lemon</li>
            <li>more then most products I bought from the store.</li>
            <li>This prompted me to search for it on Amazon (because of prime) and I was glad they had it.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a better price.</li>
            <li>I love Suki because of this product.</li>
            <li>One use and your face will feel baby smooth!</li>
            <li>The reason I love the Suki creamy foaming cleaser is because it fits all of the essentials that I want in a cleanser. 1.</li>
            <li>and it worked OK just not like what I remembered.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>I wish they offered a subscription on this product :)</li>
            <li>I &#x27;think&#x27; my skin is looking much better, although no one has said anything.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is made with all natural ingredients and very happy it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this in my birchbox and fell in love.</li>
            <li>birchbox has this on sale for a lot more.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>I have used this cleanser many times and it is supposed to smell like lemons.</li>
            <li>The lemon scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Love this cleanser and adore the scent.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these scrub.</li>
            <li>Favorite face scrub.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product in Birchbox and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling when it starts to foam up.</li>
            <li>i love this - use it every night in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The lemongrass scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li>Get it, you won&#x27;t regret, I don&#x27;t rate much unless it is great.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely continue purchasing this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best exfoliating cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I got this on my birchbox and LOVE it now I&#x27;m here to purchase more</li>
            <li>It did leave my skin feeling very dry--after washing it and before putting on moisturizer--but after moisturizer, my skin felt very nice.</li>
            <li>Does leave skin very clean feeling, but was hoping for a bit more pore cleansing.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle but effective sugar scrub!</li>
            <li>Then I put on Peter Thomas Roth stuff, and my new find is Lily of the Valley Aloe Vera Gelly (great stuff,  vit C and E and zinc...</li>
            <li>It smells divine, is super natural, and if you happen to get a bit in your mouth, which is very easy to do when washing your face, it even tastes good (not that I recommend eating it!).  </li>
            <li>smells great and leaves my skin very soft</li>
            <li>My face feels clean with a water rinse, the sugar dissolves gently when scrubbed, the lemongrass smell is great, my skin is polished but not abraded.</li>
            <li>Again, this product is fantastic but we aren&#x27;t sure if this is a legit seller.</li>
            <li>Sister bought this for me as a gift, I loved it so much I purchased for my mom.  </li>
            <li>Only good for oily skin, wish I knew before I ordered it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild (in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it exfoliates AND makes your face feel clean afterwards when it gets into its foamy texture.</li>
            <li>The sugar nicely exfoliates and quickly turns into a foamy/silky product that leaves my face squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I love that this product line is free of chemicals and cheap fillers which are harmful to us.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the clean feeling you get when you use this product.  </li>
            <li>Great cleaner, cleans like no other.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it leaves my skin smooth and squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>Although the scrub has large particles, be gentle and it will disappear into a beautiful foam.</li>
            <li>item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have been looking for a good exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li>my skins smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>but it makes your face feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>makes my face feel so clean and smooth</li>
            <li>I first tried in my birchbox subscription and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>Kind of high price</li>
            <li>and it always leaves my skin clean and glowing.</li>
            <li>my face feels so clean after i use it, and it smells divine.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel great and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry or greasy.</li>
            <li>This product has never caused any irritation and my face feels so nice and clean and soft when I use it.</li>
            <li>they say it&#x27;s very effective for light wrinkles) and some other stuff</li>
            <li>it would be more reasonable if it were like 15 dollars or so</li>
            <li>Smells divine, works effectively to leave skin cleansed and soft.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this and as soon as I used it, I had to have the full size product.</li>
            <li>I love the lemon scent, but it doesn&#x27;t get my skin very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super cool to feel the exfoliating bits turn into a foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>It is course enoush to do a great job sloughing off the dead skin layer leaving my skin feeling really smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Use this mild exfoliate every day in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have used most of the sample and will most likely be buying a full-size version of the product once it runs out.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face super clean and fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>Love the all natural ingredients and made in the USA!</li>
            <li>The simple glass jar packaging is sturdy, modern, and pleasant to hold and to see in your cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now the jar is better, the product is more dry than before.  </li>
            <li>This one is great for that if you don&#x27;t water it down to much then as your ready to take it off you can then, add more water and finish cleansing.</li>
            <li>my thing is I do a little vitamin C serum (made by myself-thanks to the great people writing in on Amazon,</li>
            <li>Does a great job of exfoliating without being too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>Lemon fresh.</li>
            <li>I really cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>but it has a fresh lemony smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I love the all natural ingredients in this brand.  </li>
            <li>but I have slowly added on more and more Suki products and so far I love them all!</li>
            <li>I am not into super gentle scrubs.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I was pregnant and experiencing acne and it has worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>First it exfoliates</li>
            <li>I love that i added this my my daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>This soap really cleans and keeps my pores exfoliated!</li>
            <li>Very drying!</li>
            <li>Once you mix the scrub with water, it becomes a very luxurious and fresh face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Love the product but the packaging fell short (see picture).  </li>
            <li>It was a lot more liquid and the jar was a bit different.  </li>
            <li>However the dryness is good in my opinion as I was always left with so much extra liquid in the jar before.  </li>
            <li>This exfoliater will help black heads and any break outs going on and works better when you use all of their products with it!</li>
            <li>My favorite things are the smell and that you can control the intensity of the scrub by using little water or more for more foam less scrub.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, I like the smell</li>
            <li>The sugar crystals are much finer and consistent in size.</li>
            <li>This scrub smells like lemon drops, and makes my face super soft, without drying.</li>
            <li>it does goes soft quickly.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and every product I use ends up either drying my skin out completely and making me breakout or leaving my face super oily and breaking out.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and if you happen to get a little in your mouth.....</li>
            <li>Unlike oily Deep Steep, Alba Botanics sugar scrub, which leave too much oily residue even after using soap to remove oils, the Suki brand is fantastic.</li>
            <li>All selling on Amazon, BUT I have to say that the Suki products are selling at Whole Foods for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>REALLY cleans your skin.</li>
            <li>I still really like it though, and its cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Gently scrubs while cleaning face well</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates while cleansing.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful without using artificial fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel like this cleans my face very well.  </li>
            <li>The foaming action makes your skin feel all-American clean but leaves it remarkably soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It felt virtually the same as this product except the sugar crystals in mine didn&#x27;t dissolve on my face as quickly as their&#x27;s did.</li>
            <li>all natural, gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>No icky chemicals, so I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>The list of ingredients is short, sweet, and natural.</li>
            <li>The product had leaked out of container around lid and seemed a bit dry on top, as though it wasn&#x27;t sealed properly.</li>
            <li>only foams up a little bit for me, but the lemon scent is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because the product tends to dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>I only used it very gently</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them - I also recommend buying directly as they seen to monitor quality control.</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comparable to this product and costs less than a dollar to make a full batch.</li>
            <li>If you have combination skin and/or sensitive skin, this is a must!</li>
            <li>and I am environmentally sensitive from formaldehde over-exposure from a newly constructed home).</li>
            <li>This past time, however, I bought directly from Suki&#x27;s website and the quality was even better.</li>
            <li>It does not leave your skin stripped and dry like most other cleansers or exfoliants.  </li>
            <li>however, the ingredients show that this product has way too much sugar (not helping my acne), and not enough natural products</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not harsh leaves</li>
            <li>Really feels like it is cleansing you face while using a deep scrub.</li>
            <li>This is the only face wash I really use anymore.</li>
            <li>I feel like I wind up throwing out a jar that&#x27;s still half full almost every time.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product for several reasons: (1) it smells amazing, (2)</li>
            <li>You will absolutely need to be using a moisturizer with this product as it does make your face very dry from the cleansing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a few tries to get the hang of using it (which means scooping out the right amount of paste and emulsifying it with the right amount of water), but once you do, you’ll be amazed at how well a cleanser can perform (considering the low expectations for one compared to a moisturizer, say).</li>
            <li>The sugar melts fast in wet hands.</li>
            <li>It had a hard crust on top and felt like dry sand.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that usually breaks out with new products, but this is very natural and calming.</li>
            <li>This also strange because it should feel soft and slushy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that this product was the real deal or perhaps it was old.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price as with ALL of Suki&#x27;s products they last about 9 months or longer; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>so soft it&#x27;s insane and has an amazing fresh scent that&#x27;s totally intoxicating.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good like their foaming cleanser, either.</li>
            <li> These works so good on my face</li>
            <li> Beads dissolve and feel good on your face.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell, and does a very nice job of exfoliating and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells like a lemon drop -- just love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smooth and exhilarated!!</li>
            <li> Love this face scrub!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> i love this face wash!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how much I love this face cleanser!  </li>
            <li> and I love the Suki line!</li>
            <li> It is best to follow directions and mix with water first or, it feels quite abrasive on your face.  </li>
            <li> I love this scrub!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice refreshing scent, foams nicely, and does a good job of exfoliating the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great and smooth feeling after use.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing</li>
            <li> I got to the bottom of the barrel I decided to try and make my own exfoliant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before you buy this or buy again try making your own exfoliant like I did.</li>
            <li> And my skin looks really nice.</li>
            <li> The scrub cleans pores effectively and is now my go to scrub for 2X a week,</li>
            <li> This is a nice exfoliating cleanser for the face.</li>
            <li> The scrub is made from sugar crystals, so it kind of melts away as you wash your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel good, clean and smell good.....</li>
            <li> , she was very fair and pretty.</li>
            <li> It not only feels and smells good, but if you get a bit on your lips it tastes great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you insist on purchasing a product I really enjoyed using this one, and I recommend it :) good luck</li>
            <li> ingredients are all natural, (3) feels awesome on skin, (4) and lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must say that I liked it better before.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that so far has worked every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> Its so effective and refreshing, I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it smells so good and so clean.</li>
            <li> At first it seems as if it may be too abrasive but as it melts into your face it feels great.</li>
            <li> It feels so good on your face, smells refreshing, and really works to exfoliate and make your skin look gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> I first received a free sample of this cleanser from Birchbox and loved it!</li>
            <li> Love this scrub.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on and off for many years.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like washing your face with a Lemon Drop :)</li>
            <li> The product has come without a seal on the top of the jar, which is inconsistent with how Suki delivers it, and it dries out within a week.</li>
            <li> Smells refreshing as well.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, I found that because I added more lemon</li>
            <li> more then most products I bought from the store.</li>
            <li> This prompted me to search for it on Amazon (because of prime) and I was glad they had it.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a better price.</li>
            <li> I love Suki because of this product.</li>
            <li> One use and your face will feel baby smooth!</li>
            <li> The reason I love the Suki creamy foaming cleaser is because it fits all of the essentials that I want in a cleanser. 1.</li>
            <li> and it worked OK just not like what I remembered.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I wish they offered a subscription on this product :)</li>
            <li> I &#x27;think&#x27; my skin is looking much better, although no one has said anything.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is made with all natural ingredients and very happy it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in my birchbox and fell in love.</li>
            <li> birchbox has this on sale for a lot more.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser many times and it is supposed to smell like lemons.</li>
            <li> The lemon scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Love this cleanser and adore the scent.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these scrub.</li>
            <li> Favorite face scrub.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in Birchbox and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling when it starts to foam up.</li>
            <li> i love this - use it every night in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The lemongrass scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li> Get it, you won&#x27;t regret, I don&#x27;t rate much unless it is great.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely continue purchasing this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Simply the best exfoliating cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I just love it.  </li>
            <li> but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I got this on my birchbox and LOVE it now I&#x27;m here to purchase more</li>
            <li> It did leave my skin feeling very dry--after washing it and before putting on moisturizer--but after moisturizer, my skin felt very nice.</li>
            <li> Does leave skin very clean feeling, but was hoping for a bit more pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle but effective sugar scrub!</li>
            <li> Then I put on Peter Thomas Roth stuff, and my new find is Lily of the Valley Aloe Vera Gelly (great stuff,  vit C and E and zinc...</li>
            <li> It smells divine, is super natural, and if you happen to get a bit in your mouth, which is very easy to do when washing your face, it even tastes good (not that I recommend eating it!).  </li>
            <li> smells great and leaves my skin very soft</li>
            <li> My face feels clean with a water rinse, the sugar dissolves gently when scrubbed, the lemongrass smell is great, my skin is polished but not abraded.</li>
            <li> Again, this product is fantastic but we aren&#x27;t sure if this is a legit seller.</li>
            <li> Sister bought this for me as a gift, I loved it so much I purchased for my mom.  </li>
            <li> Only good for oily skin, wish I knew before I ordered it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild (in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it exfoliates AND makes your face feel clean afterwards when it gets into its foamy texture.</li>
            <li> The sugar nicely exfoliates and quickly turns into a foamy/silky product that leaves my face squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I love that this product line is free of chemicals and cheap fillers which are harmful to us.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the clean feeling you get when you use this product.  </li>
            <li> Great cleaner, cleans like no other.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it leaves my skin smooth and squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> Although the scrub has large particles, be gentle and it will disappear into a beautiful foam.</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have been looking for a good exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li> my skins smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> but it makes your face feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> makes my face feel so clean and smooth</li>
            <li> I first tried in my birchbox subscription and I loved it so much</li>
            <li> Kind of high price</li>
            <li> and it always leaves my skin clean and glowing.</li>
            <li> my face feels so clean after i use it, and it smells divine.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel great and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> This product has never caused any irritation and my face feels so nice and clean and soft when I use it.</li>
            <li> they say it&#x27;s very effective for light wrinkles) and some other stuff</li>
            <li> it would be more reasonable if it were like 15 dollars or so</li>
            <li> Smells divine, works effectively to leave skin cleansed and soft.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and as soon as I used it, I had to have the full size product.</li>
            <li> I love the lemon scent, but it doesn&#x27;t get my skin very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super cool to feel the exfoliating bits turn into a foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> It is course enoush to do a great job sloughing off the dead skin layer leaving my skin feeling really smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Use this mild exfoliate every day in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have used most of the sample and will most likely be buying a full-size version of the product once it runs out.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face super clean and fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> Love the all natural ingredients and made in the USA!</li>
            <li> The simple glass jar packaging is sturdy, modern, and pleasant to hold and to see in your cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the jar is better, the product is more dry than before.  </li>
            <li> This one is great for that if you don&#x27;t water it down to much then as your ready to take it off you can then, add more water and finish cleansing.</li>
            <li> my thing is I do a little vitamin C serum (made by myself-thanks to the great people writing in on Amazon,</li>
            <li> Does a great job of exfoliating without being too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Lemon fresh.</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> but it has a fresh lemony smell to it.  </li>
            <li> I love the all natural ingredients in this brand.  </li>
            <li> but I have slowly added on more and more Suki products and so far I love them all!</li>
            <li> I am not into super gentle scrubs.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was pregnant and experiencing acne and it has worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li> First it exfoliates</li>
            <li> I love that i added this my my daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> This soap really cleans and keeps my pores exfoliated!</li>
            <li> Very drying!</li>
            <li> Once you mix the scrub with water, it becomes a very luxurious and fresh face cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Love the product but the packaging fell short (see picture).  </li>
            <li> It was a lot more liquid and the jar was a bit different.  </li>
            <li> However the dryness is good in my opinion as I was always left with so much extra liquid in the jar before.  </li>
            <li> This exfoliater will help black heads and any break outs going on and works better when you use all of their products with it!</li>
            <li> My favorite things are the smell and that you can control the intensity of the scrub by using little water or more for more foam less scrub.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, I like the smell</li>
            <li> The sugar crystals are much finer and consistent in size.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells like lemon drops, and makes my face super soft, without drying.</li>
            <li> it does goes soft quickly.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and every product I use ends up either drying my skin out completely and making me breakout or leaving my face super oily and breaking out.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and if you happen to get a little in your mouth.....</li>
            <li> Unlike oily Deep Steep, Alba Botanics sugar scrub, which leave too much oily residue even after using soap to remove oils, the Suki brand is fantastic.</li>
            <li> All selling on Amazon, BUT I have to say that the Suki products are selling at Whole Foods for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> REALLY cleans your skin.</li>
            <li> I still really like it though, and its cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Gently scrubs while cleaning face well</li>
            <li> It gently exfoliates while cleansing.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful without using artificial fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel like this cleans my face very well.  </li>
            <li> The foaming action makes your skin feel all-American clean but leaves it remarkably soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It felt virtually the same as this product except the sugar crystals in mine didn&#x27;t dissolve on my face as quickly as their&#x27;s did.</li>
            <li> all natural, gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> No icky chemicals, so I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients is short, sweet, and natural.</li>
            <li> The product had leaked out of container around lid and seemed a bit dry on top, as though it wasn&#x27;t sealed properly.</li>
            <li> only foams up a little bit for me, but the lemon scent is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the product tends to dry out quickly.</li>
            <li> I only used it very gently</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them - I also recommend buying directly as they seen to monitor quality control.</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comparable to this product and costs less than a dollar to make a full batch.</li>
            <li> If you have combination skin and/or sensitive skin, this is a must!</li>
            <li> and I am environmentally sensitive from formaldehde over-exposure from a newly constructed home).</li>
            <li> This past time, however, I bought directly from Suki&#x27;s website and the quality was even better.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your skin stripped and dry like most other cleansers or exfoliants.  </li>
            <li> however, the ingredients show that this product has way too much sugar (not helping my acne), and not enough natural products</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not harsh leaves</li>
            <li> Really feels like it is cleansing you face while using a deep scrub.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I really use anymore.</li>
            <li> I feel like I wind up throwing out a jar that&#x27;s still half full almost every time.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product for several reasons: (1) it smells amazing, (2)</li>
            <li> You will absolutely need to be using a moisturizer with this product as it does make your face very dry from the cleansing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a few tries to get the hang of using it (which means scooping out the right amount of paste and emulsifying it with the right amount of water), but once you do, you’ll be amazed at how well a cleanser can perform (considering the low expectations for one compared to a moisturizer, say).</li>
            <li> The sugar melts fast in wet hands.</li>
            <li> It had a hard crust on top and felt like dry sand.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that usually breaks out with new products, but this is very natural and calming.</li>
            <li> This also strange because it should feel soft and slushy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product was the real deal or perhaps it was old.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price as with ALL of Suki&#x27;s products they last about 9 months or longer; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so soft it&#x27;s insane and has an amazing fresh scent that&#x27;s totally intoxicating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably experiment with other natural ingredients around my kitchen at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Nearly all other facial cleansers fall into a Sophie’s choice of foaming types that strip you dry or milky types that coat you in a lingering film.)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not young!</li>
            <li> I have had trouble skin for years, and while it&#x27;s not perfect now, I have seen a huge improvement since using this scrub!</li>
            <li> The sugar crystals dissolve fairly quickly as you add water, so you get the sensation of serious scrubbing without the harsh abrasion.</li>
            <li> Different texture and cleaning that when I&#x27;ve used this same product in the past.</li>
            <li> crystals feel a little rough to me for daily use.  </li>
            <li> But I have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Small tub, tho pricey, will last a few months since u only scrub 2-3 a week.</li>
            <li> It polishes your skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> as they just painfully scratch your healthy skin and do a really uneven job (if at all) of actually removing the dead layer.</li>
            <li> I prefer chemical exfoliants like acids (fruit, salicylic, glycolic, alpha hydroxy) which are less crude and more even in their effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t packaged in such a heavy little glass container.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this product keeps my skin looking good without those nasty break outs.</li>
            <li> Tossed all my other exfoliating cleansers, this is the bomb!</li>
            <li> but I expect this small jar to last at least 6 months as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other products would leave my skin dried out or greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> This was not sealed and it had it had an odd chemical smell.</li>
            <li> My wife has purchased this item several times and loves it, but the last few purchases from this seller have been questionable.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;ve changed the formula a little, it seems.</li>
            <li> I like a little power in mine.</li>
            <li> Use a little on damp skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use it everyday</li>
            <li> I usually stray away from exfoliators, but this one smells so yummy and isn&#x27;t as harsh as others.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t always have the money to buy this product because it is on the expensive side, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works really well, but by the time you&#x27;re halfway through the jar, all the scrubby sugar stuff is gone and it&#x27;s just a weird thin sticky liquid.</li>
            <li> Once you add a little bit of water it foams up to THE smoothest exfoliation wash ever!</li>
            <li> Not sure about the exfoliate effect</li>
            <li> but isnt too harsh!</li>
            <li> A bit of water hydrates it again, but it can be annoying trying to get the consistently right again.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a crazy type of breakout, clusters of tiny whiteheads the morning after using.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s too expensive for me to buy again, and when I received the product the lid wasn&#x27;t closed all the way so a bit of the contents spilled out before I even started using</li>
            <li> My only wish is they put this into an unbreakable container as I&#x27;m afraid I will drop this jar in the shower.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people have complained that the product dries out in the jar, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem.</li>
            <li> I generally don’t like cleansers with physical exfoliants (like those horribly sharp-edged ground apricot kernels which will remain unnamed here!)</li>
            <li> Now its not too dry that its bad or anything.  </li>
            <li> It looks like a second-hand cleanser because of the broken package and the amount of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have occasionally very bad acne, and this completely turned my skin around and made my skin CLEARER than it has ever been in my life.  </li>
            <li> telling me how to do it; people saying how the pre-made products are expensive (and I concur).</li>
            <li> Addicted!</li>
            <li> Color me stupid.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Works great and smells like a lemon drop -- just love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! And they&#x27;ve changed the formula a little, it seems. The sugar crystals are much finer and consistent in size. This is a necessity in my beauty toolbox!</li>
            <li> smells great and leaves my skin very soft</li>
            <li> Love this scrub.  First it exfoliates then it turns into a foam.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE This product. I don&#x27;t use anything else on my face. I have acne prone skin and this product keeps my skin looking good without those nasty break outs. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t always have the money to buy this product because it is on the expensive side, but well worth the money. I have been using this product on and off for many years.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have sensitive skin so it&#x27;s not harsh leaves my skins smooth and clean. I love that i added this my my daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I Cant like without this product. It polishes your skin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  I look forward to using it every morning.  It&#x27;s like washing your face with a Lemon Drop :)</li>
            <li> My wife has purchased this item several times and loves it, but the last few purchases from this seller have been questionable. The product has come without a seal on the top of the jar, which is inconsistent with how Suki delivers it, and it dries out within a week. The last delivery had the product seeping out the edges of the jar. Again, this product is fantastic but we aren&#x27;t sure if this is a legit seller.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of face scrubs out there, but this one goes a step beyond the others. It not only feels and smells good, but if you get a bit on your lips it tastes great! It leaves your skin smooth and exhilarated!!</li>
            <li> Love this face scrub! Really feels like it is cleansing you face while using a deep scrub. Smells refreshing as well.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a crazy type of breakout, clusters of tiny whiteheads the morning after using. It also made my skin red. I only used it very gently and ive used regular sugar on my face before so I don&#x27;t think it was the grains, I felt like it left a very obvious film so maybe it was culprit.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product for several reasons: (1) it smells amazing, (2) ingredients are all natural, (3) feels awesome on skin, (4) and lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s too expensive for me to buy again, and when I received the product the lid wasn&#x27;t closed all the way so a bit of the contents spilled out before I even started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got to the bottom of the barrel I decided to try and make my own exfoliant. I just used lemon juice and sugar. It felt virtually the same as this product except the sugar crystals in mine didn&#x27;t dissolve on my face as quickly as their&#x27;s did. Interestingly, I found that because I added more lemon it ended up helping my skin more then most products I bought from the store. I use my mixture twice a day. The lemon has minimized my acne scars and the sugars pull out zits under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy this or buy again try making your own exfoliant like I did. It&#x27;s very comparable to this product and costs less than a dollar to make a full batch. I&#x27;ll probably experiment with other natural ingredients around my kitchen at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you insist on purchasing a product I really enjoyed using this one, and I recommend it :) good luck</li>
            <li> Great product. I like it....love it! It&#x27;s very mild (in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t burn. Some people think that&#x27;s a good thing. If it burns a touch it must be working. I used to be one of those people. But I&#x27;ve found that no pain, no pain! And my skin looks really nice. FYI my thing is I do a little vitamin C serum (made by myself-thanks to the great people writing in on Amazon, telling me how to do it; people saying how the pre-made products are expensive (and I concur). Then I put on Peter Thomas Roth stuff, and my new find is Lily of the Valley Aloe Vera Gelly (great stuff,  vit C and E and zinc...they say it&#x27;s very effective for light wrinkles) and some other stuff but those are the 3 that are staples of my skin care regimen.  All selling on Amazon, BUT I have to say that the Suki products are selling at Whole Foods for much cheaper. This product is around $6 cheaper.</li>
            <li> I first received a free sample of this cleanser from Birchbox and loved it! This prompted me to search for it on Amazon (because of prime) and I was glad they had it. This past time, however, I bought directly from Suki&#x27;s website and the quality was even better. Suki is a great company! I highly recommend them - I also recommend buying directly as they seen to monitor quality control.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Leaves skin polished and lemony fragrant without tightness.  Use weekly!</li>
            <li> Smells good. The sugar melts fast in wet hands. Not sure about the exfoliate effect</li>
            <li> Amazing product. REALLY cleans your skin. You will absolutely need to be using a moisturizer with this product as it does make your face very dry from the cleansing. I love the fact that it exfoliates AND makes your face feel clean afterwards when it gets into its foamy texture.</li>
            <li> I was sent this product as a trial from Birchbox, I&#x27;ve been hooked every since. Amazon has a better price. My favorite things are the smell and that you can control the intensity of the scrub by using little water or more for more foam less scrub.</li>
            <li> The best exfoliant I have ever used.  I bought an extra do my daughter could use it too! Lemon fresh.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing. If I could, I would just leave the lid off and use it as an air freshener. The scrub cleans pores effectively and is now my go to scrub for 2X a week,</li>
            <li> Smells good exfoliates well but isnt too harsh!</li>
            <li> I love Suki because of this product. I have to keep myself from eating it!&lt;br /&gt;It says not for use with people who have cystic acne (but I have occasional cystic/hormonally based acne) and it has actually helped. It could never hurt to try, since if you don&#x27;t like it on your face you can use it all over your body!</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I really use anymore. I think they changed the recipe and I must say that I liked it better before. I still really like it though, and its cheaper on Amazon. \\&quot;It even tases good\\&quot;, according to my brother. I met Suki one time, she was very fair and pretty.</li>
            <li> love the product, just expensive for the quantity...it would be more reasonable if it were like 15 dollars or so</li>
            <li> It looks like a second-hand cleanser because of the broken package and the amount of the cleanser. I even feel shamed to return it because it seems someone has used it for months. Very disappointed. It&#x27;s a great product though, just don&#x27;t buy it from amazon.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells like lemon drops, and makes my face super soft, without drying. No icky chemicals, so I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a nice exfoliating cleanser for the face. I use it once or twice a week and it always leaves my skin clean and glowing. I gave it four stars because the product tends to dry out quickly. A bit of water hydrates it again, but it can be annoying trying to get the consistently right again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! One use and your face will feel baby smooth! It smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> Use this mild exfoliate every day in the shower. Smells divine, works effectively to leave skin cleansed and soft.</li>
            <li> The reason I love the Suki creamy foaming cleaser is because it fits all of the essentials that I want in a cleanser. 1. It exfoliates LIKE A DREAM 2. Once you add a little bit of water it foams up to THE smoothest exfoliation wash ever! 3. It smells of yummy lemons (but not in an overbearing way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel stripped at all. It moisturizes and takes off all waterproof face makeup with ease! I highly highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this product was the real deal or perhaps it was old. Different texture and cleaning that when I&#x27;ve used this same product in the past. On the positive side, I like the smell and it worked OK just not like what I remembered.</li>
            <li> Big deal. Does nothing for my skin. I bought the entire line of products. Color me stupid. No miracles in these jars. Smell is great, but that&#x27;s a lot of money for something that smells nice. Will never buy anything from this product line again. I&#x27;ve been taken.</li>
            <li> I am not into super gentle scrubs. I like a little power in mine. This one is great for that if you don&#x27;t water it down to much then as your ready to take it off you can then, add more water and finish cleansing. But I have to be careful. it does goes soft quickly. I wish it stayed &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; longer.</li>
            <li> i love this face wash! my face feels so clean after i use it, and it smells divine. it&#x27;s super cool to feel the exfoliating bits turn into a foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel good, clean and smell good.....however, the ingredients show that this product has way too much sugar (not helping my acne), and not enough natural products so I had to switch.</li>
            <li> Overpriced. Good ingredients, but doesn&#x27;t help with my acne. Does leave skin very clean feeling, but was hoping for a bit more pore cleansing. Won&#x27;t likely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in November and I still love it. I am now buying my second one and will continue to buy sukiface. I wish they offered a subscription on this product :) It smells wonderful, it feels great and it does wonders. I &#x27;think&#x27; my skin is looking much better, although no one has said anything. I love the fact that it is made with all natural ingredients and very happy it is cruelty free. I would recommend it to anyone and may buy as a gift for some.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this stuff and had to buy some.  It is course enoush to do a great job sloughing off the dead skin layer leaving my skin feeling really smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and as soon as I used it, I had to have the full size product. The smell is sugary-lemony and it exfoliates without causing my skin to break out. Love the all natural ingredients and made in the USA! My only wish is they put this into an unbreakable container as I&#x27;m afraid I will drop this jar in the shower.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, makes your skin feel great.  I have occasionally very bad acne, and this completely turned my skin around and made my skin CLEARER than it has ever been in my life.  FIVE STARS!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in my birchbox and fell in love. This soap really cleans and keeps my pores exfoliated! Plus it is like washing your face with lemon pound cake! It smells amazing and if you happen to get a little in your mouth..... Well it is just awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint, buy it on amazon....birchbox has this on sale for a lot more.</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> Sister bought this for me as a gift, I loved it so much I purchased for my mom.  It feels so good on your face, smells refreshing, and really works to exfoliate and make your skin look gorgeous.  One of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and every product I use ends up either drying my skin out completely and making me breakout or leaving my face super oily and breaking out.  This is a wonderful product that so far has worked every time I use it.  I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how much I love this face cleanser!  It smells divine, is super natural, and if you happen to get a bit in your mouth, which is very easy to do when washing your face, it even tastes good (not that I recommend eating it!).  If you have combination skin and/or sensitive skin, this is a must!</li>
            <li> This was not sealed and it had it had an odd chemical smell. I have used this cleanser many times and it is supposed to smell like lemons. It had a hard crust on top and felt like dry sand. This also strange because it should feel soft and slushy.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this through my Birchbox subscription. It has a really nice refreshing scent, foams nicely, and does a good job of exfoliating the skin. It did leave my skin feeling very dry--after washing it and before putting on moisturizer--but after moisturizer, my skin felt very nice. I have used most of the sample and will most likely be buying a full-size version of the product once it runs out.</li>
            <li> Very drying! Can&#x27;t use it. Doesn&#x27;t smell good like their foaming cleanser, either. Only good for oily skin, wish I knew before I ordered it!</li>
            <li> Got this through a Birchbox trial, and was hooked! The sugar nicely exfoliates and quickly turns into a foamy/silky product that leaves my face squeaky clean. The lemon scent is refreshing. I have sensitive skin that usually breaks out with new products, but this is very natural and calming.</li>
            <li> I never got my order, but I did get a sample and it smells so good and so clean. It doesn&#x27;t lessen acne or anything but it makes your face feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have sensitive skin and have been looking for a good exfoliating scrub.  This product has never caused any irritation and my face feels so nice and clean and soft when I use it.</li>
            <li> This face wash smells amazing! Does a great job of exfoliating without being too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I keep buying it. I&#x27;m on my third or fourth jar.  Gently scrubs while cleaning face well</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  It gently exfoliates while cleansing.  It does not leave your skin stripped and dry like most other cleansers or exfoliants.  It smells wonderful without using artificial fragrance.  I love that this product line is free of chemicals and cheap fillers which are harmful to us.  I bought this product because I was pregnant and experiencing acne and it has worked very well for me.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser and adore the scent. At first it seems as if it may be too abrasive but as it melts into your face it feels great. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t packaged in such a heavy little glass container. My face loves it and I&#x27;m not young!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these scrub. These works so good on my face (I have very sensitive skin and I am environmentally sensitive from formaldehde over-exposure from a newly constructed home). It is definitely worth the price as with ALL of Suki&#x27;s products they last about 9 months or longer; a little goes a long way. This exfoliater will help black heads and any break outs going on and works better when you use all of their products with it!</li>
            <li> great scrub. loved it!</li>
            <li> Unlike oily Deep Steep, Alba Botanics sugar scrub, which leave too much oily residue even after using soap to remove oils, the Suki brand is fantastic. My face feels clean with a water rinse, the sugar dissolves gently when scrubbed, the lemongrass smell is great, my skin is polished but not abraded. It is a gentle but effective sugar scrub! Use a little on damp skin. Small tub, tho pricey, will last a few months since u only scrub 2-3 a week. I will try the body scrub next.</li>
            <li> Favorite face scrub.  Smells great and smooth feeling after use.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in Birchbox and fell in love with it. Its so effective and refreshing, I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I will not go without it.</li>
            <li> It works really well, but by the time you&#x27;re halfway through the jar, all the scrubby sugar stuff is gone and it&#x27;s just a weird thin sticky liquid. I feel like I wind up throwing out a jar that&#x27;s still half full almost every time. Not worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliator. I usually stray away from exfoliators, but this one smells so yummy and isn&#x27;t as harsh as others. I love the feeling when it starts to foam up. I will keep buying this!</li>
            <li> i love this - use it every night in the shower.  makes my face feel so clean and smooth</li>
            <li> The best exfoliater for your face. The smell is amazing and I love the Suki line! Although the scrub has large particles, be gentle and it will disappear into a beautiful foam.</li>
            <li> I really cannot say enough good things about this product.  I absolutely love the clean feeling you get when you use this product.  You don&#x27;t have to use it everyday but it has a fresh lemony smell to it.  It is best to follow directions and mix with water first or, it feels quite abrasive on your face.  Once you mix the scrub with water, it becomes a very luxurious and fresh face cleanser.  It has all the components of being a very good face cleanser</li>
            <li> I generally don’t like cleansers with physical exfoliants (like those horribly sharp-edged ground apricot kernels which will remain unnamed here!) as they just painfully scratch your healthy skin and do a really uneven job (if at all) of actually removing the dead layer. I prefer chemical exfoliants like acids (fruit, salicylic, glycolic, alpha hydroxy) which are less crude and more even in their effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I make an exception for suki face exfoliate foaming cleanser. The sugar crystals dissolve fairly quickly as you add water, so you get the sensation of serious scrubbing without the harsh abrasion. The foaming action makes your skin feel all-American clean but leaves it remarkably soft and moisturized. (Nearly all other facial cleansers fall into a Sophie’s choice of foaming types that strip you dry or milky types that coat you in a lingering film.) The lemongrass scent is refreshing. The list of ingredients is short, sweet, and natural. The simple glass jar packaging is sturdy, modern, and pleasant to hold and to see in your cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few tries to get the hang of using it (which means scooping out the right amount of paste and emulsifying it with the right amount of water), but once you do, you’ll be amazed at how well a cleanser can perform (considering the low expectations for one compared to a moisturizer, say).</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. It makes my skin feel great and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry or greasy. My mom started using it too and she swears it made some of her finer wrinkles go away.</li>
            <li> This is the shiet!  Get it, you won&#x27;t regret, I don&#x27;t rate much unless it is great.  This is great.</li>
            <li> Addicted! I love this scrub! Leaves my&lt;br /&gt;Skin so soft it&#x27;s insane and has an amazing fresh scent that&#x27;s totally intoxicating. Since it&#x27;s sugar based it&#x27;s non drying even in winter.</li>
            <li> Love the product but the packaging fell short (see picture).  The product had leaked out of container around lid and seemed a bit dry on top, as though it wasn&#x27;t sealed properly.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble skin for years, and while it&#x27;s not perfect now, I have seen a huge improvement since using this scrub! I know a lot of people have complained that the product dries out in the jar, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem. It&#x27;s actually still quite liquidy towards the end. I will definitely continue purchasing this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  I first tried in my birchbox subscription and I loved it so much I went on the hunt to buy it!  Delightful scent, all natural, gentle on the skin.  Love!</li>
            <li> Simply the best exfoliating cleanser I have ever used.  Smells great, have been tempted to taste it LOL.  Love this product, it leaves my skin smooth and squeaky clean.  Tossed all my other exfoliating cleansers, this is the bomb!</li>
            <li> Amazing smell, and does a very nice job of exfoliating and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Great cleaner, cleans like no other. Smells like lemon jolly rancher. Beads dissolve and feel good on your face. Kind of high price, but I expect this small jar to last at least 6 months as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love the lemon scent, but it doesn&#x27;t get my skin very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suki exfoliate foaming cleanser only foams up a little bit for me, but the lemon scent is amazing.  The scrub is made from sugar crystals, so it kind of melts away as you wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crystals feel a little rough to me for daily use.  The face wash I was using before this had gentler beads in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like this cleans my face very well.  When I follow it up with my toner, I still have a lot of makeup left on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this isn&#x27;t the best cleanser for me, I love the lemon scent a LOT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Suki exfoliating cleanser for over a year now and I just love it.  Leaves my face super clean and fresh feeling.  I love the all natural ingredients in this brand.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of products over the years but this is my favorite.  Other products would leave my skin dried out or greasy feeling.  This one leaves my skin feeling just perfect.  I will note though that the product has changed since my last purchase which was a year ago.  It was a lot more liquid and the jar was a bit different.  Now the jar is better, the product is more dry than before.  However the dryness is good in my opinion as I was always left with so much extra liquid in the jar before.  Now its not too dry that its bad or anything.  In my opinion its perfect now!  If you&#x27;ve considered trying this product go try it because its amazing!  I started out using just this but I have slowly added on more and more Suki products and so far I love them all!</li>
            <li> I got this on my birchbox and LOVE it now I&#x27;m here to purchase more</li>
