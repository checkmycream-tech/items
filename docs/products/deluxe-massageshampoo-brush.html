            <li>I do the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method of washing my hair and this brush is great for massaging in between washings.</li>
            <li>But my family members like the best of kind I bought.</li>

            <li>and it seems to be well made and of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Always good to have a couple extras around, for travel, etc.</li>
            <li>The shampooer arrived in good time.</li>
            <li>I even use it to massage my forehead and it feels sooo good and helps with headaches.  </li>

            <li>Good quality</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>These are good for shampoo and massage of the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>The handle adds a very stylish look to the brush.   </li>
            <li>Love this thing!</li>
            <li>I Love it!...</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on the scalp.</li>
            <li>This scalp brush massages nicely without scratching</li>
            <li>Nice hand held shampoo scrubber for the hair.</li>
            <li>I got a nice tingly feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>Started off with a Swissco 4 years ago and loved it, gifted one to my sister who also loves hers.  </li>
            <li>This truly is a deluxe model of a shampoo brush.</li>
            <li>We liked this brush.</li>
            <li>It also functions wonderfully to provide stimulation to the skin anywhere you can reach with it, particularly the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.</li>
            <li>The tines are rigid but not painful and give a great scalp massage.</li>
            <li>but it is very easy to avoid.  </li>
            <li>but by far, this is the best.    </li>
            <li>Product is good and durable...not cheap.</li>
            <li>I should have just gone with this tried and true version that I already knew was good.  </li>
            <li>but after years of using these scalp brushes she has a lot more hair than she did before.  </li>
            <li>the bristles on this shampooer were more flexible and do not massage my scalp as I hoped.</li>
            <li>Okay so I found this about a month ago and though I&#x27;d buy it to try and sooth my headache</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love that I can hang it up on a hook in the shower.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a lovely addition to hair care.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Despite my best efforts as others have pointed out, water remains and creates a potential haven for mildew etc.</li>
            <li>Just a thought. :)</li>
            <li>my existing better version is the knockoff).</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sooooo glad that I tried it because it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>My scalp feels great and doesn&#x27;t itch as much as it used to.</li>
            <li>I bought both and this one most closely resembles the ones I&#x27;m usd</li>
            <li>EZ PEEZEE :-)</li>
            <li>how many of you pick up a shampoo massager and massage your head when you are taking a shower?</li>
            <li>Bought two more.</li>
            <li>The cute color is a plus too.</li>
            <li>My husband and son love to use it.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality item and it&#x27;s a great way to ensure that you remove all of the shampoo or conditioner residue.</li>
            <li>The handle is designed in such a way that it facilitates a very good grip.</li>
            <li>It is much more comfortable against the skin.</li>
            <li>I thought the bristles would be softer and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>to, it&#x27;s sturdy ergonomically sound and just a better value.</li>
            <li>You were on time, you did good, and I want to try out this brush when I get ready to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>This product also works great as a hairbrush for men, or for women and children with short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The density is just right: many are so dense they can tangle hair, but not this one.</li>
            <li>The handle and shape of the brush make it very easy to hold (even when everything is slippery) and it feels very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Thus, this product is either a knockoff of another product, a changed version, or the original product (and</li>
            <li>much better than the last shampoo brush that I had, the britles give a nice massage and they are sturdy</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t mold in the shower, easy to hold and just the right amount of flexibility and stiffness.</li>
            <li>that the bristles were of good length so that enough hair would not be in the way of shampooing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s best for thick curly hair (as it can tangle your hair), but it does leave the blood flowing in your scalp.</li>
            <li>The one I already have has wonderfully soft bristles so that substantial pressure can be exerted without irritation or pain, thus allowing for effective scalp stimulation.  </li>
            <li>The brush is really stylish and of high quality.</li>
            <li>-Easy grip    - Gentle on hair ( your hair doesn&#x27;t fall out while brushing )    </li>
            <li>so it is important for me to really rub my scalp and get the shampoo</li>
            <li>The brush tips are made of silicon which gives a more natural feel than plastic when massaging your scalp.   </li>
            <li>As for the price, I think it is worth every penny</li>
            <li>These things are worth investing in and using.</li>
            <li>I would buy again- worth the money.</li>
            <li>Friendly company and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed my hair with it, and used it to comb through conditioner right in the shower.</li>
            <li>little device is not only excellent for massaging the scalp.</li>
            <li>The handle is pretty sturdy and ergonomic.</li>
            <li>Really pretty ...</li>
            <li>When I saw this one it was exactly what I was looking for with the longer flexible bristles.  </li>
            <li>I have this brush and used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>This is sturdy and is exactly what I was looking for in a shampoo brush.  </li>
            <li>This has made shampooing my hair so much easier!</li>
            <li>Only wish I could pick the color :)</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a massage/shampoo brush</li>
            <li>but I broke the first one when I dropped it and the handle came off when it hit the tile floor.</li>
            <li>Tried it the shampoo brush out for the first time-</li>
            <li>the positive-</li>
            <li>and it is worth the two or so dollars more you pay over other brands.</li>
            <li>I love that you can hang it to dry.</li>
            <li>It is made of solid and strong plastic.</li>
            <li>The bristles are not too hard and feel good.</li>
            <li>Its strands are harder than you would think, I use it sometimes, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>With that much money that I paid, how did this happen?</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Also, who wants to have to hassle with a fussy rinse routine?</li>
            <li>Really like it</li>
            <li>helped my hair so much when I shampoo it.</li>
            <li>This is much, much better than other scalp/shampoo brushes.</li>
            <li>The first is [[ASIN:1929587007 dry-skin brushing]], which uses a natural, vegetable-derived, somewhat-stiff [[ASIN:B005P0CQJS brush]] to stimulate the skin of the body.</li>
            <li>There are two schools of thought regarding stimulating the skin and connective tissue just beneath it that inspired me to use this particular implement in that way.</li>
            <li>In particular, the sensation of rubbing it over the palm of the hands creates an immediate sense of relaxation and well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ts very hard and does not feel good.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower - highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This massager seems to be of high quality</li>
            <li>I disagree with other reviews that said that the plastic could easily break.   </li>
            <li>It matches 90% of original Swissco product but the bristles are slightly harder.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s comfortable in your hand, helps massage and stimulate the scalp moderately gently (the nubs are a bit stiff) as I</li>
            <li>I found the exact same brush design at Sally Beauty supply for $1.99.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d actually rate this much higher if it wasn&#x27;t for a rather mind boggling flaw in it&#x27;s design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually works better when I&#x27;m in the shower and use it to help break down my inner/outer thighs to get the blood flowing..</li>
            <li>and I love that the nubs are not too hard.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this brush frequently since I bought it a couple of months ago</li>
            <li>It stimulates the scalp and my hair is soft and detangled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is comfortable on my head, and allows me to slough off the dead, itchy skin on my scalp while I shampoo.  </li>
            <li>the way, this is not the only brand of this particular style of massage/shampoo brush.</li>
            <li>Can pull out hair or damage it if you&#x27;re too rough, so be gentle!</li>
            <li>The bristles are flexible but larger and whether someone likes them that way or will find them too large is probably a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li>Who cares that it costs a little more than others---it&#x27;s still not much money</li>
            <li>Eventually I decided I wanted another for our second bath and purchased a cheap imitation which broke within a month of occasional use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my old cheapie shampoo scrubber that lasted for years.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to get pink or purple.</li>
            <li>and I find that a circular motion on my scalp can tangle my hair if I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li>It can be used on thick curly hair just use common sense to avoid tangling or use it after detangling to get a good scalp massage...</li>
            <li>The brush tips are not too hard and not too soft; they are just right.</li>

            <li> This has made shampooing my hair so much easier!</li>
            <li> Only wish I could pick the color :)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a massage/shampoo brush</li>
            <li> but I broke the first one when I dropped it and the handle came off when it hit the tile floor.</li>
            <li> Tried it the shampoo brush out for the first time-</li>
            <li> the positive-</li>
            <li> and it is worth the two or so dollars more you pay over other brands.</li>
            <li> I love that you can hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> It is made of solid and strong plastic.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard and feel good.</li>
            <li> Its strands are harder than you would think, I use it sometimes, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> With that much money that I paid, how did this happen?</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Also, who wants to have to hassle with a fussy rinse routine?</li>
            <li> Really like it</li>
            <li> helped my hair so much when I shampoo it.</li>
            <li> This is much, much better than other scalp/shampoo brushes.</li>
            <li> The first is [[ASIN:1929587007 dry-skin brushing]], which uses a natural, vegetable-derived, somewhat-stiff [[ASIN:B005P0CQJS brush]] to stimulate the skin of the body.</li>
            <li> There are two schools of thought regarding stimulating the skin and connective tissue just beneath it that inspired me to use this particular implement in that way.</li>
            <li> In particular, the sensation of rubbing it over the palm of the hands creates an immediate sense of relaxation and well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts very hard and does not feel good.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This massager seems to be of high quality</li>
            <li> I disagree with other reviews that said that the plastic could easily break.   </li>
            <li> It matches 90% of original Swissco product but the bristles are slightly harder.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s comfortable in your hand, helps massage and stimulate the scalp moderately gently (the nubs are a bit stiff) as I</li>
            <li> I found the exact same brush design at Sally Beauty supply for $1.99.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually rate this much higher if it wasn&#x27;t for a rather mind boggling flaw in it&#x27;s design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually works better when I&#x27;m in the shower and use it to help break down my inner/outer thighs to get the blood flowing..</li>
            <li> and I love that the nubs are not too hard.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this brush frequently since I bought it a couple of months ago</li>
            <li> It stimulates the scalp and my hair is soft and detangled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is comfortable on my head, and allows me to slough off the dead, itchy skin on my scalp while I shampoo.  </li>
            <li> the way, this is not the only brand of this particular style of massage/shampoo brush.</li>
            <li> Can pull out hair or damage it if you&#x27;re too rough, so be gentle!</li>
            <li> The bristles are flexible but larger and whether someone likes them that way or will find them too large is probably a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li> Who cares that it costs a little more than others---it&#x27;s still not much money</li>
            <li> Eventually I decided I wanted another for our second bath and purchased a cheap imitation which broke within a month of occasional use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to my old cheapie shampoo scrubber that lasted for years.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to get pink or purple.</li>
            <li> and I find that a circular motion on my scalp can tangle my hair if I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li> It can be used on thick curly hair just use common sense to avoid tangling or use it after detangling to get a good scalp massage...</li>
            <li> The brush tips are not too hard and not too soft; they are just right.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy, the bristles are firm enough to really scrub your scalp, but not too hard to where its gonna hurt you.</li>
            <li> During the changing of the seasons, I suffer from dry, itchy scalp that leaves flakes similar to dandruff - only they aren&#x27;t oil-based...more like skin peeling from a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is much nicer looking than some of the others out there and has a small rope for hanging off of the soap dish in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It is also more expensive than some of the other brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard, doesn&#x27;t really work like you&#x27;d think</li>
            <li> If you have one near you save yourself a few bucks and buy it there.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> I tried a mixture of the principles of both, using this brush from head to toe, and I prefer it to either dry brushing or the MELT technique with balls.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with a dry scalp shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many other scalp massagers I had in the past, the brush tips are very thick (not pointy) allowing it to be used for long times without causing a burning sensation which you typically experience with the other brands due to them being too pointy.</li>
            <li> Previously, we&#x27;ve used several other ones-</li>
            <li> and I really feel it helped me induce blood circulation in my scalp without causing any breakage of my hair or irritating my scalp skin.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not so rough on my scalp.</li>
            <li> the entire thing gradually fills with soapy dirty water from shampooing your hair clean and it is not easy to flush out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, unless you like potentially revisiting the residue collected from past showers, this is NOT the shampoo brush you were looking for.</li>
            <li> The second is [[ASIN:0062065351 The MELT Method]], which uses small, firm [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The bristles were too short and close together for thick hair and it scratched the scalp instead of massaging it.  </li>
            <li> I have really long thick hair</li>
            <li> the colors and everything, but it seemed to me this would be a little less \\&quot;stiff\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but it is not easy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and dry scalp</li>
            <li> I had purchase a different massage shampoo brush that was useless.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be rigid because I had a shampooer in the past that was..</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 and 1 has a small crack and 1 has the damaged bristles.</li>
            <li> hard plastic bristles</li>
            <li> If you happen to drop this from a height onto a hard surface, there is a chance the handle will chip.</li>
            <li> Using silicone rather than hard, scratchy</li>
            <li> Hard to find this item elsewhere.</li>
            <li> For starters Amazon&#x27;s packing sucks.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem poorly attached.</li>
            <li> These brushes are difficult to find except at holiday time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this-</li>
            <li> but was very disappointed that bristles are quite firm and irritate scalp if any substantial pressure is applied.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a high quality item and it&#x27;s a great way to ensure that you remove all of the shampoo or conditioner residue.</li>
            <li> I purchased the brush for cowashing and it does a great job of cleaning and massaging the scalp. The bristles are not too hard and feel good. The handle is pretty sturdy and ergonomic. The fact that you can hang it and the color is a plus. Good quality for the price, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> Really pretty ... the colors and everything, but it seemed to me this would be a little less \\&quot;stiff\\&quot;. Its strands are harder than you would think, I use it sometimes, but don&#x27;t love it. Not the best scalp massage at all. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I want to know this 4 pcs ? when I buy this item?</li>
            <li> Love this thing! I read it helps with hair loss to use a shampoo brush and also helps reduce stress. I use it every day during the conditioner part. Untangles my hair and massages my scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as I was looking for a brush to massage my scalp while shampooing my hair in the shower. The brush is really stylish and of high quality. It is made of solid and strong plastic. I disagree with other reviews that said that the plastic could easily break.   The handle is designed in such a way that it facilitates a very good grip. The handle slides between your two fingers preventing any sliparage of the brush while massaging your scalp. The handle adds a very stylish look to the brush.   The brush tips are not too hard and not too soft; they are just right. Unlike many other scalp massagers I had in the past, the brush tips are very thick (not pointy) allowing it to be used for long times without causing a burning sensation which you typically experience with the other brands due to them being too pointy. The brush tips are made of silicon which gives a more natural feel than plastic when massaging your scalp.   I have been using this brush frequently since I bought it a couple of months ago and I really feel it helped me induce blood circulation in my scalp without causing any breakage of my hair or irritating my scalp skin.  As for the price, I think it is worth every penny and it is worth the two or so dollars more you pay over other brands.</li>
            <li> My mother has been looking for a great scalp brush- and this product has been excellent!  Previously, we&#x27;ve used several other ones- but by far, this is the best.    PROS:    -Easy grip    - Gentle on hair ( your hair doesn&#x27;t fall out while brushing )    - Feels great!    Cons:    -Haven&#x27;t found any yet.    My mother did not have a lot of hair..but after years of using these scalp brushes she has a lot more hair than she did before.  These things are worth investing in and using.</li>
            <li> I had purchase a different massage shampoo brush that was useless.  The bristles were too short and close together for thick hair and it scratched the scalp instead of massaging it.  When I saw this one it was exactly what I was looking for with the longer flexible bristles.  This scalp brush massages nicely without scratching and it seems to be well made and of good quality.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  Always good to have a couple extras around, for travel, etc.</li>
            <li> The shampooer arrived in good time. I try this product and  in my opinion, it is flexible not rigid.  I was expecting it to be rigid because I had a shampooer in the past that was.. the bristles on this shampooer were more flexible and do not massage my scalp as I hoped. However I do like that the bristles were of good length so that enough hair would not be in the way of shampooing.</li>
            <li> Nice hand held shampoo scrubber for the hair. Durable quality, oval size is easier to hold onto the handle.</li>
            <li> hard plastic bristles</li>
            <li> Friendly company and fast shipping. This is the best scalp brush ever! Say goodbye to dandruff shampoos and hello to beautiful hair! Won&#x27;t mold in the shower, easy to hold and just the right amount of flexibility and stiffness. Fabulous!!! Great for itchy winter scalp.</li>
            <li> I have this brush and used it for the first time yesterday. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s best for thick curly hair (as it can tangle your hair), but it does leave the blood flowing in your scalp. I got a nice tingly feeling after using it. I found the exact same brush design at Sally Beauty supply for $1.99. If you have one near you save yourself a few bucks and buy it there.</li>
            <li> Works as it should to rid my scalp of flakes when co-washing. Can pull out hair or damage it if you&#x27;re too rough, so be gentle!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard, doesn&#x27;t really work like you&#x27;d think</li>
            <li> Okay so I found this about a month ago and though I&#x27;d buy it to try and sooth my headache I had in the shower.. I Love it!...And as an extra added bonus it can be used in place of the Bliss cellulite massager.  It actually works better when I&#x27;m in the shower and use it to help break down my inner/outer thighs to get the blood flowing.. It&#x27;s about $18 cheaper then the cellulite massager that the brand Bliss cells for.  So with this product I get 2 for the price of one..I even use it to massage my forehead and it feels sooo good and helps with headaches.  Hey for under $3 you can&#x27;t beat that right...cheaper than medication..</li>
            <li> This is sturdy and is exactly what I was looking for in a shampoo brush.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> For starters Amazon&#x27;s packing sucks. The brush arrived broken and appears to be made of really cheap brittle plastic. The bristles seem poorly attached. I&#x27;ll go back to my old cheapie shampoo scrubber that lasted for years.</li>
            <li> These brushes are difficult to find except at holiday time. They are well built at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Started off with a Swissco 4 years ago and loved it, gifted one to my sister who also loves hers.  Eventually I decided I wanted another for our second bath and purchased a cheap imitation which broke within a month of occasional use (if the bristle pad falls out it cannot just be pressed back in, must be glued somehow). I should have just gone with this tried and true version that I already knew was good.  Why not 5 stars?  If you happen to drop this from a height onto a hard surface, there is a chance the handle will chip.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to get pink or purple. I just got this and I haven&#x27;t gotten to test this product I will soon though.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to receive my brush. And I looked forward to using it.Yet I noticed some cracks in it.With that much money that I paid, how did this happen? I want an exchange if this item is to be rated 5-stars. Please contact me if you will. And thank you for your great service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-Amazon corrected the pproblem for me.Another brush was sent to me, and the seller did a 5-star instead of 4-star-that was a mistake on MY behalf, not the seller. You were on time, you did good, and I want to try out this brush when I get ready to wash my hair. Thank you for all the good you have done.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I do the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method of washing my hair and this brush is great for massaging in between washings. I keep it in the shower - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this- but it works great! I have very thick hair and dry scalp so it is important for me to really rub my scalp and get the shampoo in- but it is not easy. This has made shampooing my hair so much easier! Only wish I could pick the color :)</li>
            <li> This is an upscale version of an old-fashioned shampoo brush.  It is much nicer looking than some of the others out there and has a small rope for hanging off of the soap dish in the shower.  The handle allows you to hold the brush in the palm of your hand when you are in the shower.  The handle and shape of the brush make it very easy to hold (even when everything is slippery) and it feels very sturdy.  The bristles are flexible but larger and whether someone likes them that way or will find them too large is probably a matter of personal preference.  I have long hair and I find that a circular motion on my scalp can tangle my hair if I&#x27;m not careful but it is very easy to avoid.  I even use this brush to &#x27;comb&#x27; conditioner through my hair and it works well for that too.</li>
            <li> this product is perfect for my hair and scalp.  The bristles are not so rough on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This truly is a deluxe model of a shampoo brush. Using silicone rather than hard, scratchy [[ASIN:B000NJG82W plastic]] for the massage tips is a terrific idea. It is much more comfortable against the skin. This product also works great as a hairbrush for men, or for women and children with short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little device is not only excellent for massaging the scalp. It also functions wonderfully to provide stimulation to the skin anywhere you can reach with it, particularly the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. There are two schools of thought regarding stimulating the skin and connective tissue just beneath it that inspired me to use this particular implement in that way. The first is [[ASIN:1929587007 dry-skin brushing]], which uses a natural, vegetable-derived, somewhat-stiff [[ASIN:B005P0CQJS brush]] to stimulate the skin of the body. The second is [[ASIN:0062065351 The MELT Method]], which uses small, firm [[ASIN:B001CS7O4O balls]] to massage the hands and feet. I tried a mixture of the principles of both, using this brush from head to toe, and I prefer it to either dry brushing or the MELT technique with balls. In particular, the sensation of rubbing it over the palm of the hands creates an immediate sense of relaxation and well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this is not the only brand of this particular style of massage/shampoo brush. There are several others sold here on Amazon that are almost identical to this one, including those made by [[ASIN:B0042UDBFK Kent]] and [[ASIN:B003IQ1N4A Babyliss]].</li>
            <li> much better than the last shampoo brush that I had, the britles give a nice massage and they are sturdy</li>
            <li> We liked this brush. It felt really good on the scalp and in the hand. I&#x27;m hesitant because it fills up with water. It has drain holes, but I noticed the next day that it had condensation inside the brush. I&#x27;m concerned about mildew and mold. It is also more expensive than some of the other brushes.</li>
            <li> This works well for its intended purpose: to massage your scalp as you&#x27;re washing it.  The handle does slip out of my hands on occasion, but that&#x27;s no big deal to me.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy, the bristles are firm enough to really scrub your scalp, but not too hard to where its gonna hurt you. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is much, much better than other scalp/shampoo brushes. It feels amazing on the scalp. The tines are rigid but not painful and give a great scalp massage. The density is just right: many are so dense they can tangle hair, but not this one. Love that I can hang it up on a hook in the shower. I&#x27;ve washed my hair with it, and used it to comb through conditioner right in the shower. I wish I&#x27;d discovered it years ago. Who cares that it costs a little more than others---it&#x27;s still not much money and it&#x27;s a lovely addition to hair care. It stimulates the scalp and my hair is soft and detangled. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually rate this much higher if it wasn&#x27;t for a rather mind boggling flaw in it&#x27;s design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the positive- it&#x27;s comfortable in your hand, helps massage and stimulate the scalp moderately gently (the nubs are a bit stiff) as I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However- the entire thing gradually fills with soapy dirty water from shampooing your hair clean and it is not easy to flush out. Despite my best efforts as others have pointed out, water remains and creates a potential haven for mildew etc. Either way- the inside has begun to look rather unattractive. Also, who wants to have to hassle with a fussy rinse routine? The fix- they need to redesign this so NO water can get inside. Then the holes would not be needed. Just a thought. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, unless you like potentially revisiting the residue collected from past showers, this is NOT the shampoo brush you were looking for.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 and 1 has a small crack and 1 has the damaged bristles. It matches 90% of original Swissco product but the bristles are slightly harder.</li>
            <li> I thought the bristles would be softer and more comfortable. It did ship on time. I wouldn&#x27;t order it again</li>
            <li> I dont like that it collects shampoo. But my family members like the best of kind I bought.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my scalp. I also use it to de tangle my hair. Really like it</li>
            <li> Good quality but was very disappointed that bristles are quite firm and irritate scalp if any substantial pressure is applied.  I bought this as an extra since I already have what I thought was the identical product.  The one I already have has wonderfully soft bristles so that substantial pressure can be exerted without irritation or pain, thus allowing for effective scalp stimulation.  Thus, this product is either a knockoff of another product, a changed version, or the original product (and my existing better version is the knockoff).</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with a dry scalp shampoo.  During the changing of the seasons, I suffer from dry, itchy scalp that leaves flakes similar to dandruff - only they aren&#x27;t oil-based...more like skin peeling from a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is comfortable on my head, and allows me to slough off the dead, itchy skin on my scalp while I shampoo.  Great size, and I love that you can hang it to dry.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  Bought it to replace one that I had.  Husband wanted it, so I bought a couple.  These are good for shampoo and massage of the scalp.  Product is good and durable...not cheap.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a massage/shampoo brush so I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect. I&#x27;m sooooo glad that I tried it because it&#x27;s helped my hair so much when I shampoo it. It brushes through without tangle my hair and at the same time massages my scalp to help with hair growth. My scalp feels great and doesn&#x27;t itch as much as it used to. I also use it when I co wash my hair too. I brush the conditioner through my hair. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this brush whatsoever. I urge everyone to try this you&#x27;ll be so happy you did.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel very good on the scalp .I can massage my scalp with my fingers.  Total impulse buy. I don&#x27;t know why I even purchased this.</li>
            <li> A necessity - detangles and is just wonderful in the shower</li>
            <li> I bought both and this one most closely resembles the ones I&#x27;m usd to, it&#x27;s sturdy ergonomically sound and just a better value. This one is a bit smaller than some others I have had before purchased from BB&amp;B but it works. It can be used on thick curly hair just use common sense to avoid tangling or use it after detangling to get a good scalp massage...EZ PEEZEE :-)</li>
            <li> Makes washing your hair feel like a scalp massage.  Reduces scalp dryness.  Leaves a cleaner feeling.  Loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts very hard and does not feel good. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> how many of you pick up a shampoo massager and massage your head when you are taking a shower? Hah! That&#x27;s what I thought----zero.</li>
            <li> Works great but I broke the first one when I dropped it and the handle came off when it hit the tile floor. Bought two more.</li>
            <li> This massager seems to be of high quality and I love that the nubs are not too hard.  I got this for my daughter to use and she loves it.  The cute color is a plus too.</li>
            <li> Tried it the shampoo brush out for the first time- I have really long thick hair and it brushed through it with ease. I used it to work my conditioner through and it worked well. Seems well made. I would buy again- worth the money.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this item elsewhere. My husband and son love to use it. A very good price and good quality.</li>
