            <li>it came quick and smell amazing as usual!&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t drown myself in perfume normally, the sizes are just right for my use, and would also be ideal for travel.</li>
            <li>I already had one of Ed Hardy&#x27;s perfumes (full size) and Love it.</li>
            <li>Was only interested in one of them but the rest smell wonderful too.</li>
            <li>Perfect little sizes</li>
            <li>so you get a different scents for a great price</li>
            <li>Great gift set for a female.</li>
            <li>They came early even which was good.</li>
            <li>did not get to treat myself from ordering this set which was my original plan.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product in the mail.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely manner undamaged and in original packaging.</li>
            <li>ordered the set because I thought the other scents would make great additions as stocking stuffers and I would get to keep and enjoy the Villain scent for myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each perfume in the set smells so great, it&#x27;s hard to pick a favorite.</li>
            <li>Two are a nice fruity scent, and the other two are more musky.  </li>
            <li>They all smell similar, but each has its own unique scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the free shipping too.</li>
            <li>My daughter love this set, she got it at 8 years old, and uses it when she goes to church.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer noted, there is a nice variety of scents for different moods and occasions.  </li>
            <li>They are just the right size to slip into a purse as well.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what we were looking for in a sample kit.</li>
            <li>This gives you the option to wear one fragrance one day and another the next. :)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased this product.</li>
            <li>so I would suggest going to a store to smell them all first before committing to spending the amount on four that were in my opinion equivalent to samples.</li>
            <li>So now I have 3 fragrances that I like and love, with the forth one Born wild, OK, but I don&#x27;t like it as well as the other 3.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far is Hearts and Daggers, with Love  and Luck, Born Wild and Ed Hardy following.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new sent to wear and loved that I could try each for few days before I decided on one.</li>
            <li>Was interested in trying the other scents but did Not want to invest in full size at full price with out knowing If I would like them</li>
            <li>we received it today, and Villian was not included, and I&#x27;m very upset about this.</li>
            <li>Not having smelled any of these Ed Hardy perfumes before, I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on one particular scent and not like it, so I bought this set to see which one I  preferred.</li>
            <li>I was running out of my current perfume (Lucky) and looking for something new.</li>
            <li>Love the little bottles for travel</li>
            <li>The only negative is the scents don&#x27;t last very long, so you will have to reapply if you want to smell good all day!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the Ed Hardy perfumes, but was not sure which one to buy and could not find all the scents available to sample in my area, so this set gave me the opportunity to try a variety of the scents, without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a girl who likes to have options, so this set fits the bill.  All of the scents are pleasing, and the size is perfect for traveling as they fit the size limits for screening.  The only negative is the scents don&#x27;t last very long, so you will have to reapply if you want to smell good all day!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product in the mail. I love all Ed Hardy fragrances. I ordered this on the 19th and the estimated time of arrival was the 28th. I received the package on the 25th! I love and recommend this product to anyone who loves Ed Hardy fragrances but just cannot choose which one to buy. This gives you the option to wear one fragrance one day and another the next. :)</li>
            <li> I love 3 of the 4 fragrances in this set and am looking forward to using them.  I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to get the fourth one in order to get a set.  It seems every Ed Hardy collection has one that smells not particularly good.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased this product. I tested 3 of them in a department  store and a regular size bottle was at least $60.00 for one of them Ed Hardy Eau de Parfum . I saw the same product in the drugstore for $30.00 and undecided if the I(pink) Ed Hardy Eau de Parfum was what I wanted vs the Hearts and daggers I loved on a lady I complemented, I purchased this gift collection. I already knew the Eau de Parfum and the Love and Luck smelled good. My favorite was the hearts and daggers. So now I have 3 fragrances that I like and love, with the forth one Born wild, OK, but I don&#x27;t like it as well as the other 3. I am satisfied with this purchase. It arrived in a timely manner undamaged and in original packaging. Thanks Amazon for the free shipping too.</li>
            <li> Great decision. I could try all the fragrances at once!</li>
            <li> good to drop in your purse for on the go purposes or traveling. Great gift set for a female. Love the fragrances</li>
            <li> I bought this for some verity in the perfumes I wear.  My husband loves the one in the pink bottle.  Two are a nice fruity scent, and the other two are more musky.  All in all, very happy with this purchase.  They are just the right size to slip into a purse as well.</li>
            <li> I was running out of my current perfume (Lucky) and looking for something new. Not having smelled any of these Ed Hardy perfumes before, I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on one particular scent and not like it, so I bought this set to see which one I  preferred. Each perfume in the set smells so great, it&#x27;s hard to pick a favorite. They all smell similar, but each has its own unique scent. I was very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I already had one of Ed Hardy&#x27;s perfumes (full size) and Love it. Was interested in trying the other scents but did Not want to invest in full size at full price with out knowing If I would like them so this was an Awesome way to try them All at a good price. Turns out I liked them all and now I have purse size bottles to carry with me at all times. Would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> The packaging is beautiful, and would be a welcome gift.  As another reviewer noted, there is a nice variety of scents for different moods and occasions.  My favorite so far is Hearts and Daggers, with Love  and Luck, Born Wild and Ed Hardy following. Since I don&#x27;t drown myself in perfume normally, the sizes are just right for my use, and would also be ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> Its the perfect size for travel. Was only interested in one of them but the rest smell wonderful too. I will buy again</li>

            <li> I ordered this for my sister for her birthday, because she liked the original Ed Hardy and Villian (which was said was in the box in the description. we received it today, and Villian was not included, and I&#x27;m very upset about this.</li>
            <li> Some of the sents were better than others, but a great sample package. I was looking for a new sent to wear and loved that I could try each for few days before I decided on one. Good purchase and good price.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the collections but I can only can tolerate two out of the four so I would suggest going to a store to smell them all first before committing to spending the amount on four that were in my opinion equivalent to samples. Still a great way to have more for your buck if you are in favor of all smells.</li>
            <li> Love the little bottles for travel</li>
