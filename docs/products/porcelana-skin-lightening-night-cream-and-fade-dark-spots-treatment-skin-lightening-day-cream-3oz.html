    <ol>
            <li>It applies and absorbs best that way.  </li>
            <li>Best skin lightener I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>very fairly for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>fragrance is very nice.</li>
            <li>All in all a good product.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my cousin who is out of country, she loved it.</li>
            <li>I hope to see a good result soon as stated,nevertheless it was a good transaction</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>This does not reverse it but appears to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li>Arrived in great condition, I love that there are both day and night options.  </li>
            <li>Was a gift for mom she love this cream!</li>

            <li>Love this product for my face</li>
            <li>&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t love</li>
            <li>But the product worked faster and better before they added moisturizer and sunscreen,....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products to rid of my brown spots.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are precise in spot treatment, or else it will noticeably lighten health pigmented skin.</li>
            <li>Nice set of moisturizers, quickly absorbed and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>and Absolutely Loved it, I have Hyperpigmentation and it really controlled that.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as easy to use and good results</li>
            <li>be just fine.</li>
            <li>I have been using porcelana for about a month and have noticed a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>While the creams did not make me develop a caucasian-like tone (thank goodness), they helped smooth out my complexion and stopped making me look sunburnt.</li>
            <li>and I will be So Happy to be back to where I was before using this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, and so far I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I figured I better return to what ALWAYS Worked and should have NEVER switched in the First place.</li>
            <li>Just a light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I got the product quick and like the product</li>
            <li>I Highly would recommend this product and I am sure</li>
            <li>This product has been around for many years and does a nice job for dark spots on ones hands.</li>
            <li>As of right now, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li>First order was two of Daytime formula.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for only 4 days but LOVE how my Skin Feels.</li>
            <li>i don,t like the consistent,</li>
            <li>I personally haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation, however I would warn to be very careful with the application.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE thick, rich facial creams, but these are more along the lines of refrigerated canned frosting.</li>
            <li>Porcelana was very inexpensive and I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any results really since I started using it for almost a month.</li>
            <li>even though,  those additions are appreciated,.</li>
            <li>It really hasn&#x27;t started working yet...</li>
            <li>I think my whole face looks brighter, though the one spot I really want gone is still there.  </li>
            <li>I really did a number on my skin early in high school (sleeping in make-up, popping pimples etc...).  </li>
            <li>: the day product doesn&#x27;t have enough sunscreen to actually provide significant sun protection (and the label explicitly states this, as require by the FDA).</li>
            <li>Not \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; fragrance, as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>As far as I can see, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comfortable with the safety of hydroquinone for small areas of skin lightening (yes, I&#x27;ve done my</li>

            <li> lightens your skin temporarily, after a week of not using the product the dark spots and blemishes come right back.</li>
            <li> It takes 3 months to see if it really lightens dark spots.  </li>
            <li> but getting older when you worked outside just plain produces the freckled spots.  </li>
            <li> So many people are afraid that creams like this will lighten areas that they don&#x27;t want lightened, but this isn&#x27;t the case here.</li>
            <li> only thing I wonder is whether the dark spots will come back if I stop using it for a while.</li>
            <li> I have several cuts that healed and left dark areas where the scars are.  </li>
            <li> Your skin is softer and absorbs better right after washing your face, and it&#x27;s too thick to simply apply without having some sort of base moisturizer, but none of that bothers me since I was doing all of that before anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dark spots are not 100% faded, but for two weeks and just ten dollars I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Use first thing in the morning and right before you knock out at night and you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim a little over two weeks ago from my local drugstore after reading up about it that morning.  </li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on other products that claim to remove brown spots and none worked.  </li>
            <li> You really need to use a separate sunscreen in order to prevent the dark spots from getting worse.</li>
            <li> She said it makes her face feel soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> And after one week and my dark spot is actually lessening; It&#x27;s certainly not as prominent.</li>
            <li> As hydroquinone products, these will help fade your dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both creams, once in the morning and once at night for almost 2 months with no noticeable change to the dark areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using porcelana cream day and night for 1 month now, and I notice that my dark spots are vanishing</li>
            <li> Well as the years went on of course I started using other products and trying other stuff only to my Disappointment that my Hyperpigmentation came back and is now darker than ever.</li>
            <li> The prices is poor for only one of the two items.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy the texture at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant because I kept reading pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s and actually got myself confused as to which product to try.</li>
            <li> give me a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to a few friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li> products are a bit too thick and tacky.</li>
            <li> It it really thick, and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> So having two products is unnecessary, unless they up the SPF in the day product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m out of my Snooki phase of hiding behind concealer and bronzer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making my skin really dry, and peely..:( Just trying to lighten my freckles..</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to attempt to heal the damage I have done with these bad habits.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and I&#x27;m full West African (I don&#x27;t refer to myself as &#x27;black&#x27;). While the creams did not make me develop a caucasian-like tone (thank goodness), they helped smooth out my complexion and stopped making me look sunburnt. The packaging as been changed, but I hope that&#x27;s where it stops and the contents were not tampered with. All in all a good product. Will let you know if anything changes with my skin.</li>
            <li> Just started to use it can&#x27;t see results yet.  I&#x27;m sure as time goes on it&lt;br /&gt;will be just fine.</li>
            <li> The items are advertised as both the day and the night creams. Only the day cream is sent. The prices is poor for only one of the two items.</li>
            <li> No improvement in my skin tone. I cannot stand the smell. I had to get up in the middle of the night to wash my face as the smell was making me nauseous.</li>
            <li> I ordered three sets of this cream.  First order was two of Daytime formula.  Second order was one Daytime formula.  Third order was one Daytime order.  What a rip-off!!</li>
            <li> Love this product for my face</li>
            <li> As hydroquinone products, these will help fade your dark spots. I&#x27;m comfortable with the safety of hydroquinone for small areas of skin lightening (yes, I&#x27;ve done my homework).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t love: the day product doesn&#x27;t have enough sunscreen to actually provide significant sun protection (and the label explicitly states this, as require by the FDA). You really need to use a separate sunscreen in order to prevent the dark spots from getting worse. So having two products is unnecessary, unless they up the SPF in the day product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products are a bit too thick and tacky. I LOVE thick, rich facial creams, but these are more along the lines of refrigerated canned frosting. I did not enjoy the texture at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is very nice. Not \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; fragrance, as I was expecting. Just a light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about a month now, and it definitely works.  I put it on after I wash my face and moisturize with coconut oil.  It applies and absorbs best that way.  Your skin is softer and absorbs better right after washing your face, and it&#x27;s too thick to simply apply without having some sort of base moisturizer, but none of that bothers me since I was doing all of that before anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty big amount, so it will last me for several months, and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wonder is whether the dark spots will come back if I stop using it for a while.</li>
            <li> I got the product quick and like the product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. As far as I can see, it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have several cuts that healed and left dark areas where the scars are.  I&#x27;ve been using both creams, once in the morning and once at night for almost 2 months with no noticeable change to the dark areas.  Nothing, nada, zero, zilch, &amp;#34;the big donut!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it a bit longer and report back if there&#x27;s any improvement.  As of right now, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using porcelana for about a month and have noticed a huge improvement. I have spent hundreds of dollars on other products that claim to remove brown spots and none worked.  Porcelana was very inexpensive and I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> My stepdaughter just loves it. She said it makes her face feel soft and subtle. will purchase again when runs out.</li>
            <li> Nice set of moisturizers, quickly absorbed and non-greasy.  And after one week and my dark spot is actually lessening; It&#x27;s certainly not as prominent. It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li> Was a gift for mom she love this cream!</li>
            <li> It takes 3 months to see if it really lightens dark spots.  Still have two months to go.  Ask me then.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim a little over two weeks ago from my local drugstore after reading up about it that morning.  I really did a number on my skin early in high school (sleeping in make-up, popping pimples etc...).  Now that I&#x27;m out of my Snooki phase of hiding behind concealer and bronzer I wanted to attempt to heal the damage I have done with these bad habits.  I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, and so far I am very pleased.  The dark spots are not 100% faded, but for two weeks and just ten dollars I have no complaints.  I personally haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation, however I would warn to be very careful with the application.  Make sure you are precise in spot treatment, or else it will noticeably lighten health pigmented skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my cousin who is out of country, she loved it.</li>
            <li> OMG this works! I was a bit hesitant because I kept reading pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s and actually got myself confused as to which product to try. Within a week, my overall skin tone was lighter, balanced, and brighter so I looked younger. I will always use this!</li>
            <li> This product has been around for many years and does a nice job for dark spots on ones hands. I highly recommend this product as easy to use and good results</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results really since I started using it for almost a month. So I guess I will wait and see what happens later on</li>
            <li> But the product worked faster and better before they added moisturizer and sunscreen,....even though,  those additions are appreciated,.It just seems to dilute the strength of the product a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Paid very fairly for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use to use this product Years ago. and Absolutely Loved it, I have Hyperpigmentation and it really controlled that. Well as the years went on of course I started using other products and trying other stuff only to my Disappointment that my Hyperpigmentation came back and is now darker than ever. I figured I better return to what ALWAYS Worked and should have NEVER switched in the First place. I have been using this for only 4 days but LOVE how my Skin Feels. I Highly would recommend this product and I am sure give me a few weeks and I will be So Happy to be back to where I was before using this product!</li>
            <li> I just started using the product about 4days ago I hope to see a good result soon as stated,nevertheless it was a good transaction</li>
            <li> This product is mos def working on my upper lip pigmentation issue</li>
            <li> It really hasn&#x27;t started working yet...its been about 2 weeks. It it really thick, and I don&#x27;t like that. It&#x27;s making my skin really dry, and peely..:( Just trying to lighten my freckles..</li>
            <li> So far not a whole lot of change.  I&#x27;ll give it a  month.  Using it twice a day as often as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition, I love that there are both day and night options.  I&#x27;ve been using them all over my face so I don&#x27;t get any &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; effect that I&#x27;ve heard of, if you use them just on one spot.  I think my whole face looks brighter, though the one spot I really want gone is still there.  I think it&#x27;s lighter though, and I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, so I&#x27;m very optimistic</li>
            <li> Only thing I found that works on my unwanted spots.</li>
            <li> i don,t like the consistent,</li>
            <li> I butter 2 itens, but just come 1</li>
            <li> lightens your skin temporarily, after a week of not using the product the dark spots and blemishes come right back.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but getting older when you worked outside just plain produces the freckled spots.  It is life. This does not reverse it but appears to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li> Best skin lightener I&#x27;ve tried. So many people are afraid that creams like this will lighten areas that they don&#x27;t want lightened, but this isn&#x27;t the case here. I&#x27;ve tried Ambi and then this AND I&#x27;m never going back. I&#x27;ve recommended this to a few friends and co-workers. Use first thing in the morning and right before you knock out at night and you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to rid of my brown spots. Seems like finally I found something that works. I&#x27;ve been using porcelana cream day and night for 1 month now, and I notice that my dark spots are vanishing</li>
