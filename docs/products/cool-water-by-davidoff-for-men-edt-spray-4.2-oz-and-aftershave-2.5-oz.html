            <li>very light, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Cool Water by Davidoff is always a fine product for men&#x27;s grooming!</li>
            <li>stuff lasts all day, at some points its too strong, my fav smell</li>
            <li>However, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels for men is still the top which I use in special occasions.</li>
            <li>I have used Cool Water for many years.</li>
            <li>Love Cool Water products  by Davidoff</li>
            <li>use it all the time , fresh not over powering.</li>
            <li>Just about right for me.</li>
            <li>Amazon always has great deals that are hard to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li>Cannot remember the exact time I started.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure check out a local store and then purchase here.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>For daily use, Davidoff is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Not too strong but does stay with you a little better than others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always used this colony, I know it very well</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne and aftershave.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still my go-to out of the many other bottles of cologne sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li>The scent(s) I think are fresh,, botanical/herbal, without being excessive, a very clean smell....</li>
            <li>Tried several others but always come back to Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>This one smells nearly identical</li>
            <li>I was only looking for aftershave but ended up buying this set for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff typically lasts good through half day with that up close smell lasting all day.</li>

            <li> it was approximately the same price as one bottle at the local store except I get double with this deal</li>
            <li> Prefer the liquid aftershave than palm lotion version as the alcohol does help with sanitizing occasional small cuts.</li>
            <li> This is the other scent my husband has worn for decades.</li>
            <li> Slightly grassy.</li>
            <li> 30 % less than retail.&lt;br /&gt;Great  </li>
            <li> and this is not original, is an imitation&lt;</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> He is addicted to the smell!</li>

            <li> I have used Cool Water for many years. More then 10 years or even 15+ years. Cannot remember the exact time I started. I prefer it over heavy, thick or very sweet kinds. This one&#x27;s scent is light, refreshing and pleasant. Slightly grassy. Just about right for me. Tried several others but always come back to Cool Water.  Prefer the liquid aftershave than palm lotion version as the alcohol does help with sanitizing occasional small cuts. It also leave a lotion kind of film on skin, which feels nice.</li>
            <li> All things considered, this was an aggressive price for a solid product. A bit larger volume and quicker shipping could have increased this rating up a star. Otherwise, good product for good price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cologne. Wife bought this for me for a Christmas present. One of the best I have ever worn. This stuff has been around for years you can&#x27;t go wrong. Not too strong but does stay with you a little better than others. I have worn some colognes that wear off before you even get to work. This stuff typically lasts good through half day with that up close smell lasting all day. Your wife will love that. If you aren&#x27;t sure check out a local store and then purchase here. Very good price.</li>
            <li> The bottles I have had in the past had a much stronger, longer-lasting scent.  This one smells nearly identical but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long.  I&#x27;m not accusing Amazon here, but they may need to audit their vendor/supplier.  Having said that, it still smells great.  I&#x27;ve been using this for God-knows-how-many-years and it&#x27;s still my go-to out of the many other bottles of cologne sitting on the counter. :)  It just doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours.  The scent is all but gone after that.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is all but gone after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used this colony, I know it very well and this is not original, is an imitation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret this purchase</li>
            <li> lasts for hours very good product and shipped fast.. will def buy again from this seller</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne and aftershave. My boyfriend is also very happy with it - very light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Cool Water by Davidoff is always a fine product for men&#x27;s grooming!</li>

            <li> For daily use, Davidoff is my favorite. Amazon always has great deals that are hard to find in retail stores. However, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels for men is still the top which I use in special occasions. Five stars for Amazon and Davidoff! Thank you!</li>
