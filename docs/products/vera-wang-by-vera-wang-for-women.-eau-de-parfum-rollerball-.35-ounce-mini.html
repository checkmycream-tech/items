            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>In love with the smell.</li>
            <li>the vera wang scent is lovely oriental type perfume.  </li>
            <li>if you are looking for staying power make sure you are getting parfum.</li>
            <li>I love the brand but cannot recommend the seller at this time.</li>
            <li>She really love it.  </li>
            <li>I Love this fragrance, Vera Wang by Vera Wang.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, and can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about the rollerball until now.</li>
            <li>I was able to take my favorite frangrance with me in a convenient form.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely but does not smell like the Vera Wang I have been using for four years from the department store.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed the scent of Vera Wang.</li>
            <li>I have body wash that scents my skin more than this perfume.</li>
            <li>While I love saving money, there&#x27;s no economy in buying knock offs.</li>
            <li>Nice to keep in your purse for a quick fragrance</li>
            <li>I love the original Vera Wang scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically lightly scented liquid with glitter.</li>
            <li>Very, very powerful scent.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfume and to get it in the travel/roller ball size is very convenient for me.</li>
            <li>If you want the Vera Wang scent, save your pennies and buy a full bottle of the parfum or EDP.</li>
            <li>Lasts for hours and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>It also has a mild taste unlike the perfumes so your husband can kiss you on your neck.</li>
            <li>I love all of Vera Wang&#x27;s fragrances, but this is such a classic, I wear it the most!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m aware that rollerballs aren&#x27;t as strong as EDPs, they&#x27;re simply not as weak as this is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classic yet original but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I had been looking everywhere for my favorite fragrance when I was running low.</li>
            <li>I chose the highest possible rating because I love Vera Wang products and this was no exception.  </li>
            <li>Still need the spray bottle to get the lovely scent to last.</li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t believe I found it for such an affordable price!</li>
            <li>Good everyday scent.</li>
            <li>I do feel this perticular sample is more an eu de toilet than a parfum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a few expensive scents that I thought smelled great but ended up not smelling great on</li>
            <li>Convenient to keep in purse or pocket for a night out without using the large perfume bottle but will not be strong enough mask underarm odour if that is what you need it for.</li>
            <li>It certainly looks the part</li>
            <li>Well all I can say is, my wife loves it and says its the real thing, and will never go to another department store to purchased , Cause of the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks again amazon ... Pitbullman</li>
            <li>As much as I like it, I don&#x27;t like the retail price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll likely take my own advice and do the same.</li>
            <li>My wife loved the idea of a small container to carry in her pocketbook!</li>
            <li>this is just the right size for purse and very hard to find in Dept. stores - glad I found it here...</li>
            <li>It smells fresh, stays on long, and it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I bought a similar size one of a different fragrance for ten dollars more compared to this one.</li>
            <li>The only way I get any real scent from this is if I apply it for about two minutes.</li>
            <li>The Vera Wang scent is lovely, but in this formulation it only lasts a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, it&#x27;s a subtle but very classy scent.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last like the normal spray does.</li>

            <li> nothing wrong with the product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It has been my favorite perfume for years. I am so happy to find it in a rollerball, which is so much more convenient to keep in my purse. Love it :)</li>
            <li> Nice to keep in your purse for a quick fragrance pick me up.&lt;br /&gt; Definitely recommend the rollerball. Vera Wang for women is great.</li>
            <li> Good everyday scent. In love with the smell. Lasts for hours and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> smell did not last well .</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last like the normal spray does.</li>
            <li> I had been looking everywhere for my favorite fragrance when I was running low. Macy&#x27;s no longer carries it.  I was told to check out Kohl&#x27;s to see if they had it and they do not carry this frangrance either.  Kohl&#x27;s does have other Vear Wang fragrances, but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will shop on Amazon to get it in the future.</li>
            <li> Obviously not authentic.  Mixed with a LOT of alcohol and doesn&#x27;t even smell like the perfume.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Well all I can say is, my wife loves it and says its the real thing, and will never go to another department store to purchased , Cause of the price. To sum it up. Shes happy so im happy!! Thanks again amazon ... Pitbullman</li>
            <li> I chose the highest possible rating because I love Vera Wang products and this was no exception.  I would recommend it to friends and family who compliment the smell as I were it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the vera wang sample i recieved but the seller has not completed my order.  the vera wang scent is lovely oriental type perfume.  I do feel this perticular sample is more an eu de toilet than a parfum but it is handy to cary and well packaged. the au de tiolet doesnt have the staying power of a parfum so take that into account when purchasing.  if you are looking for staying power make sure you are getting parfum. I love the brand but cannot recommend the seller at this time.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter who is a fan of Vera Wang.  I think she will like that she can carry this in her pocket.</li>
            <li> nothing wrong with the product, it&#x27;s just that i ordered the wrong scent and perfumes can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, it&#x27;s a subtle but very classy scent.  Just recently started using Vera Wang again, and now as well as in the past, I always receive compliments when I where it.  I definitely recommend this product, and the service from Amazon, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Very nice light weight, very nice scent.  Perfect for&lt;br /&gt;stocking stuffers, and at the right price.  I should have&lt;br /&gt;bought more for more stockings!</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I have to say this product is like glittery water, almost. The Vera Wang scent is lovely, but in this formulation it only lasts a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake or something! I wear Vera Wang all the time, and I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this tube. It doesn&#x27;t even last on your body. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> rollerballs make great gifts. perfect for purse or on-the-go. great good size &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; for someone on your list that does not yet have a favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift with the Eau De Parfum for my daughter.  She really love it.  A very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen this particular product in department stores, but when shopping on Amazon, it popped up and I&#x27;m SOOOO glad it did!!!! I LOVE this!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfume and to get it in the travel/roller ball size is very convenient for me. It smells fresh, stays on long, and it&#x27;s not overpowering. I just love this scent, you won&#x27;t be disappointed when you purchase it.</li>
            <li> HAs the same scent of Vera Wang by Vera Wang, but I don&#x27;t think it lasts as long as the Eau de parfum. Shimmer  shows well on dark skin. Great for teenaged girls. Convenient to keep in purse or pocket for a night out without using the large perfume bottle but will not be strong enough mask underarm odour if that is what you need it for. Use the mini parfums instead. It also has a mild taste unlike the perfumes so your husband can kiss you on your neck.</li>
            <li> I Love this fragrance, Vera Wang by Vera Wang. The Rollerball is a great idea! Especially for the purse or travel.</li>
            <li> Perfume arrived ahead of time and exactly as described I am very happy with this product and it is a good value</li>
            <li> I love all of Vera Wang&#x27;s fragrances, but this is such a classic, I wear it the most! Very elegant and feminine.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years, I Love this scent!!! The rollerball is so convenient for traveling and it also fits in a clutch.</li>
            <li> Very, very powerful scent.  I LOVE! LOVE!LOVE it!  Great value for the cost!</li>
            <li> My wife loved the idea of a small container to carry in her pocketbook!</li>
            <li> Nice to have the rollerball to carry in my purse but the fragrance only lasts about a minute.  Still need the spray bottle to get the lovely scent to last.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, and can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about the rollerball until now. I like that it&#x27;s Eau de parfum, and not toilette, so it stays on longer. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I bought a similar size one of a different fragrance for ten dollars more compared to this one.</li>
            <li> I love the original Vera Wang scent. This rollerball was great for travel. I was able to take my favorite frangrance with me in a convenient form.</li>
            <li> this is just the right size for purse and very hard to find in Dept. stores - glad I found it here...</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really nice!!! I might try another Vera Wang fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> I have the 1.7 oz of this perfume but found it too bulky to carry in my purse...this fits perfectly in my purse and it smells so good...a must have</li>
            <li> Smells lovely but does not smell like the Vera Wang I have been using for four years from the department store. Something is different, but I cannot describe it. Also, the scent does not last. Nice packaging and love the portability. Will happily use it but will have to reapply often.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed the scent of Vera Wang. It&#x27;s classic yet original but not overpowering. As much as I like it, I don&#x27;t like the retail price so I chose the rollerball as a cheaper alternative. I also wanted a smaller version to see if the scent reacted well with my body chemistry. I&#x27;ve bought a few expensive scents that I thought smelled great but ended up not smelling great on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying anything online is a crap shoot, especially with something as tricky as perfume. If you find a great deal, do your research on the seller to ensure you get a legitmate product. I&#x27;ve been duped before and I think I got duped again with this rollerball. It certainly looks the part but the scent is non-existent. I have body wash that scents my skin more than this perfume. The only way I get any real scent from this is if I apply it for about two minutes. There&#x27;s a faint scent left behind that fades away within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m aware that rollerballs aren&#x27;t as strong as EDPs, they&#x27;re simply not as weak as this is. It&#x27;s basically lightly scented liquid with glitter. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, go for it. If you want the Vera Wang scent, save your pennies and buy a full bottle of the parfum or EDP. I&#x27;ll likely take my own advice and do the same. While I love saving money, there&#x27;s no economy in buying knock offs.</li>
            <li> It came when they said it would and it&#x27;s lasted me longer than I thought it would. I love it and can&#x27;t believe I found it for such an affordable price!</li>
