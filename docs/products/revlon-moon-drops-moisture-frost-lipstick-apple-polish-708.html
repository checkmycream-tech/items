            <li>I had been unable to find this particular shade for some time and was very excited when my daughter put me on to you.</li>
            <li>Apparently it got lost.</li>

            <li> just too expensive now, always used that color</li>

            <li> I have used this color lipstick for over 10 years and I like the slight frost, and the moisture the product gives my lips.  While it isn&#x27;t one of the stay-all-day lipsticks, I have no problem with re-applying after eating.  And color goes with most everything.  Can&#x27;t believe Revlon discontinued it.</li>
            <li> The color of this lipstick itself is pretty and true to the picture that shows it.

            <li> This is the only lipstick I wear.  Revlon, in its \\&quot;wisdom\\&quot; has discontinued it.  The color is flattering, brings complements, and matches anything I wear.  I found 6 tubes in my internet search and bought all of them.  Revlon, what were you thinking???</li>
            <li> I was so glad to get this lipstick. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. I love the color, the texture etc. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>

            <li> It was unopened, unused and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I have used Revlon Moon Drops Apple Polish #708 for many years.  I had been dissapointed when I couldn&#x27;t find the color, Apple Polish.  Had tried several other colors, and they just didn;t work for me.  So when I found it on Amazon and the right color I was soooooooo  happy.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love - Love this lipstick.  Great color for summer but I&#x27;m sad Revlon discontinued this item from their line.  Great to be able to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
