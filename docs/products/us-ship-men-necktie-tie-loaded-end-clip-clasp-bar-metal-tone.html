            <li>Just what I wanted and great for the price</li>
            <li>It looks good and all when wearing it</li>

            <li>Look good.</li>
            <li>Feel good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good tie bar.</li>
            <li>totally satisfied!</li>
            <li>Fits nicely</li>
            <li>Nice looking  clip, i get lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Nice clip.</li>
            <li>Got this, and honestly, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>Its a tie clip, it works and it looks nice.</li>
            <li>Looks good and clean with a nice suit and tie.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t broke yet after many wears.</li>
            <li>I gave this item 3 stars, because it truly is ok for the price you pay.  </li>
            <li>What more do you need to know?</li>
            <li>Very sturdy..looks great</li>
            <li>Very nice tie bar highly recommended !</li>
            <li>Yeah it was cheap, but if I knew it would be so scratched &amp; worn out, I would have invested more money into a nicer one.</li>
            <li>more importantly, it keeps my tie in place.</li>
            <li>In short, this tie clip looks nice for the price, and does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>so I need something durable and cheap for when I lose these.</li>
            <li>The tie clip looks cheap, almost like a fat paper clip that&#x27;s been flattened.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look good, and you will most likely never use</li>
            <li>It was worth the wait to get this tie clip!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, cheap, and effective.</li>
            <li>Great little product and shipped promptly</li>
            <li>nice basic design.  </li>
            <li>would spend more next time, cheap feeling</li>
            <li>It is not a small, loose tie clip, but a nice large tie clip that fits nice when I put it on the tie.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this tie bar for my husband he started wearing it right away, it kept his tie from flying around in the wind, and keeps his tie in place.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work with the slimmer ties of today,  otherwise not bad.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, but way too big for modern skinny ties.</li>
            <li>This is the best mens accessory, if you wear neckties I guess, If you don&#x27;t wear ties, I don&#x27;t recommend getting this because in my opinion I think it would just look weird.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hoping you wouldn&#x27;t do that anyway, considering the rest of your attire, if you&#x27;re using a tie clip already ;)</li>
            <li>again, for this price, what can you really expect?  </li>
            <li>This tie clip really does the trick.</li>
            <li>It looks good, but seems to have some difficulty staying in place as the two pronged end on the back is not very grippy.</li>
            <li>It does not stay on straight which is the main purpose of a tie bar.</li>
            <li>Very clean and sharp look</li>
            <li>My husband has had nothing go wrong with this tie bar, so for the price it&#x27;s been great, never has broke, no flaking or anything like that.</li>
            <li>My son needed a simple, tasteful tie clip for his first job.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t have enough grip to keep from sliding on smooth ties.</li>

            <li> Not really much else to say, especially at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect to put it through enormous amounts of abuse...</li>
            <li> The picture is slightly misleading it isn&#x27;t the high quality you would want for a suit but everyday wear</li>
            <li> This thing is as wide as Texas.  </li>
            <li> Worked today for me with a wide tie.</li>
            <li> Money unwell spent.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I have a few.</li>
            <li> so works well with narrow tie styles.  </li>
            <li> The tie clip that I got had some (very slight) jagged edges.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday at work!</li>
            <li> I obviously expected wrong, so</li>
            <li> Within moments of handling, it broke in two useless pieces.</li>
            <li> And it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This one is used for the wider ties. Fits nicely and I get compliments on it almost every time I wear it. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, but way too big for modern skinny ties.</li>
            <li> I just look so dapper with this thing, my gf made me take it off.. Ever seen the axe body spray commercials? Yeah...</li>
            <li> Great price but not the highest of quality manufacturing. It looks good and all when wearing it but the price fits it. Only when you put it on does it feel flimsy at the hinge. I have a few. Haven&#x27;t broke yet after many wears.</li>
            <li> Nice looking  clip, i get lots of compliments on it. Does its job.</li>
            <li> Once I open the bag it was in I noticed scratch marks all over it. Wanted to give this as a gift but now I&#x27;m too embarrassed. The tie clip looks like it was used for a decade. Very unhappy with this purchase. Yeah it was cheap, but if I knew it would be so scratched &amp; worn out, I would have invested more money into a nicer one.</li>
            <li> I like it I use it everyday at work!</li>
            <li> This thing is as wide as Texas.  Doesn&#x27;t really work with the slimmer ties of today,  otherwise not bad.</li>
            <li> Really good clip.  Looks more expensive than it cost and more importantly, it keeps my tie in place.</li>
            <li> It looks good, but seems to have some difficulty staying in place as the two pronged end on the back is not very grippy.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and great for the price</li>
            <li> Looks good and clean with a nice suit and tie. Good finish.</li>
            <li> PERFECT!! This was JUST what I needed! No complaints!</li>
            <li> Great little product and shipped promptly</li>
            <li> In short, this tie clip looks nice for the price, and does a fairly good job. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t have enough grip to keep from sliding on smooth ties.</li>
            <li> Look good. Feel good.</li>
            <li> very simple, as advertised.</li>
            <li> I work in a restaurant so I need something durable and cheap for when I lose these.</li>
            <li> This is the best mens accessory, if you wear neckties I guess, If you don&#x27;t wear ties, I don&#x27;t recommend getting this because in my opinion I think it would just look weird.</li>
            <li> Nice clip. Worked today for me with a wide tie. Low price!</li>
            <li> nice basic design.  It&#x27;s not quite 21/2 inches so works well with narrow tie styles.  Can&#x27;t beat the price...same type costs 15-20 dollars at sears or jc penny&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The picture is slightly misleading it isn&#x27;t the high quality you would want for a suit but everyday wear it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> The US Ship A Style Men Necktie Tie [redundancy sic] Loaded End Clip Clasp Bar Silver Tone is essentially a piece of garbage. Within moments of handling, it broke in two useless pieces. Money unwell spent.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this tie bar for my husband he started wearing it right away, it kept his tie from flying around in the wind, and keeps his tie in place. My husband has had nothing go wrong with this tie bar, so for the price it&#x27;s been great, never has broke, no flaking or anything like that. I would purchase this again if my husband ever needs it replaced. It&#x27;s a good tie bar.</li>
            <li> Got this, and honestly, you get what you pay for.  The tie clip looks cheap, almost like a fat paper clip that&#x27;s been flattened.  It doesn&#x27;t look good, and you will most likely never use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, for this price, what can you really expect?  I obviously expected wrong, so don&#x27;t let my mistake happen to you.  I gave this item 3 stars, because it truly is ok for the price you pay.  That said, I would never, and have never used it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed... Looks nothing like the pictures</li>
            <li> If you are considering purchasing the silver tie bar take note that the image displayed is not an image of the actual product.</li>
            <li> Very nice tie bar highly recommended ! You can&#x27;t beat the price for the look. Very clean and sharp look</li>
            <li> Its a tie clip, it works and it looks nice. What more do you need to know?</li>
            <li> Solid clip; hold tie well; no complaints.</li>
            <li> aside from the fact that it&#x27;s a silver tie clip, what i received looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> Not my purchase. Was probably bought by the person who hacked my account earlier this year.</li>
            <li> This tie clip really does the trick. It&#x27;s simple, cheap, and effective. Not really much else to say, especially at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect to put it through enormous amounts of abuse... but I&#x27;m hoping you wouldn&#x27;t do that anyway, considering the rest of your attire, if you&#x27;re using a tie clip already ;)</li>
            <li> would spend more next time, cheap feeling</li>
            <li> My son needed a simple, tasteful tie clip for his first job.  He did not have a lot of money to spend, so this clip worked well.  The workings of the clip are solid, and the grooves on the front make it look like a more expensive clip than it is.</li>
            <li> It was worth the wait to get this tie clip! It is not a small, loose tie clip, but a nice large tie clip that fits nice when I put it on the tie. And it wasn&#x27;t expensive. totally satisfied!</li>
            <li> It does not stay on straight which is the main purpose of a tie bar. To hold the tie. Not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Even though the product was packaged well, the face of the clip had several indentations.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li> Cant beat it for the money. Very sturdy..looks great</li>
            <li> The tie clip that I got had some (very slight) jagged edges.</li>
