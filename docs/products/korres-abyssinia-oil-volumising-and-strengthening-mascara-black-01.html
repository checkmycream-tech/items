            <li>This IS the Best mascara.  </li>
            <li>It is so great.</li>
            <li>I decided to take a chance because it was being sold at a great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Not in good conditoins</li>
            <li>but it is a good mascara</li>
            <li>Love it love it!!</li>
            <li>Just smooth and good for the lashes too!</li>
            <li>It is now my favorite!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this brand of makeup but wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like the mascara.  </li>
            <li>I only need to use one coat to get good coverage and two coats doesn&#x27;t get clumpy which is great.  </li>
            <li>But... just one more try, that&#x27;s all they get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent mascara, which makes the lashes dramatically different.  </li>
            <li>It took more time cleaning my eyes after I but it on.</li>
            <li>I have tried many mascaras (Givenchy, Tarte, Rimmel etc.)</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;d read so many great reviews about this line of mascara, maybe my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>It was easy to remove completely in the shower, and made my lashes look very nice.</li>
            <li>I love Korres mascara and have used a different kind (the lengthening one) for awhile -</li>
            <li>This mascara arrived quickly but it comes out of the tube in a huge blob - forget trying to use it.</li>
            <li>There is a very light amount of flaking, but I think this can be attributed to the fact the ingredients are very &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Luxurious... makes my lashes thick and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>First off, I love that this uses natural ingredients that do not irritate and are actually safe for eyes.  </li>
            <li>I received it quickly, but the mascara was not sealed and when I drew the applicator out</li>
            <li>But I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didnt give it five stars is because It wasnt anything that was amazing</li>
            <li>have not had the problem of flaking/smudging with this mascara, but as with any mascara, its best to apply a thin line of powder under your lower lash line to avoid running/smudging of your mascara and eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll experiment, one more time, with one of their other mascaras just to be sure I didn&#x27;t happen to get &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and now i love it i love putting&lt;br /&gt;it on because its so black, the onlly thing i dont like is the brush</li>
            <li>I had a sample version of this mascara that I kept until it totally ran out because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>at first i did not like this product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to get in an actual store where you can try it.</li>
            <li>it feels super soft applying it</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Korres products and thought I would order it at Amazon (my go to for almost everything) as it was only $7.99.  </li>
            <li>This mascara comes out clumpy and way to much on brush.  </li>
            <li>I put this mascara on literally about 4 hours ago, and if I were to touch my lashes gently and look at my finger, it would be covered in smudge.</li>
            <li>you apply too much and get clumps or stuck together lashes, just comb through with an eyelash brush, which you should do after applying mascara anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara</li>
            <li>I love the long list of natural ingredients, but it really isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li>Worn alone, this mascara does a good job of subtly lengthening and thickening my lashes.  </li>
            <li>My lashes look as full as if I&#x27;d bought a store brand or generic brand of mascara.</li>
            <li>Makes your eyelashes feel hydrated and gives them a pretty, elongated but natural look.</li>
            <li>, it was dripping wet as if it had been filled with water or something.</li>
            <li>Besides may them look long and full.</li>
            <li>Will review my new mascara once I receive.</li>
            <li>This does not bother my sensitive eyes at all.</li>
            <li>my old standby (maybelline).</li>
            <li>and it looks old.</li>
            <li>I have used high end brands like Clinique and Lancome earlier, and drug store brands such as Maybelline, even tried Avon.  </li>
            <li>Not great and not horrible, just so-so.</li>
            <li>It would not dry and smudged constantly through the day.  </li>
            <li>; bad apple out of an otherwise superior batch.</li>

            <li> at first i did not like this product cause it didnt harden,&lt;br /&gt;it made my eyelashes look weird and chunky &amp; they kind&lt;br /&gt;of stuck together, but after a while of using it my eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;did have a change they got longer and now i love it i love putting&lt;br /&gt;it on because its so black, the onlly thing i dont like is the brush</li>
            <li> Love it love it!! It is so great. The perfect mascara for me. No limps. Just smooth and good for the lashes too!</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!  I&#x27;ve always liked this brand of makeup but wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like the mascara.  I decided to take a chance because it was being sold at a great price on Amazon.  It is now my favorite!  I only need to use one coat to get good coverage and two coats doesn&#x27;t get clumpy which is great.  It stays on pretty well but also isn&#x27;t impossible to wash off at the end of the day.  I also like that it didn&#x27;t end up under my eyes as much as my other mascaras do.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;d read so many great reviews about this line of mascara, maybe my expectations were too high. But the bottom is, it does a slightly less than average job. Not great and not horrible, just so-so. My lashes look as full as if I&#x27;d bought a store brand or generic brand of mascara. Will I buy again...? I&#x27;ll experiment, one more time, with one of their other mascaras just to be sure I didn&#x27;t happen to get &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; bad apple out of an otherwise superior batch. But... just one more try, that&#x27;s all they get.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Korres products and thought I would order it at Amazon (my go to for almost everything) as it was only $7.99.  I received it quickly, but the mascara was not sealed and when I drew the applicator out, it was dripping wet as if it had been filled with water or something. Needless to say, I will not even dare to put this product on my eyes. I have since ordered Korres mascara from HSN where I can trust what I am receiving. Buyer beware of this seller. Will review my new mascara once I receive.</li>
            <li> If you never tear up, touch your eyes, or sweat, then this mascara might work for you. But I walked around with it smudged under my eyes all day.</li>
            <li> And am gonna have to buy it again coz, I  am running out of it and it is the only thing that stop my eyelashes from falling down.Besides may them look long and full.</li>
            <li> I bought Korres products in Athens, Greece some time ago, and I stumbled upon the mascara on Amazon when I bought it.  It&#x27;s an excellent mascara, which makes the lashes dramatically different.  I have used high end brands like Clinique and Lancome earlier, and drug store brands such as Maybelline, even tried Avon.  Nothing compares to Korres!</li>
            <li> I love Korres mascara and have used a different kind (the lengthening one) for awhile - I decided to give this one a try to mix it up.  It was horrible.  It would not dry and smudged constantly through the day.  Everytime I looked in the mirror I had mascara smudges under my eye.  I definitely recommend the lengthening one, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I like that this mascara doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals in it like others sold in stores. It colors the lashes well and doesn&#x27;t flake or clump. It lengthens my lashes so that they can be seen. It doesn&#x27;t really make them look thicker, but I put a thin line of eyeliner at the base of my lashes to help a bit with that. This does not bother my sensitive eyes at all. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Luxurious... makes my lashes thick and works perfectly. I was nervous about buying an all-natural mascara, worried it wouldn&#x27;t work as well as my old standby (maybelline). But I love it and highly recommend. Can&#x27;t beat the price for Korres!</li>
            <li> This mascara comes out clumpy and way to much on brush.  As for volume I never saw that so I stopped using it.  It took more time cleaning my eyes after I but it on.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras (Givenchy, Tarte, Rimmel etc.) and before this mascara I thought Rimmel was the&lt;br /&gt;best.  When I bought this one and started wearing it, it actually makes my lashes pop out just as if I was&lt;br /&gt;wearing false eyelashes.  This IS the Best mascara.  I won&#x27;t be buying any other.</li>
            <li> I had a sample version of this mascara that I kept until it totally ran out because I liked it so much. It was easy to remove completely in the shower, and made my lashes look very nice. However, THIS mascara... I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s the same! I put this mascara on literally about 4 hours ago, and if I were to touch my lashes gently and look at my finger, it would be covered in smudge. I love the long list of natural ingredients, but it really isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li> The mascara is blackest black, adds thickness to your lash line and elongates each lash as well. I have not experienced clumping.</li>
            <li> First off, I love that this uses natural ingredients that do not irritate and are actually safe for eyes.  Worn alone, this mascara does a good job of subtly lengthening and thickening my lashes.  However, I prefer to layer it over [[ASIN:B006RJRDTY Physicians Formula Mascara, Lash Boosting, Black Organics 7562 0.26 oz (7.5 g)]] because that one really lengthens my lashes and then the combination of the two seriously creates the effect of false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you apply too much and get clumps or stuck together lashes, just comb through with an eyelash brush, which you should do after applying mascara anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the problem of flaking/smudging with this mascara, but as with any mascara, its best to apply a thin line of powder under your lower lash line to avoid running/smudging of your mascara and eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara! Makes your eyelashes feel hydrated and gives them a pretty, elongated but natural look. There is a very light amount of flaking, but I think this can be attributed to the fact the ingredients are very &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;. A definite every-day mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara arrived quickly but it comes out of the tube in a huge blob - forget trying to use it. I&#x27;ll just stick with my Mally.</li>
            <li> Not in good conditoins and it looks old. I have a feeling this product was not new. I will not buy a mascara online again it&#x27;s better to get in an actual store where you can try it.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara it feels super soft applying it and it doesnt seem to smudge it stays put all day. The only reason I didnt give it five stars is because It wasnt anything that was amazing but it is a good mascara</li>
