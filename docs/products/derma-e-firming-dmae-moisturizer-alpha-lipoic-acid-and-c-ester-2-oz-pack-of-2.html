            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great price</li>
            <li>and i have a great deal of respect for derma e products.  </li>
            <li>My skin is radiant, feels great and stays moist throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer works great on my skin type.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
            <li>This is amazing!  </li>
            <li>, I scored a cream I love at a price that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>But this is a good cream.</li>
            <li>I do not like to do reviews until I have used a product for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I was so hoping this would work because the price is a good price</li>
            <li>It is exceptional.</li>
            <li>It is exceptional.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and the results are impressive.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>arrived quickly, love this !</li>
            <li>Great price as well,  important ingredients listed at the beginning of product not the end.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>The cream itself has a great texture that goes on smooth and does not leave the skin oily at all.  </li>
            <li>and it was popular</li>
            <li>Of course, even warm water stings my irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>I have had this before and liked it but then switched to Serum 7 when all the press came out about that.</li>
            <li>Either way, it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as Clarins products, but it works 100% better.  </li>
            <li>I have found that Amazon has by far the best price for this cream.  </li>
            <li>It contains some of the most effective ingredients known today.</li>
            <li>To the contrary, he said this ingredient is one of the top things you should look for in a skin cream.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why most are now in pump form.</li>
            <li>That costs more for the company to make though</li>
            <li>It is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>is more even.  </li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; and I love the way it feels when I put it on.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>We all love the results of this moisturizer and all get a lot of compliments on the youthfulness of our skin.  </li>
            <li>The most noticeable difference has been around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin fresh and feels good at night and every morning, it is light, with a nice and discret scent.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean after every application.</li>
            <li>Have used this firming moisturizer for month&#x27;s now and love the way it goes on so smoothly</li>
            <li>so just be sure to use clean hands when handling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>light moisturizer, nice texture, non greasy, gets absorbed easily, makes skin supple and evens skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I admit that I get a lot more than I give to Amazon reviews and this product has been so great and is such a great price that I had to hop to it and give back to all of you who write the reviews that help me make my buying decisions.</li>
            <li>It firms your skin and deminishes fine lines.</li>
            <li>It may contain one drop of organic oil out of a huge kettle of product and still say that.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li>The cream is not greasy, even though the texture is creamy and light.</li>
            <li>But I do love this cream and find it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Creamy and rich.  </li>
            <li>this cream soaks in good, some creams seem like they just lay on top your skin and not really do anything, this one soaks in and I feel like it helps, but droopy necks run in my family</li>
            <li>I looked at the reviews prior to buying; so many positive reviews reassured me this was probably a good buy.</li>
            <li>I actually bought both types that are being sold on Amazon, and they both are equally good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this moisturizer to others who love it as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>I really think this is working better than the Serum 7 though anyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that my skin absorbs it quickly</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs and leaves no shine.</li>
            <li>and I believe it has made a tremendous difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I will say the very first day my skin felt softer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some of the other products this company offers, but this one has shown me the greatest results.</li>
            <li>have LOVED this cream for quite some time but was paying $32 a pop for it at my local Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>The reasons I love it are that it is light enough to wear during the day without any greasy feeling (even in the San Diego heat!)</li>
            <li>Like this product line, but I have sensitive skin and this irritated my skin, but will still use derma e products as I love that they are &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have used many expensive anti aging creams in the past and I find this one to be superior to most at a great price.</li>
            <li>skin absolutely felt softer the very first day and my makeup applied easily&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do happen to like the night moisterizer very much; I will purchase that again.  </li>
            <li>I find the prices to be very reasonable for the quality</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>But now after 3 weeks I can go without foundation for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>I saw improvement in my rosacea outbreak in the first twenty four hours.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic lotion has all needed elements needed to keep skin young .  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, am on my third jar!</li>
            <li>Works OK but going back to product from Australia.</li>
            <li>Cleared blemishes that I had problems with for months within the first week of use.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too oily and it absorbs well leaving my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the jar I thought the cream was spoiled.</li>
            <li>I have had quite a few woman ask me what I use on my skin to make it look so good.  </li>
            <li>, it has a nice little tingle when applied, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your skin fell oily.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, this cream has no offensive or strong odor, and has never caused a reaction, such as rash.</li>
            <li>Usually certain ingredients will do this to my skin.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s hard to believe the price is so good.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream</li>
            <li>So this must be containing something that my face wants to run from screaming.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much</li>
            <li>but I think that the Derma e line really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a fragrance, not perfumed like the department store creams.</li>
            <li>This product really works to reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into the skin very well for using under make-up.  </li>
            <li>I have used much more expensive products that didn&#x27;t deliver the same great results.</li>
            <li>My 55 yr old skin looks so smooth and clear</li>
            <li>I have found other product that are better.</li>
            <li>My skin used to be very blotchy and it has become more even in complexion, I require way less make up</li>
            <li>This derma-e product is working for me to help keep my skin as soft and smooth as possible.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li>but I will give this a little more time before I decide.</li>
            <li>AND powerful enough to effect changes while you sleep at night</li>
            <li>primary ingredient this time (DMAE) is all natural (it&#x27;s not organic) and studies have shown that it actually seems to help correct fine lines and firm.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to try something new for every day use during the daytime.</li>
            <li>and my journey to find a new face cream began.</li>
            <li>Olay has some strongly proven ingredients and expensive ones rather than lots of cheap fillers and  doesn&#x27;t try to pass off misleading labels and I like that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some of the ingredients aren&#x27;t even natural but there are no harsh additives in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have uber sensitive skin that has reactions with almost everything.</li>
            <li>may return to my old cream</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and moisturizer yet not oily with this</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After using this for only a week my skin has shown so much improvement that I will stick with it as my go-to cream.  </li>
            <li>I may not like some of the practices of the company as far as labeling, but I can see why this cream gave them a \\&quot;name\\&quot; in the cosmetics world.</li>

            <li>My 8-year old daughter says it smells like frosting.  </li>
            <li>I still have issues near my nostrils, probably because it&#x27;s tissue season.  </li>
            <li>After using twice a day for 2 days I have noticed a reduction in pore size and a fading of old acne scars.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate their natural, paraben and cruelty-free approach.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 64 years old, and although I wear sunscreen under my make-up, I&#x27;ve acquired some wrinkles.</li>
            <li>but because it peels the top layer of skin off slowly, your skin renews gradually which is something it stops doing when you</li>
            <li>me start my review by saying I had low expectations for this cream after first using their cleanser, which was ordered the same day.</li>
            <li>backup ingredients were good as well though only one of them is organic (the jojoba seed oil) which they obviously only added so that they could slam an asterisk after it and then put a certified organic stamp on their box with an asterisk before it to fake the buyer into thinking the whole product is organic.</li>
            <li>Right there on his website you will see the article touting the positive effects of DMAE, and no mention of anything negative.</li>
            <li>With regular, everyday use will keep your skin smooth and even toned.  </li>
            <li>Having worked with cosmetic scientists in major cosmetic companies, I&#x27;m a bit too educated on ingredients and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very small pores which clog easily, but do not clog with this cream.</li>
            <li>massive reduction in an old oversized pore from when I picked at my face as a kid.  </li>
            <li>I could barely see.</li>
            <li>I gave it one star because it arrived far earlier than the</li>
            <li>It does moisturize the face but it has a strong perfume smell which is not good for a guy like me.</li>
            <li>The drastic improvement in my rosacea is worth a few extra pimples.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive, senior skin and this creme just works wonders on it.  </li>
            <li>The sensatiwasps not long lasting and does not deter me from continuing use.  </li>
            <li>In the morning I cover this with Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunblock SPF 45 and Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion, SPF 15.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a fragrance, not perfumed like the department store creams.</li>
            <li> This product really works to reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into the skin very well for using under make-up.  </li>
            <li> I have used much more expensive products that didn&#x27;t deliver the same great results.</li>
            <li> My 55 yr old skin looks so smooth and clear</li>
            <li> I have found other product that are better.</li>
            <li> My skin used to be very blotchy and it has become more even in complexion, I require way less make up</li>
            <li> This derma-e product is working for me to help keep my skin as soft and smooth as possible.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream.  </li>
            <li> but I will give this a little more time before I decide.</li>
            <li> AND powerful enough to effect changes while you sleep at night</li>

            <li> I bought this product to try something new for every day use during the daytime.</li>
            <li> and my journey to find a new face cream began.</li>
            <li> Olay has some strongly proven ingredients and expensive ones rather than lots of cheap fillers and  doesn&#x27;t try to pass off misleading labels and I like that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients aren&#x27;t even natural but there are no harsh additives in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have uber sensitive skin that has reactions with almost everything.</li>
            <li> may return to my old cream</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and moisturizer yet not oily with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After using this for only a week my skin has shown so much improvement that I will stick with it as my go-to cream.  </li>
            <li> I may not like some of the practices of the company as far as labeling, but I can see why this cream gave them a \\&quot;name\\&quot; in the cosmetics world.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product to try something new for every day use during the daytime. It does moisturize the face but it has a strong perfume smell which is not good for a guy like me. I prefer facial moisturizers with no scent. I have found other product that are better.</li>
            <li> Having worked with cosmetic scientists in major cosmetic companies, I&#x27;m a bit too educated on ingredients and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start my review by saying I had low expectations for this cream after first using their cleanser, which was ordered the same day. It had horrible rough artificial synthetic and stripping agents in it including sulfates which should always be avoided due to harsh stripping. However, like this package it nonetheless had the \\&quot;certified organic\\&quot; stamp on the back. How can they do this? Do you see the tiny asterik before the stamp? Now, do you see one or two ingredients with an asterisk after them?  This is a common labeling \\&quot;scam\\&quot; but not a scam kinda thing. It will have one or two organic ingredients that are certified organic. The rest can be all synthetic but the asterisk means the organic stamp belongs to those two. It may contain one drop of organic oil out of a huge kettle of product and still say that. Don&#x27;t be fooled. Some of the ingredients aren&#x27;t even natural but there are no harsh additives in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So obviously I went in with little trust for the cream. But this is a good cream. I suspect they came out with this cream and it was popular so they created some cheap poor quality side products that people automatically trusted due to the branding and got a little greedy with game playing and labeling games but I&#x27;ll stick to this cream only for this rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have uber sensitive skin that has reactions with almost everything. This caused no reaction or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary ingredient this time (DMAE) is all natural (it&#x27;s not organic) and studies have shown that it actually seems to help correct fine lines and firm. In fact, it&#x27;s the only ingredient that&#x27;s been shown to do this aside from Retin-A which is very expensive and requires a prescription (it&#x27;s prescribed for acne but because it peels the top layer of skin off slowly, your skin renews gradually which is something it stops doing when you age.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: One reviewer said Dr. Oz said not to use this. To the contrary, he said this ingredient is one of the top things you should look for in a skin cream. I couldn&#x27;t imagine him saying this when I read that review so I googled it. Right there on his website you will see the article touting the positive effects of DMAE, and no mention of anything negative. I am not sure why she said this or if she was thinking of another cream she confused with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin absolutely felt softer the very first day and my makeup applied easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The backup ingredients were good as well though only one of them is organic (the jojoba seed oil) which they obviously only added so that they could slam an asterisk after it and then put a certified organic stamp on their box with an asterisk before it to fake the buyer into thinking the whole product is organic. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theuser should know that it&#x27;s unfortunate that thus is in tub rather than pump form. Any bacteria on your hands will transfer to the cream and can grow. That&#x27;s why most are now in pump form. That costs more for the company to make though so just be sure to use clean hands when handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this cream works and it softens. I like that it&#x27;s cruelty free. I don&#x27;t think c-ester should be on the front of the box or the name because according to the ingredient list order there is hardly any in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they purposefully mislead buyers on their packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may return to my old cream but I will give this a little more time before I decide. My skin feels soft and moisturizer yet not oily with this so I do like it. Olay has some strongly proven ingredients and expensive ones rather than lots of cheap fillers and  doesn&#x27;t try to pass off misleading labels and I like that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I bought 2 jars of this so I have plenty of time to decide. I will say the very first day my skin felt softer so I can&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t like it. I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this for only a week my skin has shown so much improvement that I will stick with it as my go-to cream.  I may not like some of the practices of the company as far as labeling, but I can see why this cream gave them a \\&quot;name\\&quot; in the cosmetics world. It is exceptional. However, I do wish they&#x27;d bring up some of their other products to the same standard.y go-to cream.

            <li> I really like this cream, it has a nice little tingle when applied, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your skin fell oily. It does have alight odor but goes away. Great price as well,  important ingredients listed at the beginning of product not the end. Great service from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews prior to buying; so many positive reviews reassured me this was probably a good buy. Oh No! This stuff made me want to scratch my face off. Usually certain ingredients will do this to my skin.  So this must be containing something that my face wants to run from screaming.  I just don&#x27;t know what the ingredient(s) is.  I do happen to like the night moisterizer very much; I will purchase that again.  This however was an unfortuante purchase that I will not repeat.</li>
            <li> I typically use Clarins and Estee Lauder products.  I read about DMAE in a book by Dr. Perricone and found this cream at my local grocery store.  It is outstanding.  I have been using it for three weeks and my face is smoother, brighter, has fewer wrinkles and the color is more even.  I&#x27;m 41, have peri-oral dermatitis and rosacea.  I have always had to use foundation.  I don&#x27;t use much and I do mix it with lotion and sunscreen.  But now after 3 weeks I can go without foundation for the first time in my life.  That&#x27;s amazing!  I&#x27;ve read some reveiws about the smell.  I assume it&#x27;s the DMAE or C-Ester.  Either way, it doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as Clarins products, but it works 100% better.  Plus, it&#x27;s not an awful smell.  My 8-year old daughter says it smells like frosting.  I&#x27;m not sure about that, but I don&#x27;t care.  It&#x27;s also not as hydrating as my other creams.  I always use another cream anyway so this isn&#x27;t a big deal for me.  In the morning I cover this with Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunblock SPF 45 and Eucerin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion, SPF 15.  At night and on very windy, cold Pittsburgh days, I put Clarins HydraQuench Rich Cream on over this.</li>
            <li> Alpha lipoic acid was mentioned in my anatomy text book as a substance documented to repair microcellular structures that provide epidermal cell support, although I&#x27;m unsure if the lower level cells benefit from an external application of this cream which would have to make its way past the outer layer of dead epidermal cells. That said, DMAE - Alpha Lipoic C-Ester Retexturizing Creme is an excellent cream. My skin feels very clean after every application. I have very small pores which clog easily, but do not clog with this cream. The cream is not greasy, even though the texture is creamy and light. Furthermore, this cream has no offensive or strong odor, and has never caused a reaction, such as rash. I highly recommend this cream. It is not a gimmick. I actually bought both types that are being sold on Amazon, and they both are equally good.</li>
            <li> In September, I had the worst rosacea outbreak of my life.  I had red, thick, bumpy, scaly skin from my nostrils, down the folds by my mouth and across my chin.  I tried several things with no improvement.  I ordered this cream after some Internet research on beneficial ingredients.  I was saving up for expensive prescription medicine, when this cream arrived.  I saw improvement in my rosacea outbreak in the first twenty four hours.  In one month, my skin had cleared up about 80%.  I applied it to the affected area every time I went into the bathroom for any reason.  Now, it&#x27;s December and my rosacea is 95% gone and the scarring is healing well.  I still have issues near my nostrils, probably because it&#x27;s tissue season.  I now use the cream only once a day except by my nose.  I got two jars in October and still have three fourths of a jar left in December.  The price is right and the results are impressive.  Now the warnings.  This cream burns and stings on irritated skin.  Of course, even warm water stings my irritated skin.  The sensatiwasps not long lasting and does not deter me from continuing use.  Also, this cream seems to slightly increase acne flare ups, my other irritating skin condition.  The drastic improvement in my rosacea is worth a few extra pimples.  I now use Derma e problem skin cleanser and reduced use of  this cream to only once per day.  It seems to be helping.  The bottom line is, I will be trying other products from Derma e--problem skin formulas next.  I have ordered products for my friends for Christmas.  I won&#x27;t be wasting my money for expensive prescriptions or designer formulas without trying Derma e first.</li>
            <li> this item and other derma e items can be purchased for half the price on vitacost.com</li>
            <li> Awesome makes my skin feel like silk</li>
            <li> I noticed wrinkles starting to develop six or so months ago (yikes!) and my journey to find a new face cream began. I don&#x27;t mind the smell of this face cream. To me it&#x27;s \\&quot;earthy\\&quot; and I love the way it feels when I put it on. Not greasy - at all! I&#x27;ve found that my skin absorbs it quickly and it leaves my face soft and smooth. Now... there&#x27;s no miracle cream that&#x27;s going to erase time!!! Acceptance is half the battle. But I do love this cream and find it&#x27;s worth the money. At night I put this on as a base and then Skin Food on my cheeks and eyes (Skin food is too greasy to wear during the day). So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Fantastic lotion has all needed elements needed to keep skin young .  This is my second order and I doubled up. Dame very good for skin along with Esther c</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, am on my third jar!</li>
            <li> No longer does the esthetician say my face could use a moisturizer.  My skin stays soft and less wrinkled. Wish I had started using this before my 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It firms your skin and deminishes fine lines. I have been using it for about five years every day and I love it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my medical doctor who said this is what his wife uses.  Three or four years ago i began using this, purchasing it at a health food store or on-line.  I have found that Amazon has by far the best price for this cream.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  After using twice a day for 2 days I have noticed a reduction in pore size and a fading of old acne scars. It quickly absorbs and leaves no shine. Love it!</li>
            <li> I begin using this product after reading Dr. Perricone&#x27;s book. I tried another with similar ingredients but it made my face break out.   I do not like to do reviews until I have used a product for a good amount of time. A couple of weeks will not cut it. I have been using this product for about a year and a half now and I believe it has made a tremendous difference in my skin. My skin used to be very blotchy and it has become more even in complexion, I require way less make up then I did when I begin using it. It doesnt feel heavy and I believe my pores look smaller. It also keeps my skin hydrated which is just an added benefit.   I will continue to use this product as I think it is going to help me age gracefully. I have problem skin and I am going to try other Derma E products as well.</li>
            <li> Have used this firming moisturizer for month&#x27;s now and love the way it goes on so smoothly and you can feel the tightening effect after it&#x27;s been on a little while.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a staple for myself, my sister and my mom.  We all love the results of this moisturizer and all get a lot of compliments on the youthfulness of our skin.  The cream itself has a great texture that goes on smooth and does not leave the skin oily at all.  I highly recommend this cream.  I have used many expensive anti aging creams in the past and I find this one to be superior to most at a great price.</li>
            <li> I admit that I get a lot more than I give to Amazon reviews and this product has been so great and is such a great price that I had to hop to it and give back to all of you who write the reviews that help me make my buying decisions. THANK YOU!  SO here&#x27;s the scoop...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have LOVED this cream for quite some time but was paying $32 a pop for it at my local Whole Foods.  The reasons I love it are that it is light enough to wear during the day without any greasy feeling (even in the San Diego heat!) AND powerful enough to effect changes while you sleep at night so you can skip all those expensive night creams.  Results I&#x27;ve gotten, massive reduction in an old oversized pore from when I picked at my face as a kid.  I thought I was stuck with that- but nope!  This cream made it so no one else would even know its there.  Along with my primarily raw food diet - it has helped me ditch all my old cystic acne issues which had massive emotional benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I see it, I scored a cream I love at a price that&#x27;s awesome. I keep this on my subscribe &amp; save so I pay even less and I never run out.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m kidding myself but I think that the Derma e line really has made a difference in the appearance of my skin. I use several products including the peptides plus wrinkle cream at night and DMAE ester-c cream in the daytime. The textures are buttery and the creams absorb well. I&#x27;m not wild about all the scents but they don&#x27;t bother me. I find the prices to be very reasonable for the quality and I appreciate their natural, paraben and cruelty-free approach. The website has a lot of info as well.</li>
            <li> Works OK but going back to product from Australia.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for about 2 weeks now.  i do notice it hydrates/mositurizes well and my skin is softer but do not notice any difference in my wrinkles yet. I have sensative skin and have had not issues.  I am 66 and do not expect miracles!  LOL&lt;br /&gt;It is a great price and i have a great deal of respect for derma e products.  I might try a different combination of cream after i use these jars.</li>
            <li> My 55 yr old skin looks so smooth and clear, it&#x27;s hard to believe the price is so good. Make up goes on smoother and I use less foundation.  Foundation doesn&#x27;t settle into wrinkles or pores all day. Seems to keep make up in place longer. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a fragrance, not perfumed like the department store creams. I prefer less fragrance. Cleared blemishes that I had problems with for months within the first week of use. That&#x27;s not the reason I purchased but I&#x27;ll take it.  Definitely firmed jaw line, chin, the \\&quot;Droopy Dog\\&quot; area and hopefully will continue.  I am not the woman who frets over aging, our skin is going to get lines, wrinkles, spots, all sorts of changes and no cream, potion, lotion or Supplement will make you look like you&#x27;re 30 again.  This derma-e product is working for me to help keep my skin as soft and smooth as possible.  I would recommend.  I have oily skin, prone to some break outs, slightly noticeable pores on nose, medium tones.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> This product really works to reduce wrinkles. I&#x27;m 64 years old, and although I wear sunscreen under my make-up, I&#x27;ve acquired some wrinkles. I&#x27;ve tried other creams, including Retin A, but this one has won me over. The most noticeable difference has been around my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried some of the other products this company offers, but this one has shown me the greatest results.</li>
            <li> Had terrible allergic reaction after using this. I only applied a little to my face before I went to bed and when I woke up my face and neck were red like a bad sun burn. And my eyes were so swollen I could barely see.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly, love this !</li>
            <li> Creamy and rich.  My skin is radiant, feels great and stays moist throughout the day.  After years of using expensive Department Store brands, I will never go back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this moisturizer to others who love it as much as I do.  Absorbs into the skin very well for using under make-up.  With regular, everyday use will keep your skin smooth and even toned.  I&#x27;ve used Derma e products for about two years now and haven&#x27;t found one yet that I didn&#x27;t like.  Very reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> Pros: light moisturizer, nice texture, non greasy, gets absorbed easily, makes skin supple and evens skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: stings for a minute or two on dry and sensitve skin.</li>
            <li> Not what&#x27;s sold in stores. Had a severe allergic reaction to this product...checked all ingredients and nothing different.</li>
            <li> this cream soaks in good, some creams seem like they just lay on top your skin and not really do anything, this one soaks in and I feel like it helps, but droopy necks run in my family so I am probably cursed.</li>
            <li> This has not done anything for my face. I will try something else . I was so hoping this would work because the price is a good price but that was not the case.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works great on my skin type.  It isn&#x27;t too oily and it absorbs well leaving my skin soft and smooth.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I have used much more expensive products that didn&#x27;t deliver the same great results.</li>
            <li> Like this product line, but I have sensitive skin and this irritated my skin, but will still use derma e products as I love that they are &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have had this before and liked it but then switched to Serum 7 when all the press came out about that. They have subsequently changed that product and now I am back to Derma e. I really think this is working better than the Serum 7 though anyway.</li>
            <li> I normally do not give reviews but I felt I needed to for this product. I gave it one star because it arrived far earlier than the due date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has one of the worst fowl swells for a face cream I have ever smelled. When I first opened the jar I thought the cream was spoiled. The color is horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The so called firming cream is not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I use it, no results yet, but I am patient!  Too time to get all my wrinkles, will take time to fade them!</li>
            <li> I use quite a few derma E products and I like them all.  This is one of my favorites.  I must admit that the smell is odd but, like one of the other reviewers, I like it.  I have dry, sensitive, senior skin and this creme just works wonders on it.  I have had quite a few woman ask me what I use on my skin to make it look so good.  I have no hesitation in recommending it.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin fresh and feels good at night and every morning, it is light, with a nice and discret scent.  A little amount feels enough and therefore it takes me a long time to need to reorder.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought it four times already. The price is very reasonable, it does not contain any parabens, weird aluminums, hydrogenated stuff..or others that have proven to have long term side effects.  It contains some of the most effective ingredients known today. I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing &amp; my son couldn&#x27;t believe I was wearing no makeup!!</li>
