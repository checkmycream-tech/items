    <ol>
            <li>and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is a great company and I will purchase their products again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO happy.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Just LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>THANKS for making suck a great product!!!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good that this is free of toxins - sure.</li>
            <li>However, it is a great product and I am willing to pay the premium.</li>
            <li>It glides on very smooth, and no changes in effectiveness, so even better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and now now how to remedy the problem.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>the more you use it.</li>
            <li>Am really looking for a good deodorant that&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>However, once trying it, was pleasant surprised.  </li>
            <li>I would much rather make my own with coconut oil, baking soda, arrowroot, and some essential oils which is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper to do(:&lt;br /&gt;Enjoyed trying the product though, the tea tree oil is a nice addition to the peppermint.</li>
            <li>I wrote to the company and they quickly responded.  </li>
            <li>excellent natural alternative to high chemical products, at first it left little residue of product, but after 2 weeks if use its perfect now.</li>
            <li>I look forward to trying the other varieties to see if they are just as FABULOUS!!!  </li>
            <li>First, IT WORKS!  </li>
            <li>The ToM&#x27;s lemon-scented deodorant helped the most out of the three, but it didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li>Well, I decided to give the natural kind a shot and was actually surprised to see that this problem disappeared!</li>
            <li>good natural deodorant, does leave white residue--but I don&#x27;t mind it washes off--</li>
            <li>The second was marginally better.</li>
            <li>The product worked started working the first day.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if you&#x27;re in a similar position of having deodorant and sweat baked into your clothes, the short coverage isn&#x27;t a huge deal--I can always reapply between classes.</li>
            <li>You have no idea how much of a relief this is.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for existing.</li>
            <li>In fact, there were some days that I didn&#x27;t need to reapply, but on days where I was most active, I did have to reapply... which doesn&#x27;t really bother me, since I shower after I exercise anyway.  </li>
            <li>It goes on a bit rough at first, but then it goes on smooth</li>
            <li>I initially wrote a review and did not like the dry texture but loved the natural peppermint and tea tree scent.  </li>
            <li>Body odor was becoming a major issue in my house, and none of the standard deodorants seemed to be working.</li>
            <li>I declined the new one but quickly held under the blow dryer for a second</li>
            <li>Finally, a natural deodorant that really works.</li>
            <li>They told me that it should not be dry but an ingredient they use has a higher melting temperature and they would send a new one.  </li>
            <li>But who wants to smell sweaty when you&#x27;ve put on this kind of expensive deodorant...</li>
            <li>As an early morning runner, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised that I can apply this natural stick deodorant just once a day after showering in the morning.</li>
            <li>It might not smell feminine like Lavanilla, but as I&#x27;ve said earlier, scent wasn&#x27;t exactly my main concern.</li>
            <li>And, third, while I have a VERY sensitive nose (seems all sorts of perfumes give me a headache then a migraine), well, this does NOT!  </li>
            <li>As a last resort I decided to find a natural deodorant with tea tree oil, which is a natural bacteria killer.</li>
            <li>Very expensive, but very effective.</li>
            <li>I admit, this worried me, especially with my underarm issue, but oddly enough, it actually fixed it!</li>
            <li>After trying many different natural deodorants, was skeptical about trying yet another natural product.  </li>
            <li>I am now switching between this and Degree since I have sensitive skin and the tea tree product was becoming irritating after several days.</li>
            <li>It is even more expensive because the tube is only about half full.</li>
            <li>The application site is a little sore as this product is pretty abrasive.</li>
            <li>The only drawback to this natural deodorant is that it has a short protection span--its done and gone after 2-3 hours of regular activity (school, work, etc).</li>
            <li>First one arrived dried out and crumbly.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> First one arrived dried out and crumbly.  </li>
            <li> I needed a natural deodorant because all the ones I had tried previously had baked onto my shirts, making the armpits always smell like sweaty flowers.</li>
            <li> ** - I think they changed their formula a little bit, because the texture is definitely not the same coarsey texture like it used to be - which is a big improvement!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awfully expensive, but I was willing to try it because of the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time, too.</li>
            <li> completely dry and scratches your skin.</li>
            <li> It was applied after a shower when my underarms were dry.</li>
            <li> this was terribly thick, made my shirt look wet (exactly what I do NOT want!), and even had to wash my shirt a few times before it came out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying it at night after a shower because less oil gets on my clothes the next day and it still prevents odor.</li>
            <li> As long as you wait a few minutes before you put on a shirt, you won&#x27;t find any white residue on the inside of your t-shirts.</li>
            <li> It is very dry and cakey.</li>
            <li> Compared to other natural/organic deodorants I&#x27;ve tried were: Herban Cowboy, Lavanilla and Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to bother with any other deodorants because this one exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> To make a long and gross story short, I used to get really bad underarm rash, which I believe was from a developed allergy to aluminum.</li>
            <li> There are large, scratchy particles in this, which make application uncomfortable (almost like sandpaper).</li>
            <li> I really did like this deoderant, but I find it expensive.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours after application I could smell slight b.o.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-it was probably too cold and the coconut oil solidified too much</li>
            <li> I found that JK Naturals was a LOT longer-lasting than others, which means I didn&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it every few hours.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m a heavy perspirer, it works well all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still get that gross, itchy and uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> Not many people will take the time to write an essay about deodorant, so keep that in mind, too.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has an odd smell (wet cardboard &amp; mint) and a weird texture (damp sand).</li>
            <li> There is another brand called &amp;#34;Life Stinks&amp;#34;, which is sort of hard to apply (it&#x27;s a powder), but it works -</li>
            <li> It started late summer of 2013, and then it subsided a bit when I made the switch to department store deodorants (like Degree or Secret) to organic/natural ones.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave any icky grossness stuck to your under-arms either, which is also A+!</li>
            <li> -twist thing at bottom was broken and did not push up the stick&lt;br /&gt;-crumbles into a hundred pieces when applying&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the day progressed, the odor became worse.</li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t have all those nasty ingredients that NO ONE needs!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this deodorant did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> and it makes me smell bad.</li>
            <li> Still crumbled, and what stayed on the stick was still painful to use.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-still worthless</li>
            <li> I hate the consistency of this deodorant.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This simply doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s good that this is free of toxins - sure. But who wants to smell sweaty when you&#x27;ve put on this kind of expensive deodorant... There are large, scratchy particles in this, which make application uncomfortable (almost like sandpaper). The white residue was described by others and I wouldn&#x27;t have cared if this actually worked. I&#x27;m not someone who sweats overly or has BO issues. Unless I used this. Doesn&#x27;t work for me. Don&#x27;t recommend wasting your money. There is another brand called &amp;#34;Life Stinks&amp;#34;, which is sort of hard to apply (it&#x27;s a powder), but it works - so I&#x27;m likely to go back to that.</li>
            <li> Smells good. First one arrived dried out and crumbly.  They are not returnable, but amazon agreed to replace it for another, fresher one. The second was marginally better. Still crumbled, and what stayed on the stick was still painful to use. Threw the second one away. Am really looking for a good deodorant that&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant. This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot - I have no odor at all when I use it. The challenge though is that it has an oil in it and the oil has stained some of my clothes. It actually ruined a silk blouse - you can see the oil marks outlined around the armpit and I hadn&#x27;t sweat at all when I wore it. I&#x27;ve tried applying it at night after a shower because less oil gets on my clothes the next day and it still prevents odor.</li>
            <li> As an early morning runner, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised that I can apply this natural stick deodorant just once a day after showering in the morning. It continues to work all day, through the night and, the next day, I still don&#x27;t smell even after running five miles! Finally, a natural deodorant that really works.</li>
            <li> Body odor was becoming a major issue in my house, and none of the standard deodorants seemed to be working. As a last resort I decided to find a natural deodorant with tea tree oil, which is a natural bacteria killer. The product worked started working the first day. I am now switching between this and Degree since I have sensitive skin and the tea tree product was becoming irritating after several days.</li>
            <li> Love it! I will order it again!</li>
            <li> I initially wrote a review and did not like the dry texture but loved the natural peppermint and tea tree scent.  I wrote to the company and they quickly responded.  They told me that it should not be dry but an ingredient they use has a higher melting temperature and they would send a new one.  I declined the new one but quickly held under the blow dryer for a second and it was perfect.  Had I not e mailed them I would not have known this.  I love this stuff and now now how to remedy the problem.  This is a great company and I will purchase their products again.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I needed a natural deodorant because all the ones I had tried previously had baked onto my shirts, making the armpits always smell like sweaty flowers. Well, I decided to give the natural kind a shot and was actually surprised to see that this problem disappeared! The only drawback to this natural deodorant is that it has a short protection span--its done and gone after 2-3 hours of regular activity (school, work, etc). Honestly, if you&#x27;re in a similar position of having deodorant and sweat baked into your clothes, the short coverage isn&#x27;t a huge deal--I can always reapply between classes.</li>
            <li> good natural deodorant, does leave white residue--but I don&#x27;t mind it washes off--likely the kokum butter</li>
            <li> Just LOVE this stuff!  First, IT WORKS!  Second, it doesn&#x27;t have all those nasty ingredients that NO ONE needs!  And, third, while I have a VERY sensitive nose (seems all sorts of perfumes give me a headache then a migraine), well, this does NOT!  WOO HOO!!!!  THANKS for making suck a great product!!!!!  I look forward to trying the other varieties to see if they are just as FABULOUS!!!  :)</li>
            <li> this was terribly thick, made my shirt look wet (exactly what I do NOT want!), and even had to wash my shirt a few times before it came out. After using it once I returned it.</li>
            <li> completely dry and scratches your skin.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, but very effective. It is even more expensive because the tube is only about half full. However, it is a great product and I am willing to pay the premium.</li>
            <li> To make a long and gross story short, I used to get really bad underarm rash, which I believe was from a developed allergy to aluminum. It started late summer of 2013, and then it subsided a bit when I made the switch to department store deodorants (like Degree or Secret) to organic/natural ones. Around August 2014, I decided enough was enough and looked to Earth Clinic to see which ingredients help solve this problem... which is what eventually brought me to JK Naturals.  Compared to other natural/organic deodorants I&#x27;ve tried were: Herban Cowboy, Lavanilla and Tom&#x27;s of Maine. The ToM&#x27;s lemon-scented deodorant helped the most out of the three, but it didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it. I&#x27;d still get that gross, itchy and uncomfortable feeling. I found that JK Naturals was a LOT longer-lasting than others, which means I didn&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it every few hours. In fact, there were some days that I didn&#x27;t need to reapply, but on days where I was most active, I did have to reapply... which doesn&#x27;t really bother me, since I shower after I exercise anyway.  Do keep this in mind - I did NOT know about its coarse texture before buying it. I admit, this worried me, especially with my underarm issue, but oddly enough, it actually fixed it! It goes on a bit rough at first, but then it goes on smooth the more you use it. It might not smell feminine like Lavanilla, but as I&#x27;ve said earlier, scent wasn&#x27;t exactly my main concern. As long as you wait a few minutes before you put on a shirt, you won&#x27;t find any white residue on the inside of your t-shirts. It also doesn&#x27;t leave any icky grossness stuck to your under-arms either, which is also A+! (the ToM&#x27;s deodorant-users know what I&#x27;m talking about)  I&#x27;m SO happy. Can&#x27;t you tell? Not many people will take the time to write an essay about deodorant, so keep that in mind, too. You have no idea how much of a relief this is. I&#x27;m not going to bother with any other deodorants because this one exceeded my expectations.  ***OVER 1YEAR UPDATE*** - I think they changed their formula a little bit, because the texture is definitely not the same coarsey texture like it used to be - which is a big improvement! It glides on very smooth, and no changes in effectiveness, so even better. Still haven&#x27;t used a different deodorant, and haven&#x27;t had that itchy/red grossness since using JK Naturals. Lasts a really long time, too. 100% believer in this stuff. Thank you so much for existing.</li>
            <li> excellent natural alternative to high chemical products, at first it left little residue of product, but after 2 weeks if use its perfect now. I do recommend it</li>
            <li> Item received as described and on time.</li>
            <li> I really did like this deoderant, but I find it expensive. I would much rather make my own with coconut oil, baking soda, arrowroot, and some essential oils which is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper to do(:&lt;br /&gt;Enjoyed trying the product though, the tea tree oil is a nice addition to the peppermint.</li>
            <li> -twist thing at bottom was broken and did not push up the stick&lt;br /&gt;-crumbles into a hundred pieces when applying&lt;br /&gt;-it was probably too cold and the coconut oil solidified too much&lt;br /&gt;-still worthless</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this deodorant did not work well for me. It was applied after a shower when my underarms were dry. I did not exert myself or work up a sweat. Within a few hours after application I could smell slight b.o. As the day progressed, the odor became worse. I&#x27;ve used it multiple times with identical results.  This deodorant has an odd smell (wet cardboard &amp; mint) and a weird texture (damp sand). The application site is a little sore as this product is pretty abrasive. It&#x27;s awfully expensive, but I was willing to try it because of the natural ingredients.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> After trying many different natural deodorants, was skeptical about trying yet another natural product.  However, once trying it, was pleasant surprised.  Although I&#x27;m a heavy perspirer, it works well all day.  Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I hate the consistency of this deodorant. It is very dry and cakey. It flakes everywhere and it makes me smell bad.</li>
