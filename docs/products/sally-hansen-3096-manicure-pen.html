    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed when the tip turns color from the polish, still works great!  </li>
            <li>Great for cleaning off polish around nails.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I had to scrub many times to &#x27;erase&#x27; the contour of the nail.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for why others had so many problems, but here&#x27;s my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have also used a q-tip with dipped in remover and find this much better.</li>
            <li>The one I have is great; I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>Buying many more for stocking stuffers right now...</li>
            <li>It cleans up my little mistakes, the tips is precise, and my nails look great!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do a thing to clean up my nails.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will be a tad bit better as the old tips bend way to easy and don&#x27;t stay accurate.</li>
            <li>and this pen works quickly and precisely to clean up my fingers.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not do what it promises, but the cheaply made &#x27;sponge&#x27; tip easily breaks off!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even worth that.</li>
            <li>It worked great the first time I used it using a dark teal.</li>
            <li>By the time I moved on to my right hand the tip broke.</li>
            <li>The polish does stain the tip (right now mine is purple), but it still works quite well.</li>
            <li>I would say that this product works exactly as well as I always wished</li>
            <li>Also, the remover in the pen is potent and works quickly, you don&#x27;t have to rub it back and forth much over mistakes before it completely removes any errant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the first tip to clean up 3 manicures, with three different colors of polish.</li>
            <li>It works well and doesn&#x27;t take much to take of polish</li>
            <li>This correction pen is firm and nicely tapered so that you can remove polish from the tiniest creases of your nailbed without ruining your manicure.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this pen because it has a small tip that I can use to clean up the corners of my nails.</li>
            <li>(I have only used it for light colors, so I can&#x27;t really speak as to its ability to clean off dark polish stains.)</li>
            <li>I had high hopes of purchasing something that would remove nail polish from my skin with precision and ease.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a hard time painting my own nails</li>
            <li>Although I enjoy it, I really do think that $4-5 is a little much for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>I had some trouble getting the cap off, the the first disposable attachment broke clean off, and it took forever to reload the  second.</li>
            <li>And even with a lot of pressure, it takes a lot of passes over the area, and barely works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier and faster at the old fashioned way: a little bit of cotton rolled in the tip of a stick...</li>

            <li> As another reviewer said you don&#x27;t have to push hard or wipe much, just a few swipes and it comes right off the skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no smearing from the previous colors on your new manicure.</li>
            <li> The corrector tip is very hard, which makes it precise, except it doesn&#x27;t erase anything unless you use a lot of pressure, which can actually end up slipping and taking off polish from my nails instead.  </li>
            <li> The tip was completely dry.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was already useless, as it didn&#x27;t make any noticeable difference in the smudges on my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I never comment on products, but I came on here to purchase this product for family and friends after having been gifted one myself and noticed all the bad reviews...</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> After spending $5 for this worthless pen, I think I would&#x27;ve gotten more bang for my buck by simply lighting a $5 bill on fire!</li>
            <li> The pen is dry, even after a few minutes with the tip pointed downward.</li>
            <li> only thing I could suggest for the negative reviews is that they got a bad/old product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at Target, for about half the price listed here.</li>
            <li> Now i just try extra hard  not to mess up my nails and hope that I won&#x27;t be needing  this anymore!</li>
            <li> When I tried to remove the part of the tip still left in the pen, it retracted up into the pen where I couldn&#x27;t retrieve it and also made it impossible to replace the tip with a new one.  </li>
            <li> The sponge tip picked up just enough color to get stained and render itself useless.  </li>
            <li> This product is pointless.</li>
            <li> Q-tips are thick and can be fuzzy so they can be difficult with subtle corrections.</li>
            <li> I hate polishing my nails mostly because I&#x27;m terrible at it</li>
            <li> lousy product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make any difference except smudge the polish around worse than before!</li>
            <li> Just completely awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Me llego la compra en la fecha prometida y el producto fue exactamente el que solicite, en buen estado, lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> I had some trouble getting the cap off, the the first disposable attachment broke clean off, and it took forever to reload the  second. Now i just try extra hard  not to mess up my nails and hope that I won&#x27;t be needing  this anymore!</li>
            <li> This product worked well for my needs. It cleans up my little mistakes, the tips is precise, and my nails look great!</li>

            <li> lousy product. Didn&#x27;t do a thing to clean up my nails. Thankfully i know the Q-tip dipped in nail polish remover trick</li>
            <li> The sponge tip picked up just enough color to get stained and render itself useless.  Luckily it was already useless, as it didn&#x27;t make any noticeable difference in the smudges on my cuticles.  Q-tip and nail polish remover is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I never comment on products, but I came on here to purchase this product for family and friends after having been gifted one myself and noticed all the bad reviews... I hate polishing my nails mostly because I&#x27;m terrible at it and this pen works quickly and precisely to clean up my fingers. As another reviewer said you don&#x27;t have to push hard or wipe much, just a few swipes and it comes right off the skin. Don&#x27;t be alarmed when the tip turns color from the polish, still works great!  Buying many more for stocking stuffers right now...</li>
            <li> This product is pointless. It doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING! The tip was completely dry. It doesn&#x27;t make any difference except smudge the polish around worse than before! I threw mine away after two uses. It wasn&#x27;t even worth that. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have a different version of this pen and this shipment looks like an updated version.  Hopefully it will be a tad bit better as the old tips bend way to easy and don&#x27;t stay accurate.</li>
            <li> What a joke. Not only does it not do what it promises, but the cheaply made &#x27;sponge&#x27; tip easily breaks off! Even though it comes with 2 refill heads, all three broke off, during my Corrections.    Next time I go to Sally Beauty Supply!</li>
            <li> It worked great the first time I used it using a dark teal. Then the second time I used Essie&#x27;s Forever Yummy and it smeared instead of cleaning up. By the time I moved on to my right hand the tip broke. Definitely not buying it again.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time. Great for cleaning off polish around nails.</li>
            <li> The tip broke off after about 3 uses.  When I tried to remove the part of the tip still left in the pen, it retracted up into the pen where I couldn&#x27;t retrieve it and also made it impossible to replace the tip with a new one.  I had to trash it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at Target, for about half the price listed here. It works fantastically well. I can&#x27;t speak for why others had so many problems, but here&#x27;s my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen comes with one tip attached and two extras in the package. I&#x27;ve used the first tip to clean up 3 manicures, with three different colors of polish. The polish does stain the tip (right now mine is purple), but it still works quite well. There&#x27;s no smearing from the previous colors on your new manicure. Also, the remover in the pen is potent and works quickly, you don&#x27;t have to rub it back and forth much over mistakes before it completely removes any errant polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used a q-tip with dipped in remover and find this much better. Q-tips are thick and can be fuzzy so they can be difficult with subtle corrections. This correction pen is firm and nicely tapered so that you can remove polish from the tiniest creases of your nailbed without ruining your manicure. I would say that this product works exactly as well as I always wished the q-tips would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I could suggest for the negative reviews is that they got a bad/old product. The one I have is great; I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>

            <li> Love these! I&#x27;ve always had a hard time painting my own nails but with this I can fix my messes</li>
            <li> I like it. It does work!!</li>
            <li> After spending $5 for this worthless pen, I think I would&#x27;ve gotten more bang for my buck by simply lighting a $5 bill on fire! This so-called clean-up pen does NOTHING, not even when I tried dipping it into nail polish remover. I&#x27;ve gone back to using Q-tips instead.</li>
