    <ol>
            <li>The fragrance is delicious.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for my purse.</li>
            <li>Great product, smells great.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this wonderful softening hand cream!</li>
            <li>But it is a good size for my purse.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend was very pleased and will be buying more!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite line ever!</li>
            <li>This is a nice, light hand cream that comes in a respectable 2oz tube that&#x27;s perfect for carrying in your purse.  </li>
            <li>So nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my hands feel and the fragrants is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Hand cream smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>The smell is more than addicting.</li>
            <li>Pretty good cream.</li>
            <li>but i found it to be too strong of a floral scent; however, it does absorb quickly and is light not greasy.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it for a splurge!</li>
            <li>but it sure is handy having a smaller sized product that fits in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I read that it smelled so fresh and when receiving it</li>
            <li>This is clearly a luxury product, with its main benefits being sulfate, paraben, and phthalate free.  </li>
            <li>I get complimented constantly on the light floral fragrance...</li>
            <li>Very nice...love the fragance.</li>
            <li>I personally would buy it again but only because I love jasmine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hefty price tag when all its really doing is leaving a nice feminine scent on top of being generally moisturizing (no more than any other hand lotion at a lower price point though.)  </li>
            <li>Lotion makes my hand feel really soft but not as fragrant as the body lotion.</li>
            <li>I personally think the cost is a tad too much for 2 oz.</li>
            <li>, I thoguht it smelled like Jasmine, or rather like an old lady.</li>
            <li>The cream is thick enough that it can leave your hands feeling slightly greasy if you put too much but absorbs quickly, leaving a light floral scent that reminds me of jasmine.  </li>

            <li> I wanted to love this, but ultimately this hand cream left my hands greasy, didn&#x27;t offer long-term moisturization (actually dried out my cuticles after several days of use), and was ridiculously expensive for the amount.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for the size and when compared to similarly sized products made by companies like Kiehls and Neutrogena, it&#x27;s hard to justify</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very, VERY disappointed.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff! Great product, smells great.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but ultimately this hand cream left my hands greasy, didn&#x27;t offer long-term moisturization (actually dried out my cuticles after several days of use), and was ridiculously expensive for the amount.  Very, VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> i read about this product in a magazine as an editor&#x27;s choice for hand cream but i found it to be too strong of a floral scent; however, it does absorb quickly and is light not greasy. If you like floral scents then this is something you might want to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of kai products for awhile, especially the body butter...but it sure is handy having a smaller sized product that fits in my purse.  I get complimented constantly on the light floral fragrance...I just love it!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend was very pleased and will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Hand cream smells fantastic! Saving for rollerball</li>
            <li> OMG!! The smell is more than addicting. This is my favorite line ever! Pricey but worth it for a splurge!</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my hands feel and the fragrants is beautiful. I would recommend this product. I ordered the body lotion as well.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is delicious.  So nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light hand cream that comes in a respectable 2oz tube that&#x27;s perfect for carrying in your purse.

            <li> Very nice...love the fragance. A bit pricey, but you only need a small amount. Lasts a long time. I travel with it and leave perfume containers at home.</li>
            <li> I like the cream but think the scent is too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Lotion makes my hand feel really soft but not as fragrant as the body lotion. I personally think the cost is a tad too much for 2 oz.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this wonderful softening hand cream! Perfect size for my purse. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Pretty good cream. The scent lingers for a while. The container is pretty small for the price. But it is a good size for my purse.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed. I read that it smelled so fresh and when receiving it, I thoguht it smelled like Jasmine, or rather like an old lady.</li>
            <li> came as promised, my wife loves this product</li>
            <li> fragrance was way  too flowery for me.</li>
