            <li> Feels natural.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li> why did I order another not too long ago?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not for someone who gets majorly dry skin, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to hydrate your winter skin, give this a try!</li>
            <li> I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t too heavy and greasy, but also doesn&#x27;t leave me coming back by 11am to reapply.</li>
            <li> This makes my pores smaller, and seems to firm my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I combine it with the Vitamin C powder and put it on after washing before any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have bought this from another vendor in the past, but Amazon beats their price (philosophy when hope is not enough serum, 4 oz QVC Price:$104.00)</li>
            <li> Also the price is outrageous, I love my murula oil ,It works the same as this oil for only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I tried it due to family suggestions.</li>
            <li> so I usually do put on another moisturizer after applying.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least a year, keeps my skin hydrated even in the ugly northern winters!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and that speakes for it self.</li>
            <li> Just as described, shipped quickly and packaged securely. This is a wonderful product and the price was a good value.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a good moisturizer in the winter. I&#x27;ve tried everything from fancy makeup counter creams to drug store lotions. I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t too heavy and greasy, but also doesn&#x27;t leave me coming back by 11am to reapply. Enter this serum. It really hydrates, absorbs quickly and never leaves residue. Better than any moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s probably not for someone who gets majorly dry skin, but if you&#x27;re looking for something to hydrate your winter skin, give this a try!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Use it morning and night and it does not make my skin oily.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and well worth the money. Seller is the best I have purchased a product from and I will definitely be doing business with them again.</li>
            <li> Always use this product</li>
            <li> This product is great. I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months. I am 31 years old. I have good skin over all, but I have gotten a ton of compliments on it since I&#x27;ve started using this product. I combine it with the Vitamin C powder and put it on after washing before any other moisturizer. I have pretty dry skin so I usually do put on another moisturizer after applying. But, in the summer, I didn&#x27;t need to. This product was enough alone. I highly recommend this product. So worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> I have bought this from another vendor in the past, but Amazon beats their price (philosophy when hope is not enough serum, 4 oz QVC Price:$104.00) ( Philosophy When Hope Is Not Enough 4 Oz by Philosophy Amazon Price $90.95) plus you get the free shipping as a Prime member.  This product has been a good one for me.  It works under makeup to give you skin a even palette so your makeup glides on smoother.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Great seller!</li>
            <li> This is an wonderful product, works wonders on tired skin! At my age I need all the help I can get and this is awesome!</li>
            <li> I see no difference.Also the price is outrageous, I love my murula oil ,It works the same as this oil for only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Iam so glad they came out with the large bottle&lt;br /&gt;saves time and money&lt;br /&gt;only wish it came in a clear bottle so I know&lt;br /&gt;when Iam running low</li>
            <li> I have been using this for at least a year, keeps my skin hydrated even in the ugly northern winters!</li>
            <li> This really works your skin does look firmer and younger.  I use it every morning under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> This is a new line for me. I tried it due to family suggestions. I love it! My skin has never felt so clean and the serum is working to tighten my pores and reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for lil over a year now.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in anything really...I was using it for lil sagging around my jaw line and it also claims to help inhibit facial hair growth, which, as im aging, im becoming aware of but it doesn&#x27;t seem to help in that department either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so why did I order another not too long ago?  because I&#x27;ve heard great things about it and im hoping that MAYBE..a big MAYBE that is is keeping my jawline from sagging any further???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is not a moisturizer.  it is a fast absorbing/drying serum and I wear it under my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Feels natural.</li>
            <li> I like using this under a moisturizer or alone as my moisturizer.  It is a nice light product.  Makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> This makes my pores smaller, and seems to firm my skin a bit. My skin drinks it in and does not break out at all from it. I really like it. I use it at night after cleansing.</li>
            <li> Great product! So good for your skin; it&#x27;s been a staple in my cosmetic bag for a few years now. It&#x27;s a serum that I put on prior to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this product smells great, makes my skin soft without making it break out! i highly recommend it &amp; will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 15 years now and now have found this in the 4oz. size, thru Amazon...great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 2-3 weeks and see no changes to skin texture or appearance.  My mother in-law says to keep on for another 2 weeks for seeing benefits, so I will do so.</li>
