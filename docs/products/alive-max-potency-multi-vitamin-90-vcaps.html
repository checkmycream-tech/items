            <li> I feel a little misled.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I like this formulated version but I need the women&#x27;s formula.</li>
            <li> Love these vitamins. I can actually feel the difference when I use them.</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference when I stop and then start taking them again.  For the money, these are by far the best value in vitamins around.</li>
            <li> The best vitamin I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in high hopes and wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The product came in perfect condition and in record time!</li>
            <li> I have tried many vitamins and I can say from experience that this vitamin does better for me than some of the other more popular ones.  This one is the gel cap.  I think they are better than the tablets.</li>
            <li> I have been using these food-based vitamins for several years now and they give me a lot of energy and help me to stay healthy.  I hardly ever get sick since I&#x27;ve been taking them.</li>
            <li> I have taken these for years and LOVE them.  Here is why: The veggie caps seem to better absorb then the regular capsules. I admit I do not eat enough veggies and fruits. And the best part, I cannot tell you the last time I have had a cold.  (When people around me are dropping like flies) I credit these vitamins.  Even taking only two in the morning I feel a difference!</li>
            <li> This a great vitamin at a great price.I tried all the best ones out there.Taking it daily will make you feel hmmm  ALIVE!</li>
            <li> I searched every store within 50 miles of me to find these, but all stores only carry the TABLETS or CHEWIES. I prefer the CAPSULES i bought because there is NO additional fillers (i.e. gelatin, glycerin, etc) plus I can break it apart and sprinkle a small amount of the contents into my kids&#x27; juice cups to give them an extra dose of vitamins when their sick.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy these monthly - very good!</li>
            <li> Best vitamins on the market. if you can take only one kind, these will do nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my son he has no problems swallowing them and doesn&#x27;t hesitate when he takes them . Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Good price and no stomach trouble from the product.  Arrived on time and was the product advertised. Drawback: you have to knock out  6 pills a day.</li>
