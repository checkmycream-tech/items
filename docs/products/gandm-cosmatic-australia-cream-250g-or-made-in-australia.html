            <li>It has a very nice scent and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I researched for quite some time and ended up going with this because of the good reviews and great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>good price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using lanolin for a couple years now, it works good for me.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She was very pleased with this one</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>But LOVE the product once I get to it!</li>
            <li>very good, very fast!</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality cream with fragrance.</li>
            <li>It has no smell, huge plus in my book!  </li>
            <li>However, I would not recommend it for nursing moms as there are additional ingredients in it that may not be safe for baby.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off getting lanolin specifically for breasts.</li>
            <li>and she is asking for more, so definitively would recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>Absorbs easily and leave the hand very smooth and soothed.</li>
            <li>I missed that it is full of parabens!  </li>
            <li>It goes on wet and creamy, takes all of 7 seconds to soak in, great hand cream, keeps a nice water barrier for hours.  </li>
            <li>Good potential -- feels nice, but checking the ingredients list</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer , and absorbs super fast.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job, so it is cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Needlesstosay, I have used almost every resonably priced cream and lotion available.  </li>
            <li>I buy two or three jars at a time (in order to get free shipping).  </li>
            <li>This has a very powerful aroma, which reminded me of my grandmother.</li>
            <li>I guess it has something to do with that nice Australian lamb oil?</li>
            <li>but I might as well get my money&#x27;s worth, but I&#x27;m never buying it again.</li>
            <li>A little too pricey to use all over but very nice for the face.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my face right after I get out the shower</li>
            <li>Very soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The lotion takes an astonishing amount of time to rub in, otherwise it leaves white streaks on your face.</li>
            <li>exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it daily on my face and body.</li>
            <li>it is exactly what</li>
            <li>Great especially if your skin is dry, like mine.</li>
            <li>So nice- puts all other hand creams to shame.</li>
            <li>All lanolin products are not equal, but I found this to be good for repairing dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li>My husband and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>so it absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li>has tried many and other creams sting or irritate her skin when put on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is better than the more expensive dept. store creams I have been buying at 3 times the cost</li>
            <li>and I will continue to order it as my main moisturizer.</li>
            <li>good cream for everyday use especially in winter.</li>
            <li>I tried it on dry skin and damp skin fresh from the shower, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.</li>
            <li>The only downside would be the initial off fragrance, which I notice does dissipate somewhat quickly.  </li>
            <li>But, the pure lanolin take some time to soak in and I need something I can slap on my hands in the morning on the way out the door that will last all day.  </li>
            <li>Sort of medicinal, makes me think of an old folks home.</li>
            <li>it was at least cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just got the real one from Australia, and the real product is so much better than this fake one !</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave one feeling greasy, but it works very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my elbows and heels, but because of the strong smell I put it on either late at night or well before I&#x27;m going to be with people.</li>
            <li>Peeling off strong film that&#x27;s glued down is, frankly, impossible to do easily.  </li>
            <li>I live in an ultra dry state and work in an enclosed dry environment, so use this cream for everything - face and body - often several times a day on my hands and legs.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin is very dry.  My daughter used this cream when she was in Australia and told me about it.  It is awesome.  I have given it to everyone in my family.  Both my sisters and Brother-In-Laws are using it.</li>
            <li> This review is for the lanolin + vitamin e cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product looking for an inexpensive, lightweight daily moisturizer for my combination skin. I researched for quite some time and ended up going with this because of the good reviews and great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly do not understand how this product has ANY 5-star reviews. From the moment I opened the jar, I knew I had made a mistake! The smell is horrendous. Sort of medicinal, makes me think of an old folks home. I tried adding some orange essential oil, but it seemed like no matter how much I added I could not mask the awful smell! And the odor lasts for quite a while-I was afraid to let my husband kiss me for fear of him asking what the awful smell was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, I MIGHT have been willing to keep using it if it had performed well (mostly because I hate waste). Unfortunately, this is not the case. The lotion takes an astonishing amount of time to rub in, otherwise it leaves white streaks on your face. I tried it on dry skin and damp skin fresh from the shower, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. It left my face feeling almost tight/sticky which was horrible. And I had a small dry patch of flaky skin on my chin from a spot treatment for acne, but after putting this on before bed I woke up with the patch looking exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would never recommend this product and will probably throw it away. Thank GOODNESS it was at least cheap!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I have dry skin and live in a very dry climate.  This is better than the more expensive dept. store creams I have been buying at 3 times the cost and I will continue to order it as my main moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My husband and I really like this product.  It smooths and softens sun damaged skin and is an excellent moisturizer.  I apply it to my face right after I get out the shower so it absorbs really well.  Leaves my skin dewy but NOT greasy</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has saved my skin this winter, which has been exceptionally dry and cold!  I use it day and night and find that it moisturizes continuously between showers.  The only downside would be the initial off fragrance, which I notice does dissipate somewhat quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume, either, as long as I wait a little while after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion. Doesn&#x27;t leave one feeling greasy, but it works very well on dry skin. I guess it has something to do with that nice Australian lamb oil?</li>
            <li> I am suffering from skin rashes so I&#x27;m buying all sorts of creams and lotions to try. This is a nice quality cream with fragrance. A little too pricey to use all over but very nice for the face.</li>
            <li> good cream for everyday use especially in winter. It is my daily care after apply my toner water. keep skin moisture.</li>
            <li> good price it works well on the places i need it</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily on my face and body. However, I would not recommend it for nursing moms as there are additional ingredients in it that may not be safe for baby. You&#x27;re better off getting lanolin specifically for breasts. Otherwise, great product.</li>
            <li> So nice- puts all other hand creams to shame. Great for my husband - who has working man hands and for mine - for dishwater hands.</li>
            <li> Good potential -- feels nice, but checking the ingredients list I missed that it is full of parabens!  I wish I didn&#x27;t even have to use this jar but I might as well get my money&#x27;s worth, but I&#x27;m never buying it again.</li>
            <li> It works great on my chapped hands. Absorbs easily and leave the hand very smooth and soothed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using lanolin for a couple years now, it works good for me.  But, the pure lanolin take some time to soak in and I need something I can slap on my hands in the morning on the way out the door that will last all day.  Love this stuff!  It has no smell, huge plus in my book!  It goes on wet and creamy, takes all of 7 seconds to soak in, great hand cream, keeps a nice water barrier for hours.  Very glad I found IT!</li>
            <li> Use it on my skin. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer , and absorbs super fast.</li>
            <li> All lanolin products are not equal, but I found this to be good for repairing dry, cracked skin. It didn&#x27;t sting when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Lanolin night cream is best I haver used.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my wife from a recommendation from a friend.&lt;br /&gt;First I thought it would be just as any other cream that she has tried before.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has very dry skin on her hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;She has tried many and other creams sting or irritate her skin when put on.&lt;br /&gt;She was very pleased with this one and she is asking for more, so definitively would recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product. Please don&#x27;t buy it. I&#x27;ve just got the real one from Australia, and the real product is so much better than this fake one ! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this lotion was to thin to help me</li>
            <li> I thought it could be applied to my face. But it&#x27;s too oily. I can only use it on body.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim trying to find something for my son&#x27;s dry rough cracked hands....if that describes you then look no further! This stuff has transformed his hands. He LOVES it and so do I. It has a very nice scent and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. Soaks into your skin and soothes those awful red and dry patches. I will keep buying this! I tell everyone about this cream. Thank you Australia!!!</li>
            <li> I live in an ultra dry state and work in an enclosed dry environment, so use this cream for everything - face and body - often several times a day on my hands and legs.  I have a jar at work as well as one or two at home.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job, so it is cost effective.  Needlesstosay, I have used almost every resonably priced cream and lotion available.  I buy two or three jars at a time (in order to get free shipping).  One problem with their new packaging -- it&#x27;s difficult and messy to remove.  Peeling off strong film that&#x27;s glued down is, frankly, impossible to do easily.  But LOVE the product once I get to it!</li>
            <li> this cream is fantasitic.and it is exactly what I want.and my mother also want this one&lt;br /&gt; finally i have to give her</li>
            <li> This has a very powerful aroma, which reminded me of my grandmother. (I&#x27;m grandmother age now.) I think lanolin must have been all that was avalable &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve been using it on my elbows and heels, but because of the strong smell I put it on either late at night or well before I&#x27;m going to be with people. It does does soften the skin, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> very good, very fast!</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel wonderful and it also is great on my hands.  Why pay for expensive face creams.  Has no oily residue.</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable.  Great especially if your skin is dry, like mine.</li>
