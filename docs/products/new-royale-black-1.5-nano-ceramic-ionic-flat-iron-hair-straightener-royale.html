            <li>He was surprisingly knowledgeable about hair straightening and all the problems that come along with it.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good Iron, maybe If you haven&#x27;t had a good iron before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think it depends on who you buy it from on whether or not you get a good one.</li>
            <li>so I feel good that I didn&#x27;t get ripped off after all.</li>
            <li>Nice straightener good price and works great on my hair</li>
            <li>but I got free shampoo, conditioner and the sales girl was very pleasant and straightened all my hair.</li>

            <li>Something to make my hair look nice and neat without spending a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>They sell these kind of straighteners at the mall for over 150 dollars.</li>

            <li>The best I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Is as expected.very good product, easy to use,not burn hair.</li>
            <li>This iron works great and get VERY hot, so beware.</li>
            <li>To be honest I think it damaged my hair more then</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have very fine, course, frizzy hair with a lot of cowlicks.</li>
            <li>New in the box and very good price.</li>
            <li>It uses infrared heat which is great for your hair and its PURE CERAMIC PLATES.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind deal with Amazon since it has great reputation, but I don&#x27;t like deal with manufacture since they all have many so called &#x27;EXCEPTIONS&#x27; to really honor their warranty.  </li>
            <li>I like to know more about &#x27;Pro Salon Beauty&#x27; information.  </li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require to much heat to get a great salon quality straighten.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I love this straightner.</li>
            <li>just OK, it works, but that&#x27;s all...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this is my review because I have a CHI, and its so much better, (</li>

            <li>IN LOVE WITH THIS STRAIGHTENER.</li>
            <li>OMG I&#x27;M IN LOVE.</li>
            <li>and that means more heat damage</li>
            <li>Its ok, it straightens but gives ur hair a burnt smell.</li>
            <li>Buy knowing that it is not the latest release like those that show us  kiosk.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky and looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>This one works better than all of them.</li>
            <li>Love it best treatment gives life back to my hair!</li>
            <li>i love it though</li>
            <li>One of the best flat iron...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot, therefore not as good at straightening your hair.</li>
            <li>The cheap plastic holder for more than one hunder bucks product?  </li>
            <li>(I know, right!?!)</li>
            <li>, the packaging was very nice and professional.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron and works great on my hair and is high quality as well.</li>
            <li>When we got home, we couldn&#x27;t wait to try it ourselves and still just as easy as the gentleman in the mall made it out to be.</li>
            <li>This is perfect my niece/god daughter needed a new flat iron and found this one at a great price and was delivered so fast she loves it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy, fast and safe on my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone who likes to have nice straightened or curled hair love it.</li>
            <li>I have fine, striaght hair</li>
            <li>I have fine curly colored treated hair.</li>
            <li>This thing feels really cheap.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I paid $150 for this straightner and a &#x27;free&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the plastic is cheap</li>
            <li>I paid $90 and got the iron, a stand up holder and a free bottle of shampoo....</li>
            <li>Great price saw same one at the mall for 200.00!</li>
            <li>For the next 6 months they will do her hair for free whenever we come in the mall!!!</li>
            <li>I tested this flat iron at the mall and thought it was great, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay $150 for it.</li>
            <li>This product is great for African American hair, no matter how thick!!!I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>When I received it, I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>When I bought it I paid about $80 for it and it was worth it!</li>
            <li>The new one is amazing...</li>
            <li>it works great and looks exactly the same as the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ones.  </li>
            <li>I have used only once since it arrived, but it seems good product.</li>
            <li>We absolutely fell in love with the ease of use and the ability to straighten after just one swipe of the iron through her hair.    </li>
            <li>Loved this flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good flat iron</li>
            <li>It is very excellent quality, seriously.</li>
            <li>My 14-year-old daughter bought this straightening iron from a Kiosk at a mall today after a demonstration on her mildly curly hair (she had tried to straighten it herself in the morning).</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t heat up quickly, like stated in the info packet.</li>
            <li>all within a quick amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>course at this point I am out of my money and out of luck because the item was more than 30 days old.</li>
            <li>We got a lifetime warranty and holder and a hair comb to go with the purchase, I loved the iron so much that I went back to the Kiosk and bought one for myself.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve had with this is the warmup wait, honestly.</li>
            <li>Got my monies worth on this product.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have VERY straight hair, but using this really makes my hair look sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li>I let the woman straighten a few strands of my hair and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>If I find any problems in the future I will let you all know, so far seems fair for the price.</li>
            <li>it very much.</li>
            <li>i like it very much.</li>
            <li>i was in the mall with my friends when sale girl showed me royal flat iron &amp; said that it&#x27;ll cost $200 but when i checked on amazon.com ,it was only $42.i love to own this flat iron,i feel my hair are more smoother &amp; silky now.</li>
            <li>The flat iron worked great on my hair, but it stopped working after the second use.</li>
            <li>Which country are the products made in exactly?  </li>
            <li>I was interested in this product because I was stopped by one of the vendors in the mall.</li>
            <li>However, I still wanted to search online first.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that I purchased from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>have thick wavy hair, does a great job.</li>
            <li>My sister has the same one she purchased in the mall (for much much more $$) and using hers</li>
            <li>My hair stays plank straight for a week without touch-ups!</li>
            <li>I, like many of you, first saw this flat iron at a mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>This is the fist flat iron I love.</li>
            <li>The Royale is better than any flat iron for my hair.</li>
            <li>I just love this flat iron..</li>
            <li>OMG I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was amazing, but he charged me $300, then he went down to $100.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t shut off automatically after a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li>It straightened easily and stayed straight through the next day.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t even get a little warm</li>
            <li>So, the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>her hair looks like it is naturally straight when she uses it.</li>
            <li>I found this one at a much lower price and purchased it.</li>
            <li>Ended up buying a one at a Royale kiosk afterwards just to try and found out this one is real too.</li>
            <li>but this one really does the job.</li>
            <li>Does not heat very well.  </li>
            <li>I live on the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; side of the Island of Hawaii, so finding a hot iron straightener that seals and straightens</li>
            <li>So far I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I like many other people was at the mall and saw a woman who tested this product on my hair.</li>
            <li>After seeing how he was able to transform her usually coarse thick hair into something so manageable, soft, shiny and smooth!!</li>
            <li>But honestly with one maybe two presses well-la, no more kinks.</li>
            <li>Price was more than half of what I paid In the past.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So much better than the chi and cost much less.</li>
            <li>It calims the product is made in Italy, why no company information or web site link if the products are from a decent size manufacture?  </li>
            <li>Earlier pulled my hair a bit, but now I think it&#x27;s super efficient.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t I have to have it on high heat to work</li>
            <li>My irons are very important to me as I use them everyday.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know if the product can be more durable, or maybe other users just be more careful, but they are fragile.</li>
            <li>It stays pretty much the same even when I am in high-humidity.    </li>
            <li>Normally I keep straighteners on 250 degrees or so but with this one I turned it all the way</li>
            <li>My very first flat iron was a Royale that I bought at a mall over 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I owned a Royale that was purchased NEW at the MALL</li>
            <li>I was at the mall a second time, ready to purchase it and thought about researching a little more and found this one listed on amazon.</li>
            <li>Definitely need to improve the package, the flat iron looks cheap compare to SEDU product.</li>
            <li>But, I am giving the review only 4 stars because they broke one the first fall.....</li>
            <li>(you have to keep the original box and receipt...and the straightener can&#x27;t look \\&quot;abused\\&quot; or have any modifications/work done by anyone other than the company).  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft !</li>
            <li>They also stopped getting hot enough after about a year and the ceramic was chipping on both.</li>
            <li>Does exactly the same thing</li>
            <li>Made from cheap plastic and not worth buying it.</li>
            <li>Is not the Mall iron, not get hot enough</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t even hot enough!</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product for use while traveling due to its dual voltage.</li>
            <li>but it works exactly the same as the $200 one.</li>
            <li>Yes this is the same exact straightener the kiosks at the mall sell for $200.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be exactly the same though-</li>
            <li>and it laid it down very well!!!</li>
            <li>It makes your hair shiny and soft and it lasts if you know what your doing.</li>
            <li>I have had other expensive flat irons, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so straight that not even a curling iron will work to curl it, but this flat iron does the job wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>does not mess it up.</li>
            <li>And its nothing all that sand special in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li>It flattens my hair with barely any re-passover needed, and makes it so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>This product heats up quickly and does little damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>I recently decided that I wanted to get a new one and ended up getting a Chi because everyone just loves them.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it if you like this flat iron .</li>
            <li>I was actually taken back by how straight my hair was.</li>
            <li>However, on the first use I noticed I had to keep going down the same strand of hair many times, but on the mall one they only went down the strand ONCE!</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference between not using a flat iron at all, using my old drug store purchased flat iron, and using this one.</li>
            <li>I have medium texture wavy hair (Caucasian) but it can get very unruly in the very dry California weather.</li>
            <li>the old ones, the new ones have less quality, that why I decided to try a new brand).&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice</li>
            <li>Sadly my daughter was with me at the mall and saw the amazing results of the products, so</li>
            <li>Nothing special I bought it thinking it was going to be better than the purple one same brand less expensive</li>
            <li>I am also a retired hair stylist and have used the professional flat irons too.</li>
            <li>Well worth the little extra</li>
            <li>It became completely unreliable in such a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews I expected a high quality straightener.</li>
            <li>and this one does the exact same thing of much less money.</li>
            <li>I have used many other straighteners in the past but my hair always starts to re-curl at the ends by the next day which hardly makes it worth the 1 1/2 to 2 hours it takes for me to straighten it.</li>
            <li>I have super thick course hair and this straightener does wonders.</li>
            <li>like the other reviewer said, I think it is just normal, what I would expect out of a straightner.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this over any other brand any day!</li>

            <li> and I think it depends on who you buy it from on whether or not you get a good one.</li>

            <li> OMG I&#x27;M IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> and that means more heat damage</li>
            <li> Its ok, it straightens but gives ur hair a burnt smell.</li>
            <li> Buy knowing that it is not the latest release like those that show us  kiosk.</li>

            <li> This one works better than all of them.</li>

            <li> i love it though</li>
            <li> One of the best flat iron...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as hot, therefore not as good at straightening your hair.</li>
            <li> The cheap plastic holder for more than one hunder bucks product?  </li>
            <li> (I know, right!?!)</li>
            <li> , the packaging was very nice and professional.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron and works great on my hair and is high quality as well.</li>
            <li> When we got home, we couldn&#x27;t wait to try it ourselves and still just as easy as the gentleman in the mall made it out to be.</li>
            <li> This is perfect my niece/god daughter needed a new flat iron and found this one at a great price and was delivered so fast she loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy, fast and safe on my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to everyone who likes to have nice straightened or curled hair love it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, striaght hair</li>
            <li> I have fine curly colored treated hair.</li>
            <li> This thing feels really cheap.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I paid $150 for this straightner and a &#x27;free&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the plastic is cheap</li>
            <li> I paid $90 and got the iron, a stand up holder and a free bottle of shampoo....</li>
            <li> Great price saw same one at the mall for 200.00!</li>
            <li> For the next 6 months they will do her hair for free whenever we come in the mall!!!</li>
            <li> I tested this flat iron at the mall and thought it was great, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay $150 for it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for African American hair, no matter how thick!!!I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> When I received it, I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> When I bought it I paid about $80 for it and it was worth it!</li>
            <li> The new one is amazing...</li>
            <li> it works great and looks exactly the same as the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ones.  </li>
            <li> I have used only once since it arrived, but it seems good product.</li>
            <li> We absolutely fell in love with the ease of use and the ability to straighten after just one swipe of the iron through her hair.    </li>
            <li> Loved this flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good flat iron</li>
            <li> It is very excellent quality, seriously.</li>
            <li> My 14-year-old daughter bought this straightening iron from a Kiosk at a mall today after a demonstration on her mildly curly hair (she had tried to straighten it herself in the morning).</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t heat up quickly, like stated in the info packet.</li>
            <li> all within a quick amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> course at this point I am out of my money and out of luck because the item was more than 30 days old.</li>
            <li> We got a lifetime warranty and holder and a hair comb to go with the purchase, I loved the iron so much that I went back to the Kiosk and bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had with this is the warmup wait, honestly.</li>
            <li> Got my monies worth on this product.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have VERY straight hair, but using this really makes my hair look sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li> I let the woman straighten a few strands of my hair and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> If I find any problems in the future I will let you all know, so far seems fair for the price.</li>
            <li> it very much.</li>
            <li> i like it very much.</li>
            <li> i was in the mall with my friends when sale girl showed me royal flat iron &amp; said that it&#x27;ll cost $200 but when i checked on amazon.com ,it was only $42.i love to own this flat iron,i feel my hair are more smoother &amp; silky now.</li>
            <li> The flat iron worked great on my hair, but it stopped working after the second use.</li>
            <li> Which country are the products made in exactly?  </li>
            <li> I was interested in this product because I was stopped by one of the vendors in the mall.</li>
            <li> However, I still wanted to search online first.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that I purchased from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> have thick wavy hair, does a great job.</li>
            <li> My sister has the same one she purchased in the mall (for much much more $$) and using hers</li>
            <li> My hair stays plank straight for a week without touch-ups!</li>
            <li> I, like many of you, first saw this flat iron at a mall kiosk.</li>
            <li> This is the fist flat iron I love.</li>
            <li> The Royale is better than any flat iron for my hair.</li>
            <li> I just love this flat iron..</li>
            <li> OMG I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was amazing, but he charged me $300, then he went down to $100.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t shut off automatically after a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li> It straightened easily and stayed straight through the next day.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t even get a little warm</li>
            <li> So, the shipping was fast</li>
            <li> her hair looks like it is naturally straight when she uses it.</li>
            <li> I found this one at a much lower price and purchased it.</li>
            <li> Ended up buying a one at a Royale kiosk afterwards just to try and found out this one is real too.</li>
            <li> but this one really does the job.</li>
            <li> Does not heat very well.  </li>
            <li> I live on the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; side of the Island of Hawaii, so finding a hot iron straightener that seals and straightens</li>
            <li> So far I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I like many other people was at the mall and saw a woman who tested this product on my hair.</li>
            <li> After seeing how he was able to transform her usually coarse thick hair into something so manageable, soft, shiny and smooth!!</li>
            <li> But honestly with one maybe two presses well-la, no more kinks.</li>
            <li> Price was more than half of what I paid In the past.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So much better than the chi and cost much less.</li>
            <li> It calims the product is made in Italy, why no company information or web site link if the products are from a decent size manufacture?  </li>
            <li> Earlier pulled my hair a bit, but now I think it&#x27;s super efficient.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t I have to have it on high heat to work</li>
            <li> My irons are very important to me as I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if the product can be more durable, or maybe other users just be more careful, but they are fragile.</li>
            <li> It stays pretty much the same even when I am in high-humidity.    </li>
            <li> Normally I keep straighteners on 250 degrees or so but with this one I turned it all the way</li>
            <li> My very first flat iron was a Royale that I bought at a mall over 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I owned a Royale that was purchased NEW at the MALL</li>
            <li> I was at the mall a second time, ready to purchase it and thought about researching a little more and found this one listed on amazon.</li>
            <li> Definitely need to improve the package, the flat iron looks cheap compare to SEDU product.</li>
            <li> But, I am giving the review only 4 stars because they broke one the first fall.....</li>
            <li> (you have to keep the original box and receipt...and the straightener can&#x27;t look \\&quot;abused\\&quot; or have any modifications/work done by anyone other than the company).  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft !</li>
            <li> They also stopped getting hot enough after about a year and the ceramic was chipping on both.</li>
            <li> Does exactly the same thing</li>
            <li> Made from cheap plastic and not worth buying it.</li>
            <li> Is not the Mall iron, not get hot enough</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even hot enough!</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product for use while traveling due to its dual voltage.</li>
            <li> but it works exactly the same as the $200 one.</li>
            <li> Yes this is the same exact straightener the kiosks at the mall sell for $200.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be exactly the same though-</li>
            <li> and it laid it down very well!!!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair shiny and soft and it lasts if you know what your doing.</li>
            <li> I have had other expensive flat irons, but this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so straight that not even a curling iron will work to curl it, but this flat iron does the job wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does not mess it up.</li>
            <li> And its nothing all that sand special in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> It flattens my hair with barely any re-passover needed, and makes it so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This product heats up quickly and does little damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> I recently decided that I wanted to get a new one and ended up getting a Chi because everyone just loves them.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it if you like this flat iron .</li>
            <li> I was actually taken back by how straight my hair was.</li>
            <li> However, on the first use I noticed I had to keep going down the same strand of hair many times, but on the mall one they only went down the strand ONCE!</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference between not using a flat iron at all, using my old drug store purchased flat iron, and using this one.</li>
            <li> I have medium texture wavy hair (Caucasian) but it can get very unruly in the very dry California weather.</li>
            <li> the old ones, the new ones have less quality, that why I decided to try a new brand).&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice</li>
            <li> Sadly my daughter was with me at the mall and saw the amazing results of the products, so</li>
            <li> Nothing special I bought it thinking it was going to be better than the purple one same brand less expensive</li>
            <li> I am also a retired hair stylist and have used the professional flat irons too.</li>
            <li> Well worth the little extra</li>
            <li> It became completely unreliable in such a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews I expected a high quality straightener.</li>
            <li> and this one does the exact same thing of much less money.</li>
            <li> I have used many other straighteners in the past but my hair always starts to re-curl at the ends by the next day which hardly makes it worth the 1 1/2 to 2 hours it takes for me to straighten it.</li>
            <li> I have super thick course hair and this straightener does wonders.</li>
            <li> like the other reviewer said, I think it is just normal, what I would expect out of a straightner.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this over any other brand any day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some of the most expensive flat irons on the market.</li>
            <li> and i have never used a flat iron that actually worked on my hair.</li>
            <li> and I use a flat iron daily for styling.  </li>
            <li> This is the third Royale Flat Iron that I have  purchased .  </li>
            <li> my regular flat iron did.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Royale flat iron I have had.  </li>
            <li> This is not the SAME flat iron as the one in the malls!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s ceramic, it feels more like thick glass</li>
            <li> Let me say, I am a black woman with very coarse hair in which I never thought anything other than a pressing comb off the stove would get my hair to be as straight.</li>
            <li> Beet flat iron I&amp;#34;ve ever used</li>
            <li> i bought this flat iron at the mall today for $119, but mine came with the silicone stand and a lifetime warranty</li>
            <li> A coworker of mine with curly hair that she likes to straighten purchased this flat iron after she saw how mine worked and</li>
            <li> I use this flat Iron all the time.</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy frizzy and this flat iron makes my hair so silky.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a month ago from here</li>
            <li> I bought one at the mall yesterday for $150 and felt slightly let down after seeing this one for so much cheaper here.</li>
            <li> The flat iron is actually 1\\&quot; wide instead of 1 1/2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely hard to straighten and stay straight</li>
            <li> I was using an expensive Chi straightner and a cheap ConAir (for my bangs).</li>
            <li> I just bought the pink one, but they also have the deep purple, and debra print sets.  </li>
            <li> I have very \\&quot;Frizzy\\&quot;, curly, thick, course hair.</li>
            <li> Biggest piece of crap I&#x27;ve ever bought and the warranty of course is good</li>
            <li> I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to buy it from her at that ridiculous price</li>
            <li> only problem is package and posting described a black flat iron and mines came purple ..</li>
            <li> Also, the plates themselves aren&#x27;t very long</li>
            <li> Dry&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Small enough for small hands, the pro and the beginner who just wants to do her bangs.</li>
            <li> My hair usually be shine and soft after I use.</li>
            <li> And for about 85% less than the regular retail price, I will take the one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> There is no reason an item such as this should have stopped working in less than a years time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is the picture shows the plates being gold and the one I got has black plates.</li>
            <li> I have impossibly thick, curly, and unruly hair that really dislikes doing what I want half the time</li>
            <li> is that after 30 days when Amazon does not accept returns...Royale can use this as an excuse to do NOTHING about the defective product!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried on wet hair yet though.</li>
            <li> Was impossible to keep clean!</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was that the box was previously opened, and there was some hair (previous owner probably) inside the box.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that I could get the same one for so much cheaper</li>
            <li> just as expected!</li>
            <li> and I have no complaints besides a few minor issues with the cord.</li>
            <li> (but I think that the issues are my fault due to improper storage)</li>
            <li> You can use it to iron your hair while its wet!  </li>
            <li> and I use it 2-3 times a week in the lowest heat setting to curl-iron my bangs and some other areas .</li>
            <li> I have never again had to worry about buying any other heat styling products.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it would heat up, other times not.</li>
            <li> Tried to tough it out and ended up buying a new one all together.</li>
            <li> this is a fake Royale straightener as i have a real one.this ad also says new and the box seal was broken and inside packaging torn apart, the warranty and product paper work have stains on them.</li>
            <li> when she saw that I had bought them she immediately asked to use them and clumsy her set them on the bathroom sink, turned her back for a moment and crack.</li>
            <li> Start off at a low temp and slowly bump it up until you find the temp that will give you the desired results.</li>
            <li> I only let him press and curl a very small part of my hair</li>
            <li> I owned one previously for 2 years, but I dropped it and the plates cracked.</li>
            <li> I have very delicate long and medium hair, very long</li>
            <li> Sometimes it would heat up just a little, sometimes it would heat up to</li>
            <li> but it shipped way faster than expected!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustrated with the controls being in a hard to manipulate place along with the very slow warm up time.</li>
            <li> just got it today and already not satisfied.</li>
            <li> A slick salesman tried to con me at the mall to buy this thing for $125.</li>
            <li> There should be a mandatory warranty for at least a year for customers to return defective items like this.</li>

            <li> we all know what i mean.</li>
            <li> Now, Royale did give me the option of paying some ridiculous price like $40 to replace my defective iron...</li>

            <li> Will get the job done  but will take some time with thick hair. It did go out on me a year after I purchased it. My hairdresser just got me one nice one with her discount</li>
            <li> The flat iron is actually 1\\&quot; wide instead of 1 1/2\\&quot;.  I am uttered for the poor package.  The cheap plastic holder for more than one hunder bucks product?  I questioned how the term of 5 year warranty works, still hasn&#x27;t the answer back.  I don&#x27;t mind deal with Amazon since it has great reputation, but I don&#x27;t like deal with manufacture since they all have many so called &#x27;EXCEPTIONS&#x27; to really honor their warranty.  I tried to find &#x27;Pro Salon Beauty&#x27; information, can&#x27;t locate it from google.  I can only communicate with them with email through Amazon.  It calims the product is made in Italy, why no company information or web site link if the products are from a decent size manufacture?  Which country are the products made in exactly?  I like to know more about &#x27;Pro Salon Beauty&#x27; information.  Overall, I think the product works as it says, but not up to the price I paid.  Definitely need to improve the package, the flat iron looks cheap compare to SEDU product.</li>
            <li> I was interested in this product because I was stopped by one of the vendors in the mall. I thought it was amazing, but he charged me $300, then he went down to $100. However, I still wanted to search online first. I have used only once since it arrived, but it seems good product. I haven&#x27;t tried on wet hair yet though. The only thing I did not like was that the box was previously opened, and there was some hair (previous owner probably) inside the box. I ignored it, and used it. If I find any problems in the future I will let you all know, so far seems fair for the price. thank you!</li>
            <li> i was in the mall with my friends when sale girl showed me royal flat iron &amp; said that it&#x27;ll cost $200 but when i checked on amazon.com ,it was only $42.i love to own this flat iron,i feel my hair are more smoother &amp; silky now.</li>
            <li> Beet flat iron I&amp;#34;ve ever used</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I expected a high quality straightener. This thing feels really cheap. Also, the plates themselves aren&#x27;t very long so you have to do smaller sections of hair.</li>
            <li> So I bought these flatirons because like everyone else on here, I was approached by a overly aggressive salesman at the mall offering the same brand of flatirons. After the salesman harassed me into letting him curl my hair I was actually taken back by how straight my hair was. I only let him press and curl a very small part of my hair but the next day after sleeping with no scarf or bonnet on my head, THE CURL WAS STILL THERE! Let me say, I am a black woman with very coarse hair in which I never thought anything other than a pressing comb off the stove would get my hair to be as straight. But honestly with one maybe two presses well-la, no more kinks. So, the shipping was fast (Kudos to Amazon Prime!), the packaging was very nice and professional. But, I am giving the review only 4 stars because they broke one the first fall..... Sadly my daughter was with me at the mall and saw the amazing results of the products, so when she saw that I had bought them she immediately asked to use them and clumsy her set them on the bathroom sink, turned her back for a moment and crack. The flatiron plate chipped and that was that. So I don&#x27;t know if the product can be more durable, or maybe other users just be more careful, but they are fragile.</li>
            <li> perfect! just as expected!</li>
            <li> Use this link [...] and go to more deals.  There is a royal straightener combo with a straightener, mini straightener, and a curling iron all for $99.  I just bought the pink one, but they also have the deep purple, and debra print sets.  I have used royale for years! I have never had a problem, and this is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve seen EVER!! I hope this helps some of you ladies! The website sells the sets for $349, so this is a very good deal.  :-)</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter love it so...works for me!  They are very happy with this brand as it is the first time we have bought this type.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter who has thick, wavy hair. It straightened easily and stayed straight through the next day. We are very satisfied with this product. I have purchased other Royale products and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Is as expected.very good product, easy to use,not burn hair.New in the box and very good price.I love it.</li>
            <li> One of the best flat iron...</li>
            <li> i bought this flat iron at the mall today for $119, but mine came with the silicone stand and a lifetime warranty (you have to keep the original box and receipt...and the straightener can&#x27;t look \\&quot;abused\\&quot; or have any modifications/work done by anyone other than the company).  i have really thick, curly, frizzy hair and i have never used a flat iron that actually worked on my hair. I used it as soon as i got home, and i&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I returned this product. It damaged my hair and didn&#x27;t do as advertised</li>
            <li> I have had other expensive flat irons, but this one is by far the best.  It leaves my hair shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing ! It makes my hair so soft ! I love it. And it&#x27;s 100$ anywhere else !</li>
            <li> Nice straightener good price and works great on my hair</li>
            <li> I tested this flat iron at the mall and thought it was great, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay $150 for it. I was at the mall a second time, ready to purchase it and thought about researching a little more and found this one listed on amazon. I saved a ton of money buying it here and it comes in the same box as the one demonstrated to me at the mall. I have VERY straight hair, but using this really makes my hair look sleek and smooth. I can really tell a difference between not using a flat iron at all, using my old drug store purchased flat iron, and using this one. A coworker of mine with curly hair that she likes to straighten purchased this flat iron after she saw how mine worked and her hair looks like it is naturally straight when she uses it. Make sure you buy it from a seller with good review.</li>
            <li> This is the fist flat iron I love. It goes nice and smooth on my hair. The best I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have used it both in US and abroad I like that it is dual voltage. I still need to learn how to curl with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent. ...just as show in the picture! The original!!★★★★★</li>
            <li> I use this flat Iron all the time. I have had it for almost two years now and I have no complaints besides a few minor issues with the cord. (but I think that the issues are my fault due to improper storage)</li>
            <li> So far I love this flat iron. I owned one previously for 2 years, but I dropped it and the plates cracked. I thought I would try a more expensive iron and I did not like any of the 3 I tried: Ion, Solia, and Rowenta.  I ended up returning them and going back to a Royale.  I have fine, striaght hair and I use a flat iron daily for styling.  I was looking for an iron that grips my hair without snagging or pulling, one that works well for curling, and that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  My hair is so straight that not even a curling iron will work to curl it, but this flat iron does the job wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have said that the Royale irons on Amazon are fakes.  If it is a fake, I can&#x27;t tell... it works great and looks exactly the same as the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ones.  And for about 85% less than the regular retail price, I will take the one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, work superbly. Doesn&#x27;t require to much heat to get a great salon quality straighten. Heats up in no time.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightner at a kiosk at the mall today. The guy did a demo on my hair. He was surprisingly knowledgeable about hair straightening and all the problems that come along with it.    I paid $150 for this straightner and a &#x27;free&#x27; shampoo. I see now I over paid compared to online prices. Anyway, I have very fine, course, frizzy hair with a lot of cowlicks. I was using an expensive Chi straightner and a cheap ConAir (for my bangs). I would have to go over my hair several times. They also stopped getting hot enough after about a year and the ceramic was chipping on both. Just so you know what I am comparing this one to.    Anyway, I love this straightner. I only have to go over each section once and it can do fairly thick sections. It makes my hair smooth and shiny. It stays pretty much the same even when I am in high-humidity.    I don&#x27;t think the plastic is cheap like the other reviewer said, I think it is just normal, what I would expect out of a straightner. It is also light-weight.    It was well worth the money. The guy explained the warranty. It is a standard manufacturer warranty that covers defects, such as if it breaks or stops working.</li>
            <li> THIS THING IS FABULOUS!!! My daughter has had a relaxer since she was 5 and she&#x27;s now 12. Because of the damage the relaxer has done to her hair we decided to go \\&quot;natural\\&quot;. This process has been costly and time consuming....until I ran into a Royale salesman at my local mall. After seeing how he was able to transform her usually coarse thick hair into something so manageable, soft, shiny and smooth!! I HAD TO HAVE IT!!! I got a great deal on it too. I paid $90 and got the iron, a stand up holder and a free bottle of shampoo.... BUT THAT&#x27;S NOT ALL!!! For the next 6 months they will do her hair for free whenever we come in the mall!!! YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT THAT!!! This product is great for African American hair, no matter how thick!!!I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> this is a fake Royale straightener as i have a real one.this ad also says new and the box seal was broken and inside packaging torn apart, the warranty and product paper work have stains on them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good Iron, maybe If you haven&#x27;t had a good iron before.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just OK, it works, but that&#x27;s all...&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is my review because I have a CHI, and its so much better, (the old ones, the new ones have less quality, that why I decided to try a new brand).&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice and then I preferred to sell it, and buy a InfraShine. This Royale, didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I, like many of you, first saw this flat iron at a mall kiosk. It did an amazing job on my hair, and I was really impressed, but not on the price! I found this one at a much lower price and purchased it. When I received it, I was so excited to try it out. However, on the first use I noticed I had to keep going down the same strand of hair many times, but on the mall one they only went down the strand ONCE! This is not the SAME flat iron as the one in the malls! It doesn&#x27;t get as hot, therefore not as good at straightening your hair. Also, I noticed my hair getting frizzy and wavy within minutes of being outside! Save your money and go to Sally&#x27;s and get the GVP (Generic Value Product)brand. Its awesome!!</li>
            <li> This is the third Royale Flat Iron that I have  purchased .  I always got them from the kiosks in the mall . This is the first one that I purchased from Amazon.  Price was more than half of what I paid In the past.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell a difference if there is any.  Great deal great product I would highly recommend it if you like this flat iron .</li>
            <li> Love this! ordered my own because i would always borrow my sisters. I have super thick course hair and this straightener does wonders. So much better than the chi and cost much less. I would highly recommend this over any other brand any day!</li>
            <li> Purchase this after repeated attempts at purchasing other products that randomly breaks!&lt;br /&gt;And I have thick, curly hair and it straightens so perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;love it!! its been almost a year and I still have it!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I am looking for.  Something to make my hair look nice and neat without spending a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;Like it very much.</li>
            <li> Product is okay. Not what I was expecting but it shipped way faster than expected!!!</li>
            <li> This item is getting a very low rating because it stopped working 10 months after I got it. There is no reason an item such as this should have stopped working in less than a years time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course at this point I am out of my money and out of luck because the item was more than 30 days old. There should be a mandatory warranty for at least a year for customers to return defective items like this.</li>
            <li> Ended up buying a one at a Royale kiosk afterwards just to try and found out this one is real too. Does exactly the same thing</li>
            <li> Ive had this for 5 years (Since April 2011) and I&#x27;ve never had any problems. It is very excellent quality, seriously. You can use it to iron your hair while its wet!  I have very delicate long and medium hair, very long and I use it 2-3 times a week in the lowest heat setting to curl-iron my bangs and some other areas . It uses infrared heat which is great for your hair and its PURE CERAMIC PLATES. I was scared about buying this but its the best thing i did. I have never again had to worry about buying any other heat styling products. Imagine that.. Ive had it for 5 years, dropped it several times, chipped a tiny corner once and it has always worked great! When I bought it I paid about $80 for it and it was worth it!</li>
            <li> I have very \\&quot;Frizzy\\&quot;, curly, thick, course hair. I have straightened it for years. I am also a retired hair stylist and have used the professional flat irons too. The Royale is better than any flat iron for my hair. Only need to iron one time on each strand, you don&#x27;t have to re-flatiron in between washings &amp; sleeping on your your hair does not mess it up. I love it!</li>
            <li> My 14-year-old daughter bought this straightening iron from a Kiosk at a mall today after a demonstration on her mildly curly hair (she had tried to straighten it herself in the morning). We absolutely fell in love with the ease of use and the ability to straighten after just one swipe of the iron through her hair.    We got a lifetime warranty and holder and a hair comb to go with the purchase, I loved the iron so much that I went back to the Kiosk and bought one for myself. When we got home, we couldn&#x27;t wait to try it ourselves and still just as easy as the gentleman in the mall made it out to be. Best purchase we have made for ourselves!!!</li>
            <li> Love this straightner! Great price saw same one at the mall for 200.00! My hair is extremely hard to straighten and stay straight but this one really does the job. Great customer service from this company as well!</li>
            <li> The flat iron worked great on my hair, but it stopped working after the second use. I think that this was a used product.</li>
            <li> The best item I ever used.Highly recommend to everyone who likes to have nice straightened or curled hair love it.</li>
            <li> Made from cheap plastic and not worth buying it. You&#x27;re better off buying a nume</li>
            <li> Is not the Mall iron, not get hot enough</li>
            <li> I like many other people was at the mall and saw a woman who tested this product on my hair. I am mixed so some of the products aren&#x27;t meant for my hair. Long story short I let the woman straighten a few strands of my hair and it was amazing! I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to buy it from her at that ridiculous price so I looked on Amazon. I read the reviews and I think it depends on who you buy it from on whether or not you get a good one. Mine works great and I have had no issues with it. Well worth the price. Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair at all.</li>
            <li> This product came in on time and it was packaged well. I have 3b/3c hair no perm! and it laid it down very well!!! It makes your hair shiny and soft and it lasts if you know what your doing. so if it ever breaks I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> DIL said it fizzed her hair,sent it back.</li>
            <li> i like it very much. Everything is same as in discription. .... ..... ...... ...... ....... ........ ...... ...... .....</li>
            <li> I hated this thing. I turned the heat all the way up and it wasn&#x27;t even hot enough! Normally I keep straighteners on 250 degrees or so but with this one I turned it all the way and it wasn&#x27;t hot enough. When I would have some product left in my hair it baked on the plates. Was impossible to keep clean! Tried to tough it out and ended up buying a new one all together. The new one is amazing... but this is a p.o.s.</li>
            <li> I just love this flat iron..this is the 2nd one that I purchased, and will continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing. Absoultey love it</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I read all the reviews before I made my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick wavy hair, does a great job.</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had with this is the warmup wait, honestly. It flattens my hair with barely any re-passover needed, and makes it so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> IN LOVE WITH THIS STRAIGHTENER. They sell these kind of straighteners at the mall for over 150 dollars. So it was great to find a deal like this online! I love amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I have medium texture wavy hair (Caucasian) but it can get very unruly in the very dry California weather. Dry&#x3D;frizz/breakage. This iron works great and get VERY hot, so beware. Start off at a low temp and slowly bump it up until you find the temp that will give you the desired results.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this flat iron.  My hair is wavy frizzy and this flat iron makes my hair so silky.  No longer frizzy :o)</li>
            <li> Does not over heat, does not burn hair! OMG I&#x27;M IN LOVE. No more of that horrible smell.....we all know what i mean. Small enough for small hands, the pro and the beginner who just wants to do her bangs.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t heat up quickly, like stated in the info packet. After 5 mins, they still didn&#x27;t heat up properly</li>
            <li> Nothing special I bought it thinking it was going to be better than the purple one same brand less expensive but it wasn&#x27;t I have to have it on high heat to work and that means more heat damage</li>
            <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;- Temperature setting&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- Breaks hair&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t heat up the outside enough for longer curls&lt;br /&gt;- RETURN POLICY NOT GOOD. Has to be unopened, unused. (How will one test it if it&#x27;s unopened or not used?!)&lt;br /&gt;- Not sure if it&#x27;s ceramic, it feels more like thick glass</li>
            <li> Its ok, it straightens but gives ur hair a burnt smell. It straightens on time but its not like what they say. your hair will curl up from moisture.</li>
            <li> It heat&#x27;s up great, however, it does not have an automatic power off and sometimes I forget to turn it off and leave my room.</li>
            <li> I bought one at the mall yesterday for $150 and felt slightly let down after seeing this one for so much cheaper here. If you did the same, don&#x27;t feel bad. After further research I found that the one I bought and this inexpensive one are different. This one is ceramic COATED and mine is the 100% ceramic plates. The 100% ceramic plate versions run from $75-300 + shipping online so I feel good that I didn&#x27;t get ripped off after all. Whatever the price, the one I got is amazing! My hair has never looked better! It&#x27;s also very easy, fast and safe on my hair. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I paid $150 but I got free shampoo, conditioner and the sales girl was very pleasant and straightened all my hair. Well worth the little extra I may have saved if I purchased online. I don&#x27;t have to wait for shipping and I have a local established place to deal with for any future warranty issues.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! My hair usually be shine and soft after I use.</li>
            <li> Buy knowing that it is not the latest release like those that show us  kiosk. Earlier pulled my hair a bit, but now I think it&#x27;s super efficient.</li>
            <li> To be honest I think it damaged my hair more then my regular flat iron did. My ends are terrible after using it.</li>
            <li> I live on the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; side of the Island of Hawaii, so finding a hot iron straightener that seals and straightens my hair curly hair is a godsend! My hair feels silky and looks healthy and shiny. I originally purchased this product for use while traveling due to its dual voltage. Will be using it for travel to Italy, (will let you know how it works when I return!). However, it&#x27;s a winner for every day use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some of the most expensive flat irons on the market. This one works better than all of them.</li>
            <li> just got it today and already not satisfied. i have to go over one piece of hair 100 times to get it as striaght as i want it</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair, curl my hair, etc. all within a quick amount of time.  This product heats up quickly and does little damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, works great!  Just like the one they wanted $100 for at the mall, including the DVD.</li>
            <li> Loved this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love it best treatment gives life back to my hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter was not happy with it. She states it took for ever to iron her hair.</li>
            <li> I replaced my SEDU from Solia with this iron. I&#x27;m frustrated with the controls being in a hard to manipulate place along with the very slow warm up time. Occasionally the plates catch and pull out my hair. I have fine curly colored treated hair. This iron feels sturdy enough, only time will tell how it holds up. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this brand again, but it&#x27;ll do for awhile. My irons are very important to me as I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> A slick salesman tried to con me at the mall to buy this thing for $125. Paleeez!!! No way. I&#x27;m happy with it for the price I paid. And its nothing all that sand special in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this hair straightener and I love it! My sister has the same one she purchased in the mall (for much much more $$) and using hers one is actually the reason I chose this specific brand/product. I was a little skeptical that I could get the same one for so much cheaper but it works exactly the same as the $200 one. This hair straightener works wonders. I have impossibly thick, curly, and unruly hair that really dislikes doing what I want half the time so I was amazed at how well this works on me. I have used many other straighteners in the past but my hair always starts to re-curl at the ends by the next day which hardly makes it worth the 1 1/2 to 2 hours it takes for me to straighten it. (I know, right!?!) Not with this bad boy! My hair stays plank straight for a week without touch-ups! I can&#x27;t wait to see how it holds up in the Florida humidity this summer.</li>
            <li> I just need to learn how to use it please people watch the DVD.. only problem is package and posting described a black flat iron and mines came purple .. i love it though so I guess I&#x27;ll keep it</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a month ago from here and I used it twice and now it doesn&#x27;t even heat up it turns on but doesn&#x27;t work it doesn&#x27;t even get a little warm it&#x27;s cold! Biggest piece of crap I&#x27;ve ever bought and the warranty of course is good but you have to send it in and send $20 with it total BS!</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Within 3 months of sporadic use-i.e. only used a couple of days a month, it started to malfunction.  Sometimes it would heat up, other times not. Sometimes it would heat up just a little, sometimes it would heat up to it&#x27;s hottest.  It became completely unreliable in such a short amount of time.  It was never mishandled, dropped etc.&lt;br /&gt;**** WARNING TO FUTURE BUYERS: Amazon is not an \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; seller of this product, according to the Royale Customer Service department. All this means for Royale is that after 30 days when Amazon does not accept returns...Royale can use this as an excuse to do NOTHING about the defective product!!! The warranty offered by Royale becomes void if their product is not purchased by an \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; seller. Now, Royale did give me the option of paying some ridiculous price like $40 to replace my defective iron...but I had just paid $50 three months prior. I told them \\&quot;no thank-you\\&quot; as I no longer trust their product. Ugh!</li>
            <li> Yes this is the same exact straightener the kiosks at the mall sell for $200. I bought one from the mall about 5 years ago it was was the best thing that ever happend to me. It was on its last leg so I purchased this one and it is great. The only thing is the picture shows the plates being gold and the one I got has black plates. The product seems to be exactly the same though- I owned a Royale that was purchased NEW at the MALL and this one does the exact same thing of much less money.</li>
            <li> This is perfect my niece/god daughter needed a new flat iron and found this one at a great price and was delivered so fast she loves it.</li>
            <li> Does not heat very well.  This is the 2nd Royale flat iron I have had.  This one doesn&#x27;t come close to working like the prior one did.</li>
            <li> My very first flat iron was a Royale that I bought at a mall over 7 years ago.  I recently decided that I wanted to get a new one and ended up getting a Chi because everyone just loves them.  I was not at all happy with my Chi purchase and returned it within days of purchasing it and bought another Royale.  This is a great flat iron and works great on my hair and is high quality as well.</li>
            <li> Got my monies worth on this product. This was purchased for someone else.  The feedback I received is that it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good flat iron but it doesn&#x27;t shut off automatically after a certain amount of time. It&#x27;s very annoying.</li>
