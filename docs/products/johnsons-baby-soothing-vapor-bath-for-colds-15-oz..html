    <ol>
            <li>Great purchase</li>
            <li>A great buy for an even greater product!!</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant - reminds me of Eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>Great and quick transaction!!!</li>
            <li>It smells quite nice in the bottle, but once I put it in the bath, I noticed no vapors, soothing or otherwise.</li>
            <li>It does make some nice bubbles, though.</li>
            <li>The original smelled just like eucalyptus and was great in the shower every morning.</li>
            <li>Exceptional, very therapeutic.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for young and older people.</li>
            <li>The original is much better than the &#x27;new&#x27; one.</li>
            <li>so there wasn&#x27;t really much I could do besides keep her comfortable.</li>
            <li>and she finally slept 4 hours stretches(much better than up every hour).  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this here since it doesn&#x27;t seem to be sold locally.</li>
            <li>I used the older version with my other kids and found the smell was quite nice.</li>
            <li>The original formula is clear, where the new is not.</li>
            <li>Excellent when your baby has a cold.</li>
            <li>Not so much now.</li>
            <li>This really helps when my son gets congested and stuffy</li>
            <li>It seems to really help.</li>
            <li>Am buying the older bottles when I see them.</li>
            <li>The old one had eucalyptus and menthol, this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It is very misleading because the name is the same.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks different and the scent of the product is very subdued...which is a bummer because it doesn&#x27;t seem as vapor&#x27;y.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewer that the new smell is pretty gross.</li>
            <li>The new one I bought has the same name but the product inside is different.</li>
            <li>Great for when my baby is sick.</li>

            <li> I bought this product because a friend told me to.</li>
            <li> My baby had been battling a stuffy nose all week. Shes 5 months so there wasn&#x27;t really much I could do besides keep her comfortable. I found this online and was anxious to try it out. I gave her a bath at night and she finally slept 4 hours stretches(much better than up every hour).  I may just keep using it even when she isn&#x27;t sick!</li>
            <li> I used to have a bottle of this that ran out. The new one I bought has the same name but the product inside is different. It is NOT for babies with colds and stuffy noses as it was before. The old one had eucalyptus and menthol, this doesn&#x27;t.It is very misleading because the name is the same.</li>
            <li> I swear j &amp; j has changed this product. The bottle looks different and the scent of the product is very subdued...which is a bummer because it doesn&#x27;t seem as vapor&#x27;y.</li>
            <li> Exceptional, very therapeutic.  I put some peppermint oil to infuse the soothing powers.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant - reminds me of Eucalyptus.  Creates some bubbles if you add to running water, however, not like an actual bubble bath product.</li>
            <li> Excellent when your baby has a cold. | Excelente quando seu bebê está resfriado.</li>
            <li> I used the older version with my other kids and found the smell was quite nice. I bought this to use when my baby had a cold and was very disappointed. I&#x27;ll be looking for a similar product from another company.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite cold remedies!</li>
            <li> The original is much better than the &#x27;new&#x27; one. I agree with the other reviewer that the new smell is pretty gross. The original smelled just like eucalyptus and was great in the shower every morning. Not so much now. Am buying the older bottles when I see them. The original formula is clear, where the new is not.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this here since it doesn&#x27;t seem to be sold locally. This really helps when my son gets congested and stuffy</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this at Target. It smells quite nice in the bottle, but once I put it in the bath, I noticed no vapors, soothing or otherwise. It does make some nice bubbles, though. My son loves bubble baths, so I guess I&#x27;ll just juice it up with some essential oils when I need something to actually help with his congestion.</li>
            <li> Great for when my baby is sick. Great purchase</li>
            <li> I have used this for my grandchild whenever he is stuffy with a cold. It seems to really help.</li>
            <li> Great and quick transaction!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for young and older people. I used this on my children as they were growing up and bought it for my husband and I to soak in the tub with. I now use it for my grandchidren. A great buy for an even greater product!!</li>
