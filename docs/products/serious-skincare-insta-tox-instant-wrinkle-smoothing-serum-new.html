            <li>InstA-tox is Temporary fix for fine lines, and minimizing deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>InstA-tox is Temporary fix for fine lines, and minimizing deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product line and love almost everything I have tried!  </li>
            <li>and it just worked fabulously.</li>
            <li>All this does is tighten your skin..doesn&#x27;t smooth anything out.</li>
            <li>Your face will look lifted and the texture will look smooth.</li>
            <li>Have used for years and it does smooth out wrinkles under the eyes and around the mouth</li>
            <li>Start with clean, exfoliated skin.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>Start with clean, exfoliated skin.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>- Wait the full amount of designated time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- Wait the full amount of designated time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to shake the tube vigorously before opening it, and gently squeeze the tube.</li>
            <li>I have been using Insta-tox for many years and find it very satisfactory for lifting the eyelids.  </li>
            <li>It is very drying on the skin though, so be sure to moisturize that area every night or it will burn when you apply it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>if you put too much on, it&#x27;s easy to fix - just gently blot the area with a lightly damp q- tip or your finger</li>
            <li>Products was fresh (important) and seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>As an extra measure, I then used my derma brush to exfoliate any &#x27;peeling skin, since I use Retin-A in the evenings, to make sure that my skin was completely clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It really amazed me when I watched my wrinkles disappear!!  </li>
            <li>Being a man, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would look natural when applied, but you can&#x27;t even tell-</li>
            <li>I distinctly felt the sensation of &#x60;tightening&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>this product is worth a try</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my wrinkles but it is totally worth it for the under-eye area.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a tightness in my skin right away and will definetly keep this as a staple in my skin arsenal</li>
            <li>In summary, as long as you apply it properly, it works great and that is true with any makeup product so this should be nothing new to those of you who use makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a full face product, rather you dab it onto areas with fine lines or wrinkles and as it dries it does fill in the lines leaving your skin looking smooth and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t wear foundation very often I found this product to not be what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes a difference for my undereye bags.  </li>
            <li>MUST NOT USE TOO MUCH AT ANY ONE TIME</li>
            <li>I can only see using this on special occasions.</li>
            <li>was very excited that the product worked so well, but quickly realized that unless you put makeup on over the product you could see dull spots where I applied the product to my face.</li>
            <li>It simply acts like a super alum product, in my guesstimation, like a pliable astrigent which is invisible and</li>
            <li>Above my top lip, all lines were definitely diminished.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Will never, ever live without this stuff now</li>
            <li>From the first time I used Serious  Skin Care,  I was amazed at how fast it worked, how my wrinkles literally disappeared and how smooth my skin looked after putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion:  If this product works so well for my aged mature skin, younger women have an even better advantage, but follow the directions precisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: As the day wore on, some of the product&#x27;s tightening results wore off.  </li>

            <li>This is the only wrinkle concealer I have found that really does the job!</li>
            <li>If a tiny bit of liquid comes out first, I don&#x27;t use it - just dab it off with a tissue.</li>
            <li>use: dab a tiny amount directly into wrinkles / fine lines (don&#x27;t rub in), wait for product to dry.</li>
            <li>Laugh lines, also substantially diminished, and I have a small &#x60;puckered patch&#x27; of light wrinkles on my left cheek that had almost completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>AM 40 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>I am writing this review from the perspective of (mature skin), meaning over the age of 50.  </li>
            <li>The downside is that you need to develop an application technique otherwise you can put too much on and the product will turn white.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve tried that really works for me.  </li>
            <li>First, I cleansed, using my liquid cleanser &#x60;C Clean&#x27;, another product of the Serious Skin Care line.  </li>
            <li>followed the directions precisely, first I shook the tube, applied a thin layer over my &#x60;targeted areas&#x27;, (fine lines and slightly deeper wrinkles) and waited for a full three minutes, keeping my face completely &#x60;expressionless&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I patted dry, and waited a minute or two to assure, smooth, dry skin for optimal</li>
            <li>The main reason for doing this is because &#x60;mature skin&#x27; has slightly different needs, and we tend to have different expectations.  </li>
            <li>It must be applied to bare skin, per the directions.  </li>
            <li>You have to be careful to not put too much on, but with practice this is not a problem</li>
            <li>and I live in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>I will say that you need to be careful and not over apply it or put on too much product on or it will leave a white residue.</li>
            <li>Yes, if you apply to much at once it&#x27;ll leave a white residue when it dries so just be careful and apply it sparingly.  </li>
            <li>All the lines on my forehead had completely disappeared, and the same with the minor &#x60;crow&#x27;s-feet&#x27; around my eyes.  </li>

            <li> Younger women are included in this review, because if a product works for mature skin, than younger women definitely have the advantage, however, this is geared for those of us a little past our prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was buying other products here and thought I would get this at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I use a very small amount of the product and gently rub it over and around the frown line area.</li>
            <li> Must work it into the skin with the tips of the fingers and let it dry until a bit of tightness is felt and</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this a few years ago when a little extra weight gain caused a few wrinkles around my eyes and the wrinkles in my forehead looked a little deeper.</li>
            <li> It does not take care of loose or sagging areas, but that is not was this product is used for.  </li>
            <li> It does not take care of loose or sagging areas, but that is not was this product is used for.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;temporarily fills in little frown lines and wrinkles and such.</li>
            <li> If you get the area too wet though, you will remove the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready for under eye surgery for my eyebags</li>
            <li> I have serious bags under my eyes and this completely erases them.  </li>
            <li> It works, but you must apply very little or it will be white.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount of the product to get freat results.</li>
            <li> the other brand.</li>
            <li> why don&#x27;t you let us all know what that other product is.  </li>
            <li> Next, I applied my moisturizer, I was afraid that this would &#x60;dissolve&#x27; some of the results, but instead my skin acquired my normal suppleness and any &#x60;mask-like&#x27; look faded.  </li>

            <li> I must admit I was very skeptical about trying this product. I originally ordered this a few years ago when a little extra weight gain caused a few wrinkles around my eyes and the wrinkles in my forehead looked a little deeper. From the first time I used Serious  Skin Care,  I was amazed at how fast it worked, how my wrinkles literally disappeared and how smooth my skin looked after putting on my makeup. My face tightened up in every area where I used Serious Skin Care and it just worked fabulously. I will say that you need to be careful and not over apply it or put on too much product on or it will leave a white residue. Don&#x27;t worry though if you put too much on, it&#x27;s easy to fix - just gently blot the area with a lightly damp q- tip or your finger and  the residue will go away. If you get the area too wet though, you will remove the product.  In summary, as long as you apply it properly, it works great and that is true with any makeup product so this should be nothing new to those of you who use makeup. I have now been a Serious Skin Care user for several years and I LOVE it!  I think it is a great product and I wouldn&#x27;t do without it !</li>
            <li> It does what it claims to do.  It must be applied to bare skin, per the directions.  IMO great product.</li>
            <li> excellent product. mi use it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now. I stop for awhile then get reminded of the need to start again! lol&lt;br /&gt;It works! It simply acts like a super alum product, in my guesstimation, like a pliable astrigent which is invisible and&lt;br /&gt;temporarily fills in little frown lines and wrinkles and such. It also makes your pores appear to &#x27;take a hike&#x27; and it&lt;br /&gt;really does last for hours!! I have to wash it off at the end of my day.&lt;br /&gt;But the best thing is you can try it out for yourself..it&#x27;s got a money-back guarantee! But you won&#x27;t want to send it back..wait and see, girls! 👗💄👠</li>
            <li> I love this product. It only takes a small amount of the product to get freat results. One tube last for months.</li>
            <li> This product is the only one that does what it says.  I put it on and moisturizer after love it.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing it is small</li>
            <li> Nope, nope, nope and nope...do not even bother. All this does is tighten your skin..doesn&#x27;t smooth anything out. Can&#x27;t wear it with anything else because as soon as you put something on top of it, it releases the tightening effect.</li>
            <li> Never leave home without it!!  Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This product takes away my undereye bags and lasts all day. You have to be careful to not put too much on, but with practice this is not a problem</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT, DISAPPOINTING&lt;br /&gt;IT DRIES ON MY SKIN, FORMING A WHITE FILM&lt;br /&gt;I AM 40 YEARS OLD AND IT MADE ME LOOK 65.&lt;br /&gt;WAIST OF MY MONEY</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love it....I always buy from HSN.  I was buying other products here and thought I would get this at the same time.  BIG MISTAKE!  It seems to me that the tube has been replaced with something else.  I am very familiar with this product and know how to use it.  I know what the consistency is....the product was something else.  I will never buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 3 years and think it works great.  Extremely happy with the company I just purchased it from.  Very quick delivery  and well packaged- will definitely use them again. Also impressed with a note enclosed saying will help with any problems.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  It really amazed me when I watched my wrinkles disappear!!  Being a man, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would look natural when applied, but you can&#x27;t even tell- no residue left on my skin at all.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review from the perspective of (mature skin), meaning over the age of 50.  The main reason for doing this is because &#x60;mature skin&#x27; has slightly different needs, and we tend to have different expectations.  Younger women are included in this review, because if a product works for mature skin, than younger women definitely have the advantage, however, this is geared for those of us a little past our prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next detail to reveal is that I have dry skin and I live in a dry climate.  I do not know if that makes a difference, but it maybe something to consider, because it has been my experience that products work differently, under different types of conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product when I had plenty of time, no place to go, so that I could be thorough in order give this product optimal opportunity for the best results.  First, I cleansed, using my liquid cleanser &#x60;C Clean&#x27;, another product of the Serious Skin Care line.  As an extra measure, I then used my derma brush to exfoliate any &#x27;peeling skin, since I use Retin-A in the evenings, to make sure that my skin was completely clean and smooth.  I patted dry, and waited a minute or two to assure, smooth, dry skin for optimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions precisely, first I shook the tube, applied a thin layer over my &#x60;targeted areas&#x27;, (fine lines and slightly deeper wrinkles) and waited for a full three minutes, keeping my face completely &#x60;expressionless&#x27;.  I distinctly felt the sensation of &#x60;tightening&#x27;.  After 3 minutes, I checked my results, and I have to admit that I was rather shocked.  All the lines on my forehead had completely disappeared, and the same with the minor &#x60;crow&#x27;s-feet&#x27; around my eyes.  Above my top lip, all lines were definitely diminished.  Laugh lines, also substantially diminished, and I have a small &#x60;puckered patch&#x27; of light wrinkles on my left cheek that had almost completely disappeared.  However, my face felt a little stiff, almost as if wearing a mask.  Then I applied my face serum and that loosened up the mask-like feeling, but the &#x60;tightening product results&#x27; remained the same.  Next, I applied my moisturizer, I was afraid that this would &#x60;dissolve&#x27; some of the results, but instead my skin acquired my normal suppleness and any &#x60;mask-like&#x27; look faded.  Application of foundation and make-up followed, and I can assure you that the result was beautiful and realistically life-like.  It does not take care of loose or sagging areas, but that is not was this product is used for.  InstA-tox is Temporary fix for fine lines, and minimizing deeper wrinkles.  There was no mask or mannequin look, and although I did not go back to my 20&#x27;s or 30&#x27;s, this product took 5 - 10 years off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Few Helpful Tips for Optimal Results:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Start with clean, exfoliated skin.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Shake tube thoroughly before each use.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Apply the thinnest layer of product - that way there is NO product residue&lt;br /&gt;4)  Do Not rush - Wait the full amount of designated time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  If this product works so well for my aged mature skin, younger women have an even better advantage, but follow the directions precisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: As the day wore on, some of the product&#x27;s tightening results wore off.  However, for a couple of hours the results were incredible.  This is longer than some other &#x27;wrinkle reducers&#x27; that I have tried since they only lasted about 15-20 minutes, which I considered to be useless since they lose their effect before I have a chance to leave my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review, and I hope that this has been helpful for all women of all ages.if wearing a mask.

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a spot product to fill in fine lines and wrinkles then this is the product for you! It&#x27;s not a full face product, rather you dab it onto areas with fine lines or wrinkles and as it dries it does fill in the lines leaving your skin looking smooth and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited that the product worked so well, but quickly realized that unless you put makeup on over the product you could see dull spots where I applied the product to my face. Since I don&#x27;t wear foundation very often I found this product to not be what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to use: dab a tiny amount directly into wrinkles / fine lines (don&#x27;t rub in), wait for product to dry. Very easy!</li>
            <li> Love this product, have always used it and cheaper on amazon. just a little dab will do you and it hides the wrinkles some. Some is better than none</li>
            <li> Really great for pore reducing. Not a permanent solution, but for an engagement when you want to look flawless, this is the product for you. Great under makeup. Your face will look lifted and the texture will look smooth. I am not paid nor do I work for the company. Just a consumer like you.</li>
            <li> This stuff works fabulous!  The downside is that you need to develop an application technique otherwise you can put too much on and the product will turn white.  This is the only wrinkle concealer I have found that really does the job!</li>
            <li> this did not work at all.. for me.. maybe some people it will but .. its not for me.. thank you</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product</li>
            <li> I bought 2 products stating the same effect, however this one does not come close to  the other brand. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It did not meet their sales pitch. I was disappointed.with the product. would recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> Never disappoints and have used this product for 3 years now.  Can&#x27;t be without it at my age and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for frown lines! Be sure to shake the tube vigorously before opening it, and gently squeeze the tube. If a tiny bit of liquid comes out first, I don&#x27;t use it - just dab it off with a tissue. I use a very small amount of the product and gently rub it over and around the frown line area. Then I use a blow dryer on low heat, for about a minute. Voila!</li>
            <li> Have used for years and it does smooth out wrinkles under the eyes and around the mouth</li>
            <li> I really like this product line and love almost everything I have tried!  To get this at a good price is especially nice!</li>
            <li> I noticed a tightness in my skin right away and will definetly keep this as a staple in my skin arsenal</li>
            <li> I use this daily.  It does work and does what the manufacturer says it does.  Very nice on wrinkles around your eyes</li>
            <li> I have been using Insta-tox for many years and find it very satisfactory for lifting the eyelids.  Users need to know that you need to work with it on the skin for a couple of minutes.  It does not work instantaneously.  Must work it into the skin with the tips of the fingers and let it dry until a bit of tightness is felt and you see the difference.---Give it a try</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but if you use botox go with that for a lasting look</li>
            <li> The product was all liquid  and not cream like when previously ordered</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes a difference for my undereye bags.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve tried that really works for me.  Yes, if you apply to much at once it&#x27;ll leave a white residue when it dries so just be careful and apply it sparingly.  I&#x27;m not ready for under eye surgery for my eyebags so it&#x27;s the easiest and best thing out there that I&#x27;ve tried.  I can&#x27;t understand the bad reviews.  If you don&#x27;t like this product and you know of another product that works than why don&#x27;t you let us all know what that other product is.  Don&#x27;t just down this one.  Let us know if you know of one better, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I did not like the feel on my skin and felt it did next to nothing in terms of smoothing wrinkles.  Not worth the price</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT, BUT MUST NOT USE TOO MUCH AT ANY ONE TIME</li>
            <li> This product helps fill in any scars or wrinkles.  Love.  Gives me confidence in my appearance:)  Thanks for making such awesome products!</li>
            <li> Have been using for years, great stuff. Products was fresh (important) and seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> this product is worth a try</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd tube.  I have serious bags under my eyes and this completely erases them.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything for my wrinkles but it is totally worth it for the under-eye area.  It is very drying on the skin though, so be sure to moisturize that area every night or it will burn when you apply it in the morning.  Will never, ever live without this stuff now that I have found it.</li>
            <li> It works, but you must apply very little or it will be white. I can only see using this on special occasions.</li>
