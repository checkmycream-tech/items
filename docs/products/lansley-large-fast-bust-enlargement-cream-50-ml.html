            <li>To get the most out of products like these you really need to consistently massage your breasts to get the blood circulating to them.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I thought It would work, but nothing, even though I used it constantly for a month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and worth a try.</li>

            <li>Does this really work because I&#x27;m so conceited about my size A.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Similar to when your breast kind of swell or feel bigger when your one your period then</li>
            <li>I am going to try other products and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>Soft Breasts, but really doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I am a transgender woman and been naturally enhancing my breasts for a while now.</li>
            <li>I do measure them also so far a inch</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any change, still using the product but not everyday .I</li>
            <li>know it will take a long time to get full female breasts.</li>
            <li>about 3 days now, i can really say much, than, its a foreign product</li>
            <li>I have little over a hand full of breast now.which</li>

            <li> Its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used the product for 2 month and had NO results,  this is just waste of money people.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave this a one star because it didn&#x27;t work for me. It arrived quickly which was great but the jar is rather small. Its a thick little jar so there&#x27;s really not much product to use. While using it, I&#x27;d occasionally see a little bit of a difference then it&#x27;d go away. Similar to when your breast kind of swell or feel bigger when your one your period then later they go back to normal. Its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife lol I noticed a small increase with her size hahaha as right now, its a handful for me so I gave it a 5 star. i&#x27;m happy with how it feel lol so ladies if you want a bigger bust size from a B size to a DD size. don&#x27;t expect to get that large. its like us guys expecting to grow up to a Foot or a Yard stick from penis enlargement pills. It works but not as effective. so wish the best of luck to you ladies out there who buy these stuff who want a bigger breast size or to impress their partners.</li>
            <li> just tried it and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Just finished using this product. I am a transgender woman and been naturally enhancing my breasts for a while now. The one jar lasted exactly 2 months, using it once in the morning. To get the most out of products like these you really need to consistently massage your breasts to get the blood circulating to them. I have found my breasts to have lifted somewhat and are firmer. I guess there are different results for different people but for me it&#x27;s a thumbs up. Also you don&#x27;t loose what you gain from any breast enhancement so that&#x27;s just not true. So buyer beware because larger breasts are permanent. It&#x27;s not expensive and worth a try. Good luck ladies!</li>
            <li> I used the product for 2 month and had NO results,  this is just waste of money people. Dont buy it</li>
            <li> Honestly, I thought It would work, but nothing, even though I used it constantly for a month. Not buying it again!</li>
            <li> this is very good it works</li>
            <li> this product with breast enhanacement vac pump every day will slowly enlarge the breast.you have to keep doing this for months.there is no fast or quick way.i started 10 weeks ago.now I have little over a hand full of breast now.which is good because I am a male that started with none.i know it will take a long time to get full female breasts.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping that it would work but didn&#x27;t. After reading so many positive reviews thought it would work. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> i just started using this products about 3 days now, i can really say much, than, its a foreign product</li>
            <li> I love it I&#x27;m a size bigger and keeps them firm I buy it every month</li>
            <li> I have been using it for couple of days now n I can see a diference on my boobs I do measure them also so far a inch but also they look fuller im def going to buy more happy with the results so far</li>
            <li> Soft Breasts, but really doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work. it has the same effect as lotion, moisture.</li>
            <li> Just started using will advise</li>
            <li> This really works well</li>
            <li> I used a jar of this cream over a month. I did not notice any change in my breasts except that my breasts became very tender and my nipples very sore. I did not apply it to my nipples but after about 5 days of using the cream, I noticed extreme soreness. I am going to try other products and see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> Used as directed, I didn&#x27;t notice any change after using the entire contents.</li>
            <li> Does this really work because I&#x27;m so conceited about my size A. I want to have fuller breast. Does this cream work.?</li>
            <li> Yes indeed lady&#x27;s get it. Not going to fail you...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any change, still using the product but not everyday .I gonna finish the bottle, if some thing change I will gladly right other review.</li>
            <li> did not work at all! total hype</li>
            <li> Really works. I seen a difference within a few days. Only thing that Is bad about this product, if you stop using this product. Your breasts will go back to the way they were. I will no longer use this, you have to keep throwing away your money to keep the results you were looking for to begin with.</li>
