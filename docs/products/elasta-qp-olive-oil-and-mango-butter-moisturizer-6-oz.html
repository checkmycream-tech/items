            <li>It smells great and it makes my hair feel sooo soft!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and is absorbed quickly in the hair.</li>
            <li>Finally a moisturizer with great ingredients for my hair.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY MOISTURIZING, NICE FRAGANCE.</li>
            <li>As far as this product is concerned, it did a fair job.</li>
            <li>My hair is loving; it feels so soft!!</li>
            <li>The olive oil and mango butter moisturizer is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>I heard such good reviews about this product, so I wanted to give it try.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because my hair took to it very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not what I&#x27;m looking for...still on my hunt for a good moisturizer for already flat ironed hair.</li>
            <li>Its greaseless texture didn&#x27;t make me feel as if I applied an oily coating onto my skin which got all over my clothing before it was absorbed.</li>
            <li>Seeing that the product comprised of ingredients that I liked and that it had a 4+ star rating, I bought it without a second thought.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it moisturizes for days.</li>
            <li>This is a must if you&#x27;re natural and you want to have nice, soft and moisturized hair!</li>
            <li>I have fine curly natural hair and this product</li>
            <li>and this makes it soft, smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s offered in a larger size so that I&#x27;ll have more on hand for a while.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this product</li>
            <li>It only takes a little bit to provide a great amount of moisture.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to all naturals who have a hard time finding a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The relaxed hair doesn&#x27;t need as much product.</li>
            <li>I bought it and now my whole family is using it.</li>
            <li>I love this product especially to put on the ends of my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I believe I&#x27;ve tapped into a new use for this product!</li>
            <li>Well this product is decent.</li>
            <li>Combined with coconut oil, it becomes a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>as I said, combined with coconut oil, it did a decent job.</li>
            <li>although too thick to put on the shaft of my hair is great to seal in my very dry ends.  </li>
            <li>But, I will say that I am still in the learning phase with my new hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This moisturizer makes your skin very soft and silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and a little does go a long way..</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li>I focus use on the natural hair.</li>
            <li>I am currently completely transitioned.  </li>
            <li>am using this on my 1 year old daughterâ€™s hair and it is working well for her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and like the feel and smell on my natural hair</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair moist and soft.</li>
            <li>All i gotta say is wow.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Im transitioning my hair to natural.</li>
            <li>Moisturized my natural 4a hair every night.</li>
            <li>I have lots of coarse, straight and frizz-prone hair</li>
            <li>I still have a lot left, and I used it very often.</li>
            <li>She puts it on at night and makes it her hair soft in the morning</li>
            <li>I can use this product to both moisturize by natural hair as well as seal.</li>
            <li>UT leave my hair moisturized and soft</li>
            <li>It truly keeps my hair moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>I work it into my ends first, then distribute into the rest of my hair while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>I live in South Florida, Frizz central!</li>
            <li>When I take my hair down in the morning, it&#x27;s soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m AA and have natural hair, I was looking for a hair moisturizer that would not make my hair damp and cause my flat ironed hair to swell and frizz--and it did just that.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product especially if you struggle with dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li>Probably not great for fine hair.</li>
            <li>make my hair very moisturized a little is all you need</li>

            <li> My hair is always dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets texturizers and it causes her hair to become very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little off, but I get the same results!</li>
            <li> Does not weigh my hair down.</li>

            <li> Here is a little info about my hair.</li>
            <li> Because of its thick consistency, I would consider this a heavy moisturizer</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product especially to put on the ends of my natural hair.  I have fine curly natural hair and this product although too thick to put on the shaft of my hair is great to seal in my very dry ends.  It smells nice and a little does go a long way..For Naturals with thicker hair this will be a great addition to your hair regime..</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from relaxed to natural. The Olive Oil &amp; Mango Butter Moisturizer keeps my hair moisturized during extended wear of a protective style. I focus use on the natural hair. The relaxed hair doesn&#x27;t need as much product. The product has quite a thick consistency so a little goes a long way. It smells great which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> A co-worker suggested this product to me.  I am currently completely transitioned.  This product is just okay for me. I like the smell. But, I will say that I am still in the learning phase with my new hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this on my 1 year old daughterâ€™s hair and it is working well for her. It adds the needed moisture to her hair. I would purchase this again for her. But, it is not a product that I am running to the store to get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and like the feel and smell on my natural hair so of course I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it when I came across it on amazon. Its great for two strand twists!</li>
            <li> It smells great and it makes my hair feel sooo soft! I bought it and now my whole family is using it. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and I love it</li>
            <li> Well this product is decent. I would give it a 7/10. I have dry hair, so that could be the problem. But I would suggest trying it. It has a great smell!</li>
            <li> The olive oil and mango butter moisturizer is rich and creamy. It keeps my hair moist and soft. Smells great!</li>
            <li> All i gotta say is wow.Finally a moisturizer with great ingredients for my hair. My hair is thick and can sometimes be a bit dry but mann..my hair eats it up! lol! I love and adore the smell. I still have it in my hair the very next day. It is awesome. Makes hair soft and shiny. Also DOES help with split ends. I am marking this as my go-to moisturizer for my hair. Im transitioning my hair to natural. I will definitely be using this for flat twist. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Moisturized my natural 4a hair every night. Smells so good I want to eat it. Does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This product is a life and time saver and I hope they never discontinue it. I have lots of coarse, straight and frizz-prone hair and this makes it soft, smooth and manageable. It smells great, not overpowering, and the texture is like a pudding. I work it into my ends first, then distribute into the rest of my hair while it&#x27;s wet. It allows me to air-dry my hair without any frizz. I live in South Florida, Frizz central! This makes my hair look like I just put keratin in it, amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it takes the volume out of your hair, which is great if you hate pouf like me. Probably not great for fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a must if you&#x27;re natural and you want to have nice, soft and moisturized hair! This works well with Elasta QP DPR-11 conditioner and moisture shampoo!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer makes your skin very soft and silky to the touch. Its greaseless texture didn&#x27;t make me feel as if I applied an oily coating onto my skin which got all over my clothing before it was absorbed. I am very happy with this product and will definitely buy more. I hope it&#x27;s offered in a larger size so that I&#x27;ll have more on hand for a while. Elasta has a repeat buyer for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After reading other reviews I&#x27;ve come to learn that this product is generally used for hair... Well guys I must say that you can add skin care to the list. X^D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item because it displayed as a result in my search for great skin care products. Seeing that the product comprised of ingredients that I liked and that it had a 4+ star rating, I bought it without a second thought. It didn&#x27;t occur to me to read the reviews posted. At any rate, I will buy this product again as part of my skin care regime. I believe I&#x27;ve tapped into a new use for this product! :u)</li>
            <li> make my hair very moisturized a little is all you need</li>
            <li> I love this... i use this and the  curl custard with mango hair grease and my twist outs are always nice!</li>
            <li> Amazing hair moisturizer! I love it. It&#x27;s thick, and a little goes a very long way. I still have a lot left, and I used it very often. My hair is loving; it feels so soft!!</li>
            <li> Note: this product is a PROTEIN moisturizer, so keep that in mind if you want to have a moisturizing/protein balance. It only takes a little bit to provide a great amount of moisture. Awesome product, will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets texturizers and it causes her hair to become very dry and brittle.  This is a very good moisturizer.  She puts it on at night and makes it her hair soft in the morning or she uses it when putting her back in a lose pony tail.  I have seen less shedding when using this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves hair feeling okay, just thought it could be better.</li>
            <li> This is a really good light moisturizer for me. I smells great and leave no build up! Moisturizes without making hair sticky and damp.</li>
            <li> The pudding is a 5 star. I give this one a 4 star. It smells good, the pudding smells even more fragrant.  The price is right and it moisturizes for days. The pudding is even better. Everywhere I go people say my daughters hair smells so good using the pudding. It makes her curly hair stay moist and keeps the curls.</li>
            <li> I use this product when I twist my hair and as a deep leave-in conditioner in the winter. It works great and smells wonderful without weighing my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> Good feeling and smelling for my hair.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY MOISTURIZING, NICE FRAGANCE. I JUST HOPED IN DIDNT HAD CONS. BUT WHEN I USE IT TO GO TO THE BEACH OR TO GO FOR A WALK IN THE MOUTAINS I WORKS VERY GOOD KEEPING MY HAIR MOISTURIZED.</li>
            <li> Here is a little info about my hair. My hair is always dry. NOTHING keeps it moisturized. EVERY shampoo strips my hair. It&#x27;s as if my hair hates me. I have relaxed hair and I try my best to keep from looking like a frizzy haired 7th grader but it is not working out. As far as this product is concerned, it did a fair job. Combined with coconut oil, it becomes a decent moisturizer. I will purchase this again(not from this vendor, though. From the store.)because as I said, combined with coconut oil, it did a decent job.</li>
            <li> I use several creams on my hair but none of them moisturize anything like this one!  I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This product gave me the moisture I needed. I can use this product to both moisturize by natural hair as well as seal.</li>
            <li> Still a great product!  Not as good as the original.  It seems a little off, but I get the same results!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this product and I love it UT leave my hair moisturized and soft and it smells great</li>
            <li> I heard such good reviews about this product, so I wanted to give it try.  I&#x27;m AA and have natural hair, I was looking for a hair moisturizer that would not make my hair damp and cause my flat ironed hair to swell and frizz--and it did just that.  It&#x27;s still not what I&#x27;m looking for...still on my hunt for a good moisturizer for already flat ironed hair.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this product because my hair took to it very well. It moisturized my hair and it kept my twists in place. I would recommend this product to all naturals who have a hard time finding a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  It truly keeps my hair moisturized and soft.  It has a thick consistency so a little bit goes a long way.  Because of its thick consistency, I would consider this a heavy moisturizer so you wont need a lot to keep your hair moist and healthy.  It smells amazing and is absorbed quickly in the hair. This is a superb product and its a staple in my hair regime.  I use it nightly to moisturize my hair before tying it up for bed. When I take my hair down in the morning, it&#x27;s soft and very manageable.  I highly recommend this product especially if you struggle with dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say that Elasta QP Olive Oil Mango Butter Moisturizer worked great in my hair. It also helps with the dryness.</li>
