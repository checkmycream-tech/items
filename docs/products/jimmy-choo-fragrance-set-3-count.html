            <li> I brought this as a Christmas gift for my mom and I almost never gave it to her as it smells sooooo good. I have to get one for myself. It also came sooner than I expected based on estimated shipping.</li>
            <li> Smells very sophisticated. It is on the line similar to Flower bomb Parfum. I am glad I purchased it!!!!!</li>
            <li> 5 stars ladies! Loved everything and fast shipping! I will definitely be returning when I&#x27;m running low. Every thing was of good quality.</li>

            <li> his perfume is sweet and awesome. My wife loves this. She&#x27;ll be so happy.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was fast. Was very surprised.</li>
            <li> By far this is one of my favorite fragrances,people ask me quite often what perfume are you wearing. From the time I put it on in the morning til the end of the day you can still smell the fragrance. I bought 2 of these gift sets thinking I&#x27;d give one as a gift I ended up keeping them both. Happy Birthday to me.</li>
            <li> This was a great set to buy -- smells wonderful</li>

            <li> This is the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn. The smell is amazing &amp; it stays all day. If you spray your hair it wont wear off until you wash it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great gift and my wife love it.  I also love the wonderful smell.  It has a light fragrance and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> What can I possibly say about this: Awesome packaging, scent, and products.  This is not an over-powering scent, but people around me that did smell it, liked it and asked what it was. I would buy this again for myself or as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have many brands of cologne and anyone who knows me knows i love to smell good. i never wear the same scent each day. This scent has changed me. Not only am i wearing it daily but it has become one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Great gift. well packed, arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Hint of spice, musk and sandalwood,but yet not over powering. I once thought of it as a fall and winter scent,not so much anymore. It also has a slightly sweet and refreshing smell to. The perfume last all day. Love it!</li>
