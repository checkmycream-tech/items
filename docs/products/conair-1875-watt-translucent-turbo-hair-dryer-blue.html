            <li>I love this hairdryer !!  </li>
            <li>Considering how much I loved the dryer and how great the price was</li>
            <li>A GOOD FIVE INCHES SHORTER CORD LENGTH.  </li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>It was good, while it lasted.</li>
            <li>But had a good run.</li>

            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>We are very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I got it because I decided to melt crayons, and for this I have not had a better dryer ever!</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that it came with a attachable 2 in 1 pick which many companies do not do.</li>
            <li>So far I am quite impressed with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love It!</li>
            <li>This was a replacement and it is great much more powerful .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light weight.</li>
            <li>Was ok while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and product great.</li>
            <li>Good price, so far so good.</li>
            <li>My dog farts more forcefully.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light weight and quite which already makes it awesome enough.  </li>
            <li>Buttons slide and  not as easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I soon learned why: the three heat settings are cool, cool, and warm.</li>
            <li>... attachments snap on and off easily and securely... and</li>
            <li>and it works fine except for one thing....</li>
            <li>Light but strong air flow.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a great hair dryer overall.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, but not flimsy or cheap feeling...</li>
            <li>And, of course, it is cheap.</li>
            <li>ergonomic handle, comfortable</li>
            <li>Works great, efficiently dries my full head of long hair without overheating.</li>
            <li>I thought this blow dryer was going to be not so good because of the low price.</li>
            <li>it is really cool looking...</li>
            <li>I has good air speed and is relatively quiet.</li>
            <li>If you have thick, frizzy hair this may not be the best one for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- cool shot button to help \\&quot;freeze\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>This underpowered &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; hair dryer is barely adequate.  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer because it was cute, inexpensive and had a few good attachments.  </li>
            <li>The dryer is easy to use, very efficient and stores well.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is really cool, and the price is very reasonable as well.  </li>
            <li>it may be that it&#x27;s not as powerful as it used to be.</li>
            <li>Great dryer, small but gets the job done quickly</li>
            <li>I received this hair dryer today, and I tried it right away.  </li>
            <li>It makes the whole process fairly quick.</li>
            <li>Attachments are too tight and will take a good time to detach them.</li>
            <li>It is actually perfect and does everything a expensive blow dryer does.</li>
            <li>Hot air is too hot.</li>
            <li>powerful but gentle</li>
            <li>I returned the first hairdryer for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I used it the first time</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight,short and thin hair and the ionic conditioning dryers zap any body that I may be able to build through shampoos or setting solutions and cancels it out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an older model of that exact hairdryer for seven years and never had that problem.  </li>
            <li>real junky thing,</li>
            <li>Come on Con Air, how much are you really saving chintzing on the cords?  </li>
            <li>, my hair is drying faster and feels silkier than with my ion dryer marketed for those very things</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like using the attachments.</li>
            <li>There is another Conair dryer that looks very similiar to this one that does have  ionic conditioning</li>
            <li>I really like the split control on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for years (of course, it&#x27;s an older model)</li>
            <li>I would like another one just like the older one</li>
            <li>The heat can get really hot, and the air speed can get really strong too, and I like it since my hair needs a lot of heat and air strength to get dried and straightened.  </li>
            <li>To add to that it does a fantastic job drying my hair without getting too hot (on the high heat &amp; air settings, and it has cut my drying time almost in half.  </li>
            <li>Simple to use, useful attachments  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- lightweight but sturdy plastic housing, not too hot to the touch on low, decent insulation on high&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then, I tried to use it the second time and it would not get hot.</li>
            <li>Pretty blue color</li>
            <li>Lots of power for a little dryer a lot more than the expensive one I own .3 speeds and 3 temps.</li>
            <li>I am surprised how quiet this blow dryer is &amp; works very well.  </li>
            <li>and so few are available</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it needs too much pressure to put and take out the straightening pic and the concentrator.  </li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s about 7 or 8 years old.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much, I have to dry my and my daughter hair every day</li>
            <li>This hairdryer gets hot enough and is powerful enough to dry and style my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a sharp looking powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The low setting does not work at all and the high setting smells like it&#x27;s burning.  </li>
            <li>the design of the head part has changed, which I&#x27;m not sure if it was for the better, since it takes me much longer to dry my hair than before with the same model hair drier.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at first because it was smaller and lighter than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>Either they weren&#x27;t hot enough on Low (and too hot on high) or most commonly the flow of the air was too weak.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer came in a clear blue color and I thought it was suppose to be purple.</li>
            <li>Does not pack the punch of older models with a gentler flow of air, making it harder to dry hair straight.  </li>
            <li>My older conair finally went kaput when i tried to dry off the dog after his bath.</li>
            <li>Since I have very little hair, I never used the hot setting on my previous dryer; so I don&#x27;t miss the hot setting on this one.  </li>
            <li>Either way, for an inexpensive little hair dryer, it&#x27;s definitely lasted long enough to be worth it.</li>

            <li> I have an old house and outlets down low.  </li>
            <li> When this dryer arrived, it was clear from the packaging that it had been returned by a previous customer.</li>
            <li> I also like how you can dry your hair and straighten it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I bought and returned a couple of other more expensive dryers that had a lot of power to dry but</li>
            <li> Now I have to crouch to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been unable to clean it and it is gummy and</li>
            <li> and I am hoping it lasts as long as my previous one, but the air flow is not nearly as forceful as my other.</li>
            <li> I purchased this same dryer at least 15 years ago and it finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it only a few months.  </li>
            <li> I selected to purchase this dryer because it is one of the few left that does not have ionic conditioning.</li>
            <li> so be careful and don&#x27;t mix up the two.</li>
            <li> and I will be using this to blow dry the dog a lt faster than the previous ones I had.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the the hanging hook is too small.  </li>
            <li> The buttons move up and down with ease.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s break it down</li>
            <li> Less than satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> Its got a weak air flow and makes sounds like its starting to die</li>
            <li> Bought this blow dryer for the kids because they are a little ruff on dryers.</li>
            <li> Too heavy.</li>
            <li> Now, it is dead.</li>
            <li> Downside is occasionally a strand of my hair gets caught in the back of the dryer which can be painful.</li>
            <li> The sliding control buttons are slippery and hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> anymore I picked this one, not a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to turn the dryer on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all is THE CORD IS SHORTER!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like it very much, I have to dry my and my daughter hair every day and it just work perfect.!</li>
            <li> This underpowered &amp;#34;toy&amp;#34; hair dryer is barely adequate.  Its got a weak air flow and makes sounds like its starting to die and I&#x27;ve had it only a few months.  I would have returned it but between the shipping costs back and forth, I just kept it.  The filter in the back does not come off for cleaning and the fan is plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a non ionic dryer and so few are available anymore I picked this one, not a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A real junky thing, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Works  Cons: Does not pack the punch of older models with a gentler flow of air, making it harder to dry hair straight.  Buttons slide and  not as easy to maneuver.  Worst of all is THE CORD IS SHORTER!  A GOOD FIVE INCHES SHORTER CORD LENGTH.  Come on Con Air, how much are you really saving chintzing on the cords?  I have an old house and outlets down low.  Now I have to crouch to dry my hair.  Good thing I&#x27;m not tall.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer on April 29, 2011, it is now June 13, 2011, and the dryer is already malfunctioning.  The low setting does not work at all and the high setting smells like it&#x27;s burning.  I will not buy another Conair dryer!</li>
            <li> I thought this blow dryer was going to be not so good because of the low price. It is actually perfect and does everything a expensive blow dryer does. I loved the fact that it came with a attachable 2 in 1 pick which many companies do not do. Love Love Love It!</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer today, and I tried it right away.  I was surprised at first because it was smaller and lighter than I had expected.

The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it needs too much pressure to put and take out the straightening pic and the concentrator.  Every time I try to pull it out, I&#x27;m scared that I might break it, but I think I&#x27;ll get used to that.  Anyway, this is a great hair dryer overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for years (of course, it&#x27;s an older model) and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I believe it&#x27;s about 7 or 8 years old.  Either way, for an inexpensive little hair dryer, it&#x27;s definitely lasted long enough to be worth it.</li>
            <li> Too heavy. Cheap plastic. Hot air is too hot. It does not smoothen hair while drying, rather pulls out the moisture. Attachments are too tight and will take a good time to detach them.</li>
            <li> It was good, while it lasted. Now, it is dead. But had a good run. Now, we have another.</li>
            <li> This is a sharp looking powerful hair dryer. Simple to use, useful attachments  Conair Translucent is an excellent value</li>
            <li> So far I am quite impressed with this hair dryer.  It is extremely light weight and quite which already makes it awesome enough.  To add to that it does a fantastic job drying my hair without getting too hot (on the high heat &amp; air settings, and it has cut my drying time almost in half.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Was ok while it lasted. Lasted about 1 1/2 years. Started sparking and making noises like it was about to burn out.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, but not flimsy or cheap feeling... powerful but gentle, my hair is drying faster and feels silkier than with my ion dryer marketed for those very things... attachments snap on and off easily and securely... and it is really cool looking... I really am so happy with this. Only bummer is that I ordered this dryer with the pic attachment but got the diffuser. I tried to exchange it for what I wanted but it was turning into a pain. Considering how much I loved the dryer and how great the price was I let it go.</li>
            <li> When this dryer arrived, it was clear from the packaging that it had been returned by a previous customer. I soon learned why: the three heat settings are cool, cool, and warm. Since I have very little hair, I never used the hot setting on my previous dryer; so I don&#x27;t miss the hot setting on this one.  I has good air speed and is relatively quiet. And, of course, it is cheap.</li>
            <li> good dryer for the money. don&#x27;t like the double switch.  does what a dryer should do.</li>
            <li> comb does not stay on  keeps popping off</li>
            <li> Less than satisfactory.  The switches  would not work with ease.  I returned the first hairdryer for a replacement.  The second hairdryer arrived and the same issue occurred.  According to customer service at Amazon the dryer was taken off your listing.  I&#x27;ve had an older model of that exact hairdryer for seven years and never had that problem.  I would like another one just like the older one but it seems that the the manufacturers have changed the style.  It&#x27;s too difficult to use.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the the hanging hook is too small.  Great dryer, small but gets the job done quickly</li>
            <li> This was a replacement and it is great much more powerful . Shipping was fast and product great.We are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> the design of the head part has changed, which I&#x27;m not sure if it was for the better, since it takes me much longer to dry my hair than before with the same model hair drier. it may be that it&#x27;s not as powerful as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Bought this blow dryer for the kids because they are a little ruff on dryers. Good price, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because it was cute, inexpensive and had a few good attachments.  I used it the first time and it is very difficult to turn the dryer on.  The sliding control buttons are slippery and hard to maneuver. Then, I tried to use it the second time and it would not get hot. It&#x27;s on it&#x27;s way back to the store.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. Amazaon fulfilled my orders they have the tracking alway have a confirmation.  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works wonderfully. I really like using the attachments. One of the attachments combs through your hair as it drys it. It makes the whole process fairly quick. The buttons move up and down with ease. The hair dryer came in a clear blue color and I thought it was suppose to be purple. Even with the difference in color this is a great product.</li>
            <li> The comb keep coming off</li>
            <li> I purchased this same dryer at least 15 years ago and it finally gave out.  checked Amazon and found the same blower, except it is not the same even tho it is the same brand, model and wattage.  It works great and I am hoping it lasts as long as my previous one, but the air flow is not nearly as forceful as my other.</li>
            <li> I selected to purchase this dryer because it is one of the few left that does not have ionic conditioning. I have very fine, straight,short and thin hair and the ionic conditioning dryers zap any body that I may be able to build through shampoos or setting solutions and cancels it out.  Actually I purchased a couple of extra ones just in case Conair decides to discontinue this model #261.  There is another Conair dryer that looks very similiar to this one that does have  ionic conditioning so be careful and don&#x27;t mix up the two. This dryer works for me.  If you have thick, frizzy hair this may not be the best one for you.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for over a year and it works fine except for one thing....the silicone-like finish is melting and sticky.  I have been unable to clean it and it is gummy and hair is sticking to it.&lt;br /&gt;I need to toss it and buy something else.</li>
            <li> Lots of power for a little dryer a lot more than the expensive one I own .3 speeds and 3 temps. Pretty blue color</li>
            <li> My older conair finally went kaput when i tried to dry off the dog after his bath. In all fairness, that thing lasted years even after I buzzed my head and passed it on to the Mrs. I have had a couple (Vidal, smaller travel conair and other)since but they didn&#x27;t work the same. Either they weren&#x27;t hot enough on Low (and too hot on high) or most commonly the flow of the air was too weak. My dog farts more forcefully. This one is the one...let&#x27;s break it down&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- lightweight but sturdy plastic housing, not too hot to the touch on low, decent insulation on high&lt;br /&gt;- cool shot button to help \\&quot;freeze\\&quot;  the curl or whatever you&#x27;re trying to do&lt;br /&gt;- ergonomic handle, comfortable&lt;br /&gt;- protection plug (outlet breaker)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- not a foldable handle for compact travel&lt;br /&gt;- no cord reel/retraction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Mrs. likes it and I will be using this to blow dry the dog a lt faster than the previous ones I had.</li>
            <li> So I have only used this for my hair once and my girlfriend used it another time. For those two times this was a great hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This however is not the reason i got this. I got it because I decided to melt crayons, and for this I have not had a better dryer ever!</li>
            <li> The dryer is easy to use, very efficient and stores well. Good buy. I would definitely recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very quiet blow dryer.  I am surprised how quiet this blow dryer is &amp; works very well.  It&#x27;s also very light weight.</li>
            <li> Works great, efficiently dries my full head of long hair without overheating. Downside is occasionally a strand of my hair gets caught in the back of the dryer which can be painful.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer gets hot enough and is powerful enough to dry and style my hair. I bought and returned a couple of other more expensive dryers that had a lot of power to dry but not enough heat to style.</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer! Light but strong air flow.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer !!  It is lightweight and has the three speed settings as well as three temperatures.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Also, low priced.</li>
            <li> I really like the split control on it.</li>
