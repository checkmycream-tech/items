            <li>The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have a quality medicated face and body wash.</li>

            <li>These bars really work to keep my back and face clean from acne.</li>
            <li>the proactiv bar work better than any other bar of soap out there, as it does for that.</li>
            <li>beautiful  young looking skin Proactiv is the way to go, I have been using this product since it was first introduced to the public, grant it is a little pricy, but by the same token it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>

            <li>however does make skin smooth but dry&#x27;s skin if lotions or moisturizer is not applied.</li>
            <li>My face looked so much better and less oily.</li>
            <li>The main difference between the 2, the bar does not have the grit for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>highly reccomend</li>
            <li>It works a little better and the its not pricey.</li>
            <li>I started using the bar soap over the liquid proactiv body wash when I take a shower because I think it works a little better than the proactiv body wash.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this is so gentle on my skin, even with the beads in the bar.</li>
            <li>Used this whole bar consistently and was the only product I used where I break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin immedately after a few days felt better and some of my acne started to go away.  </li>
            <li>Too expensive to buy on a regular basis, but it kind of works and smells clean.</li>
            <li>I have little to no blemishes on my back, and im sure</li>
            <li>and I would hope that people understand that this product or any other products for acne that there is not any quick fixes, it takes time.  </li>
            <li>She has used it for about two weeks and her face and shoulders are about 80% clear.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of days my skin started  to clear.</li>
            <li>He uses this every day and his skin has been clear ever since he started using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying natural products and so far it&#x27;s helping the pimples go away..</li>
            <li>I bought the bar because it is much cheaper and after using it, I realize that 1 bar will last a lot longer than the bottle.</li>
            <li>Not at all a sure fire way of curing acne, at least not for me.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for back acne</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped my 14 year old grandson.</li>
            <li>The reason why i got this is because i thought it would be fast acting, and it is</li>
            <li>The soap bar also brought out some of my natural features on my face and looked healthier.</li>
            <li>Soft face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference from regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I purchased this from the seller a couple weeks ago, and may i say SUPER fast shipping, it got to my home so quick and with no damage (except a small dent in the packaging, but no harm to the bar)&lt;br /&gt;I would reccoment this to anyone who has trouble with body acne.</li>
            <li>Large enough to last.</li>
            <li>With any product for acne, it gets worse at first but clears up rather quickly in time.  </li>
            <li>The soap only last a month so $15 a month for a soap seems high.</li>
            <li>So far this bar of soap has worked wonders on my back!!</li>
            <li>I have used this for problem skin on my back and it has cleared it completely.</li>
            <li>; People if you are feeling embarrassed and self-conscious  about your skin there is no excuse not to have</li>

            <li> Large enough to last.</li>
            <li> With any product for acne, it gets worse at first but clears up rather quickly in time.  </li>
            <li> The soap only last a month so $15 a month for a soap seems high.</li>
            <li> So far this bar of soap has worked wonders on my back!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for problem skin on my back and it has cleared it completely.</li>
            <li> ; People if you are feeling embarrassed and self-conscious  about your skin there is no excuse not to have</li>
            <li> Its the only thing that has worked for me in such a long time!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it should last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> THIS MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT AND LESS</li>
            <li> after about a week and a half i saw major improvements!</li>
            <li> It actually works, keeps the zits down, and makes them less conscious about pimple issues.</li>
            <li> I believe cause all in all all it did was dry them out</li>
            <li> If anything, it made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> The soap bar is larger than average.</li>
            <li> will say this that this doesnt dry out like other bars do,</li>
            <li> I only had a few pimples when I started using the soap, but after using this product..</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have used it over a longer period of time because I saw no real difference in my body acne.  </li>
            <li> Some areas of my skin did get worse but cleared up fast.  </li>
            <li> This either works wonders or not,  really depends on your body chemistry</li>
            <li> I noticed that it dried out my skin a little but a little skin moisturizer fixed that.</li>
            <li> First they sent me the wrong soap.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does the job.</li>
            <li> See other rating --</li>
            <li> After using it, it seems that is did a little something for my acne marks on my chest but not much.</li>
            <li> I still use the other proactiv cleaning products everyday.</li>
            <li> so she gave me half a bar of her&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has little beads in the bar.</li>
            <li> comes back not happy about theat.showed up on time.</li>
            <li> When it came in i waited a few days to use it and the day after i used the bar on my face, and it works</li>
            <li> It lathers well and seems to work if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be some miracle product, and it dried the hell out of my skin.</li>
            <li> I got another bar for half this price!  </li>
            <li> I usually buy a few i advance too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking it would have the same benefits as the cleanser in the bottle and cheaper, but I was completely wrong...</li>
            <li> but anyway I used it and my face got worst before it got better.</li>

            <li> this product made my skin 20xs worse!</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> Too bad the price isn&#x27;t lower.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After using it, it seems that is did a little something for my acne marks on my chest but not much. however does make skin smooth but dry&#x27;s skin if lotions or moisturizer is not applied.</li>
            <li> the proactiv bar work better than any other bar of soap out there, as it does for that. I still use the other proactiv cleaning products everyday. will say this that this doesnt dry out like other bars do, so thats a plus. Prefered use I think is also linked with the othe practiv facial cleaning as well. In short the 4 out of 5 is from the price only. How about a bundle PROACTIV?</li>
            <li> My son has used it for two weeks and hasn&#x27;t seen any improvement. It may work well on others but it hasn&#x27;t helped the breakout on his back at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking it would have the same benefits as the cleanser in the bottle and cheaper, but I was completely wrong...It made my skin 10xs oilier and it broke me out all over my face..I only had a few pimples when I started using the soap, but after using this product..I had huge ones on my nose, chin, and forehead..I will never use the soap again and I&#x27;ve even stopped using proactiv..I&#x27;m trying natural products and so far it&#x27;s helping the pimples go away..</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this buy. I rated it 5 stars because it was truly an amazing buy and product. I would of gave it 10 stars if it allowed me :)! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have a quality medicated face and body wash. It&#x27;s 100% exactly like the Proactiv Cleansing Bar you see on commercials. It&#x27;s not a fraud, but one thing it is would be a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have really bad acne on my back so I decided to get the proactiv bar, it seemed to work okay the first couple weeks just drying out the pimples and all. But after a month of useing it I don&#x27;t see any real clarity in my acne. But maybe it&#x27;s just me, I n√©ed more stronger acne type medication I believe cause all in all all it did was dry them out but they didn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and no issues. Everything was great! Nothing bad to say. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  The fresh and clean feeling and smell lasts a lot longer than regular soap.  Love it.</li>
            <li> works great my only pro. with any of these is when i stop useing them my acme comes back not happy about theat.showed up on time.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. It has a nice lather and scent. I would recommend this to anyone who has a problem with body acne. I would have given it 5 stars but it really only last a month and $17.00 is a lot for a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon because you can&#x27;t purchase it without getting the whole system.  She has used it for about two weeks and her face and shoulders are about 80% clear.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> well this product didNt work for my skin type. I got even more zits . like tiny ones, if it had a mixture  benzoly peroxide with salicylic Acid. i think it might of work even more.</li>
            <li> THIS MAKES MY SKIN SO SOFT AND LESS BUMPS LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT AND GREAT PRICE AS WELL</li>
            <li> I have been using the Proactive cleanser in the bottle for 3-4 years but I use it up quickly. I bought the bar because it is much cheaper and after using it, I realize that 1 bar will last a lot longer than the bottle. The main difference between the 2, the bar does not have the grit for exfoliating. However, I bought 2 facial exfoliating pads from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for $3.</li>
            <li> Makes my face oil free and clear! Highly recommended! It lasts a long time as well, good sized soap bar!</li>
            <li> This soap is creamy and smells really nice.  Maybe I should have used it over a longer period of time because I saw no real difference in my body acne.  Maybe I will give it another try.  Too bad the price isn&#x27;t lower.</li>
            <li> Works great as it says. Our daughter loves using it. Will be buying more when these run out. Proactiv is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I love this product it gives me a really clean feel, and I feel like it does help control my acne. I usually buy a few i advance too.</li>
            <li> So far this bar of soap has worked wonders on my back!! I use it twice a week and has not cause any dryness or discomfort. Love it!! Hope it continues working.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and it appears to be working well. She is happy and looks great, so I am happy!</li>
            <li> Used this whole bar consistently and was the only product I used where I break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No change whatsoever. If anything, it made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> My grandson uses it, and it works great!</li>
            <li> Great sizes and products always a great product and it works on my sons acne.  Would recommend this provider as well.  Fast service</li>
            <li> Great body bar soap for acne.Use it daily to keep that nasty acne away.A little drying to the skin but with a good moisturizer should balance everything out.</li>
            <li> Again I must say that Proactiv has come through again with another amazing product. &amp;#34; People if you are feeling embarrassed and self-conscious  about your skin there is no excuse not to have beautiful  young looking skin Proactiv is the way to go, I have been using this product since it was first introduced to the public, grant it is a little pricy, but by the same token it&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> Good product , does the job.</li>
            <li> Not at all a sure fire way of curing acne, at least not for me. Too expensive to buy on a regular basis, but it kind of works and smells clean.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for back acne</li>
            <li> I loveee proactiv and this soap is amazing! totally worth the money, first off it makes your skin feel so nice! you see instant results first time using, I am looking forward to buying a lottttt more! lol</li>
            <li> Works great on my face better then the 120 kit</li>
            <li> Out of all of the Proactiv products, my daughter found the bar soap to be the most effective. Got a good price on Amazon and we&#x27;re very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped my 14 year old grandson. I recommend</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Product works like the liquid, only cheaper. Like it very much. Much creamy and you could feel the cystals. I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was right on time.</li>
            <li> First they sent me the wrong soap. I didnt order the Proactiv plus but anyway I used it and my face got worst before it got better. After a couple of days my skin started  to clear. The soap leaves your face very dry, so applying a moisturizer or some kind of lotion afterwards would be helpful. Other than that, it does the job.</li>
            <li> When it came in i waited a few days to use it and the day after i used the bar on my face, and it works i saw the diffrence right away. I thought it would take like a week but it didnt. The reason why i got this is because i thought it would be fast acting, and it is so i recommend this to anyone. My face looked so much better and less oily. The soap bar also brought out some of my natural features on my face and looked healthier.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help, I&#x27;ve had better luck with Neutrogena products. After three weeks of using it, I saw no improvement.</li>
            <li> These bars really work to keep my back and face clean from acne. I bought the bars online instead of ordering it from Proactiv. I believe you cannot order products from ProActiv unless signing up for an automatic shipments from them. I only want to order bars when I need them and this allowed me to do that.</li>
            <li> I have enjoed using this soap. It is large and has lasted me a while, it does make my face feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> i got the soap for my son. he likes the soap&lt;br /&gt;i have brought 4 or 6 bars of soap already</li>
            <li> Has the same exfoliating beads as the facial cleanser and has a nice clean smell. The soap bar is larger than average. It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It may not be the same for all...this product made my skin 20xs worse! I had some pimples here and there, in hope this product would get rid of them only made me worse!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from the seller a couple weeks ago, and may i say SUPER fast shipping, it got to my home so quick and with no damage (except a small dent in the packaging, but no harm to the bar)&lt;br /&gt;I would reccoment this to anyone who has trouble with body acne. I have always had body acne on my shoulders since middle school. So i decideded to try something new, and this was the fix! after about a week and a half i saw major improvements! I have little to no blemishes on my back, and im sure in the next week the will all be gone! I have sensitive skin, and this is so gentle on my skin, even with the beads in the bar. I noticed that it dried out my skin a little but a little skin moisturizer fixed that. Over all I LOVE this and plan on buying more when i run out. Its the only thing that has worked for me in such a long time! i even use it on my face sometimes!&lt;br /&gt;So buy this you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> It was packed okay, recieved in mail in record time.  I started using this product prior to purchasing it here.  One of my friends suggested that I try it so she gave me half a bar of her&#x27;s.  My skin immedately after a few days felt better and some of my acne started to go away.  I was so pleased with this product that I knew that I had to purchase it right away.  Some areas of my skin did get worse but cleared up fast.  With any product for acne, it gets worse at first but clears up rather quickly in time.  Very happy with this product and I would hope that people understand that this product or any other products for acne that there is not any quick fixes, it takes time.  I use the soap three times pre day and that seems to work the best for me.</li>
            <li> It works if you seriously use it EVERYDAY. You cannot skip a day or two. I like that it has little beads in the bar. Like an exfoliate.</li>
            <li> recommended by our doctor</li>
            <li> It works great. That&#x27;s why I buy it</li>
            <li> The service was great . I love the soap .Its the only thing that will help my face . I have roshea  and have been to many Dr.&#x60;s for it and nothing worked until I found this soap.</li>
            <li> the delievery was prompt and on time. and the Bar soap does the trick. I use it for my heat rash and blemishes on my back and in about 3 days I started to see the difference. Awesome! highly reccomend</li>
            <li> love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Dove, and Safeguard but now, I won&#x27;t go back.  I prefer the bar to the liquid 100%.</li>
            <li> To pricy for one bar of soap that your zits get used to. Buy Walgreens medicated acne soap.  It works a little better and the its not pricey.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactive for many years but couldn&#x27;t get my teenage son to use it. The bar was the solution. He doesn&#x27;t feel as if he&#x27;s using something &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; and now his acne is disappearing...like I knew it would!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves using it and it works which is great.  Will buy it again as it works well and that is what is needed</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Proactiv cleansing bar. It is so easy to travel with. No worries about spilling or being over 3 oz and I&#x27;m ocnvinced it lasts much longer than the cream. I&#x27;m sold and will use the bar for life. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used this for problem skin on my back and it has cleared it completely. I will continue to use this soap and I can now look forward to dressing for the summer!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything better for my teenager.  He uses this every day and his skin has been clear ever since he started using it.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for both of my pre teen and teen kids.  It actually works, keeps the zits down, and makes them less conscious about pimple issues.</li>
            <li> Great product.. Soft face. I usually don&#x27;t use products with any &amp;#34;semi-harsh&amp;#34; chemicals in them... But sometimes our womanly bodies throw us off course... That&#x27;s when I can count on Proactive to help me out and make me more confident than ever</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst purchase i have made. This item rusted the soap within 5 minutes. Imagine putting rust on your body, no thanks do not waste your money</li>
            <li> The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it should last me a long time.  I like it, I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It works really awesome leaves me skin feeling clean and smooth and I only use this soap and the refining mask</li>
            <li> It lathers well and seems to work if you use it everyday. The soap only last a month so $15 a month for a soap seems high.</li>
            <li> It worked but if i wouldve used it twice a day like it said maybe i wouldve loved it. I used this soap for acne ony arms . It did work . It was worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about this bar. It smells good no pasty feeling cleans very well. I have the face wash &amp; others but wanted a bar. Very smooth feeling, love using this will buy another. the 5.25 OZ is an awesome size no need to worry about the size... Large enough to last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for appox. 3 weeks and I&#x27;m noticing subtle changes. The bar is almost gone, I probably have a month left. I apply the cleansing bar once a day, although the directions say twice. I only use it when I&#x27;m bathing (hence, why I only use it once a day). I will probably start using it more frequently, because the results aren&#x27;t happening as fast as I would like them to. The liquid version worked a lot better than the bar. I may go back to the liquid. Overall, it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ll give an update once I have finished the product.</li>
            <li> Great product. It cleans my skin well without drying it out.  I use it daily with great success.  Will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be some miracle product, and it dried the hell out of my skin. Would not recommend it and I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got another bar for half this price!  See other rating -- the soap is good and my son likes it.</li>
            <li> Proactive products were requested for a  gift and the person who uses it said  it works really well in clearing his skin</li>
            <li> Well at first it was working but then i notice the smaller the bar got the more acne i got</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference from regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;If anything, I got a bit more zits on my body...  This either works wonders or not,  really depends on your body chemistry</li>
            <li> my daughter swears it helped</li>
            <li> I started using the bar soap over the liquid proactiv body wash when I take a shower because I think it works a little better than the proactiv body wash.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap bar instead of the Deep Cleansing Wash.  This is the best product ever.  I use it just for my face and neck areas.  Proactive is a great product.</li>
            <li> I am very much disappointed with this purchase. It hasn&#x27;t done nothing with my \\&quot;bacne\\&quot; if not making it worse. It has even gave me some acne on my face. I had tried proactive before and it&#x27;s another flop from them. Done buying their products</li>
