            <li> When you apply this cream, it blends easily into the skin leaving no sticky residue.  I find over time, there has been a slight decline of noticeable tiny facial lines.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, sometimes so dry that I put straight Jojoba oil on my face.  Basically what I’m saying is I need a heavy moisturizer.  However, this cream was even too heavy for me.  It clogged my pores and broke my skin out pretty back.&lt;br /&gt;Another one bites the dust….a full bottle of night cream just wasted away.  There should be some kind of an exchange where woman can go and a swap out products that didn&#x27;t work for them.</li>
            <li> Love this...used it for 25 years!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! After just the first use I could tell my face didn&#x27;t feel so dry. I&#x27;ve had several compliments on my completion and they didn&#x27;t even know I was makeup free. I highly recommend this to everyone and will continue to use this product! Thanks for making it so inexpensive for my tight budget!</li>
            <li> I need to purchase one AHEAD so I don&#x27;t run out.  This was recommended during a facial and I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0006ZEWEE DN-24 Hydracreme Pharmagel Intensive Vitamin Facial Treatment 2 oz]]    Love it! doesnt make my eyes burn and feels great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else! I have rather sensitive skin and this product works great on it. No breakouts or irritation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mom.  She has been using Pharmagel for about a year now and loves the brand.  I was able to get a better price for the product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The only face cream my wife will use! No fragrance and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This face cream is great.  Non-allergenic, no greasy feel, absolutely helps my skin feel soft.  I use it every night and any time I wash my face.  It&#x27;s totally worth the price.  No heavy odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note:  it is not a sunscreen, none built in.  Which is one thing I like about it, (we don&#x27;t&#x27; need sunscreen at night)..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this creme for many years, as has my 91 year old mother.  She repeatedly receives compliments on her skin and comments on how young she looks.  I think it helps my skin too.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommend this to me in 1993, and i have been using this ever since. I have tried other expensive products in the past but nothing has ever worked as well. And i get complaints on my skin all the time, and no one can believe my age. Must be this wonderful creme. I use the wash &amp;amp; scrub also.</li>
            <li> I love this DN-24 Hydracreme. It is so smooth and penetrating. I use mornings when I don&#x27;t wear makeup and before I retire at night,</li>
            <li> Best cream ever ! Leaves skin soft without being greasy.. Great under makeup! A little goes a long way! Smooth skin!</li>
            <li> Like this product very much.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and all the other related stuff</li>
            <li> my wife like them, I will order for more.</li>
            <li> This product is OK. It is a bit heavy for my skin type (oily). If your skin is dry, it might work better for you.</li>
            <li> This is the best night cream that I have found that is a reasonable price.  Even recommended by my anesitician</li>
            <li> Good product, but expensive.</li>
            <li> Awesome, don&#x27;t want to. Use anything else</li>
            <li> Lovely cream to use containing some very powerful ingredients that are useful for the skin. Good for day and night usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It keeps my skin soft and fresh looking.  I use it morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  After washing my face and putting it on my face feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This was recommend to me by someone in the business. It does not feel heavy on the skin after application</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the advice of a trusted friend.  I was not dissappointed.  A little goes a long way and its a great value for the amount you receive.  I have mildly sensitve skin and started using the product in the middle of a midwest winter.  It immediatly helped rehydrate the skin.  As I move into summer, I&#x27;ve noticed smoother skin that is very supple to the touch. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because i have not used a wide variety of other facial moisturizers so I don&#x27;t have alot to compare it to.  The product is not greasy and has a mild scent you usually associate with sun-screens.</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly and as described.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over twenty years. This is my favorite night cream.  I am often told I don&#x27;t look my age.  I started using it when I learned how gentle yet effective it is.  My ballroom dance clients see may skin up close and ask what I use.  I am happy to share age and my secrets.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s and needed something for wrinkles and moisture. This is already making a difference. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dehydrated.</li>
            <li> This cream is just great. I use it at night, but occasionally as a daycream It was recommended to me by my esthetician years&lt;br /&gt;ago. I have tried other items in the product line. This is a terrific brand.</li>
            <li> great cream for day and night</li>
    </ol>
