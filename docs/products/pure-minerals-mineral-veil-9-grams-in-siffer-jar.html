            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I got luminous and it gives me that dewy look which is a nice change from the always matte look I have.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ll pass it along to a friend and surely make another fan of this makeup.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure but decided to try it and</li>
            <li>As suggested by the seller, I now mix w/moisturizer to use as a cream foundation and love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Not quite as fine a powder as the original Bare Minerals, but price is very good, so I&#x27;ll keep ordering it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, comparable to the brand name Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not aggravating it and feels light weight.</li>
            <li>it is light</li>
            <li>This one seems more &amp;#34;starchy&amp;#34; if that&#x27;s the right word</li>
            <li>Not as good as bare minerals the real stuff but more affordable</li>
            <li>I love this Mineral Veil by Pure minerals</li>
            <li>Every morning my daughter and I love to apply this with our makeup, its very easy to apply and the jar has enough for both of us to use.</li>
            <li>The mineral veil is OK though I prefer the consistency of Bare Minerals better.  </li>
            <li>Love this just as good as Bareminerals but cost less.</li>
            <li>when I mix two of the colors together from Pure Minerals, it works!</li>
            <li>Color is pretty transparent.  </li>
            <li>I just wish that it had more ounces (bigger jar) for the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have quite the same luminous sheen as the better brands</li>
            <li>Not a terrible product but a little too light for my liking.</li>
            <li>Thanks Pure Minerals!</li>
            <li>like this make up just as much as the higher ticket Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li>Color has a yellowish undertone rather than a rosy undertone, but this is getting very nitpicky.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast with no problems?</li>
            <li>It really helps my daugther glow</li>
            <li>Ok, lighter than expected.</li>
            <li>I have used other products much more expensive and this is just as good!</li>
            <li>Had to go back to Bare Minerals, but it&#x27;s better than looking like a clown.</li>
            <li>but it is actually way too dark in this brand, so I bought the Fair foundation</li>
            <li>I expected it to cover better and blend better, not very satisfied</li>
            <li>it gives more coverage with less powder.  </li>
            <li>I am an older lady and my skin is quite senstitive.</li>
            <li>Color differant, not same as bare minerals, its ok but again not bare minerals.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The shade I picked was too dark and when I requested the lighter shade they helped me pick the exact correct call lot and shipped it fast, no charge</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Not even close to Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>And does not seem to help oil like bare minerals matte.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And does not seem to help oil like bare minerals matte.</li>
            <li> Very coarse instead of silky and doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> NOT EXACTLY the same color as Bare Minerals, but</li>
            <li> However,  the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; face powder was a very strange color - it looked yellow in the jar and on my face.  </li>

            <li> I hope this company sticks around long term</li>

            <li> A little heavier than Bare Minerals, but I like that</li>
            <li> It also had tiny little pieces if glitter in it, not fond of the sparkle.</li>
            <li> I just have to be careful</li>
            <li> I mixed it with another brand of finishing veil so as not to waste the product</li>
            <li> and it is a sickly pale yellow color.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount</li>
            <li> the only problem was when I went to sift some out in the lid the sifter in the jar was too small and it fell out in the lid arg!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste it all over the floor?</li>
            <li> makes face go pale - chgs makeup&#x27;s color</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> makes face go pale - chgs makeup&#x27;s color</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my face look sooo flawless.</li>
            <li> I am an older lady and my skin is quite senstitive. This is a good product it is quite a suprize to me it stays on for so long. I use a smaller brush to apply and it is seems to cover well I would reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and product. I have sensitive skin with dermatitis. It&#x27;s not aggravating it and feels light weight. The shade I picked was too dark and when I requested the lighter shade they helped me pick the exact correct call lot and shipped it fast, no charge and I didn&#x27;t have to return the original wrong color. I&#x27;ll pass it along to a friend and surely make another fan of this makeup. I love it. I got luminous and it gives me that dewy look which is a nice change from the always matte look I have. I hope this company sticks around long term so I can use it forever. I also got the corrective concealer and cinnamon blush....both equally awesome! Thanks Pure Minerals!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure but decided to try it and like this make up just as much as the higher ticket Mineral Veil.</li>

            <li> Not even close to Bare Minerals.  Very coarse instead of silky and doesn&#x27;t last as long.  Very disappointed.  Med. Beige is perfect for my skin tone but it is actually way too dark in this brand, so I bought the Fair foundation and it is a sickly pale yellow color.  Had to go back to Bare Minerals, but it&#x27;s better than looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> As suggested by the seller, I now mix w/moisturizer to use as a cream foundation and love it.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  A little heavier than Bare Minerals, but I like that it gives more coverage with less powder.  NOT EXACTLY the same color as Bare Minerals, but when I mix two of the colors together from Pure Minerals, it works! (for way cheaper!)</li>
            <li> Wow! So much better than I was expecting! Very light weight. It doesn&#x27;t have quite the same luminous sheen as the better brands but I feel like it actually stays on throughout the day! Covers perfectly.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> The mineral veil is OK though I prefer the consistency of Bare Minerals better.  This one seems more &amp;#34;starchy&amp;#34; if that&#x27;s the right word and I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  However,  the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; face powder was a very strange color - it looked yellow in the jar and on my face.  In fact, when I applied it, I almost looked like I had jaundice!  Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Color differant, not same as bare minerals, its ok but again not bare minerals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not to fond of this powder but it will do in a rush.</li>
            <li> Not a terrible product but a little too light for my liking. It also had tiny little pieces if glitter in it, not fond of the sparkle. I mixed it with another brand of finishing veil so as not to waste the product and it did the trick.</li>
            <li> Every morning my daughter and I love to apply this with our makeup, its very easy to apply and the jar has enough for both of us to use. It really helps my daugther glow and she is very happy when she looks in the mirror, it does seem to help my beautiful face as well!</li>
            <li> Ok, lighter than expected. And does not seem to help oil like bare minerals matte.</li>
            <li> Love this just as good as Bareminerals but cost less. Perfect flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product! Quality and performance of the name brand without the price tag. I love it. It lasts forever as well and I am glowing.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, comparable to the brand name Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> Used with the foundation, this makeup provides the perfect finish just as good as Bare Minerals. I recommend this product for anyone with problem skin, or perfect skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> Not quite as fine a powder as the original Bare Minerals, but price is very good, so I&#x27;ll keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> I love this Mineral Veil by Pure minerals it is light and it gives my skin a glow. You only need a small amount and I like the fact that is has no parabens. I have used other products much more expensive and this is just as good!</li>
