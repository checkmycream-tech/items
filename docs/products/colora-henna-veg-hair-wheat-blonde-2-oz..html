            <li>The price was great, too.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>All these help incredibly, and my natural curls look incredible, shiny, conditioned, and fall in a good curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>This product is good because it makes your hair strong but it feels like you have sand in your hair.</li>
            <li>Did a good job and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, great quality, color is superb and very natural - I would recommend this henna to everybody with this hair color.</li>
            <li>For being a first time Henna user, this product is great.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t wash my hair more than twice a week.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love henna.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to fix the brassiness without resorting to more chemicals, and on a budget as my hair reaches just under my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really love this product and color.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks better than it has for 5 years.</li>
            <li>The color is wonderful, starts off light redhead and fades to strawberry blonde.  </li>
            <li>Using creme rinse made washing it out easy.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color, blended my darker blonde roots with my dyed blond ends.</li>
            <li>The color is a beautiful blond and my hair feels terrific.  </li>
            <li>I am getting many many compliments on my color, and many thinking its real and that I am from Ireland.  </li>
            <li>For one who doesn&#x27;t want harmful chemicals in their scalp and hair, yet wants to turn mousey graying blonde to a more lively color, this product is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Nice and doesnt change color but doesnt last too long however great for a week end  </li>
            <li>Not any more, my hair is very soft and full of color.</li>
            <li>If the color doesn&#x27;t last, I will update this review, but this is certainly better than the $30 I was paying every 6 weeks for temporary color to cover those pesky grays!</li>
            <li>This is came out a golden brown on my ash brown hair, and my greys turned blond.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and colors nicely, however, after a few weeks the shade turns to a brownish orange.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was rather like the highlighting I always had</li>
            <li>First time using henna.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely not a hair dye that falls into the easily applied and removed category.</li>
            <li>The mud-like paste has a strong/interesting smell to it and tangles your hair really fast.</li>
            <li>really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything except tint hair a light strawberry red.</li>
            <li>It is kind of messy because it like mud</li>
            <li>I used plain warm water to mix it, applied it with my fingers, and waited under a plastic cap for two hours before washing it out.  </li>
            <li>The results, shiney, manageable, toned down my wirey white hair and good color.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put a towel down so that the henna don&#x27;t get on your bed spread.  </li>
            <li>It is most definitely Strawberry Blonde.  </li>
            <li>The smell was kinda spinachy, but not unpleasant, and disappeared shortly after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product after reading some of the glowing customer reviews...</li>
            <li>It surprises me to read that others say golden or blonde.  </li>
            <li>After all the trouble though, my hair was much softer, and when the light hits my hair</li>
            <li>Afterward the bathroom will be a little messy from the henna but that is a good excuse to clean the bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does seem to shift colors, sometimes more blonde and sometimes more redhead almost orange, which is just a step before weird.  </li>
            <li>;  If you give yourself a henna treatment every month or five weeks you will not have roots show and it looks natural and people will wonder &amp;</li>
            <li>Looks completely natural.   </li>
            <li>The color is a light, shiney, pale lemon shade and it looks utterly natural.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve aged I&#x27;ve developed major streaks of white on the top of my head with lots of white peppered through the rest.</li>
            <li>but eventually my hair began to look more light gray than blonde which gave a cold look that doesn&#x27;t match my skin color</li>
            <li>My only problem is that my hair is so thick I could have used some more.</li>
            <li>It barely covered my chin length bob.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Washing it out is like washing out a head full of small grained and sticky sand.  </li>
            <li>make sure the part around the face and widow&#x27;s peak is thick so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you order enough if you have thick or long hair.</li>
            <li>This product colors only the grey hairs and creates a natural highlight effect.</li>
            <li>I use half of the natural and half of the wheat blonde henna along with a heaping tablespoon of light brown henna and then add and apply to my wet hair.  </li>

            <li> I mixed this with neutral henna and only left it on about an hur and a half</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair with lots of grey around my face.</li>
            <li> It took a lot of courage to put henna in my hair as I&#x27;ve heard it comes out pink on white hair.</li>
            <li> Then dry and style your hair.  </li>
            <li> I started out dark blonde in life and always put highlights in to avoid the dishwater look.</li>
            <li> My sister has dark brown hair with lots of white peppered through it and was horrified when she got to the point that her ususal auburn henna treatment started to look like it had pink threads in it.</li>
            <li> I was going to cut my hair  because it is very dry from using hair coloring from the stores.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a big mess in the bathroom where I applied it, either.  </li>
            <li> I left it in for two hours and then rinsed with an excessive amount of conditioner as your hair feels like a dry mud cake at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried unnatural chemical hair dyes in the past and won&#x27;t go back to them.  </li>
            <li> Mess was minimal.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I took the plunge yesterday and applied Wheat Blonde to my hair for an hour and 20 minutes...just used water and mixed up a sloppy paste, combed it through my hair, applied a plastic bag and waited.....</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; washed down the shower drain with no problem.</li>
            <li> Not that much of a mess.</li>
            <li> I ended up with less color there because mine dried out as the mud was too thin.  </li>
            <li> alas, this product did little to nothing to cover my grays.  </li>
            <li> I kept it rather thick, like mashed potatoes, when I applied it.  </li>
            <li> I am chemically sensitive, so hate all the hair dyes with perfume and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It was a pleasure to sleep the day of coloring and lay on my hair without horrible smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been terribly DRYING.  </li>

            <li> I have medium brown hair with lots of grey around my face. This product colors only the grey hairs and creates a natural highlight effect. My sister thought I&#x27;d had it done at a salon. It rinses out in about 4-6 weeks. The best thing is the price!</li>
            <li> Works great to covers gray and didn&#x27;t damage my hair but it doesn&#x27;t last long and I don&#x27;t wash my hair more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with neutral henna and only left it on about an hur and a half but it managed to lend a blonde tint to my gray temples.  It seems to strengthen my hair, also.</li>
            <li> For being a first time Henna user, this product is great. Not that much of a mess. I was going to cut my hair  because it is very dry from using hair coloring from the stores. Not any more, my hair is very soft and full of color. I have been coloring my hair with box chemical stuff for 30 yrs. The price is great too. I will be ordering 20 boxes of this henna next week. Love it. Sue</li>
            <li> I love henna.  I use half of the natural and half of the wheat blonde henna along with a heaping tablespoon of light brown henna and then add and apply to my wet hair.  then wrap my hair with saran wrap and do housework for  3/4 of an hour or take a nap for that time.  Be sure to put a towel down so that the henna don&#x27;t get on your bed spread.  It is kind of messy because it like mud but then I made mud pies as a kid so mud does not  not intimidate me.  Then shampoo the henna out and finish with some cream rinse and wash that out.  Then dry and style your hair.  Afterward the bathroom will be a little messy from the henna but that is a good excuse to clean the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago Clairol had an advertising campaign with the  slogan, &amp;#34;does she or doesn&#x27;t she&amp;#34;  If you give yourself a henna treatment every month or five weeks you will not have roots show and it looks natural and people will wonder &amp;#34;does she or doesn&#x27;t she.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, blended my darker blonde roots with my dyed blond ends.</li>
            <li> For one who doesn&#x27;t want harmful chemicals in their scalp and hair, yet wants to turn mousey graying blonde to a more lively color, this product is perfect.  It won&#x27;t lighten hair, but it will color the gray and white hairs.  I&#x27;ve tried unnatural chemical hair dyes in the past and won&#x27;t go back to them.  There is no eventual brassiness with this product.  Looks completely natural.   I used vinegar instead or water, and I let the mixture set overnight in a covered pyrex bowl. I kept it rather thick, like mashed potatoes, when I applied it.  I put a plastic bag (from the grocery&#x27;s vegetable department) over my hair and scalp, taped the bag to keep it snug, and waited 2 hours for the color to set in.  I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> Nice and doesnt change color but doesnt last too long however great for a week end  get away thx med</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  It is easy to use and colors nicely, however, after a few weeks the shade turns to a brownish orange.  No kidding!</li>
            <li> I had bleached my hair (normally my hair is a dark brown with stubborn red undertones) twice before trying this product about a week after the second bleaching. I was hoping to fix the brassiness without resorting to more chemicals, and on a budget as my hair reaches just under my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely not a hair dye that falls into the easily applied and removed category. The mud-like paste has a strong/interesting smell to it and tangles your hair really fast. I left it in for two hours and then rinsed with an excessive amount of conditioner as your hair feels like a dry mud cake at this point. After all the trouble though, my hair was much softer, and when the light hits my hair it&#x27;s really pretty. The brassiness is somewhat subdued as well and one package was just enough to do it. Will I use this product again? Possibly in a darker shade.</li>
            <li> My hair turned orange. When I contacted Company I got a response back that I should visit a beautician.</li>
            <li> This product is good because it makes your hair strong but it feels like you have sand in your hair. It takes a while to remove that all the gritty sand  from your hair. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading some of the glowing customer reviews...alas, this product did little to nothing to cover my grays.  On the upside, it did not turn my hair orange either, like the last henna product I tried did.  My hair is shinier and seems healthier, but those gray/white hairs are still present and accounted for.</li>
            <li> Used this last night on my hair and it totally covered all the gray!  I used plain warm water to mix it, applied it with my fingers, and waited under a plastic cap for two hours before washing it out.  Using creme rinse made washing it out easy.  The &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; washed down the shower drain with no problem. Because I used my fingers I didn&#x27;t have a big mess in the bathroom where I applied it, either.  The smell was kinda spinachy, but not unpleasant, and disappeared shortly after rinsing.  The color is a beautiful blond and my hair feels terrific.  If the color doesn&#x27;t last, I will update this review, but this is certainly better than the $30 I was paying every 6 weeks for temporary color to cover those pesky grays!</li>
            <li> I started out dark blonde in life and always put highlights in to avoid the dishwater look. As I&#x27;ve aged I&#x27;ve developed major streaks of white on the top of my head with lots of white peppered through the rest. At first I thought this was rather like the highlighting I always had but eventually my hair began to look more light gray than blonde which gave a cold look that doesn&#x27;t match my skin color well. It took a lot of courage to put henna in my hair as I&#x27;ve heard it comes out pink on white hair. My sister has dark brown hair with lots of white peppered through it and was horrified when she got to the point that her ususal auburn henna treatment started to look like it had pink threads in it. (a bit punk for a 60 something). Anyway, I took the plunge yesterday and applied Wheat Blonde to my hair for an hour and 20 minutes...just used water and mixed up a sloppy paste, combed it through my hair, applied a plastic bag and waited.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a delightful result!! I&#x27;m blonde again with essentially the same look I had years ago. The color is a light, shiney, pale lemon shade and it looks utterly natural. My only problem is that my hair is so thick I could have used some more. It barely covered my chin length bob. Make sure you order enough if you have thick or long hair. One package may not be enough.</li>
            <li> Did a good job and was easy to use. Will buy again. The results, shiney, manageable, toned down my wirey white hair and good color. Mess was minimal.</li>
            <li> First time using henna.  I liked it.  Strawberry blonde.  Highlights come through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to shift colors, sometimes more blonde and sometimes more redhead almost orange, which is just a step before weird.  I have a shampoo with chamomile and then it rights the color again.  I&#x27;m not expert in henna application or use, so will try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a mistake in my application:  make sure the part around the face and widow&#x27;s peak is thick so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  I ended up with less color there because mine dried out as the mud was too thin.  I left it on for one hour.  Some say two.  I will try longer next time to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the smell.  It smells like brewed tea.  I am chemically sensitive, so hate all the hair dyes with perfume and chemicals.  It was a pleasure to sleep the day of coloring and lay on my hair without horrible smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing it out is like washing out a head full of small grained and sticky sand.  It takes a while but will all wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  August 2014&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for the third time yesterday. I left it in for two hours the last two times.  The color is wonderful, starts off light redhead and fades to strawberry blonde.  It is most definitely Strawberry Blonde.  It surprises me to read that others say golden or blonde.  I am getting many many compliments on my color, and many thinking its real and that I am from Ireland.  lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been terribly DRYING.  This last time I added 1/4 honey to the mix and followed with a leave in conditioner.  And I have switched to Acure Argon conditioner last month.  All these help incredibly, and my natural curls look incredible, shiny, conditioned, and fall in a good curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product and color.  My hair looks better than it has for 5 years.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, great quality, color is superb and very natural - I would recommend this henna to everybody with this hair color.</li>
            <li> This is came out a golden brown on my ash brown hair, and my greys turned blond. The price was great, too. I will definitely be buying this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything except tint hair a light strawberry red. Won&#x27;t be trying again.</li>
