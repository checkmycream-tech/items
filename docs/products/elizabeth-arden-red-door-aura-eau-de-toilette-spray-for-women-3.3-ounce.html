            <li>I thought it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>As usual this was a great buy, the price for this was awesome considering the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I am so glad i decided to give it a chance.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this perfume and will buy again.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, light scent that stays, but isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is her favorite scent</li>
            <li>surprised cause Amazon is usually great.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the original,</li>
            <li>, scent was too strong.</li>
            <li>I have RED DOOR and have had great compliments on</li>
            <li>I am an all around kind of girl and use various perfumes but this one has had the most effect between men and women inquiring about it.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH&#x3D;))  </li>
            <li>Just received this &amp; really like it because I prefer more spicey, woodsey scents.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, I bought it for my mom for Christmas because she loves the original Red Door.</li>
            <li>The scent seems to last for a very long time, which is great for daywear, and prominent enough for nightwear.</li>
            <li>i felt quite comfortable to try AURA RED DOOR.</li>
            <li>It was on time and much cheaper than the department stores.</li>

            <li>Did really smell like the department store</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of all of the Red Door fragrances, Red Door Aura is no disappointment and holds it&#x27;s own with the other great Red Door scents.</li>
            <li>It is less offensive than the original perfume, but at the same time is still a strong and somewhat over powering scent.</li>
            <li>Thats not negative to the seller or fragrance.</li>
            <li>and she went completely gaga over it.</li>
            <li>the dry down smells better.</li>

            <li> so I prefer stronger scents to get me through long work days.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this perfume to anyone who likes Opium, and other musky/spicy scents like that.</li>
            <li> If you like the other Elizabeth Arden scents then you will like this one as well.</li>

            <li> This is a new and improved version of the Red Door perfume. It is less offensive than the original perfume, but at the same time is still a strong and somewhat over powering scent. I live in the Caribbean where it is hot all year round so I prefer stronger scents to get me through long work days. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have RED DOOR and have had great compliments on i felt quite comfortable to try AURA RED DOOR. I am so glad i decided to give it a chance.  I ordered it four days ago and it was delivered this morning. The only change i would like to see is it come UPS because it would be on my door step. Thats not negative to the seller or fragrance. I just wish i didn&#x27;t have to go get it in my regular mail. THANK YOU SO MUCH&#x3D;))  If i could give you ten stars, i would.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of all of the Red Door fragrances, Red Door Aura is no disappointment and holds it&#x27;s own with the other great Red Door scents. Aura; like Red Door Velvet and Red Door Glimmer, is not like Red Door or Red Door Revealed. Aura has a muskier, spicy scent, it&#x27;s a lot like it&#x27;s sister Shimmer but heavier. The scent seems to last for a very long time, which is great for daywear, and prominent enough for nightwear. This is another home run hit by Elizabeth Arden, I can&#x27;t even say how happy I am that I purchase this product. As usual this was a great buy, the price for this was awesome considering the size of the bottle. I would recommend this perfume to anyone who likes Opium, and other musky/spicy scents like that.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume and will buy again.  Will buy this perfume again and would suggest it for purchase</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, I bought it for my mom for Christmas because she loves the original Red Door. I like it better than the original, the dry down smells better.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, I love it. 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume, so I get brownie points for ordering it for her. Tough work... Three clicks.  It was on time and much cheaper than the department stores.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the deal on this perfume.  I thought it was too good to be true.  I was wrong.  What a great price.  I purchased this for an Xmas gift.</li>
            <li> . i ordered not the regular, not the &amp;#34;Aura&amp;#34;. i was actually told this would be replaced by the correct order, to keep this.&lt;br /&gt;that was quite a while ago (a month ?)  surprised cause Amazon is usually great.</li>
            <li> Wonderful ... its a great buy ... met my expections. ..</li>
            <li> Just received this &amp; really like it because I prefer more spicey, woodsey scents.I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t last long on my skin. Wish there was a lotion to go along with it.</li>
            <li> M o s t d e s e r v e d g i f t S h e e v e r r e c e i v e d !</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me as a gift. It has a nice, light scent that stays, but isn&#x27;t overwhelming. If you like the other Elizabeth Arden scents then you will like this one as well.</li>
            <li> The product met all my expectations and beyond. Shipping was quick.  I have no complaints at all.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and met 100% sender details about the product. I am an all around kind of girl and use various perfumes but this one has had the most effect between men and women inquiring about it. I had a gentleman pull me aside and ask what I was wearing with much respect. I told him and then I saw him with his wife just moments later and she loved it! He ordered it before she had arrived to meet with him! I love it and have received nothing but great results while wearing it by all ages and genders. BUY IT!!! WHAT YOU WAITING FOR??!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my best friend.  This is her favorite scent and she went completely gaga over it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter she LOVED IT!</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume, perfect seller, fast shipping. I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li> Did really smell like the department store, scent was too strong.</li>
