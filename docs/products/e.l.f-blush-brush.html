            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Great value!</li>
            <li>This brush is tapered expertly so that the bristles form the perfect shape</li>
            <li>and it picks up the perfect amount of product.  </li>
            <li>there are selling it for over $2 more!!!!</li>
            <li>I think it is a very good quality and</li>

            <li>I love this brush to contour with, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>really nice brush for the price!</li>
            <li>This is also good for contouring, or whatever you might need a make-up brush for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are good quality though, and don&#x27;t shed on your face.</li>
            <li>It is good for contouring with bronzer and highlighter.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>This brush is small-to-medium sized and has a nice taper to it.  </li>
            <li>Got exactly what I ordered at a great price.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my technique, but this brush picks up more blush than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure there are better-quality blush brushes out there.  </li>
            <li>I find I can control the amount of product that gets on my face much better with this brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I went ahead &amp; purchased it.</li>
            <li>I feel like I get much better coverage and can contour my cheeks better using this brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks for an amazing product e.l.f. &amp; Amazon!</li>
            <li>It is perfect for loose powder blush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and is perfect for creating a soft cheek contour.</li>
            <li>I use only in the very hollows of my cheeks and along my jawline, and this brush is perfect for it.  </li>
            <li>i really dont know what to use it for!!!?</li>
            <li>Same price as this just works much better!</li>
            <li>I love how soft the bristles are, too.  </li>
            <li>The blush doesn&#x27;t go on right.</li>
            <li>the price was right.  </li>
            <li>to place/pack on the blush but not especially good to blend, more precise but doesn&#x27;t deliver a natural look on its own.</li>
            <li>As a regular blush brush its great right up there with my mac brush, I saw something different that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>As far as the brush it holds its shape doesn&#x27;t lose hair and cleanse up easy</li>
            <li>bristles are soft and pretty dense but the handle itself reflects the cheap price.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for applying my contour, first with the thin tip, and then on the flat sides to broaden out the contour.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as cheap ones and the brush is soft but with sharp ending.</li>
            <li>Studio Blush Brush is a real winner.</li>
            <li>Considering that, I can&#x27;t complain too much about the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybe i expected more from this brush, never had a problem with elf brushes, but this one just did not do the job for me.</li>
            <li>They dispense just the right amount of product to give you a natural look and allow for you to build up layers of the product.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, &amp; a very sturdy handle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and spreads my blush very evenly.</li>
            <li>What this brush would be god for is contouring under the cheek bones because it&#x27;s pointed and not dense, so it won&#x27;t apply a high concentration of powder.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend washing it before use.</li>
            <li>I love the brush its so soft its not hard like other brush i have .  </li>
            <li>It is soft and full enough for the purpose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I tend to go pretty light with the blush; I have a pale complexion and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of color to have a noticeable effect.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to buy this because I needed a new blush brush.</li>
            <li>but it was very soft and compact for highlighter or under eyes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but overall, just kind of small to be used a blush brush.</li>
            <li>I love  elf brushes with the black handle and some with the white handle.</li>
            <li>Brush is soft, does not shed,picks up product well, applies evenly</li>
            <li>I wish I would have replaced my old brush sooner.</li>
            <li>Complete failur.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft on my face.  </li>
            <li>This blush brush is very unusual from other blush brushes that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>no super wide and dense for blending blush in, more flat than it looks as if to be used</li>
            <li>Studio taklon brushes now instead of Bare Escentuals brand or others.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s below average size which will cause a problem with those who want to apply blush to large areas.  </li>
            <li>I just bought another one after the first was looking a little haggard from years of daily use.</li>
            <li>although the brush is somewhat small, it&#x27;s just about the right size for what I want.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> For the price, the e.l.f. Studio Blush Brush is a real winner. It is soft and full enough for the purpose. Also, it&#x27;s slightly pointed end gives me a sense of control of cosmetic placement. It&#x27;s a matter of preference. This is also good for contouring, or whatever you might need a make-up brush for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price without shipping (at Target) is excellent.</li>
            <li> This blush brush is very unusual from other blush brushes that I&#x27;ve seen. This one is not very dense and it&#x27;s quite pointed. Also, it&#x27;s below average size which will cause a problem with those who want to apply blush to large areas.  I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a year and I&#x27;ve had no issues with shedding or reshaping. It does remain pointed.  What this brush would be god for is contouring under the cheek bones because it&#x27;s pointed and not dense, so it won&#x27;t apply a high concentration of powder.  All in all, it just depends on your personal preferences and what you want to use this brush for!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this brush I thought it was the little round brush from the picture and its not ! That&#x27;s really my only disappointment with it . As a regular blush brush its great right up there with my mac brush, I saw something different that&#x27;s all. As far as the brush it holds its shape doesn&#x27;t lose hair and cleanse up easy</li>
            <li> I bought it but im not using it.&lt;br /&gt; its very small to be a blush brush or countouring brush i really dont know what to use it for!!!?</li>
            <li> I bought this blush brush because it was the only one in stock at the store where I was shopping at the time, and I didn&#x27;t want to go somewhere else.  Considering that, I can&#x27;t complain too much about the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to go pretty light with the blush; I have a pale complexion and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of color to have a noticeable effect.  Maybe it&#x27;s just my technique, but this brush picks up more blush than I&#x27;d like.  I remedy that by scraping the brush across the edge of the blush compact before applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically just put a little blush on each cheekbone, so although the brush is somewhat small, it&#x27;s just about the right size for what I want.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and none of the hairs have come out, so it appears to hold up over time.  One small problem I have is that I&#x27;m not really able to use this for blending.  What I usually just do is use the brush to put the blush on my face and then blend with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;m sure there are better-quality blush brushes out there.  But, this one is not too expensive and it basically does the job I bought it to do.  I&#x27;d probably rate this 3.5 stars if half stars were allowed, but since they&#x27;re not, I&#x27;ll round up to 4.</li>
            <li> no super wide and dense for blending blush in, more flat than it looks as if to be used to place/pack on the blush but not especially good to blend, more precise but doesn&#x27;t deliver a natural look on its own. bristles are soft and pretty dense but the handle itself reflects the cheap price.</li>
            <li> I usually buy some brushes by e.l.f. so I decided to buy this because I needed a new blush brush. I didn&#x27;t like it. The blush doesn&#x27;t go on right. So I went to Ulta and bought a different one by Studio. Same price as this just works much better!</li>
            <li> I like this brush, and I&#x27;m hoping with continued use it will round out shape-wise. Currently, it&#x27;s almost pointed. The bristles are good quality though, and don&#x27;t shed on your face. I&#x27;m keeping it, but hoping it loosens up a little, and reshapes itself rounder.</li>
            <li> maybe i expected more from this brush, never had a problem with elf brushes, but this one just did not do the job for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; brush. The bristles are soft but overall, just kind of small to be used a blush brush. I ended up using it as a highlighting brush only.</li>
            <li> My MUST for putting on powder and blush. I can SEE all the product on the brush. I hate the round powder brushes that soak up too much product and deposit it all on my face. I find I can control the amount of product that gets on my face much better with this brush. I just bought another one after the first was looking a little haggard from years of daily use. Lol. I love this brush. I wash it every night with liquid dish soap to prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to brush my setting powder off my under eyes and to contour under my cheek bones.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with glo minerals blush and it works perfectly! It&#x27;s very soft and spreads my blush very evenly.</li>
            <li> Will always be an e.l.f. fan! This brush is so soft and is perfect for creating a soft cheek contour.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I thought but it was very soft and compact for highlighter or under eyes.</li>
            <li> I like to apply blush only to small area of my face so I like the fact this brush is smaller and tapered.It is good for contouring with bronzer and highlighter.Brush is soft, does not shed,picks up product well, applies evenly and it is only $3 if you buy from E.L.F. or any drugstore that sells it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush for the price. It does the job it is supposed to do. Has not shed and I&#x27;ve had it about 3months now.</li>
            <li> I was nervous when I ordered this bc I didn&#x27;t know how the quality would be. I&#x27;m so glad that I went ahead &amp; purchased it. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. Soft bristles, &amp; a very sturdy handle! Thanks for an amazing product e.l.f. &amp; Amazon!</li>
            <li> The brush was just as described.  I think it is a very good quality and the price was right.  It was delievered in the time they quoted.  I will get some of their other brushes</li>
            <li> I love the brush its so soft its not hard like other brush i have .  I do recommend this brush and this brand . I love  elf brushes with the black handle and some with the white handle. I have alot of elf brushes.</li>
            <li> Not the highest quality but does the job for reaching into smaller blush pans. I highly recommend washing it before use.</li>
            <li> I love this brush to contour with, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> really nice brush for the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to replace a small drug store blush brush and I absolutely love it! I wish I would have replaced my old brush sooner. The brush is super soft and feels great on my skin. I feel like I get much better coverage and can contour my cheeks better using this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is small-to-medium sized and has a nice taper to it.  It is perfect for applying my contour, first with the thin tip, and then on the flat sides to broaden out the contour.  Now, I mean &amp;#34;contour&amp;#34; and not bronzer....the brush is much to small for that.  I use only in the very hollows of my cheeks and along my jawline, and this brush is perfect for it.  Because it is black, it doesn&#x27;t get all stained from the dark contour color....And you can&#x27;t beat the price with a stick.  Great value!</li>
            <li> This brush is tapered expertly so that the bristles form the perfect shape and it picks up the perfect amount of product.  I love how soft the bristles are, too.  They dispense just the right amount of product to give you a natural look and allow for you to build up layers of the product.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered at a great price.</li>
            <li> It worked so well that I got another one for my highlighting powder!!!!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your $$$ on this. Buy it in store at target for only $3. there are selling it for over $2 more!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s not as strong as cheap ones and the brush is soft but with sharp ending. I used it with powder and it didn&#x27;t even hold any powder or color. Complete failur.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft on my face.  The pri¢e is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt; It is perfect for loose powder blush.&lt;br /&gt; I will buy e.l.f. Studio taklon brushes now instead of Bare Escentuals brand or others.</li>
