    <ol>
            <li>The on/off buttons are positioned perfectly so that every time you try to create a curl in your hair,you press the off button.</li>
            <li>Best curling iron ever</li>
            <li>My hair looks the best after using this size curing iron.</li>
            <li>The product works well and the size is perfect for my hair, the problem with this curling iron is the location of the heat settings dial.  </li>
            <li>and I got lots of compliments and asked what I was using to get these kind of curls!!!  </li>
            <li>This one is great.</li>
            <li>The grip was great for holding hair while twisting</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>When it works, it is a great curling iron.</li>
            <li>As I said, when it works, it does a great job on my hair that others don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Bought this item for my sister &amp; she is happy with it.</li>
            <li>I also hope the buttons don&#x27;t sink inside like a handful of others have experienced.</li>
            <li>Perfect :-)  </li>
            <li>Okay, the size is perfect by the hinge hangs all the time</li>
            <li>I love this Curling Iron it makes perfect curls</li>
            <li>I loved this curling iron when Walmart used to carry it.  </li>
            <li>Was every bit as good as described.</li>
            <li>Good curling iron but needs some changes to the design.  </li>
            <li>it is a good curling iron.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loved it</li>
            <li>It is a good curling iron for the price.</li>
            <li>she got it for Christmas and was very pleased with the size and the temp it would hold.</li>
            <li>Takes a fair bit to warm up.</li>
            <li>Love it otherwise!</li>
            <li>and it worked great on my hair, but the heat temperature dial is too easy to turn and in a location where you hit it ever time you go to roll the iron.  </li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular but works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does produce nice curls, but it sure does take effort.  </li>
            <li>So, for the cost it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great until it stops working, and I have consistently replaced it about every 6 months for many years.  </li>
            <li>Heats evenly and quickly and large size is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I need to turn the iron on a dozen or more times every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Big beautiful curls!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>If it had worked well I would have ordered a couple more.</li>
            <li>I really do love the diameter of the barrel</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found too many inexpensive curling irons this size.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to get this size curling iron again.  </li>
            <li>i love this styling iron for its heat and its size.</li>
            <li>curling iron came with a silicon sleeve for travel storage, so that is one worthwhile thing.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this Revlon product in stores any longer nor could I find the 1-3/4\\&quot; wand by another manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>Off to find a better curling iron.......</li>
            <li>I had hoped to use this to be able to put more hair onto the roller at one time to make a curl, but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I was able to deal with my hand hitting the off button as others warned about</li>
            <li>Love the size and love the way this works.</li>
            <li>I spend more time trying not to hit the on/off switch than I do using the iron.</li>
            <li>I would love the product if it were not for that.</li>
            <li>This is my second Revlon Perfect Heat Tourmaline Ceramic.  </li>
            <li>But if you keep that in mind, you will get better at avoiding the on/off and heat dial while styling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a gap between the barrel and the top cap that rips your hair out.</li>
            <li>Works better than most doesn&#x27;t make hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>However, for my long and curly hair, it is the perfect size.  </li>
            <li>It does warm up quickly and has automatic shut-off.</li>
            <li>I bought this for loose, wavy curls (which this does flawlessly), and it does was what it&#x27;s supposed to for the price.</li>
            <li>Pay the bucks and get a good one, I love my new one and it works!</li>
            <li>Works great, love the many different levels of heat and that it will shut off on its own if you forget to do it yourself, and the large size barrel.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect and I was happy to find it online, as I have been unable to find</li>
            <li>It works great and above all, doesn&#x27;t damage or crinkle hair like so many curling irons do.</li>
            <li>This one arrived in the package and everything looked fine.</li>
            <li>The machine itself worked fine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even curl my fine hair, so maybe we should just call this a heating iron.</li>
            <li>received curling iron and it turns on, well the light is on, but it does not heat up at all.</li>
            <li>My original one does not have this problem.</li>
            <li>Such a wise choice I made.  </li>
            <li>Quick to heat up every time you have to turn it on, and on, and ....</li>
            <li>This means that while I&#x27;m styling, it can easily slide to a much cooler temp without my realizing it.</li>
            <li>the only thing I liked about this&lt;br /&gt;curling iron was the 1 3/4 inch size...don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li>The automatic shut-off is pretty quick though, so</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all right where your hand holds the curling iron</li>
            <li>The spin dial is located right under where you handle the iron and b/c</li>
            <li>First of all, this thing has the controls RIGHT where your fingers push and move when you are twisting and grabbing.</li>
            <li>if you leave it sit for a few minutes be sure to make sure it&#x27;s still hot.  </li>
            <li>product is very gentle to the hair, even at the highest setting.  </li>
            <li>Also seems as you use it, it doesn&#x27;t stay as hot as when you first start.</li>
            <li>I had it on my hair for 20 seconds without it feeling hot to the touch, on the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>did get a cute curl once, but it went away by the time I did the next strand.  </li>
            <li>and I went to use it for the first time</li>
            <li>I recommend Hot Tools.</li>
            <li>Fast shippping and received the item as described ^_^ thank you!</li>
            <li>I just refuse to buy one more only to have it fall apart in 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li>I have to keep checking if the heat has been accidentally moved higher.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>It is supposed to get hot and curl your hair.  </li>
            <li>It got hot for 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Today it didn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>The problems start that the clamp isn&#x27;t very tight and if you have fine hair, it easily slips right out.  </li>
            <li>Ok for long hair.  </li>
            <li>I read similar reviews about the heat adjustment setting being easily bumped and moved.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, like the multiple settings however the dial is easily moved when curling my hair</li>
            <li>After my first one died, I ordered a highly rated one here on Amazon, but it did not have the ceramic coating.  </li>
            <li>I like the size of this iron, and couldn&#x27;t seem to find another reasonably priced one, so I continued to buy this Revlon iron.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast, has a temp control wheel and on/off buttons.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to swivel where it attaches to the unit, but now it doesn&#x27;t swivel much and the cord starts to wrap around the curling iron.</li>
            <li>I use this every week day, while getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>The heat control dial is very flimsy and lose.  </li>
            <li>Revlon really needs to fix the dial problem though.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t so much work to return</li>
            <li>I expected so much more from revlon.</li>
            <li>This is going straight in the trash.</li>
            <li>So I decided to take my chance again on the one I know is gentle to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to get get to temp as fast as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really curl that well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t curl very well.</li>
            <li>I have many other curling irons and have never had a problem with my hair holding a curl until using this product.  </li>
            <li>but it quickly wore off in places and no longer holds the hair well enough to create a curl.</li>
            <li>If my hair would not slide out and the dial would not move it would be a decent curling iron.</li>
            <li>it holds firm to my hair and curls gently without frying and I love the barrel size.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely loose the dial spins freely just by handling the iron.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Whoever designed this newer model surely does not have long hair and also never tried using it before actually producing the product.</li>
            <li>so I can curl faster and get to work, but it slides so easily that I&#x27;m constantly having to adjust it back up.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the dial to change the heat settings is located right</li>
            <li>The spring popped right out that allows the clamp to open and close</li>
            <li>Its right where you hold the iron at, and I am constantly bumping it and turning if off.</li>
            <li>I was buying the item new and it came</li>
            <li>I do not like this new upgraded Revlon curling iron.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the heating level dial is not located in a good place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about curly irons: I want it to clip my hair tight, but be easy to use.</li>
            <li>It would be better if it was in a different spot or more difficult to adjust.</li>
            <li>The dial is on the side right where you hold the device when you use it - this dial is so loose</li>
            <li>And, good luck trying to read the adjustable heat setting through the tiny, tiny little gray window above the on/off buttons.</li>
            <li>I frequently have to re-adjust it.</li>
            <li>Def do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Used it for about a month and my hair got completely fried.  </li>
            <li>hope you are able to disregard some of the negative comments on this product.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely get my moneys worth out of it, even if I only use it for six months to year.</li>
            <li>I had the exact same curling iron for three plus years using it every day until the spring finally gave out.</li>
            <li>But I decided to buy a new one with a bigger barrel.</li>
            <li>It did not heat quickly as advertised and even at the highest setting, my curls were limp.</li>
            <li>First of all, the other reviews are correct that the temperature dial sometimes fluctuates and sometimes the power switch turns off inadvertently when you&#x27;re using the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I barely used it on three sections of hair before it broke.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see the low reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li>My old one lasted about 4 years with daily use, and the ceramic never peeled.  </li>
            <li>This is the most frustrating curling iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li>- I had the same one piror and just needed a new one since I had worn the last one out.</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair (mid back) and wanted a larger diameter curling iron</li>
            <li>Well, after less than two weeks, the thumb protection plastic piece that you touch to open the barrel broke right off.</li>
            <li>My hair is too thick to hold a curl with this big thing, but it does work well for those with fine hair.</li>
            <li>When you &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; your hair though the iron, it&#x27;s not as gentle as some other curling irons.  </li>
            <li>So, I ONLY use it when I really really have the extra time because it takes me twice as long.</li>
            <li>My first one of this particular curling iron was purchased approximately 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>It works good but the on and off buttons and the heat adjustment roller are in bad places, when you curl your hair you bump them and adjust them.</li>

            <li> It is supposed to get hot and curl your hair.  </li>
            <li> It got hot for 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Today it didn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li> The problems start that the clamp isn&#x27;t very tight and if you have fine hair, it easily slips right out.  </li>
            <li> Ok for long hair.  </li>
            <li> I read similar reviews about the heat adjustment setting being easily bumped and moved.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, like the multiple settings however the dial is easily moved when curling my hair</li>
            <li> After my first one died, I ordered a highly rated one here on Amazon, but it did not have the ceramic coating.  </li>
            <li> I like the size of this iron, and couldn&#x27;t seem to find another reasonably priced one, so I continued to buy this Revlon iron.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast, has a temp control wheel and on/off buttons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to swivel where it attaches to the unit, but now it doesn&#x27;t swivel much and the cord starts to wrap around the curling iron.</li>
            <li> I use this every week day, while getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> The heat control dial is very flimsy and lose.  </li>
            <li> Revlon really needs to fix the dial problem though.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so much work to return</li>
            <li> I expected so much more from revlon.</li>
            <li> This is going straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> So I decided to take my chance again on the one I know is gentle to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get get to temp as fast as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really curl that well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl very well.</li>
            <li> I have many other curling irons and have never had a problem with my hair holding a curl until using this product.  </li>
            <li> but it quickly wore off in places and no longer holds the hair well enough to create a curl.</li>
            <li> If my hair would not slide out and the dial would not move it would be a decent curling iron.</li>
            <li> it holds firm to my hair and curls gently without frying and I love the barrel size.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely loose the dial spins freely just by handling the iron.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Whoever designed this newer model surely does not have long hair and also never tried using it before actually producing the product.</li>
            <li> so I can curl faster and get to work, but it slides so easily that I&#x27;m constantly having to adjust it back up.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the dial to change the heat settings is located right</li>
            <li> The spring popped right out that allows the clamp to open and close</li>
            <li> Its right where you hold the iron at, and I am constantly bumping it and turning if off.</li>
            <li> I was buying the item new and it came</li>
            <li> I do not like this new upgraded Revlon curling iron.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the heating level dial is not located in a good place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about curly irons: I want it to clip my hair tight, but be easy to use.</li>
            <li> It would be better if it was in a different spot or more difficult to adjust.</li>
            <li> The dial is on the side right where you hold the device when you use it - this dial is so loose</li>
            <li> And, good luck trying to read the adjustable heat setting through the tiny, tiny little gray window above the on/off buttons.</li>
            <li> I frequently have to re-adjust it.</li>
            <li> Def do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Used it for about a month and my hair got completely fried.  </li>
            <li> hope you are able to disregard some of the negative comments on this product.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely get my moneys worth out of it, even if I only use it for six months to year.</li>
            <li> I had the exact same curling iron for three plus years using it every day until the spring finally gave out.</li>
            <li> But I decided to buy a new one with a bigger barrel.</li>
            <li> It did not heat quickly as advertised and even at the highest setting, my curls were limp.</li>
            <li> First of all, the other reviews are correct that the temperature dial sometimes fluctuates and sometimes the power switch turns off inadvertently when you&#x27;re using the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I barely used it on three sections of hair before it broke.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the low reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> My old one lasted about 4 years with daily use, and the ceramic never peeled.  </li>
            <li> This is the most frustrating curling iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> - I had the same one piror and just needed a new one since I had worn the last one out.</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair (mid back) and wanted a larger diameter curling iron</li>
            <li> Well, after less than two weeks, the thumb protection plastic piece that you touch to open the barrel broke right off.</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick to hold a curl with this big thing, but it does work well for those with fine hair.</li>
            <li> When you &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; your hair though the iron, it&#x27;s not as gentle as some other curling irons.  </li>
            <li> So, I ONLY use it when I really really have the extra time because it takes me twice as long.</li>
            <li> My first one of this particular curling iron was purchased approximately 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It works good but the on and off buttons and the heat adjustment roller are in bad places, when you curl your hair you bump them and adjust them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so flimsy which makes it impossible to get a precise temp setting, not to mention that it is the exact place you want to grab when curling your hair so you constantly change the setting back and forth.</li>
            <li> Also, the on/off button is very soft and easy to push the off button when holding this curling iron thus, cutting off power while trying to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I hardly ever review products</li>
            <li> i am constantly having to turn it back on but overall, its working extremely well</li>
            <li> Given how the dial style knob spins loosely around while you handle the curling iron, it has the feel of a trinket rather than something that can actually functions.</li>
            <li> The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t work long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long, but I hope it lasts!</li>
            <li> problem is that the heat selector dial is so loose that it won&#x27;t stay at the level I set (the hottest for my hair).</li>
            <li> Every time I have bought this item it broke down within months at the same location.</li>
            <li> Great size and was my second revlon curling iron, HOWEVER as other reviews state the placement of the temperature dial is in the WORST place ever... and after using this iron twice I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I would do it but hate to pay postage and make this more of a loss for me!  :</li>
            <li> yes, it heats up, but the heat dial and on/off switch are constantly turned down or turned off due to their location.  </li>
            <li> I guess I see why they&#x27;re harder to find....</li>
            <li> Not much to a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I am learning to work around them, but it is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up like the other ones I had.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t glide through my hair like my other ceramic curling irons do.  </li>
            <li> Would look at other brands before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Other than the flaw of the spin dial</li>
            <li> Very heavy, though, to have to hold up for such a lengthy time.</li>
            <li> the first worked, the 2nd heats up, but its very difficult to turn on, and this one just didn&#x27;t heat up at all.</li>
            <li> Only reason I took away one star is because the dial for the heat setting is in the complete wrong spot and you have to think of where you are putting your hands or you will turn it down/up while curling your hair.</li>
            <li> These features should be further up on the handle like the previous model where I can actually hold the handle without changing the setting or worse, turning it off.  </li>
            <li> The little dial for selecting your heat level (\\&quot;30 Heat Settings\\&quot;) is in exactly the wrong place on the handle, so you end up twisting through all 30 every time you grasp or turn the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> This size curling iron is hard to find and when mine broke, this was the only one in this size i could find.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the location of the on/off button.</li>
            <li> I love the size of it, but I hate the &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; on it.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m using it, I accidentally press the button and turn it off or accidentally turn the heat down.</li>
            <li> But for the price (less than 20 bucks)  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this size at any of the typical retailers</li>
            <li> Cheap and flimsy, by far the worst hair tool I have ever purchased and</li>
            <li> My hair is medium thick, long and layered.</li>
            <li> This curling iron doen&#x27;t even clamp down to hold your hair!  </li>
            <li> I am also now having trouble with the cord.</li>
            <li> I have to stop every few minutes and unravel it from the handle.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money!!!From a disapointed buyer who will never buy REVLON again</li>
            <li> It is by far the absolute worst curling iron that I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing because I am sure it is complicated to return it.  </li>
            <li> Temperature button is terribly placed, and it really doesn&#x27;t heat up enough.</li>
            <li> and I turned it off by mistake at least 3 times just trying to curl the front of my hair, before I gave up and used another iron.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All the setting are a bit confusing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the new product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the quality of this one is terrible as the spring broke on the very first use!!  </li>
            <li> Not a good design.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Yes the on/off button is in an annoying location, sometimes if you are not careful you will accidentally turn it off.  </li>
            <li> The lights are so small it is difficult to see if they are on or off.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s even assuming you had the correct setting to begin with as it is very hard to see the dial.</li>
            <li> I had a tough time finding a 2&amp;#34; barrel though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying, time-consuming and can occur several times within one styling session.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY poor design.</li>
            <li> Worse buy</li>
            <li> This curling iron accomplishes that, but it&#x27;s a frustrating process.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the two that I just bought turn themselves off while in use.</li>
            <li> had to use duct tape to keep the heat dial from spinning to wrong setting....</li>
            <li> Soooo frustrating!</li>
            <li> Sad, b/c</li>
            <li> Heat dial is very difficult to read and does not stay in place during use.  </li>
            <li> The button placement and heat adjuster wheel is in a bad spot.</li>
            <li> So so bad.</li>
            <li> Also the on/off switch is in a bad spot.  </li>
            <li> Bad design.</li>
            <li> Never thought anything from Revlon could be so bad.</li>
            <li> but the placement of the buttons just drive me crazy!</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I knew I hated Revlon curlers, but this was the biggest one I could find at the store.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I was buying it as a gift and it looks horrible.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my neice for a Christmas gift and it is terrible</li>
            <li> What a terrible place to locate the heat</li>
            <li> The design of this curler is awful.  </li>
            <li> Horrible curling iron...</li>
            <li> I agree with the others on the horrible placement of the on/off buttons and the temp setting wheel.</li>
            <li> #34;This is the worst beauty product I have ever gotten.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like the size of this iron, and couldn&#x27;t seem to find another reasonably priced one, so I continued to buy this Revlon iron.  It&#x27;s great until it stops working, and I have consistently replaced it about every 6 months for many years.  Not anymore, I just paid $50 for a different one.  Hoping it lasts longer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about curly irons: I want it to clip my hair tight, but be easy to use. This one is great. It heats up fast, has a temp control wheel and on/off buttons. The sleeve helps too when I travel. Buying another in a different size.</li>
            <li> I was buying the item new and it came package ripped open and plastic cut and just placed in a bag and shipped. I was buying it as a gift and it looks horrible.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my neice for a Christmas gift and it is terrible I need to return it doesnt even heat to a temp to do anything to the hair</li>
            <li> It did not heat quickly as advertised and even at the highest setting, my curls were limp. My hair is medium thick, long and layered. Maybe this would work on thinner hair, but not mine. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this curling iron for years, buying the same one time and time again. Unfortunately, the two that I just bought turn themselves off while in use. It doesn&#x27;t heat up like the other ones I had. I&#x27;m disappointed in the new product. I couldn&#x27;t find any in the stores, so I ordered online this time. Hope they can get back to what it was. Is there a reason they&#x27;re not sold in stores anymore?</li>
            <li> Handle sticks and does not clasp hair well.  Heat dial is very difficult to read and does not stay in place during use.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the most frustrating curling iron I have ever used. The on/off buttons are positioned perfectly so that every time you try to create a curl in your hair,you press the off button. I need to turn the iron on a dozen or more times every time I use it. And, good luck trying to read the adjustable heat setting through the tiny, tiny little gray window above the on/off buttons. Given how the dial style knob spins loosely around while you handle the curling iron, it has the feel of a trinket rather than something that can actually functions. The irons surface worked well for several months. The grip was great for holding hair while twisting but it quickly wore off in places and no longer holds the hair well enough to create a curl. Pros? Quick to heat up every time you have to turn it on, and on, and ....</li>
            <li> This curling iron was purchased to leave at a second location. The size is perfect and I was happy to find it online, as I have been unable to find the 1-3/4&amp;#34; model in retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the heat selector dial is so loose that it won&#x27;t stay at the level I set (the hottest for my hair). This means that while I&#x27;m styling, it can easily slide to a much cooler temp without my realizing it. When I notice my hair isn&#x27;t curling as it should be, I then have to stop, turn the heat selector dial back up and wait for the iron to heat up again. It&#x27;s annoying, time-consuming and can occur several times within one styling session. My original one does not have this problem.</li>
            <li> Big beautiful curls!  Perfect :-)  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m conflicted over this curling iron. I love the size of it, but I hate the &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; on it. It doesn&#x27;t glide through my hair like my other ceramic curling irons do.  But for the price (less than 20 bucks)  I will definitely get my moneys worth out of it, even if I only use it for six months to year. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again. The handle you use to release your hair from hits the off switch almost everytime you curl a strand. EXTREMELY poor design. Revlon should be recalling this item because it never should have hit the market.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the curling iron.  The problems start that the clamp isn&#x27;t very tight and if you have fine hair, it easily slips right out.  Secondly, the dial to change the heat settings is located right where you hand holds the curling iron.  With every twist, the heat setting changes.  It is such a pain to reset the heat settings after each curl.  What a terrible place to locate the heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;It does produce nice curls, but it sure does take effort.  If my hair would not slide out and the dial would not move it would be a decent curling iron.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron ever</li>
            <li> The button placement and heat adjuster wheel is in a bad spot. As I&#x27;m using it, I accidentally press the button and turn it off or accidentally turn the heat down. Also seems as you use it, it doesn&#x27;t stay as hot as when you first start. I am also now having trouble with the cord. It&#x27;s supposed to swivel where it attaches to the unit, but now it doesn&#x27;t swivel much and the cord starts to wrap around the curling iron. I have to stop every few minutes and unravel it from the handle. Would not buy again. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> First of all, this thing has the controls RIGHT where your fingers push and move when you are twisting and grabbing. Notice the picture... there is a DIAL and two buttons. When you are twisting the iron up to your scalp... you end up twisting the dial. This changes the heat setting. If you don&#x27;t accidentally move the dial, you are turning the thing off. Revlon needs to redesign this thing. Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, like the multiple settings however the dial is easily moved when curling my hair and I&#x27;ve found I accidentally turn it off when moving it through my hand.</li>
            <li> It is everything I hoped. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I loved this curling iron when Walmart used to carry it.  This one arrived in the package and everything looked fine. It kept shutting off after every two minutes or so of use.  Then on the third day it quit working altogether. Very disappointing because I am sure it is complicated to return it.  If it had worked well I would have ordered a couple more.</li>
            <li> Was every bit as good as described.</li>
            <li> Just in Time.... My hair has been waiting on an iron with this with. I cannot wait to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. Singleton</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick to hold a curl with this big thing, but it does work well for those with fine hair.</li>
            <li> So so bad. Doesn&#x27;t curl Your hair at all. Worse buy Ever and i do not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I read similar reviews about the heat adjustment setting being easily bumped and moved. I frequently have to re-adjust it. It would be better if it was in a different spot or more difficult to adjust. It&#x27;s a pain.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this.  I have pretty long hair (mid back) and wanted a larger diameter curling iron so I could have waves rather than tighter curls.  This curling iron accomplishes that, but it&#x27;s a frustrating process.  My biggest issue is where the on/off buttons are located as well as the heat level control knob on the side. They&#x27;re all right where your hand holds the curling iron and I&#x27;m finding myself accidentally turning it off without knowing it and then wondering why my hair is not curling (because it was off).  The heat level controller is a scrolling disc on the side and it doesn&#x27;t stay put.  I like to have the setting on the hottest so I can curl faster and get to work, but it slides so easily that I&#x27;m constantly having to adjust it back up. Also, the highest heat level is 30 and I feel it could be hotter. It does warm up quickly and has automatic shut-off. The automatic shut-off is pretty quick though, so if you leave it sit for a few minutes be sure to make sure it&#x27;s still hot.  I really do love the diameter of the barrel and I haven&#x27;t found too many inexpensive curling irons this size. So, for the cost it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li> received curling iron and it turns on, well the light is on, but it does not heat up at all. i can&#x27;t find another curling iron comparable to this one so i will be ordering another one just to see if it was just a defective product.</li>
            <li> I do not like this new upgraded Revlon curling iron.  The dial is on the side right where you hold the device when you use it - this dial is so loose that the setting changes throughout the entire process of curling all my hair.  Also, the on/off button is very soft and easy to push the off button when holding this curling iron thus, cutting off power while trying to do my hair.  Dislike.  These features should be further up on the handle like the previous model where I can actually hold the handle without changing the setting or worse, turning it off.  Whoever designed this newer model surely does not have long hair and also never tried using it before actually producing the product.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to get this size curling iron again.  Heats evenly and quickly and large size is perfect.  Only thing I would improve on is the temp. control.  Love it otherwise!</li>
            <li> yes, it heats up, but the heat dial and on/off switch are constantly turned down or turned off due to their location.  Would look at other brands before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I had the exact same curling iron for three plus years using it every day until the spring finally gave out. I couldn&#x27;t find this size at any of the typical retailers so I ordered it from here. Unfortunately, the quality of this one is terrible as the spring broke on the very first use!!  I barely used it on three sections of hair before it broke. Very disappointed and I will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up enough.  I had it on my hair for 20 seconds without it feeling hot to the touch, on the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;The on/off buttons are in the way and I turned it off by mistake at least 3 times just trying to curl the front of my hair, before I gave up and used another iron.&lt;br /&gt;I did get a cute curl once, but it went away by the time I did the next strand.  I knew I hated Revlon curlers, but this was the biggest one I could find at the store.  Hopefully the store will take the curling iron back unwrapped.</li>
            <li> i love this styling iron for its heat and its size. I haven&#x27;t had it long, but I hope it lasts!</li>
            <li> I have had a Conair curling iron for over 10 years and never had a problem with it. But I decided to buy a new one with a bigger barrel. I use this every week day, while getting ready for work. Well, after less than two weeks, the thumb protection plastic piece that you touch to open the barrel broke right off. Now I can&#x27;t use it without burning my finger. I bought another Conair- which I expect will last another 10 years.</li>
            <li> The little dial for selecting your heat level (\\&quot;30 Heat Settings\\&quot;) is in exactly the wrong place on the handle, so you end up twisting through all 30 every time you grasp or turn the curling iron.  Not a good design.  ALso, the dial is so flimsy that the slightest touch will twist it away from your preferred setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron came with a silicon sleeve for travel storage, so that is one worthwhile thing.  I&#x27;m out to buy another curling iron, though.  Growl.</li>
            <li> Burned my hair.....had to use duct tape to keep the heat dial from spinning to wrong setting....the only thing I liked about this&lt;br /&gt;curling iron was the 1 3/4 inch size...don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> First of all, the other reviews are correct that the temperature dial sometimes fluctuates and sometimes the power switch turns off inadvertently when you&#x27;re using the curling iron.  However, for my long and curly hair, it is the perfect size.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find this Revlon product in stores any longer nor could I find the 1-3/4\\&quot; wand by another manufacturer.  Thank you Amazon for having it among the products that you offer.  My hair looks the best after using this size curing iron.</li>
            <li> The design of this curler is awful.  It also does not curl my hair!  I have many other curling irons and have never had a problem with my hair holding a curl until using this product.  Def do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> The product works well and the size is perfect for my hair, the problem with this curling iron is the location of the heat settings dial.  It is located in such a spot that I constantly change the heat settings while using it.  It&#x27;s a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Horrible curling iron...but then again- you get what you paid for-.....dont waste your money!!!From a disapointed buyer who will never buy REVLON again</li>
            <li> Just bought this locally and have used it once.  I like the size and it worked great on my hair, but the heat temperature dial is too easy to turn and in a location where you hit it ever time you go to roll the iron.  Also the on/off switch is in a bad spot.  Every time I rolled the iron, I turned it off.  Off to find a better curling iron.......</li>
            <li> Good curling iron but needs some changes to the design.  The heat control dial is very flimsy and lose.  The spin dial is located right under where you handle the iron and b/c it&#x27;s extremely loose the dial spins freely just by handling the iron.  (probably why everyone is burning their hair)  I set the iron to the lowest setting and wrapped tape around it to keep it in place.  Other than the flaw of the spin dial it is a good curling iron.  Revlon really needs to fix the dial problem though.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to use this to be able to put more hair onto the roller at one time to make a curl, but it didn&#x27;t work. It just made almost no curl at all. Not the fault of the curling iron, just my conception of what I could accomplish with it. The machine itself worked fine. Very heavy, though, to have to hold up for such a lengthy time.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular but works.  When you &amp;#34;spin&amp;#34; your hair though the iron, it&#x27;s not as gentle as some other curling irons.  I had a tough time finding a 2&amp;#34; barrel though.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling, don&#x27;t get me wrong but the placement of the buttons just drive me crazy! i am constantly having to turn it back on but overall, its working extremely well and i&#x27;m getting the big bouncy curls i&#x27;ve always wanted!</li>
            <li> It died after 3-months</li>
            <li> This curling iron doen&#x27;t even clamp down to hold your hair!  You have to try to manually push it together with out burning your fingers! Cheap and flimsy, by far the worst hair tool I have ever purchased and I have tried a ton! If it wasn&#x27;t so much work to return I would do it but hate to pay postage and make this more of a loss for me!  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim</li>
            <li> Okay, the size is perfect by the hinge hangs all the time so it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to use. You have to literally force it shut every time. So, I ONLY use it when I really really have the extra time because it takes me twice as long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! It just came in the mail and I went to use it for the first time and it broke! The spring popped right out that allows the clamp to open and close that goes around your hair. I haven&#x27;t even touched it to my hair yet. Soooo frustrating! I will be returning and never buying a Revlon curling iron again! I expected so much more from revlon. Highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd curling iron like this that I bought and it hasn&#x27;t worked. the first worked, the 2nd heats up, but its very difficult to turn on, and this one just didn&#x27;t heat up at all. I guess I see why they&#x27;re harder to find.... I recommend Hot Tools. Pay the bucks and get a good one, I love my new one and it works!</li>
            <li> Fast shippping and received the item as described ^_^ thank you!</li>
            <li> Great size and was my second revlon curling iron, HOWEVER as other reviews state the placement of the temperature dial is in the WORST place ever... and after using this iron twice I am returning it.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I hardly ever review products but I just had to write a review on this one. It is by far the absolute worst curling iron that I have ever owned! It doesn&#x27;t even curl my fine hair, so maybe we should just call this a heating iron. I can&#x27;t even get a wave or volume out of it. The second problem I have with it is the temperature dial. It&#x27;s so flimsy which makes it impossible to get a precise temp setting, not to mention that it is the exact place you want to grab when curling your hair so you constantly change the setting back and forth. That&#x27;s even assuming you had the correct setting to begin with as it is very hard to see the dial. This is going straight in the trash. The upside is that I&#x27;ll keep the rubber cap and put it on my next curling iron. Do not waste your money on this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I bought this for loose, wavy curls (which this does flawlessly), and it does was what it&#x27;s supposed to for the price. But I took off the clamp, and it fell apart immediately</li>
            <li> Works great - I had the same one piror and just needed a new one since I had worn the last one out.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it she got it for Christmas and was very pleased with the size and the temp it would hold.</li>
            <li> I have bought this item several times because I am a creature of habit. When it works, it is a great curling iron. With the exception of the heat control. The problem is, it doesn&#x27;t work long. Every time I have bought this item it broke down within months at the same location. The on/off switch inevitably falls through the curling iron. You turn it on and it starts to fall to pieces. I&#x27;m researching now trying to find a replacement to this one. As I said, when it works, it does a great job on my hair that others don&#x27;t. I just refuse to buy one more only to have it fall apart in 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> My first one of this particular curling iron was purchased approximately 5 years ago.  When it stopped working I had to order another.  The only complaint I have is that the heating level dial is not located in a good place.  I have to keep checking if the heat has been accidentally moved higher.</li>
            <li> It is a good curling iron for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this item for my sister &amp; she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I agree with the others on the horrible placement of the on/off buttons and the temp setting wheel. How did this issue pass by the makers? Maybe they should do a market research before releasing? I like that it holds firm to my hair and curls gently without frying and I love the barrel size. I hope I can eventually figure out how to avoid the buttons on the handle. I also hope the buttons don&#x27;t sink inside like a handful of others have experienced.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I was able to deal with my hand hitting the off button as others warned about but then it just stopped working after about 5 months.</li>
            <li> Love the size and love the way this works. My only complaint is the location of the on/off button. Its right where you hold the iron at, and I am constantly bumping it and turning if off. I spend more time trying not to hit the on/off switch than I do using the iron. Bad design. Sad, b/c I would love the product if it were not for that.</li>
            <li> This is my second Revlon Perfect Heat Tourmaline Ceramic.  I was surprised to see the low reviews for this product.  After my first one died, I ordered a highly rated one here on Amazon, but it did not have the ceramic coating.  Big mistake.  Used it for about a month and my hair got completely fried.  So I decided to take my chance again on the one I know is gentle to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very gentle to the hair, even at the highest setting.  My old one lasted about 4 years with daily use, and the ceramic never peeled.  Yes the on/off button is in an annoying location, sometimes if you are not careful you will accidentally turn it off.  Also happens with the heat setting.  But if you keep that in mind, you will get better at avoiding the on/off and heat dial while styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you are able to disregard some of the negative comments on this product.  It works great and above all, doesn&#x27;t damage or crinkle hair like so many curling irons do.</li>
            <li> Works great, love the many different levels of heat and that it will shut off on its own if you forget to do it yourself, and the large size barrel. Only reason I took away one star is because the dial for the heat setting is in the complete wrong spot and you have to think of where you are putting your hands or you will turn it down/up while curling your hair.</li>
            <li> I got this to my wife. That&#x27;s how she reviewed it: &amp;#34;This is the worst beauty product I have ever gotten.There&#x27;s a gap between the barrel and the top cap that rips your hair out. Temperature button is terribly placed, and it really doesn&#x27;t heat up enough. Never thought anything from Revlon could be so bad. Very low quality. Do not recommend!.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this Curling Iron it makes perfect curls and I notice that my curls stay longer and I got lots of compliments and asked what I was using to get these kind of curls!!!  Such a wise choice I made.  Thanks</li>
            <li> All the setting are a bit confusing.  The lights are so small it is difficult to see if they are on or off.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to get get to temp as fast as advertised.  Ok for long hair.  Works better than most doesn&#x27;t make hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really curl that well. Takes a fair bit to warm up.</li>
            <li> Not much to a curling iron.  It is supposed to get hot and curl your hair.  It got hot for 6 months.  Today it didn&#x27;t get hot.  End of story.</li>
            <li> This size curling iron is hard to find and when mine broke, this was the only one in this size i could find. It works good but the on and off buttons and the heat adjustment roller are in bad places, when you curl your hair you bump them and adjust them. I am learning to work around them, but it is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl very well.</li>
