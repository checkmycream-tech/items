            <li>Good stuff.</li>

            <li>LOL :)</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was not all that impressed.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is the best hair product ever!.</li>
            <li>I love the product its self, but its way too overpriced.</li>
            <li>and she said hers is doing much better.</li>
            <li>I use both of the conditioners and love them both.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love these two.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair with a GREAT texture, REALLY soft and smells</li>
            <li>I have purchased 4 jars since my original review.   </li>
            <li>I just purchased this for my sister who was having dry, fly away hair</li>
            <li>I have to admit, initially the results were not too great, but with continuous use, I feel that my hair is retaining its moisture more than before, I no longer have split ends even if I use flat iron on my hair almost 2-3 times in a week (of course I do use CHI 44 iron guard).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now married to it, ordering it in batches.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love this product line for my dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>I was fine with that but have always desired to go back to blond.</li>
            <li>Since Mega Strength said for hair prone to breakage, which was the whole reason I went in search of a treatment, I got it.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve used it and my hair feels so soft and healthy again.</li>
            <li>it really repairs your hair and keeps it soft.  </li>
            <li>This deep treatment is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>Put the right picture up because there is a big difference!!!</li>
            <li>I also recommend it for any type of hair natural or relaxed</li>
            <li>, my hair is so soft</li>
            <li>I recently did and wow, did my hair not like it!</li>
            <li>I never expected just two times using it would have the effect it has.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been extremely healthy but it&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li>so more easily broken than thicker hair strands.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry scalp too, and my hair stays as if I have washed them now for almost 3 days depending on the weather.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly-wavy and  use flat iron frequently.</li>
            <li>This works real well especially on dry brittle hair.</li>

            <li> I have normal to dry hair, black in color</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle scent, not like other conditioners that smell so strong.</li>
            <li> It works well at keeping my mid-length hair soft and manageable even when it&#x27;s been dried out by the sun.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this as long as my hair is blond or being dyed!</li>

            <li> My hair is really difficult and I am always seeking for products to help me manage it and this one really helps.</li>

            <li> Works awful for thin hair making it thinner looking yet and dirty at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It actually stinks!</li>

            <li> I love the product its self, but its way too overpriced. Don&#x27;t recommend this if your not in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I have been dark haired since I was 15 years old. I was fine with that but have always desired to go back to blond. I recently did and wow, did my hair not like it! It was breaking, fizzy, and just plain damaged. I was either going with Mega Strength or Mega Moisture. Since Mega Strength said for hair prone to breakage, which was the whole reason I went in search of a treatment, I got it. The first time I used it, I was not all that impressed. My hair was easier to brush through but that was about it. This is the second time I&#x27;ve used it and my hair feels so soft and healthy again. My hair has always been extremely healthy but it&#x27;s thin (I have a ton of hair but it&#x27;s thin) so more easily broken than thicker hair strands.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to help with breakage and bring your hair back to health, this is it! I never expected just two times using it would have the effect it has. I will continue to buy this as long as my hair is blond or being dyed!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve found this L&#x27;Oreal treatment product, I am not satisfied with anything else.  It works well at keeping my mid-length hair soft and manageable even when it&#x27;s been dried out by the sun.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and we use this product it&#x27;s great. I come from NY buy you can&#x27;t find it here in SD</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It does a great job. I just purchased this for my sister who was having dry, fly away hair and she said hers is doing much better.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair, and randomly discovered this at a local beauty supply store. I&#x27;m now married to it, ordering it in batches. When I use it, people comment- it really repairs your hair and keeps it soft.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This works real well especially on dry brittle hair. I also recommend it for any type of hair natural or relaxed etc  Use it as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller &amp; product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Found this in shop and decided to give it a try. My hair is really difficult and I am always seeking for products to help me manage it and this one really helps.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is the best hair product ever!. Will never use anything else</li>
            <li> The picture is not the same thing I got. The picture shows the conditioner that&#x27;s in the orangish jar that I had b 4 &amp; it smells like fruit! The one they sent me is not the same &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell like fruit at all.. It actually stinks! Put the right picture up because there is a big difference!!!</li>
            <li> I just had a baby and my hair falls out like crazy! This has been my saving grace. No tangles, no dryness. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this product line for my dry curly hair. I use both of the conditioners and love them both.</li>
            <li> Just like whatever conditioner. Works awful for thin hair making it thinner looking yet and dirty at the end of the day. Last try for commercial products. Go back to argan oil after shampooing. This one goes to the garbage.</li>
            <li> It´s a GREAT product.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair with a GREAT texture, REALLY soft and smells SO SO SO good... LOL :)</li>
            <li> this work great, my hair is so soft</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry hair, black in color and I am Asian, 26 years of age. My hair is curly-wavy and  use flat iron frequently. I had damaged my hair due to repeated hair straightening treatments. I have been using Loreal&#x27;s Nature Therapy Mega Strength Fortifying Shampoo and cream together for about a year now and I absolutely love these two. I have to admit, initially the results were not too great, but with continuous use, I feel that my hair is retaining its moisture more than before, I no longer have split ends even if I use flat iron on my hair almost 2-3 times in a week (of course I do use CHI 44 iron guard). But every time I shampoo, my hair gets softer, and gives this silky feeling which I have never had in a lot of other Loreal products.I have normal to dry scalp too, and my hair stays as if I have washed them now for almost 3 days depending on the weather. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a hard time managing their hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. You know when you color your hair at home and included in the package is a small tube of conditioner that makes you hair feel so silky? This deep treatment is just as good if not better. I absolutely love it. My hair was feeling dry and brittle on the ends and now its so silky and manageable. I have tried numerous conditioners and treatments and nothing compares to this one. It has a very subtle scent, not like other conditioners that smell so strong. After reading the reviews I decided to give it try. Update....I have purchased 4 jars since my original review.   I love it!</li>
