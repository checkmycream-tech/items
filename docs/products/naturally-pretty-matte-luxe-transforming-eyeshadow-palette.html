            <li>(Do your own Research and Shop Around for Best price!)    </li>
            <li>The best and highest quality I have ever own.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like this pallet but the color pay off isn&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li>I like all eyeshadows but a good matte palette</li>
            <li>is good for every makeup collection.</li>
            <li>is a good idea</li>

            <li>The colors are beautiful and I love the fact that I can turn a shade into my liner.  </li>
            <li>Love this palette!</li>
            <li>I am fighting the switch to matte but at 56, I think most will agree it&#x27;s time!</li>
            <li>I sure like that!</li>
            <li>I wish I had paid attention to a popular YouTuber who tried it and didn&#x27;t care for it.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Love these It Cosmetics eye shadows.</li>
            <li>My favorite palette</li>
            <li>The darker colors were workable, but there were just too many lighter shades in the palette that I would have to struggle with</li>
            <li>I did love how the eyeshadows are formulated with peptides, collagen, etc.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!    </li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>This &#x60;Naturally Pretty Vol. 1 Matte Luxe Transforming Eyeshadow Palette&#x27; was my very first purchase from the IT Cosmetics line of beauty aids; a purchase that I have come to love!    </li>
            <li>The colors are smooth, high quality pigments that blend nicely.</li>
            <li>I feel that his palette is more suitable for people with fair to olive skin tones or for people who are looking for a more subtle look - just my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Love my new eye palette!!!</li>
            <li>I love this so pretty .</li>
            <li>I read reviews, watch YouTube tutorials and was really excited to get it.  </li>
            <li>I love my mattes and this whole concept with the transforming shade</li>
            <li>IT Cosmetics has given us a &#x60;Matte&#x27; Eyeshadow collection that offers beautiful matte colors that are not drying or chalky; which I attribute to the formulation containing Peptides, Collagen, Silk and Antioxidants - all of which seem to have added a &#x60;drop&#x27; of &#x60;satin&#x27; to each color (without the &#x60;shimmer&#x27; found in too many other so-called matte shadows).  </li>
            <li>The pretty silver outer packaging with a silver ribbon adds to the experience of feeling you are part of something special (nice touch IT Cosmetics!); inside you find an equally tasteful velour-like palette Case with a shiny gold interior; containing 14 &#x60;matte&#x27; shades and 1 pearlescent &#x60;transforming&#x27; shade; which allows you to add a touch of &#x60;luster&#x27; to any of the already pretty matte colors.    </li>
            <li>Sure the colors were pretty and very &#x60;soft&#x27; in appearance; but worthy of the accolades I had been reading for months...?    </li>
            <li>(price alone, is reason for 4 stars; although &#x27;worth it&#x27;, still a &#x27;consideration&#x27; in purchasing).    </li>
            <li>very soft and fine.</li>
            <li>This palette offers smooth, buildable, blendable shades of color for every look.    </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Naturally Pretty Vol 2 for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>This made this purchase that much sweeter!</li>
            <li>I would definitely be interested.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package I was so excited with the anticipation; I had researched IT Cosmetics for some time before finally deciding upon the IT Cosmetics \\&quot;Naturally Pretty\\&quot; Matte Eyeshadow Palette as my first &#x60;investment&#x27; from this company that promotes &#x60;Clinically proven&#x27; - &#x60;Skin Loving&#x27; - &#x60;Problem Solutions&#x27; in their beauty related products; after all, the list price of $42.00 is nothing to brush off lightly</li>
            <li>I found that the color payoff is not really that great, especially for darker complexions.  </li>
            <li>After more than a year using this palette I can say without reservation this is a MUST-HAVE palette for me; clearly whether You are looking for that classy business-look, a &#x60;natural&#x27; clean appearance, or a tasteful &#x60;ageless&#x27; look -</li>
            <li>The shadows are very well pigmented.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone who wants an all-inclusive palette to achieve any and all looks, whether matte or pearl, with shadows or liners.</li>
            <li>and my expectations were quite high</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the colors in the entire palate</li>
            <li>, I wish there were a few more lighter shades for contrast.  </li>
            <li>But overall well worth the money</li>
            <li>and free of parabens and other harmful chemicals though.  </li>
            <li>Am I the only one that agonizes over a large palette like this?</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and not in your face.</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants a naturally pretty look using skin-loving ingredients, and who wants airbrushed eye shadow application without tugging on the delicate eyelid area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this point I realized I need the extra pigmentation that It Cosmetics offers.</li>
            <li>Use the smudger/no-tug side for naturally lining above or below the lash line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the colors are matte but for you that want a little sparkle, on the bottom right corner is a shadow that you put over the matte and it gives you that sparkly look.</li>
            <li>Use the large, fluffy brush side for allover lid and crease application.</li>

            <li> I hate frosted eye shadows. I just want plain matte. All the colors are matte but for you that want a little sparkle, on the bottom right corner is a shadow that you put over the matte and it gives you that sparkly look. I love the colors. They&#x27;re soft and not in your face. You don&#x27;t have to rub the brush over the colors. A tap will do. You can also build the color if you wish. If never has fraded during the day and it has never smeared. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes either and I&#x27;m a contact wearer.  When this is gone, yes I will definitely buy it again. In fact this has led me to try the other IT cosmetics and they&#x27;re all winners.</li>
            <li> Love my new eye palette!!! The colors are beautiful!!! A must get!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this palette! The colors are smooth, high quality pigments that blend nicely. And the addition of the shimmer to transform the matte to pearl is great. Also, the magnetic case is convenient</li>
            <li> Love all the colors. The case is neat as well.</li>
            <li> This &#x60;Naturally Pretty Vol. 1 Matte Luxe Transforming Eyeshadow Palette&#x27; was my very first purchase from the IT Cosmetics line of beauty aids; a purchase that I have come to love!    When I first opened the package I was so excited with the anticipation; I had researched IT Cosmetics for some time before finally deciding upon the IT Cosmetics \\&quot;Naturally Pretty\\&quot; Matte Eyeshadow Palette as my first &#x60;investment&#x27; from this company that promotes &#x60;Clinically proven&#x27; - &#x60;Skin Loving&#x27; - &#x60;Problem Solutions&#x27; in their beauty related products; after all, the list price of $42.00 is nothing to brush off lightly and my expectations were quite high (price alone, is reason for 4 stars; although &#x27;worth it&#x27;, still a &#x27;consideration&#x27; in purchasing).    I was not disappointed!    The pretty silver outer packaging with a silver ribbon adds to the experience of feeling you are part of something special (nice touch IT Cosmetics!); inside you find an equally tasteful velour-like palette Case with a shiny gold interior; containing 14 &#x60;matte&#x27; shades and 1 pearlescent &#x60;transforming&#x27; shade; which allows you to add a touch of &#x60;luster&#x27; to any of the already pretty matte colors.

ENJOY!  ;)</li>
            <li> Am I the only one that agonizes over a large palette like this? I am fighting the switch to matte but at 56, I think most will agree it&#x27;s time! It came in last Thursday and I have worn it everyday since. I know there&#x27;s a learning curve but so far I&#x27;m happy. I&#x27;m switching all makeup from Clinique to It Cosmetics. At this point I realized I need the extra pigmentation that It Cosmetics offers. Like Clinique, there are no added perfumes or irritants. The texture of this powder o&lt;br /&gt;Is very soft and fine. Much LESS fallout than Clinique. I sure like that!</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time. I got my item before the expected delivery date. I absolutely LOVE this product. The shadows are very well pigmented. Awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> The best and highest quality I have ever own.  I use it on my cheeks as well.</li>
            <li> A perfect matte palette. For those of you who don&#x27;t like shimmer this is the palette for you! I like all eyeshadows but a good matte palette is good for every makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the colors in the entire palate</li>
            <li> Love these It Cosmetics eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Matte Luxe Transforming Eyeshadow Palette contains 14 eye shadows that are all matte, but can transform into pearl shades with the tap of a brush. This includes flattering shades I need to take me from day to night, no matter what the occasion. These shadows are formulated with peptides, collagen, silk, and antioxidants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wants an all-inclusive palette to achieve any and all looks, whether matte or pearl, with shadows or liners., this us the kit for you. Anyone who wants a naturally pretty look using skin-loving ingredients, and who wants airbrushed eye shadow application without tugging on the delicate eyelid area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These shadows diffuse the look of lines and wrinkles on eyes and lids. The matte pigment glides over my lids to create a perfect eye look. These shades are antiaging, they contain hydrating ingredients, including hydrolyzed collagen, acai, green tea, and vitamins A, C, and E. The No-Tug Heavenly Luxe Dual Shadow Brush means no tugging or pulling on delicate eyelid skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These can be worn wet or dry, as shadows or liners. Colors can be worn alone or mixed together. To transform any matte shade into a shimmery pearl shade, dip your brush into the matte shade, tap your brush into Transforming Pearl shadow, and apply. Use the large, fluffy brush side for allover lid and crease application. Use the smudger/no-tug side for naturally lining above or below the lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-19-14</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this pallet but the color pay off isn&#x27;t that great.  I wouldn&#x27;t say all of these shades are truly matte either. Some of them do have shimmer. I love my mattes and this whole concept with the transforming shade is a good idea but this pallet just isn&#x27;t one I reach for everyday.</li>
            <li> good color choices with good coverage, I wish there were a few more lighter shades for contrast.  But overall well worth the money</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and I love the fact that I can turn a shade into my liner.  I do not have raccoon eyes by the end of the day.  I recommend to buys, get the IT application brushes, they are terrific!  I also purchased the Naturally Pretty Vol 2 for my daughter.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
            <li> This Product is AMAZING!! Loved the colors and the pigmentation! Arrived in tact and seller personally thanked me for the purchase!! This made this purchase that much sweeter!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this so pretty . may be every one like this item thank you.</li>
            <li> GET  IT! My favorite palette</li>
            <li> I bought this on the It Cosmetics website.  I read reviews, watch YouTube tutorials and was really excited to get it.  I wish I had paid attention to a popular YouTuber who tried it and didn&#x27;t care for it.  I found that the color payoff is not really that great, especially for darker complexions.  The colors are very pretty but very muted, a bit powdery and show up very faintly on my medium brown skin.  I tried two different primers, also tried applying them wet.  The darker colors were workable, but there were just too many lighter shades in the palette that I would have to struggle with so I decided not to keep it  I tried a few of the lighter shades and they colors looked almost the same on my skin.  I feel that his palette is more suitable for people with fair to olive skin tones or for people who are looking for a more subtle look - just my opinion.  I did love how the eyeshadows are formulated with peptides, collagen, etc. and free of parabens and other harmful chemicals though.  If they ever come out with a palette containing bolder, richer colors I would definitely be interested.</li>
            <li> I adore this palette! All the colors are super pigmented and blend beautifully.</li>
