            <li>Skin looks more alive and you don&#x27;t have to use every day for results.</li>

            <li>What I like is that it is thicker than most so when it&#x27;s time to peel - it actually peels!  </li>

            <li>This product did what most reviewers said it would after only my first use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice anything fantastic happening to my skin although it seemed to feel a little better.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to remove, particularly if I apply it to clean skin and let it dry all the way (10-20 minutes).</li>

            <li> First time was afraid to leave it on to long.</li>
            <li> Probably not worth the money</li>
            <li> pulls at skin, which feels odd for a repair type product.  </li>
            <li> Less wrinkles?  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> But I will say I see no more difference than when I use a cheaper store bought product.</li>
            <li> the substance is really thick and does not smooth on.  </li>
            <li> and it removes small wrinkles and dirt</li>
            <li> VERY HARSH AND DAMAGING TO YOUR SKIN!</li>

            <li> I is very easy to use and gives great results,  Skin looks more alive and you don&#x27;t have to use every day for results.</li>

            <li> pulls at skin, which feels odd for a repair type product.  kind of hard to get off.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and it is a good peel for the skin.  Takes about 35 to 40 minutes to completely dry so you can peel off. Does peel off nicely and skin is vibrant and soft.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT ! DO NOT USE. VERY HARSH AND DAMAGING TO YOUR SKIN!</li>
            <li> you will like it , feel really good after use it , it is a great product , your face will look younger after use</li>
            <li> Unbelievable. This peel exceeds expectations. I&#x27;m 71, no wrinkles except for marionette lines around mouth which this product helps to diminish. Lasting effects, smooth and clear skin. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Your face feels great after use. It doesn&#x27;t give any visible results on my face but it might on a big pore face.</li>
            <li> I use this weekly. My skin feels very soft afterward. But I will say I see no more difference than when I use a cheaper store bought product.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin feel smooth I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much on peels so I admit I haven&#x27;t used that many, although I like this one well enough.  What I like is that it is thicker than most so when it&#x27;s time to peel - it actually peels!  I&#x27;ve had some that are thinner and the minute I try to peel they are coming apart so I have to give up and wash them off.  This one is much better!  Less wrinkles?  Well I kind of doubt it but definitely smoother feeling skin.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and somewhat lazy about beauty products. I will try lotions and potions as long as they are easy to use and take very little time. For me, this product was a great find-- it really works and does not require much time or effort. I have used this peel over a decade now (somewhere between 1x a week and 1x a month). It is easy to apply-- I just smooth it on with my fingers. I use it on both my face and neck. It is also easy to remove, particularly if I apply it to clean skin and let it dry all the way (10-20 minutes). If it dries all the way out, I can peel it away from my skin-- that part is a little uncomfortable in sensitive areas, like near the eyes. In areas that do not dry all the way out, the mask can be rubbed off. The results are immediately apparent. It tightens and smooths leaving younger-looking skin. When I haven&#x27;t used it for a while, I notice more dramatic improvements. My husband is not the type to otherwise pay any attention to this sort of stuff, but I got him to try it after he saw how well it worked for me, and he now uses it too. A friend we hadn&#x27;t seen in years came to visit us shortly after my husband started using the peel, and I remember our friend saying that he couldn&#x27;t figure out how my husband had aged backwards. I have been recommending this to friends and family-- it really works.</li>
            <li> it was too harsh for me,but my friend liked it very much</li>
            <li> Makes face feel silky</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product, have used it for a long time</li>
            <li> better than any 100 dol facial, and i&#x27;ve had ton of those...  not any more though.  this is incredibly effective peel off mask.  put on thick layer (important), wait 30 min, peel it off.  not only great for oily skin but just maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;many, many compliments.  people think i just had a facial...  bottle has about 5 peels in it.  that&#x27;s $3/per peel!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never be without it.</li>
            <li> I have used the peel twice. First time was afraid to leave it on to long. Second time left it on for about 1 1/2 mins. Had some scabing but not bad at all. Will continue using it.</li>
            <li> fast delivery....thanx*****</li>
            <li> I do love it but its too expensive for the amount received in the bottle.the bottle is too small.Thanks again</li>
            <li> Bought this on an airline years ago and hardly used it, I loved it SO MUCH.  Ran out and thought I&#x27;dgive it a whirl to find it on the internet and here it is.  FAVULOUS PRODUCT, especially before micro dermabrasion.</li>
            <li> Yaouch, it works but oh my gosh-! the pain. It may pull off the dead cells, but it pulls of the fine hairs that grow on your face. I ended up wetting the mask and almost myself, to get it all off. I give it 3 stars because of the pain, I give it five stars because it does what it says it will do. At first with thought I will not use this again, but it is good, so I either shave my face or just won&#x27;t peel it off my face.</li>
            <li> The first time I put this on I thought I had mistaken bottle with my Fabri-tac glue! It smells the same....&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find this product so special at all and the price is low but the bottle is really small too. I didn&#x27;t see any amazing results on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> the substance is really thick and does not smooth on.  You have to blot it on your face.  As for results I have used it about 3 or 4 times and not really seeing any results. The company was great. The first bottle was damaged in US post office and they replaced it no questions and right away.</li>
            <li> I have been using Swiss peel for years &amp; I love it. It has exceeded my expectations. My skin looks good, even my hands &amp; chest</li>
            <li> 51 yrs old. This product did what most reviewers said it would after only my first use. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> he product was ok but the bottle is too small, serving for a few applications</li>
            <li> Like this product, but use it on front head and nose not on cheeks. On cheeks, it hurts to rejove it.</li>
            <li> A nice inexpensive alternative to salon facial/peel...........I can do it at home &amp; afford to use it every week.</li>
            <li> I put this on my skin and let it stay for a while and it removes small wrinkles and dirt it is a great product love it</li>
            <li> nothing special about this product, just ok; all this commotion about its greatness is probably from people who never used good products</li>
            <li> Best product for the money and without a professional or paying lots of money. I really really love this product</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft, but I wanted a peel that actually peeled off, removing a dead layer of skin with it. This one I have to remove with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li> Really like this peel, just don&#x27;t put it on to thick, and if you do just wet your fingers and pull on it lightly and it will come off...it leaves the skin felling fresh and dewy, Will buy again !!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product maybe a month ago and have used it three times and I love it. I just ordered another bottle becuase I don&#x27;t want to run out. I don&#x27;t know if everyone will like it but I do. It does what it is supposed to do and more in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would and have purchased again and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I just re-ordered another couple bottles of Swiss Peel. I love this product!!! It leaves your face feeling refreshed and smooth. I use this once a week and it has kept my skin with that youthful look.  I highly recommend you try this product!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007P6MPMS Ultimate Swiss Peel]]</li>
