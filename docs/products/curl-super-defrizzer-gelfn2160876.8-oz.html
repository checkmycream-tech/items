            <li>Thanks for mailing it so quickly.</li>
            <li>When you smooth this product through damp hair, it leaves soft and defined curls.</li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>Helped define the curls so much.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (who likes to flat iron her hair straight), used it on my toddler&#x27;s super tight coily curls and used it on my own looser curl</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair, I only really notice it when I first pour into my hands.</li>
            <li>I had been hunting for the right gel to replace a discontinued one for several years.  </li>

            <li> Love the feeling...not too heavy or thick.  </li>
            <li> its is so difficult finding product that our curly, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t know what texture it wants to be on any given day&amp;#34; will respond to positively.</li>
            <li> I have typical naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time instead of gel.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t thick and gloppy like most gels, which are usually sticky or stiff when dry.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair too.</li>
            <li> I use this on my soaking wet hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner weren&#x27;t horrible, but weren&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Still holds after getting wet.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that will tame my frizzy, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it has lasted a while too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry, it frizzes, and it&#x27;s hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I have thick, tight, corkscrew curly hair.</li>
            <li> Worst yet, from my 2 daughters to my toddler son, it is difficult to find a product that compliments ALL of our hair as we all have naturally curly hair but of varying textures.</li>
            <li> The gel &#x27;melts&#x27; into your hair and then gives it a really weird stringy texture, and that&#x27;s how it dries.</li>
            <li> and it was quite a disappointment.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the feeling...not too heavy or thick.  Just right.  Been using Matrix Curl.Life and they have discontinued that product and replaced it with Total Results for Curls.  Thank goodness.</li>
            <li> Tames the curly girls top and prevents the Frizz even in Florida&#x27;s August humidity!</li>
            <li> I have typical naturally curly hair. It&#x27;s dry, it frizzes, and it&#x27;s hard to manage. As I have gotten older, I have learned that using better quality products really does make a difference in the overall health and manageability of my hair. This product may be a bit pricy, but it is worth every penny! A little goes a long way, so it has lasted a while too. I love it! Paired with the Total Results shampoo, conditioner, and a leave in smoothing cream and I have a winning combination. My beautician could really tell a difference too and has started carrying this product in her salon because she was so impressed with my results.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and I love it. It keeps my hair style for several days, with a dime size of gel each morning. I use it on dry hair too. It&#x27;s absolutely not greasy and hold well in a natural, not stiff kind of way!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me the last time I was at the salon. My hair can be frizzy in the humidity but not with this gel. It&#x27;s wonderful &amp; has a nice scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love this hair gel.  Its not sticky and really brings out the curls and is very easy to style using.</li>
            <li> Gives great body to limp hair, and definately helps with frizz. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have thick, tight, corkscrew curly hair. I bought the Total Results Curl trio and it was quite a disappointment. I have usually found that products made for curly hair don&#x27;t work in my hair and should have know better, but tried it out anyway. The shampoo and conditioner weren&#x27;t horrible, but weren&#x27;t great. The gel I stopped using after three or four days. The gel &#x27;melts&#x27; into your hair and then gives it a really weird stringy texture, and that&#x27;s how it dries. It made my hair kind of poofy-frizzy too. Dislike. The shampoo and conditioner do make your hair soft, but I found after repeated use it somehow takes the curl out of your hair and leaves it straightish-poofy. Also, dislike.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time instead of gel.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff.</li>
            <li> I  like this gel,it really helps my hair curl without  weighing it down. it&#x27;s very clean feeling. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!  It is the only thing that will tame my frizzy, curly hair.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Being of mixed ethnicity, and having kids with the same...its is so difficult finding product that our curly, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t know what texture it wants to be on any given day&amp;#34; will respond to positively. Worst yet, from my 2 daughters to my toddler son, it is difficult to find a product that compliments ALL of our hair as we all have naturally curly hair but of varying textures. Ugh!!! This product is versatile for sure. I have used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (who likes to flat iron her hair straight), used it on my toddler&#x27;s super tight coily curls and used it on my own looser curl and it does the trick. Don&#x27;t feel a real crunch like some other products leave either. Has a funky alcohol smell but it doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair, I only really notice it when I first pour into my hands. I am a happy camper with this product.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my hairdresser works great on my curly hair</li>
            <li> Love this hair gell. I have naturally curly hair and need something with great hold and this does the job without getting crispy:)</li>
            <li> Great product for me. I have fine curly hair. It&#x27;s light and adds fullness plus seems to really accentuate my curl.</li>
            <li> keeps my fly always down. Not greasy. Still holds after getting wet. Fresh scent not girly scent.</li>
            <li> I love this gel.  It makes nice big soft curls.  I had been hunting for the right gel to replace a discontinued one for several years.  So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair. I use this product daily using a blow dryer with a diffuser.  It makes my hair soft and manageable, plus it helps to boost the curl.  Does not dry out the hair and it is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Did not defrizz my hair, therefore I would not order it again.  I would attempt to fid a replacement product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this gel to define my fine-hair curls! Not heavy or greasy and the price here is amazing! (This product costs waaaay more at the hair salon). The clear &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; is not sticky but has a light-weight quality to it that is easy to distribute throughout damp hair. Awesome!</li>
            <li> When I had my hair done last time this is what the girl used so I ordered it. Yes, it did meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Just right for my use. thank you</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever for frizz control but does not weigh the hair down. I use this every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I had used this product in the past and love it.  It&#x27;s a great product for curly hair when wearing it natural.  Thanks for mailing it so quickly.</li>
            <li> Liked the smell and how it seemed to melt into my hair. Didn&#x27;t curl my hair as well as it should for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I use this on my soaking wet hair and let it air dry. It keeps my curls soft and frizz free for at least 2 days!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> Love it. Helps with the frizz on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I have very frizzy, thick hair.  Helped define the curls so much.</li>
            <li> This gel is excellent for curly hair! It isn&#x27;t thick and gloppy like most gels, which are usually sticky or stiff when dry. When you smooth this product through damp hair, it leaves soft and defined curls. Plus, it has a lovely scent.</li>
