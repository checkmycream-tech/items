            <li>I and others have found it to be very effective.</li>

            <li>Amazing product !</li>
            <li>Great Product and good price</li>
            <li>I love it the best I have every tried</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell like chocolate mint to me which is pleasant but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair.</li>
            <li>Does not have a pleasant order.</li>
            <li>surprising the amount of conditioner they expect you to use.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase, will keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>and I continue to see good results from using this 3 part system for my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Nioxin is a good product.  </li>
            <li>and my hair seemed to be in good condition (except for the thinning.)I</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This product helps keep my hair in good condition</li>
            <li>it works good</li>
            <li>The shampoo is good, conditio was not as good as others, so don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>My head feels so good from the tingling of the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>However, my  hair feels really good with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s helping my thinning issues at all--it does a good job of stripping oils and buildup</li>
            <li>Good product and price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is particularly good for colored hair</li>
            <li>product good, helps decrease hair falling out.</li>
            <li>it does a really good job of cleaning my scalp and keeping the flaky patch I&#x27;ve had seen childhood at bay.  </li>
            <li>Great product that really works and a great price!</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>He is very pleased and so am I.</li>
            <li>Great treatment, leaves your hair very clean</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair beautiful and shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li>, it gets better!</li>
            <li>Lovely mint smell, too!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>so I gave it a try a couple of months ago and after just the first wash was impressed.</li>
            <li>I know the directions say you need to use for more than 30 days or so before seeing results, so I am still hopeful!</li>
            <li>My hair has an amazing shine even though this system is drying.  </li>
            <li>The difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>It lathers well (not sulfate free) and my hair feels great after use.</li>
            <li>then this amazing &amp;#34;scalp therapy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>will continue to use, nice improvement to my hair</li>
            <li>When I saw this helpful product on Amazon, I was delighted to see the much better price.</li>
            <li>Ive used system 3 before and really liked it</li>
            <li>I washed my own hair in the shower and it was so tangled,</li>
            <li>washing my own hair is something that I never ever do myself so for me it was a nightmare to have to untangle my hair.</li>
            <li>I tried and liked.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely giving a tingling, minty sensation as you massage it into your scalp.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has a really nice soothing minty scent and smell</li>
            <li>They were absolutely wonderful and fast delivery</li>
            <li>It kind of makes sense</li>
            <li>the shampoo feels nice and tingly but it dries out my skin and does nothing for the hairloss, which continued unabated.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is nice.  </li>
            <li>my hair is looking good again and my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this product really works like it says, I suggest going to the Nioxin website and taking the test to find out what is the best for you.</li>
            <li>Nice menthol aroma and feel.</li>
            <li>To sum it up, after a month&#x27;s use, it&#x27;s either too soon to tell or will not be effective to stop hair loss in my case.</li>
            <li>Nioxin is a great product the shampoo, and conditioner really makes your scalp tingle love it!!</li>
            <li>I was super happy.</li>
            <li>At 65, my hair is fine, thinning and color treated, so System 4 was a good match for me.  </li>
            <li>But so far, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>My hair is feeling so much better and looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>It was great arrived right on time</li>
            <li>and it was already very fine</li>
            <li>First day-- hair was great.</li>
            <li>I tried rogain when it first started and didnt have great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m someone with fine greasy hair and this give dries it out nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for fine colored hair , however this one didn&#x27;t really impressed me, it&#x27;s far from the 5$ products you can get in any pharmacy</li>
            <li>I love it, and will never make the mistake of running out again.</li>
            <li>Best price I&#x27;ve ever seen anywhere for this essential product.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>Love amazon for helping me save money.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair appears fuller and more body.</li>
            <li>It helps with the toppik as it helps hold it in better since its slighty sticky.</li>
            <li>I will keep on using this product to see how it goes. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about five months, and a month ago, I ran out and couldn&#x27;t afford to order more shampoo.</li>
            <li>It stopped falling out once I was able to afford more Nioxin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic either.  </li>
            <li>and it caused a lot more hair loss when I tried to comb it out.</li>
            <li>I hope that othr people have better luck than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hooked! :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get to get my hair cut so that I can get some better analysis from the girl who cuts my hair.</li>
            <li>stylist recommended this product, her daughter used the product &amp; was pleased.</li>
            <li>and I do not see many strands on my comb</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I will continue to use the system a couple times a week  and purchase more of the scalp treatment to try to use between shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I wish the conditioner would be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>i noticed more of my hair falling out</li>
            <li>Either way, my hair looks better.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased the results I have seen since I started using Nioxin.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I will repurchase as there are products that are a lot cheaper that will make your hair feel thicker with more body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the cooling effect of the products.</li>
            <li>I gave it one more week</li>
            <li>and my hair kept falling more and more.</li>
            <li>My hair has the appearance of having more volume and the texture is better.</li>
            <li>You should use this product - it will change your life :)</li>
            <li>Had I been able to try it sooner, perhaps i would have had a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>doing more research, I have been taking evening</li>
            <li>Studies have shown that the combination of these two supplements combined reduce hair loss and while they did seem to help, for me the EPO works better.</li>
            <li>Great value fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the correct system for your needs.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the Nioxin Hair System 4.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with results.</li>
            <li>I love the price of the product on Amazon, it is way cheaper than my salon.</li>
            <li>Love this hair treatment system.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>but I love the way my  hair looks after the treatment.</li>
            <li>So its just OK and don&#x27;t expect that it will change anything about the quality, thickness, or amount of hair you will achieve with this product.</li>
            <li>, I put a coat of Garniar&#x27;s 3-day treatment for 3 mins for more</li>
            <li>didnt love this.  </li>
            <li>So imagine my chagrin to see a dozen precious strands of hair in my hand as I was rinsing out the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>To see dozens more strands in the drain in the shower.</li>
            <li>More on the pillow and sheets in the morning</li>
            <li>I should be able to make a fare judgement when I am finished.</li>
            <li>But it is better already.</li>
            <li>but I do think it covers my &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; better as well.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better results</li>
            <li>and I guess its OK.</li>
            <li>I have just now started to rotate it with the Orlando Pita Argan Oil Set which are my favorite hair products OF ALL TIME.</li>
            <li>will be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I made sure that I was using the formula for chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li>Now it looks better than it has in years</li>
            <li>Love this product.....</li>
            <li>and I feel like more of my hair is falling out then</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>Love the tingly sensation that accompanies the use.</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many products for my thinning hair</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have bought it again.  </li>
            <li>My hair seems to have more body after using it.  </li>
            <li>I love the Nioxin 4 System.</li>
            <li>Had better results with Nioxin</li>
            <li>just keeps the scalp healthy..</li>
            <li>I am ok with it..</li>
            <li>My hair does seem to have more body.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much better, and now I feel better about myself.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped using it, my scapt felt much better.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been more than two months.</li>
            <li>If you want a sure fired way to regrow your hair, take better care of it, eat healthier, &amp; stock up on Biotin and Fish Oil.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it, you never know how it will for you unless you try.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very excited to use this product.</li>
            <li>i have fine hair and this product gives the appearance that your hair is thicker with more body.</li>
            <li>The shampoo seems to be the most important part of the process</li>
            <li>So far, it is great.  </li>
            <li>I did share the shampoo with my 86 year old mother and she hasn&#x27;t experienced any hair regrowth</li>
            <li>Works incredibly well, especially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply after conditioner.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong .i feel the tingling in my scalp as soon as i put the conditioner ...</li>
            <li>Outstanding product and very cost effective when purchased through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I want add that they have a face book page and are very attentive to it by quickly answering all of the questions that are posted.  </li>
            <li>Full, shiny and the product smells minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so full and healthy</li>
            <li>My hair looked so lovely and full.</li>
            <li>so, I am thinking the products I received were fine.  </li>
            <li>The days I did not use it my scalp was fine.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, I liked how my hair looked when I styled it...</li>
            <li>Hair loss for a woman is not such a great thing.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced noticeable thinning following menopause in my mid-40s.</li>
            <li>It has filled in and now has some body.</li>
            <li>I know this was a genuine recommendation.</li>
            <li>Thus far, I have really liked the results with the System 4; I&#x27;m just glad that I did go to the Nioxin site and review which system to select.  </li>
            <li>So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li>I will continue with the system for a while to give it a fair trial, but so far, I&#x27;m not recommending this.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results from the Nioxin New System Kit#4.</li>
            <li>I love it and it has really helped my hair!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>If this keeps up, it&#x27;ll be well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 weeks and only, at best 2 times a week, but, while I have not yet seen more growth</li>
            <li>do color my hair, and have not noticed any significant fading from the shampoo, but then it hasnt been that</li>
            <li>and she was excited to see thickness coming into my hair.  </li>
            <li>It would be great if there was a formula which added a little more shine to the hair.  </li>
            <li>It just smells clean to me.</li>
            <li>and it gets your hair really clean.</li>
            <li>As a woman, I was in full panic mode by the time my stylist recommended Nioxin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since bought the full sizes separately and plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li>True, I swear.</li>
            <li>it is full and shiny.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I didnt give it the whole try because I just didnt love it.</li>
            <li>i used it faithfully for a couple two full kits.  </li>
            <li>and people ask me daily what I&#x27;m using that makes my hair look so good.</li>
            <li>And it continues to look full after each wash.</li>
            <li>My hair is in much better condition since using the Nioxin 4 system - much fuller, shinier and healthier.</li>
            <li>, I think it was good for my scalp, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to thicken my hair.  </li>
            <li>primrose oil has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li>I still feel like I&#x27;m losing more than normal</li>
            <li>My hair is so much thicker snd full of body!</li>
            <li>/&gt;She said, &amp;#34;Then there must be new growth.&amp;#34; :-)</li>
            <li>Really miss the nice scent of my normal redkin shampoo products.</li>
            <li>Doing that would also be a good alternative to those with dry hair who need the product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>This product really works!!</li>
            <li>I was less than thrilled, but after a month of using Nioxin, I love my hair</li>
            <li>The first day was great, the second day was okay and by the third day my scalp itched.  </li>
            <li>this product is amazing making my hair come back and look thicker than before!  </li>
            <li>Like everyone else who orders such a product, I was really hoping for good results.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it is making more hair grow (product does not claim to do so)</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and my hair has been thinning for the better part of a decade.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Right after my shower I proceeded to brush and put conditioning in my hair</li>
            <li>Right away I noticed that my hair looks and feels fuller.</li>
            <li>I ended up looking through the ingredients, this stuff has blood thinners in it among a huge array of pretty intense chemicals.</li>
            <li>It helps a lot to control oil (I have extremely fine hair that would normally be oily by the end of the day)</li>
            <li>A friend urged me to try Nioxin for my thinning hair and, much to my surprise, it made a significant difference in the texture and manageability of my hair from the first time I used the cleanser, therapy and moisturizer in the System #4 kit.  </li>
            <li>Great product to use on fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Use it or lose it ;))</li>
            <li>the only one that seems to make my hair look better is this.</li>
            <li>and it has do exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>and I feel like my hair is not thinning as much as it was before!</li>
            <li>Nioxin deep cleans that off your scalp, but leaves the scalp moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>After first use, started seeing a difference.</li>
            <li>Am expecting that further usage will show even better results.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t re-order unless something magical happens in the next couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Better price than I pay locally.</li>
            <li>For the cost of these supplements I would try them first.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend trying the EPO first.</li>
            <li>I do see a difference in just the first bunch</li>
            <li>and THAT is disconcerting when it&#x27;s the reason I bought Nioxin in the first place.</li>
            <li>exactly as represented</li>
            <li>It arrived fast!</li>
            <li>My expectations were more than I actually got.</li>
            <li>but she said her hair stopped falling out after the first use.  </li>
            <li>And it kind of dulls your hair, not a shiny feel.  </li>
            <li>She is very excited about that as well as the future outcome.</li>
            <li>Loving this system my hair has never felt cleaner with any other product before,  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and it is much easier to use than I had initially imagined.</li>
            <li>I used this set for the first time today, and my hair is bouncy, full and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is slowly looking better and better.</li>
            <li>But I reminded myself that everyone tends to experience a large amount of shedding in the first two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the products...but the hair treatment arrived half full because of leakage.</li>
            <li>Just tried it, i&#x27;m hoping for positive results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure something like this has to be used for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I normally lose 15-20 hairs in the shower and this was a tiny bit more than that.</li>
            <li>Hair that is more dry is an acceptable result if my hair stops thinning.</li>
            <li>My hair is super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Great for thin hair really gives you body</li>
            <li>I have not used a whole bottle to date.  </li>
            <li>Works for me, hair looks fuller and the thinning areas filled in by the 3rd week.</li>
            <li>I really like the whole system.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner work really well</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>The cleanser, however is very stripping of color and severely dries out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This products really seem to make a difference in the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I know my scalp is much cleaner.</li>
            <li>It helped me stop losing so much hair.</li>
            <li>I think my jair looks fuller not because of the Nioxin estimulating growth but stopping the lost of so much hair.</li>
            <li>I really think this stuff is working.</li>
            <li>Still waiting to see if the products really does what it claims.  </li>
            <li>This was very helpful after I had surgery</li>
            <li>Very soothing on my head</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would.</li>
            <li>These products have really helped my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>This system really works.</li>
            <li>After the thyroid issues worsened, the hair stopped growing in as much, but I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t losing as much as others I know with this condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nioxin helps those with too much sebum on the scalp.</li>
            <li>, you probably have too much sebum.</li>
            <li>This system has really seemed to work.</li>
            <li>but those on chemo should really use it every time.</li>
            <li>After using this system for a month there is a very noticeable difference in the thickness and density of my hair.</li>
            <li>and it feels much healthier and stronger.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo lathers very well</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need to use much of it.  </li>
            <li>I have my hair highlighted, and this product seems to be gentle with my hair.</li>
            <li>but this has really helped my hair..  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so much stronger and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>It cleans very well.</li>
            <li>or maybe it&#x27;s for real, but I am sold on this product.</li>
            <li>one star because it really didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference after months and months of use</li>
            <li>But the whole system seems to be working.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, too much money for a product I won&#x27;t/can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li>I might look for the shampoo again, but never the whole system.</li>
            <li>I have not had that much hair fall out since then.  </li>
            <li>I had a form of chemo that is for the liver called interferon that absolutely thrashed my hair and made me lose about 80% of it.</li>
            <li>I feel Nioxin is very drying -</li>
            <li>That helps - my remaining hair was looking very frizzy with this.</li>
            <li>so much fell out.</li>
            <li>I was very sceptical but it works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I dont see my scalp as much anymore.</li>
            <li>but I started seeing how much hair I was loosing.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very efficient.</li>
            <li>but it looks and feels much healthier</li>
            <li>I have been using the products for 1 1/2  months now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this from a beauty supply store, and ordered another kit from amazon at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li>I believe this product has increased the growth and thickness of her hair, it has really improved it</li>
            <li>I am recommending it to others as it really produces the results as advertised.</li>
            <li>This set makes thinning, colored hair very strong, fuller in a very short time and effect is lasting!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see if my hair starts growing back fuller and ticker like it did years ago.  </li>
            <li>My sister bought this kit &amp; was so excited to get it home and start using it; after about two weeks of regular use, she broke out in a rash &amp; had to discontinue use.</li>
            <li>My hair looks thicker and full of body and is not stiff, looks soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is always the same, so no vendor does anything special except the price it is sold for.</li>
            <li>I had SO much breakage due to my hair becoming stripped of all moisture.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my hope that I can restore my normal hair status through supplements and continued gentle treatment of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m losing twice as much hair in the shower as I normally do</li>
            <li>first impression is WOW.</li>
            <li>My hair feels more voluminous, and the products have slowed down my hair loss (associated with Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis).</li>
            <li>I have been using for a couple of months only of the original formula and not this new one I just ordered.  </li>
            <li>I love this and have begun to see  less hair loss,.  </li>
            <li>Actually seems to be drying my hair out more than it was before starting.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied and will only purchase the shampoo for a refill.</li>
            <li>I expected my hair loss to grow in a little better and faster, but I guess everyone is different and at their own pace</li>
            <li>It seems to be starting new hair growing, but I&#x27;ll have to wait to see the full impact of the system&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Nioxin products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for Nioxin but after giving the product 90 days to see results i gave up.</li>
            <li>Highly  support this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for thinning, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed also that my hair feels like it has a little more substance too it.</li>
            <li>It does make my scalp itch just a little, but not terribly.</li>
            <li>so far so good, it seems to be working a little but only been on it 6 weeks, so we will see</li>
            <li>I thought my hair was falling out due to genetics but turned out to have a major iron deficiency, however I swore I noticed more new hairs coming in while using this!</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s too early for thar, I believe)it does seem that my hair is not breaking as much</li>
            <li>So far working very well.</li>
            <li>I put it on after a shower, and style it how I normally do</li>
            <li>I have seen my hair loss go from filling my brush every two days to now losing what I would consider nearer a normal amount.</li>
            <li>My hair is now like straw and just running a cool blowdryer through it leaves a pile of hair on the floor with strands ranging from 1/2 inch to 7 inches long.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of use I noticed this system made my hair fall out even more.  </li>
            <li>The hair at the very top of my head used to feel and look very thin, but now it&#x27;s starting to feel very full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been through many medication changes over the past few years and am sure that&#x27;s added to it.</li>
            <li>The amount of hair fall in the shower was distressing and combined with the flaking/itching and newly dried-out hair, I decided this wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I have new hair growing at my hair line.</li>
            <li>#34;hair grows from the inside, there is nothing you can put on your scalp to grow new hair&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Although, I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth, I do not have to use any hair styling products to make my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li>Been using the product for 6 weeks and my hair is supple and shiny with new growth.</li>
            <li>I can see new hair growth.</li>
            <li>, I have not noticed any new growth</li>
            <li>not seen new hair growth yet</li>
            <li>New System Kit #4 1x Cleanser 10.1 oz,</li>
            <li>If your hair comes out and you see a white plug at the root, and if you lightly scrape your nails on your scalp (as if you were scratching an itch) and you have moist white stuff under your nails</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used this long enough to notice any difference yet, but I bought it on the recommendation of people who are familiar with it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I purchases in store for double the cost!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I am not sure whether I am growing more hair or whether the products make it feel thicker.  </li>
            <li>I did see that other reviewers have pointed out, the ingredients have changed from the original formula.</li>
            <li>The foam that is rubbed in to the scalp must be used sparingly - you don&#x27;t need much cause all it does is dry the scalp if you use too much IMO.</li>
            <li>then my hair recently started shedding in large amounts again</li>
            <li>Great price for a typically expensive haircare system, although I wish the Conditioner would be the same size container as the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The 2nd step conditioner is not very moisturizing so in the beginning I would use a light leave in conditioner and by day 6 I was using an additional rinse out conditioner on the ends.  </li>
            <li>It does not &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; hair as far as I can tell and</li>
            <li>so I cant say so far.</li>
            <li>so far like the way it is working.</li>
            <li>I tried Nioxin and while my hair isn&#x27;t really growing back, it does look fuller.</li>
            <li>Even if my hair isn&#x27;t really growing back, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop using this product.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, you might be surprised.</li>
            <li>It softens and has made my hair so much thicker without any further damage.</li>
            <li>I noticed baby hair growing back on the sides of my head and very front of my scalp.</li>
            <li>Have used for 1 month and no results so far.  </li>
            <li>and then my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li>So far I like the product.  </li>
            <li>so i like it so far</li>
            <li>Considerably cheaper than the Salon.</li>
            <li>It just completely contradicts the nioxin system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 51 year old perimenopausal woman (gosh, that sounds</li>
            <li>it not to feel self conscious anymore about my hair.</li>
            <li>You may not be getting the correct product, it may be old, etc.</li>
            <li>but I know it will take a few months longer to actually know for sure.</li>
            <li>I had the same issue another reviewer had with more hair falling out after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I have not had any adverse reaction (as was noted in some of the review of the product -- not necessarily this particular item)</li>
            <li>Her hair seemed to be slow to come back and what did was very fine and downy looking.  </li>
            <li>My thin hair was really thinning more, but due to using Nioxin it is getting stronger, and I don&#x27;t really have to style it because after use of system it falls into place naturally.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist actually recommended this product (before I told her I was using it) as she said it could help me hold on to the hair I have as I adjust to new medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have decided to stop using the scalp treatment but will continue with shampoo and conditioner and see if my hair actually gets thicker or I see new growth.  </li>
            <li>The scalp treatment definitely makes your hair look thicker, but i have not grown any new hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair got really, really straw-like dry.</li>
            <li>I feel Much Much better , because it gives volume to my hair, but I don&#x27;t know the result at least take several months to see.</li>
            <li>I have noted that using the three items leaves my hair more dry than in the past - even after using the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; (after I shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this product actually did want it said it could, I noticed a difference in my hair with in 2 uses.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m trying it again and have only used in once so far.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s too early to see if my hair grows back).</li>
            <li>As another reviewer mentioned, I use Toppik, but this morning i barely needed any.</li>
            <li>She never tries to sell me anything</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t thin before, it sure is now.  </li>
            <li>Due to the fb page I know that they are a reputable and responsible that stands behind its product.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews, I felt confident that this product would help me by my hair not falling out like it has done in the past</li>
            <li>Before starting to use Nioxin I was starting to think I was going to need a wig at 32 years old but not anymore!  </li>
            <li>There prices are much lower than any other store.</li>
            <li>no dry scalp, no itching..</li>
            <li>Since I only put the &amp;#34;scalp treatment&amp;#34; in certain area&#x27;s, I know that it is the product that is turning my hair grey because it is going grey just in those 3 spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty fluffy.</li>
            <li>The first few times after using products I had hair fall off.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have already used these products, so I will always be happy with this product and will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> Great product for those dealing with hereditary thinning of hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product as recommended by my hairdresser who said this was one of the products she learned about in school that instructors said was great for thinning hair.</li>

            <li> Amazing product !</li>
            <li> Great Product and good price</li>
            <li> I love it the best I have every tried</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell like chocolate mint to me which is pleasant but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair.</li>
            <li> Does not have a pleasant order.</li>
            <li> surprising the amount of conditioner they expect you to use.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase, will keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> and I continue to see good results from using this 3 part system for my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a good product.  </li>
            <li> and my hair seemed to be in good condition (except for the thinning.)I</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This product helps keep my hair in good condition</li>
            <li> it works good</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good, conditio was not as good as others, so don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> My head feels so good from the tingling of the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> However, my  hair feels really good with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s helping my thinning issues at all--it does a good job of stripping oils and buildup</li>
            <li> Good product and price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is particularly good for colored hair</li>
            <li> product good, helps decrease hair falling out.</li>
            <li> it does a really good job of cleaning my scalp and keeping the flaky patch I&#x27;ve had seen childhood at bay.  </li>
            <li> Great product that really works and a great price!</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> He is very pleased and so am I.</li>
            <li> Great treatment, leaves your hair very clean</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair beautiful and shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li> , it gets better!</li>
            <li> Lovely mint smell, too!</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> so I gave it a try a couple of months ago and after just the first wash was impressed.</li>
            <li> I know the directions say you need to use for more than 30 days or so before seeing results, so I am still hopeful!</li>
            <li> My hair has an amazing shine even though this system is drying.  </li>
            <li> The difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> It lathers well (not sulfate free) and my hair feels great after use.</li>
            <li> then this amazing &amp;#34;scalp therapy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> will continue to use, nice improvement to my hair</li>
            <li> When I saw this helpful product on Amazon, I was delighted to see the much better price.</li>
            <li> Ive used system 3 before and really liked it</li>
            <li> I washed my own hair in the shower and it was so tangled,</li>
            <li> washing my own hair is something that I never ever do myself so for me it was a nightmare to have to untangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried and liked.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely giving a tingling, minty sensation as you massage it into your scalp.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo has a really nice soothing minty scent and smell</li>
            <li> They were absolutely wonderful and fast delivery</li>
            <li> It kind of makes sense</li>
            <li> the shampoo feels nice and tingly but it dries out my skin and does nothing for the hairloss, which continued unabated.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is nice.  </li>
            <li> my hair is looking good again and my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this product really works like it says, I suggest going to the Nioxin website and taking the test to find out what is the best for you.</li>
            <li> Nice menthol aroma and feel.</li>
            <li> To sum it up, after a month&#x27;s use, it&#x27;s either too soon to tell or will not be effective to stop hair loss in my case.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a great product the shampoo, and conditioner really makes your scalp tingle love it!!</li>
            <li> I was super happy.</li>
            <li> At 65, my hair is fine, thinning and color treated, so System 4 was a good match for me.  </li>
            <li> But so far, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> My hair is feeling so much better and looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> It was great arrived right on time</li>
            <li> and it was already very fine</li>
            <li> First day-- hair was great.</li>
            <li> I tried rogain when it first started and didnt have great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone with fine greasy hair and this give dries it out nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for fine colored hair , however this one didn&#x27;t really impressed me, it&#x27;s far from the 5$ products you can get in any pharmacy</li>
            <li> I love it, and will never make the mistake of running out again.</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve ever seen anywhere for this essential product.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> Love amazon for helping me save money.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair appears fuller and more body.</li>
            <li> It helps with the toppik as it helps hold it in better since its slighty sticky.</li>
            <li> I will keep on using this product to see how it goes. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about five months, and a month ago, I ran out and couldn&#x27;t afford to order more shampoo.</li>
            <li> It stopped falling out once I was able to afford more Nioxin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic either.  </li>
            <li> and it caused a lot more hair loss when I tried to comb it out.</li>
            <li> I hope that othr people have better luck than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hooked! :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get to get my hair cut so that I can get some better analysis from the girl who cuts my hair.</li>
            <li> stylist recommended this product, her daughter used the product &amp; was pleased.</li>
            <li> and I do not see many strands on my comb</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I will continue to use the system a couple times a week  and purchase more of the scalp treatment to try to use between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I wish the conditioner would be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> i noticed more of my hair falling out</li>
            <li> Either way, my hair looks better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased the results I have seen since I started using Nioxin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I will repurchase as there are products that are a lot cheaper that will make your hair feel thicker with more body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the cooling effect of the products.</li>
            <li> I gave it one more week</li>
            <li> and my hair kept falling more and more.</li>
            <li> My hair has the appearance of having more volume and the texture is better.</li>
            <li> You should use this product - it will change your life :)</li>
            <li> Had I been able to try it sooner, perhaps i would have had a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> doing more research, I have been taking evening</li>
            <li> Studies have shown that the combination of these two supplements combined reduce hair loss and while they did seem to help, for me the EPO works better.</li>
            <li> Great value fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the correct system for your needs.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Nioxin Hair System 4.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with results.</li>
            <li> I love the price of the product on Amazon, it is way cheaper than my salon.</li>
            <li> Love this hair treatment system.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> but I love the way my  hair looks after the treatment.</li>
            <li> So its just OK and don&#x27;t expect that it will change anything about the quality, thickness, or amount of hair you will achieve with this product.</li>
            <li> , I put a coat of Garniar&#x27;s 3-day treatment for 3 mins for more</li>
            <li> didnt love this.  </li>
            <li> So imagine my chagrin to see a dozen precious strands of hair in my hand as I was rinsing out the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> To see dozens more strands in the drain in the shower.</li>
            <li> More on the pillow and sheets in the morning</li>
            <li> I should be able to make a fare judgement when I am finished.</li>
            <li> But it is better already.</li>
            <li> but I do think it covers my &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; better as well.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better results</li>
            <li> and I guess its OK.</li>
            <li> I have just now started to rotate it with the Orlando Pita Argan Oil Set which are my favorite hair products OF ALL TIME.</li>
            <li> will be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I made sure that I was using the formula for chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li> Now it looks better than it has in years</li>
            <li> Love this product.....</li>
            <li> and I feel like more of my hair is falling out then</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> Love the tingly sensation that accompanies the use.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many products for my thinning hair</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have bought it again.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to have more body after using it.  </li>
            <li> I love the Nioxin 4 System.</li>
            <li> Had better results with Nioxin</li>
            <li> just keeps the scalp healthy..</li>
            <li> I am ok with it..</li>
            <li> My hair does seem to have more body.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much better, and now I feel better about myself.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using it, my scapt felt much better.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been more than two months.</li>
            <li> If you want a sure fired way to regrow your hair, take better care of it, eat healthier, &amp; stock up on Biotin and Fish Oil.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it, you never know how it will for you unless you try.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Very excited to use this product.</li>
            <li> i have fine hair and this product gives the appearance that your hair is thicker with more body.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems to be the most important part of the process</li>
            <li> So far, it is great.  </li>
            <li> I did share the shampoo with my 86 year old mother and she hasn&#x27;t experienced any hair regrowth</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well, especially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply after conditioner.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong .i feel the tingling in my scalp as soon as i put the conditioner ...</li>
            <li> Outstanding product and very cost effective when purchased through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I want add that they have a face book page and are very attentive to it by quickly answering all of the questions that are posted.  </li>
            <li> Full, shiny and the product smells minty and refreshing.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so full and healthy</li>
            <li> My hair looked so lovely and full.</li>
            <li> so, I am thinking the products I received were fine.  </li>
            <li> The days I did not use it my scalp was fine.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note, I liked how my hair looked when I styled it...</li>
            <li> Hair loss for a woman is not such a great thing.  </li>
            <li> I have experienced noticeable thinning following menopause in my mid-40s.</li>
            <li> It has filled in and now has some body.</li>
            <li> I know this was a genuine recommendation.</li>
            <li> Thus far, I have really liked the results with the System 4; I&#x27;m just glad that I did go to the Nioxin site and review which system to select.  </li>
            <li> So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li> I will continue with the system for a while to give it a fair trial, but so far, I&#x27;m not recommending this.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results from the Nioxin New System Kit#4.</li>
            <li> I love it and it has really helped my hair!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited.</li>
            <li> If this keeps up, it&#x27;ll be well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 weeks and only, at best 2 times a week, but, while I have not yet seen more growth</li>
            <li> do color my hair, and have not noticed any significant fading from the shampoo, but then it hasnt been that</li>
            <li> and she was excited to see thickness coming into my hair.  </li>
            <li> It would be great if there was a formula which added a little more shine to the hair.  </li>
            <li> It just smells clean to me.</li>
            <li> and it gets your hair really clean.</li>
            <li> As a woman, I was in full panic mode by the time my stylist recommended Nioxin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought the full sizes separately and plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> True, I swear.</li>
            <li> it is full and shiny.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I didnt give it the whole try because I just didnt love it.</li>
            <li> i used it faithfully for a couple two full kits.  </li>
            <li> and people ask me daily what I&#x27;m using that makes my hair look so good.</li>
            <li> And it continues to look full after each wash.</li>
            <li> My hair is in much better condition since using the Nioxin 4 system - much fuller, shinier and healthier.</li>
            <li> , I think it was good for my scalp, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to thicken my hair.  </li>
            <li> primrose oil has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> I still feel like I&#x27;m losing more than normal</li>
            <li> My hair is so much thicker snd full of body!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She said, &amp;#34;Then there must be new growth.&amp;#34; :-)</li>
            <li> Really miss the nice scent of my normal redkin shampoo products.</li>
            <li> Doing that would also be a good alternative to those with dry hair who need the product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product really works!!</li>
            <li> I was less than thrilled, but after a month of using Nioxin, I love my hair</li>
            <li> The first day was great, the second day was okay and by the third day my scalp itched.  </li>
            <li> this product is amazing making my hair come back and look thicker than before!  </li>
            <li> Like everyone else who orders such a product, I was really hoping for good results.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it is making more hair grow (product does not claim to do so)</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and my hair has been thinning for the better part of a decade.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Right after my shower I proceeded to brush and put conditioning in my hair</li>
            <li> Right away I noticed that my hair looks and feels fuller.</li>
            <li> I ended up looking through the ingredients, this stuff has blood thinners in it among a huge array of pretty intense chemicals.</li>
            <li> It helps a lot to control oil (I have extremely fine hair that would normally be oily by the end of the day)</li>
            <li> A friend urged me to try Nioxin for my thinning hair and, much to my surprise, it made a significant difference in the texture and manageability of my hair from the first time I used the cleanser, therapy and moisturizer in the System #4 kit.  </li>
            <li> Great product to use on fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Use it or lose it ;))</li>
            <li> the only one that seems to make my hair look better is this.</li>
            <li> and it has do exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> and I feel like my hair is not thinning as much as it was before!</li>
            <li> Nioxin deep cleans that off your scalp, but leaves the scalp moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> After first use, started seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> Am expecting that further usage will show even better results.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t re-order unless something magical happens in the next couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Better price than I pay locally.</li>
            <li> For the cost of these supplements I would try them first.</li>
            <li> but I would recommend trying the EPO first.</li>
            <li> I do see a difference in just the first bunch</li>
            <li> and THAT is disconcerting when it&#x27;s the reason I bought Nioxin in the first place.</li>
            <li> exactly as represented</li>
            <li> It arrived fast!</li>
            <li> My expectations were more than I actually got.</li>
            <li> but she said her hair stopped falling out after the first use.  </li>
            <li> And it kind of dulls your hair, not a shiny feel.  </li>
            <li> She is very excited about that as well as the future outcome.</li>
            <li> Loving this system my hair has never felt cleaner with any other product before,  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of it and it is much easier to use than I had initially imagined.</li>
            <li> I used this set for the first time today, and my hair is bouncy, full and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is slowly looking better and better.</li>
            <li> But I reminded myself that everyone tends to experience a large amount of shedding in the first two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the products...but the hair treatment arrived half full because of leakage.</li>
            <li> Just tried it, i&#x27;m hoping for positive results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure something like this has to be used for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I normally lose 15-20 hairs in the shower and this was a tiny bit more than that.</li>
            <li> Hair that is more dry is an acceptable result if my hair stops thinning.</li>
            <li> My hair is super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> Great for thin hair really gives you body</li>
            <li> I have not used a whole bottle to date.  </li>
            <li> Works for me, hair looks fuller and the thinning areas filled in by the 3rd week.</li>
            <li> I really like the whole system.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner work really well</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> The cleanser, however is very stripping of color and severely dries out my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This products really seem to make a difference in the texture of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I know my scalp is much cleaner.</li>
            <li> It helped me stop losing so much hair.</li>
            <li> I think my jair looks fuller not because of the Nioxin estimulating growth but stopping the lost of so much hair.</li>
            <li> I really think this stuff is working.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see if the products really does what it claims.  </li>
            <li> This was very helpful after I had surgery</li>
            <li> Very soothing on my head</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would.</li>
            <li> These products have really helped my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This system really works.</li>
            <li> After the thyroid issues worsened, the hair stopped growing in as much, but I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t losing as much as others I know with this condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nioxin helps those with too much sebum on the scalp.</li>
            <li> , you probably have too much sebum.</li>
            <li> This system has really seemed to work.</li>
            <li> but those on chemo should really use it every time.</li>
            <li> After using this system for a month there is a very noticeable difference in the thickness and density of my hair.</li>
            <li> and it feels much healthier and stronger.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo lathers very well</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to use much of it.  </li>
            <li> I have my hair highlighted, and this product seems to be gentle with my hair.</li>
            <li> but this has really helped my hair..  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so much stronger and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> It cleans very well.</li>
            <li> or maybe it&#x27;s for real, but I am sold on this product.</li>
            <li> one star because it really didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference after months and months of use</li>
            <li> But the whole system seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, too much money for a product I won&#x27;t/can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> I might look for the shampoo again, but never the whole system.</li>
            <li> I have not had that much hair fall out since then.  </li>
            <li> I had a form of chemo that is for the liver called interferon that absolutely thrashed my hair and made me lose about 80% of it.</li>
            <li> I feel Nioxin is very drying -</li>
            <li> That helps - my remaining hair was looking very frizzy with this.</li>
            <li> so much fell out.</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical but it works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I dont see my scalp as much anymore.</li>
            <li> but I started seeing how much hair I was loosing.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very efficient.</li>
            <li> but it looks and feels much healthier</li>
            <li> I have been using the products for 1 1/2  months now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this from a beauty supply store, and ordered another kit from amazon at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li> I believe this product has increased the growth and thickness of her hair, it has really improved it</li>
            <li> I am recommending it to others as it really produces the results as advertised.</li>
            <li> This set makes thinning, colored hair very strong, fuller in a very short time and effect is lasting!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see if my hair starts growing back fuller and ticker like it did years ago.  </li>
            <li> My sister bought this kit &amp; was so excited to get it home and start using it; after about two weeks of regular use, she broke out in a rash &amp; had to discontinue use.</li>
            <li> My hair looks thicker and full of body and is not stiff, looks soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It is always the same, so no vendor does anything special except the price it is sold for.</li>
            <li> I had SO much breakage due to my hair becoming stripped of all moisture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is my hope that I can restore my normal hair status through supplements and continued gentle treatment of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m losing twice as much hair in the shower as I normally do</li>
            <li> first impression is WOW.</li>
            <li> My hair feels more voluminous, and the products have slowed down my hair loss (associated with Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis).</li>
            <li> I have been using for a couple of months only of the original formula and not this new one I just ordered.  </li>
            <li> I love this and have begun to see  less hair loss,.  </li>
            <li> Actually seems to be drying my hair out more than it was before starting.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied and will only purchase the shampoo for a refill.</li>
            <li> I expected my hair loss to grow in a little better and faster, but I guess everyone is different and at their own pace</li>
            <li> It seems to be starting new hair growing, but I&#x27;ll have to wait to see the full impact of the system&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Nioxin products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for Nioxin but after giving the product 90 days to see results i gave up.</li>
            <li> Highly  support this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for thinning, color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed also that my hair feels like it has a little more substance too it.</li>
            <li> It does make my scalp itch just a little, but not terribly.</li>
            <li> so far so good, it seems to be working a little but only been on it 6 weeks, so we will see</li>
            <li> I thought my hair was falling out due to genetics but turned out to have a major iron deficiency, however I swore I noticed more new hairs coming in while using this!</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s too early for thar, I believe)it does seem that my hair is not breaking as much</li>
            <li> So far working very well.</li>
            <li> I put it on after a shower, and style it how I normally do</li>
            <li> I have seen my hair loss go from filling my brush every two days to now losing what I would consider nearer a normal amount.</li>
            <li> My hair is now like straw and just running a cool blowdryer through it leaves a pile of hair on the floor with strands ranging from 1/2 inch to 7 inches long.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use I noticed this system made my hair fall out even more.  </li>
            <li> The hair at the very top of my head used to feel and look very thin, but now it&#x27;s starting to feel very full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been through many medication changes over the past few years and am sure that&#x27;s added to it.</li>
            <li> The amount of hair fall in the shower was distressing and combined with the flaking/itching and newly dried-out hair, I decided this wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I have new hair growing at my hair line.</li>
            <li> #34;hair grows from the inside, there is nothing you can put on your scalp to grow new hair&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Although, I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth, I do not have to use any hair styling products to make my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for 6 weeks and my hair is supple and shiny with new growth.</li>
            <li> I can see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> , I have not noticed any new growth</li>
            <li> not seen new hair growth yet</li>
            <li> New System Kit #4 1x Cleanser 10.1 oz,</li>
            <li> If your hair comes out and you see a white plug at the root, and if you lightly scrape your nails on your scalp (as if you were scratching an itch) and you have moist white stuff under your nails</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used this long enough to notice any difference yet, but I bought it on the recommendation of people who are familiar with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I purchases in store for double the cost!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether I am growing more hair or whether the products make it feel thicker.  </li>
            <li> I did see that other reviewers have pointed out, the ingredients have changed from the original formula.</li>
            <li> The foam that is rubbed in to the scalp must be used sparingly - you don&#x27;t need much cause all it does is dry the scalp if you use too much IMO.</li>
            <li> then my hair recently started shedding in large amounts again</li>
            <li> Great price for a typically expensive haircare system, although I wish the Conditioner would be the same size container as the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The 2nd step conditioner is not very moisturizing so in the beginning I would use a light leave in conditioner and by day 6 I was using an additional rinse out conditioner on the ends.  </li>
            <li> It does not &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; hair as far as I can tell and</li>
            <li> so I cant say so far.</li>
            <li> so far like the way it is working.</li>
            <li> I tried Nioxin and while my hair isn&#x27;t really growing back, it does look fuller.</li>
            <li> Even if my hair isn&#x27;t really growing back, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop using this product.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you might be surprised.</li>
            <li> It softens and has made my hair so much thicker without any further damage.</li>
            <li> I noticed baby hair growing back on the sides of my head and very front of my scalp.</li>
            <li> Have used for 1 month and no results so far.  </li>
            <li> and then my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> So far I like the product.  </li>
            <li> so i like it so far</li>
            <li> Considerably cheaper than the Salon.</li>
            <li> It just completely contradicts the nioxin system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 51 year old perimenopausal woman (gosh, that sounds</li>
            <li> it not to feel self conscious anymore about my hair.</li>
            <li> You may not be getting the correct product, it may be old, etc.</li>
            <li> but I know it will take a few months longer to actually know for sure.</li>
            <li> I had the same issue another reviewer had with more hair falling out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have not had any adverse reaction (as was noted in some of the review of the product -- not necessarily this particular item)</li>
            <li> Her hair seemed to be slow to come back and what did was very fine and downy looking.  </li>
            <li> My thin hair was really thinning more, but due to using Nioxin it is getting stronger, and I don&#x27;t really have to style it because after use of system it falls into place naturally.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist actually recommended this product (before I told her I was using it) as she said it could help me hold on to the hair I have as I adjust to new medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have decided to stop using the scalp treatment but will continue with shampoo and conditioner and see if my hair actually gets thicker or I see new growth.  </li>
            <li> The scalp treatment definitely makes your hair look thicker, but i have not grown any new hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair got really, really straw-like dry.</li>
            <li> I feel Much Much better , because it gives volume to my hair, but I don&#x27;t know the result at least take several months to see.</li>
            <li> I have noted that using the three items leaves my hair more dry than in the past - even after using the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; (after I shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this product actually did want it said it could, I noticed a difference in my hair with in 2 uses.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m trying it again and have only used in once so far.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s too early to see if my hair grows back).</li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, I use Toppik, but this morning i barely needed any.</li>
            <li> She never tries to sell me anything</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t thin before, it sure is now.  </li>
            <li> Due to the fb page I know that they are a reputable and responsible that stands behind its product.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I felt confident that this product would help me by my hair not falling out like it has done in the past</li>
            <li> Before starting to use Nioxin I was starting to think I was going to need a wig at 32 years old but not anymore!  </li>
            <li> There prices are much lower than any other store.</li>
            <li> no dry scalp, no itching..</li>
            <li> Since I only put the &amp;#34;scalp treatment&amp;#34; in certain area&#x27;s, I know that it is the product that is turning my hair grey because it is going grey just in those 3 spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty fluffy.</li>
            <li> The first few times after using products I had hair fall off.  </li>
            <li> So I was going to wait at least 30 days to see results, but I literally had to jump on amazon right after my shower because I had to get this out.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I tried Biotin for several months and it seemed to help somewhat, but my hair was still rather flat and lackluster and seemed to be coming out quite a bit when showering.</li>
            <li> hair is thicker; does what it says; came on time; the rinse is in a smaller bottle, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the shampoo;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can say for certain that this product is helping with my hair loss.  </li>
            <li> Not sure this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> And please use a hot oil treatment at least once a week to prevent hair fall while on this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough yet.  </li>
            <li> I did not give this product 5 stars because I have not used it long enough to warrant it getting 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to tell yet, I will keep using it for 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> given it two stars because for the cost, the amount you&#x27;re purchasing would last a rather long time.</li>
            <li> but it does make my hair not look so flat</li>
            <li> i have long hair, i needed equal shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So far after only a month I have noticed that my hair does seem a little thicker after using NIOXIN</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it in combination with the other two products for anyone taking medication that causes extreme hair loss as a side effect.</li>
            <li> It makes a big difference as that gunk prevents new little hairs from sprouting!</li>
            <li> For now I&#x27;ve been supplementing with my regular conditioner every other wash just to make it last a bit</li>
            <li> I decided to only use the 3rd step (foam) every other day.  </li>
            <li> i specifically ordered from this seller as the pic showed the bottles to be the same size as opposed to other sellers with the big difference in size of the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The other issue i had was it totally dried my hair out and made it very frizzy.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair very dry and the leave in treatment burned my scalp.</li>
            <li> Sunday, my hair was falling out in such large amounts in the shower that it covered the drain (something I never experienced prior to Nioxin).</li>
            <li> I think I will need to use the product at least 3 - 6 months to really know if its working.</li>
            <li> and I leave it on as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This product may work, however it is turning my hair grey.  </li>
            <li> Giving four stars until I get long term experience.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference, but in all fairness, didn&#x27;t stand around in the shower for as long as the directions said to waiting for it to do</li>
            <li> I used this for a long time and it did help my hair look thicker</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money investing in the entire system and did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t  say if it regrows hair, I haven&#x27;t been using it that long</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product and will probably purchase it again when it runs out since it is a decent product when compared to other shampoos and conditioners;  It works well if not better than others I have been using in the same price range.  </li>
            <li> It did thicken each hair, and did not leave an unpleasant coating, hair felt much healthier, as far a growing new hair, its to soon to tell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use, my thinning bald spots (from meds) are not half as noticeable.</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out due to a medical problem.</li>
            <li> A year later, I&#x27;m still waiting for anything, any extra little bit of hair, just a few extra strands and nothing extra happened.  </li>
            <li> I dont feel like it cleans hair spray and dry shampoo from my hair.</li>
            <li> Instead I wound up with extremely dry hair and an itchy, flaky scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the product on a Wednesday.</li>
            <li> Makes scalp dry and hair brittle.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product as it caused my hair to fall and dry out.</li>
            <li> This product damaged my hair so much---&amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; the ends of my hair--left the rest of my hair so dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would recommend it to someone with dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is now so dry and brittle</li>
            <li> I can see a difference after a month - no new hair growth yet, but it has thickened my hair and the thinning isn&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
            <li> This system adds volume to my hair and thus far, I haven&#x27;t noticed the excessive hair loss others have commented on.</li>
            <li> Only thing was that it felt like it weighed my hair down a bit...</li>
            <li> My hair has been thinning and basically falling out due to grief and stress, this product has really made a huge difference</li>
            <li> It has made my hair so much healthier and removed a lot of residue that other hair products have left behind on both my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> While it is too soon to see if I have any regrowth, I definitely have less hair falling out when I wash, and my scalp has never felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I have been deep conditioning as well since I feel Ike it makes my hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> its already down to the collarbone after six weeks but to me at least is not that much thicker.</li>
            <li> I feel it leaves my hair very dry so after using the conditioner sparingly</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel course...and after drying felt very dry and hay-</li>
            <li> On a negative note, there was a marked increase in hair loss!  </li>
            <li> The picture is a little deceptive by showing two bottles of equal size.</li>
            <li> It dries very &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and there is like some &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; left on your hair that makes it difficult to brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> When I received the product, the cardboard box was wet and mushy.</li>
            <li> These products do what I expected.</li>
            <li> Only using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> , I have only used this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have short hair and the conditioner made it limp.</li>
            <li> and I am only seeing a few strands in the shower after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Have only used product a few times.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I have to get used to is washing my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> 25 year old caucasian female with thin damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint (and the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars) is the conditioner and scalp treatment are not full size so you still have shampoo left over when the other products have run out.</li>
            <li> This was a big waste of money- did NOT work!</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning due to some health issues I am going through.</li>
            <li> Every other day is about what I can use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use any other product on the market.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this due to thinning hair on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> There are other ways.</li>
            <li> so I use it 3 times a week and use a cheaper thickening shampoo and conditioner the other days.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried of a variety of regimens, vitamins, supplements and other hair loss shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have not had any of the redness/dryness/irritation other folks have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Not sure why but, will try another product in the future.</li>
            <li> As for the scalp conditioner, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s necessary</li>
            <li> I have found no better treatments to growing out my hair than just simply taking care of it.</li>
            <li> My hair is dyed due to some greying and wavy.</li>
            <li> I changed from the system 2 to system 4 due to I colored my hair</li>
            <li> I am seeing a few little hairs coming back at the scalp.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, my hair has become stronger, and It no longer falls out when I brush and dry it.</li>
            <li> i am now back to half my previous volume, the hair loss has gone from scary sized clumps to a regular amount of hair and that receding hairline is now doing the opposite of receding,</li>
            <li> My hair has started to thin out the past few years, and I had been taking biotin for a long time and not seeing much results.</li>
            <li> If you read the description, one is half the size of the other.</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;m keeping what hair I have left.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Im giving myself a year at least to get my hair back.</li>
            <li> It is not fun.</li>
            <li> It adds lots of body to hair without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> The products don&#x27;t seem to weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> No new regrowth, but no more hair loss either.</li>
            <li> It is much less drying than 4.</li>
            <li> I bought it with recommendation of our hair stylist and here you can buy it for the half price of the salon&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I also have less hair in the drain of my shower.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s less than before I started using this.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in thickness of hair or any less falling out.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed less breakage and loss of hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that a bit less hair is coming out.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be less hair in the drain, but that may be my wishful thinking.  </li>
            <li> Still wonder why the the conditioners are half the size of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Looks thicker and less oily.  </li>
            <li> my eyes were a mess every time I used it.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but was worth the money.</li>
            <li> It made my hair hard and dry.</li>
            <li> I do wish the conditioner was bigger - seriously who uses less conditioner than shampoo?!</li>
            <li> i mean how long does it take.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a little difference  after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I do need to add a little leave in conditioner for dryness.  </li>
            <li> It did feel a little fuller</li>
            <li> On in between days I put a little of the foam on my scalp.</li>
            <li> have been using for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> I had used Nioxin in the past but tried other products.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair very dull.</li>
            <li> having had very thick hair, i lost almost 2/3 of my total hair, there were little ghost hairs in the front by my once rapidly receding hairline.</li>
            <li> I think this is doing SOMETHING I just want to warn that this should be used in tandem with a milder and softer shampoo and conditioner as its a little harsh.</li>
            <li> Did not do much for my hair but dried out my scalp like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Too much trouble to use.</li>
            <li> That would be too much trouble</li>
            <li> and I would run out of the scalp treatment in a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thought this would help w/ THAT issue, too, but after purchasing, I read reviews saying  it also dried their hair out.  </li>
            <li> but she hasn&#x27;t lost it and had really harsh treatment.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo has sodium laurel sulfate in it, which is a harsh detergent.  </li>
            <li> Plus it uses harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very dull and flat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months (this was a follow-up order) and I see less of my scalp these days!</li>
            <li> Half the price of Walgreens!</li>
            <li> am a 51 year old woman whose hair was getting very thin and falling out a lot.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say my hair isn&#x27;t still thin or flat...</li>
            <li> I have thin, long hair, chemically treated.</li>
            <li> However I was hoping to slow down the amount of hair that is falling out and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers well with very little product.</li>
            <li> I use very little of the conditioner as it dries out my ends.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair, made my scalp flakey (which is never was before) and my hair dull and without shine.</li>
            <li> I started using Nioxin, and after a few months, I realized that I had stopped always worrying about my hair!</li>
            <li> not sure after a month it is doing anything.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is suppose to help thinning hair however it does remove buildup.</li>
            <li> By Monday my scalp was itching like crazy and I had developed plaque patches around my hairline.</li>
            <li> With that product in your hair your hair does not respond as usual to drying or hair product.</li>
            <li> Like this product, not really sure if it&#x27;s helping, but have to keep trying.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not sure how it does it, but yes this product makes my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using it and would like to return it and say a few words to Nioxin about it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in the past</li>
            <li> However, I am not satisfied with system.</li>
            <li> not sure about regrowth yet, too soon.</li>
            <li> what i received was a reg size shampoo and a small conditioner.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re very slow in coming, but I think that&#x27;s because my hair has been unhealthy for a long time.  </li>
            <li> After using it about 2-3 times a week for four weeks, I am sad to say that it didn&#x27;t do anything except dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Its been getting worse lately, so I decided to break down and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> could hardly get a brush through it as it was so dry/tangled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young female, so this is rather devastating.</li>
            <li> Prices paid at stores carrying this product is at least twice the price.  </li>
            <li> and she had this really thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> and it is slowly taking the color out of my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning at the base of my forehead &amp; Nioxin really does wonders to help with hair production &amp; growth.</li>
            <li> something all of the other hair products for thinning hair have promised but failed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have my father&#x27;s hair and have extremely thinning hair on the crown.  </li>
            <li> Have very thin hair due to medications and age.</li>
            <li> ridiculous)</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed that the conditioner comes in a smaller bottle than the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that after only 4 shampooings I will have to give up.</li>
            <li> The scalp treatment is horrid...makes my hair very dull, and straw-like.</li>
            <li> I was shocked and worried about her comments as I have never really thought about my hair as being thin</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for a couple of months now and can tell that my hair loss has decreased.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thin hair and in pictures I look like I have bald spots</li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of a residue behind.  </li>
            <li> My hair was getting so thin</li>
            <li> Unable to use this product secondary to the effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist mentioned that my hair seemed to be slightly thin and recommended this product, Nioxin.  </li>
            <li> This product does wonders to make my hair look fuller and not so thin.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, I am not willing to use the conditioner or scalp treatment due to the horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> and I do not remember ever seeing dramatic change</li>
            <li> Hair looks a bit fuller, other than that I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair got worst, waste of my hard earned money stop using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought it from her even though I found it rather expensive.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me, sorry to say.</li>
            <li> the scalp treatment is totally useless to me because I am not out in the sun alot,(possibly not using all 3 products is causing it to be  ineffective)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not impressed with it, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone, and at that point, if my opinion has changed, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it</li>
            <li> Nope, not to me, sorry about that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not great - I&#x27;m still losing my hair!</li>
            <li> MY hair just got VERY thin</li>
            <li> and I am beginning to see &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; in the areas where my hair is very thin.</li>
            <li> In any event, the stuff is terrible and even my hair stylist noticed that my scalp was dry and flakey and my hair without shine.  </li>
            <li> I cannot tolerate my hair feeling dirty.</li>
            <li> I considered trying another \\&quot;number\\&quot; in the line, but for the amount of money and the risk of being unhappy again, I think I&#x27;ll pass and talk to my stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner you leave in your hair makes your hair sticky and dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different--so it might not have quite so bad an effect on others hair--but for me it was a loser.</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid problem and my hair is in really bad shape.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad thinning hair.</li>
            <li> It made me so frustrated because I wasn&#x27;t even losing hair like this before I started using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> In the shower, while combing my hair, styling it, it was awful.</li>
            <li> The scalp cleanser was rather dreadful.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning-(hence the purchase) and admittedly dry,fine BUT not in terrible condition according to my beautician (who HAD to cut my hair</li>
            <li> It smells horrible.</li>
            <li> The products did make my hair feel thicker but the scalp treatment makes my scalp itch terribly.  </li>
            <li> It is just awful.  </li>
            <li> Awful....</li>

            <li> will continue to use, nice improvement to my hair</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for a couple of months now and can tell that my hair loss has decreased.  It does make my hair feel thicker as well.  The shampoo seems to be the most important part of the process and I leave it on as long as I can. It does not &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; hair as far as I can tell and I don&#x27;t think that it is advertised to do so.  But just to reduce hair loss is great!!</li>
            <li> I started noticing my hair getting thinner about 3 yrs ago. I attributed it to stress. I started using Nioxin, and after a few months, I realized that I had stopped always worrying about my hair! I ran out of product, and went about things...then my hair recently started shedding in large amounts again (I know I&#x27;m stressed), and I restocked! I truly believe the Nioxin (I use the shampoo/conditioner&amp; Diamax) is what helps keep my hair thicker. I love it, and will never make the mistake of running out again.</li>
            <li> I have not used a whole bottle to date.  My hairdresser has noticed some improvement in my gosh hair growth.</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve ever seen anywhere for this essential product.</li>
            <li> I purchased one for my husband and 1 for my son. They both say that they have not seen any difference.</li>
            <li> Love the products...but the hair treatment arrived half full because of leakage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my hair is noticeably thinning and my hairdresser recommended it.  While it is too soon to see if I have any regrowth, I definitely have less hair falling out when I wash, and my scalp has never felt cleaner.  The shampoo and conditioner leave a tingly feeling on the scalp, which leads me to believe it&#x27;s working?  The scalp treatment is great- I put it on after a shower, and style it how I normally do and my hair looks thicker and fuller just from using that.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I have yet to see if it will help with hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife, didn&#x27;t work. She started loosing lots of hair after using this product. May be this didn&#x27;t suit her hair or not a solution for her problem</li>
            <li> Great product and speedy shipping</li>
            <li> Works for me, hair looks fuller and the thinning areas filled in by the 3rd week. I was very skeptical, but was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months (this was a follow-up order) and I see less of my scalp these days! I love the smell of it and it is much easier to use than I had initially imagined. As a woman, I was in full panic mode by the time my stylist recommended Nioxin. I bought it from her even though I found it rather expensive. When I saw this helpful product on Amazon, I was delighted to see the much better price. I&#x27;m going to keep buying it!</li>
            <li> My hair got worst, waste of my hard earned money stop using this product.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to use.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.  Delivery was expedited even though I did not request (or pay) for it.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Ive used system 3 before and really liked it so I figured I would try 4, I do not like this at all. It makes my hair color fade and my hair has been shedding 2x the amount it was prior to using this system.. I definitely will NOT be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> This product may work, however it is turning my hair grey.  Since I only put the &amp;#34;scalp treatment&amp;#34; in certain area&#x27;s, I know that it is the product that is turning my hair grey because it is going grey just in those 3 spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of this</li>
            <li> After using it about 2-3 times a week for four weeks, I am sad to say that it didn&#x27;t do anything except dry my hair. There has been no decrease in the amount of hair loss or and no increase in regrowth.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother in law and she said it did not help her hair at all. She used it for a couple months.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels.  Definitely fuller yet still silky.&lt;br /&gt;Have yet to see any improvement in the thinning areas but&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle! My hair is growing back with daily use!! Must try!</li>
            <li> Best deal on internet</li>
            <li> Exactly what I purchases in store for double the cost! Love amazon for helping me save money. Had recent weight loss surgery so losing hair snd this product is amazing making my hair come back and look thicker than before!  Give it time but best hair product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I really like the whole system.  The shampoo and conditioner work really well and I love the smell of the conditioner. It just smells clean to me. My hair appears fuller and more body.</li>
            <li> Thus far, I have really liked the results with the System 4; I&#x27;m just glad that I did go to the Nioxin site and review which system to select.  At 65, my hair is fine, thinning and color treated, so System 4 was a good match for me.  This system adds volume to my hair and thus far, I haven&#x27;t noticed the excessive hair loss others have commented on.</li>
            <li> i love it!!!!! I have tried tones of hair products to make my hair look fuller and this one has been the only one that worked. My hairstylist recommened me to use this system and I would recommend it. I have extremely thin hair and in pictures I look like I have bald spots so when I tried this and it gave me volume I was super happy. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great product! Works very well. I will be using it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for fine colored hair , however this one didn&#x27;t really impressed me, it&#x27;s far from the 5$ products you can get in any pharmacy but it didn&#x27;t reach my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have been using for close to a week.  My hair has an amazing shine even though this system is drying.  I started putting a keratin leave in conditioner before drying my hair.  This takes care of the problem.  I might try system 3 in the future.  I will update in the future.  Giving four stars until I get long term experience.  So far, it is great.  Update I do see some accelerated growth.  The cleanser, however is very stripping of color and severely dries out my hair.  I am going to see if system 3 is as drying. Update I changed only the cleanser to system 3.  It is much less drying than 4.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Androgenic Alopecia (Basically Female Pattern Baldness) I&#x27;m a young female, so this is rather devastating. This set has seemed to stop the thinning, but Ive only been using it for about a month so I cant say so far. It leaves my hair beautiful and shinny and smooth. I really like it. The foam I also like. It does tend to leave your hair a bit sticky, but I just let it totally dry,then brush it through and apply my Toppik (hair building fiber powder) and spray it. It helps with the toppik as it helps hold it in better since its slighty sticky. I will keep on using this product to see how it goes. :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Definitely recommend it. I use it all and the treatment product made my roots get ticker and fuller hair. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I did NOT think I was shedding any hair. I DO have silky, baby-fine hair, that has been processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this kit, out of curiosity. I will never, ever, go back! My hair instantly took on a shine and condition that it never had, before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it gets better! After using the kit for six weeks, the women who cuts my hair asked whether I had tried to cut my hair myself, since I had seen her. I answered in the negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said, &amp;#34;Then there must be new growth.&amp;#34; :-)</li>
            <li> Nioxin Kit is alright, used one batch of it, didn&#x27;t feel or see a difference with thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its surprising the amount of conditioner they expect you to use.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase, will keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;Step 3 makes hair feel stringy and thinner I want to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave two stars because technically it cleans hair ect.</li>
            <li> not sure after a month it is doing anything. I dont feel like it cleans hair spray and dry shampoo from my hair.</li>
            <li> Use it or lose it ;))</li>
            <li> I have only had the product 2 weeks. so far like the way it is working. will give it another 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Loving this system my hair has never felt cleaner with any other product before,  I am hooked on Nixon I have noticed a little difference  after 2 weeks. I do suggest that you use a deranged to soften your hair after wash I washed my own hair in the shower and it was so tangled, washing my own hair is something that I never ever do myself so for me it was a nightmare to have to untangle my hair. Nioxin is a great product the shampoo, and conditioner really makes your scalp tingle love it!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product. The service to get the product out is excellent</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Nioxin products. A friend told me about them, showing me her results. I tried and liked.</li>
            <li> My hair has started to thin out the past few years, and I had been taking biotin for a long time and not seeing much results. I tried Nioxin and while my hair isn&#x27;t really growing back, it does look fuller. It&#x27;s been about five months, and a month ago, I ran out and couldn&#x27;t afford to order more shampoo. Continuing to use regular shampoo, my hair started to fall out. In the shower, while combing my hair, styling it, it was awful. It stopped falling out once I was able to afford more Nioxin. Even if my hair isn&#x27;t really growing back, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop using this product. At least I&#x27;m keeping what hair I have left. lol</li>
            <li> I love it and it has really helped my hair!  This was my second order and I continue to see good results from using this 3 part system for my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference, but in all fairness, didn&#x27;t stand around in the shower for as long as the directions said to waiting for it to do it&#x27;s magic either.  The spray also seemed to make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product to use on fine thin hair.  It lathers nicely giving a tingling, minty sensation as you massage it into your scalp.  It adds lots of body to hair without weighing it down.  It would be great if there was a formula which added a little more shine to the hair.  Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This products really seem to make a difference in the texture of my hair.  I know my scalp is much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no noticeable difference. Save your money. Buy some clippers.</li>
            <li> This was a big waste of money- did NOT work! Don&#x27;t bother!  The cost does not meet the effectiveness. Blah</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference and like the minty feel that it leaves on my scalp. I have been deep conditioning as well since I feel Ike it makes my hair a little dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nioxin before and was happy with the results. I plan to keep using it from now on. I&#x27;ve tried multiple kinds of hair products claiming to make your hair grow, look fuller, etc. the only one that seems to make my hair look better is this.</li>
            <li> It seems to be workig great. I do need to add a little leave in conditioner for dryness.  Will continue using it.</li>
            <li> It helped me stop losing so much hair. I saw an improvement after maybe a week of using it. I think my jair looks fuller not because of the Nioxin estimulating growth but stopping the lost of so much hair.</li>
            <li> Nioxin has been an excellent purchase. I have already noticed a difference in the texture of my hair. Both the quality of the product and the value is great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough yet.  I don&#x27;t know if the products is working yet.  I think I will need to use the product at least 3 - 6 months to really know if its working.</li>
            <li> Great products grouped together.  I was a bit disappointed that the conditioner comes in a smaller bottle than the shampoo.  Also, I am still on the fence about the scalp treatment.  It leaves a bit of a residue behind.  Shampoo and conditioner work great.</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger and getting fuller. I can see results since starting to use it. Nothing else to say.</li>
            <li> This product has made a great difference in the thickness and texture of my husbands hair. He is very pleased and so am I.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me, sorry to say. I had a lot of expectation. The scalp cleanser was rather dreadful. I had to toss it out because it caused my hair to tangle up and it caused a lot more hair loss when I tried to comb it out. Clumps of hair was falling in the bathroom floor. I am not sold on this product at all. I&#x27;d rather go back to my regular shampoo and conditioner than use these products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for thinning hair but I still have a lot of breakage in the front hair line.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is suppose to help thinning hair however it does remove buildup.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for 2 weeks and it has do exactly what it said it would do. i have fine hair and this product gives the appearance that your hair is thicker with more body. I did not give this product 5 stars because I have not used it long enough to warrant it getting 5 stars. I was pleasantly surprised that this product actually did want it said it could, I noticed a difference in my hair with in 2 uses. The shampoo has a really nice soothing minty scent and smell</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning due to some health issues I am going through. I thought if I got some Nioxin it would help a lot. I was so excited.I did everything by the book. It dries very &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; and there is like some &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; left on your hair that makes it difficult to brush. It also left my hair very dull. I am so disappointed that after only 4 shampooings I will have to give up. I cannot tolerate my hair feeling dirty.I hope that othr people have better luck than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.  .</li>
            <li> If you know anything about Alterna hair products, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. It rocks!!&lt;br /&gt;Well, my doctor told me that I need to start using Nioxin. I was less than thrilled, but after a month of using Nioxin, I love my hair and I&#x27;m hooked! :)</li>
            <li> I really think this stuff is working. The hair at the very top of my head used to feel and look very thin, but now it&#x27;s starting to feel very full. I can&#x27;t wait to get to get my hair cut so that I can get some better analysis from the girl who cuts my hair. If this keeps up, it&#x27;ll be well worth the money! Give it a try, you might be surprised.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a while. The product stopped my hair loss &amp; my hair has started to grow in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist recommended this product, her daughter used the product &amp; was pleased.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a good product.  The picture is a little deceptive by showing two bottles of equal size. They are not. If you read the description, one is half the size of the other.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see if the products really does what it claims.  If it does I will be one happy woman.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will work as promised. Great price for a set though compared to buying from a salon or cosmetics store.</li>
            <li> I used this system 3 times in about a week. On a positive note, I liked how my hair looked when I styled it... Pretty fluffy. On a negative note, there was a marked increase in hair loss!  I stopped using, then started rogaine which took about 10 weeks till I saw a decrease in loss...but there was never an INCREASE in daily loss using rogaine. I tried the Nixon shampoo and conditioner about 3 weeks into the rogaine and saw the increase in loss with one shampoo. I stopped. It&#x27;s a shame because this was pricey and I only to 4 uses out of it.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to tell yet, I will keep using it for 4-6 months. I do like the way the texture of my hair feels after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else who orders such a product, I was really hoping for good results. Instead I wound up with extremely dry hair and an itchy, flaky scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the product on a Wednesday. First day-- hair was great. Full, shiny and the product smells minty and refreshing. Second day-- some hair fall. I normally lose 15-20 hairs in the shower and this was a tiny bit more than that. Third day-- a handful of hair left my head when I applied the conditioner. I was horrified. But I reminded myself that everyone tends to experience a large amount of shedding in the first two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Sunday, my hair was falling out in such large amounts in the shower that it covered the drain (something I never experienced prior to Nioxin). By Monday my scalp was itching like crazy and I had developed plaque patches around my hairline. Yuck! It also started leeching color from my treated hair; I could see color bleed on my towel after my shower three days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to tell myself it was just part of the introduction phase, but by the following Friday I had to quit using the product. The amount of hair fall in the shower was distressing and combined with the flaking/itching and newly dried-out hair, I decided this wasn&#x27;t for me. I considered trying another \\&quot;number\\&quot; in the line, but for the amount of money and the risk of being unhappy again, I think I&#x27;ll pass and talk to my stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it two stars because for the cost, the amount you&#x27;re purchasing would last a rather long time. The shampoo lathers well with very little product. That is, if it works for you.</li>
            <li> Product had leaked or opened. When I received the product, the cardboard box was wet and mushy. Returned everything for refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see if it works.  Used this product about 15 years ago and it DID so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying it again.  I started using &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; hair color last year and I&#x27;ve lost 3/4 of my hair!!!  So, I&#x27;m trying it again and have only used in once so far.  But what I noticed was .....the awful smell that was the OLD Nioxin is now gone and it&#x27;s been replaced with a lovely light sent.  So....I&#x27;m excited to see if my hair starts growing back fuller and ticker like it did years ago.  Hope so!  So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> This was very helpful after I had surgery and my hair started falling out. I used this for a long time and it did help my hair look thicker and I believe helped it grow back in. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 1 month. Wow! The difference is amazing. I was worried that I was going to have to use minoxidil prouduct, but not now. I bought the system 4, for visibily thinning hair that has been color treated. It softens and has made my hair so much thicker without any further damage. I will be buying this again and again.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my personal hair stylist and I think it has lived up to it&#x27;s name!  Very soothing on my head and I feel like my hair is not thinning as much as it was before! Yay!</li>
            <li> Makes scalp dry and hair brittle. Might buy the foaming scalp treatment again but not the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have tried to put in this review.  When I get to the end it says it is not working and to try again.  So - last time:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product on the suggestion of my dermatologist to  help with my thinning hair.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 weeks and only, at best 2 times a week, but, while I have not yet seen more growth (it&#x27;s too early for thar, I believe)it does seem that my hair is not breaking as much and I do not see many strands on my comb so I guess it is doing something.  I have not had any adverse reaction (as was noted in some of the review of the product -- not necessarily this particular item) I have noted that using the three items leaves my hair more dry than in the past - even after using the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; (after I shampoo.  Before starting this product I only washed my hair once a week and used nothing else and my hair seemed to be in good condition (except for the thinning.)I also cannot use the product as recommended every day.  That would be too much trouble and I would run out of the scalp treatment in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;However, I will continue to use the system a couple times a week  and purchase more of the scalp treatment to try to use between shampoos.  Hair that is more dry is an acceptable result if my hair stops thinning.</li>
            <li> These products do what I expected. I didn&#x27;t expect the hair I&#x27;ve lost to grow back just from using these products (I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month so it&#x27;s too early to see if my hair grows back). No where on the packaging does it claim to do this. However I was hoping to slow down the amount of hair that is falling out and it seems to be working. I would be happy to just keep the amount of hair I have on my head! The shampoo and conditioner smell like chocolate mint to me which is pleasant but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair. I do find that using the leave in foam seems to lessen my fall out. But I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the foam makes my scalp itch if I use it every day. Every other day is about what I can use. I also find that even tho the products claim to be for chemically treated hair, I don&#x27;t find it moisturizing enough. I wish the conditioner would be more moisturizing. I will repurchase this set.</li>
            <li> This works! I have new hair growing at my hair line. My hair is healtier and thicker.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 6 months now.  I was skeptical at first but I am now a believer!  Excellent results.</li>
            <li> Good product. Only thing was that it felt like it weighed my hair down a bit... It did feel a little fuller but I don&#x27;t know if I would say it made my hair \\&quot;thicker\\&quot;</li>
            <li> back on the nioxin wagon....hair looks and feels thicker</li>
            <li> I bought it with recommendation of our hair stylist and here you can buy it for the half price of the salon&#x27;s. This set makes thinning, colored hair very strong, fuller in a very short time and effect is lasting!</li>
            <li> so far so good, it seems to be working a little but only been on it 6 weeks, so we will see</li>
            <li> They were absolutely wonderful and fast delivery</li>
            <li> doesnt stop ur hair from fallling out. just makes it fuller. i noticed more of my hair falling out i mean how long does it take. i guess if your hormones are messed up its not going to work at all.</li>
            <li> For a Nioxin Starter Kit the only thing that matters is the lowest price. It is always the same, so no vendor does anything special except the price it is sold for.</li>
            <li> Only using for a few weeks. See no improvement. Makes my scalp itch. I like the feeling when I put it on but afterwards my scalp feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended by my hairdresser but she told me it works for some but not for all.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is awesome product</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would.</li>
            <li> These products have really helped my thinning hair. And I have regrowth happening.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be making my hair seem thicker.  I am not sure whether I am growing more hair or whether the products make it feel thicker.  Either way, my hair looks better.</li>
            <li> This had made an incredible difference in the length and fullness of my hair. Even my hairdresser commented on the length/fullness. My only complaint (and the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars) is the conditioner and scalp treatment are not full size so you still have shampoo left over when the other products have run out. I&#x27;ve since bought the full sizes separately and plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> So far working very well.</li>
            <li> This system really works. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Did not see any results and found out that the formula was changed and this is not the Nioxin I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it.  I also use biotin and together, they work to help my hair feel fuller.</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair really gives you body</li>
            <li> I thought my hair was falling out due to genetics but turned out to have a major iron deficiency, however I swore I noticed more new hairs coming in while using this!</li>
            <li> I am pleased the results I have seen since I started using Nioxin. My hair feels more voluminous, and the products have slowed down my hair loss (associated with Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis). Of course, you cannot expect miracles (even at this price), but it gave me noticeable results- something all of the other hair products for thinning hair have promised but failed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started this product before I was diagnosed with Hashimoto&#x27;s. I noticed baby hair growing back on the sides of my head and very front of my scalp. After the thyroid issues worsened, the hair stopped growing in as much, but I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t losing as much as others I know with this condition. My dermatologist actually recommended this product (before I told her I was using it) as she said it could help me hold on to the hair I have as I adjust to new medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nioxin helps those with too much sebum on the scalp. If your hair comes out and you see a white plug at the root, and if you lightly scrape your nails on your scalp (as if you were scratching an itch) and you have moist white stuff under your nails (I know, yuck), you probably have too much sebum. Nioxin deep cleans that off your scalp, but leaves the scalp moisturized and healthy. It makes a big difference as that gunk prevents new little hairs from sprouting!</li>
            <li> Product works! After first use, started seeing a difference. After a few weeks of use, my thinning bald spots (from meds) are not half as noticeable. Am expecting that further usage will show even better results. Am using all 3 products in the kit, as instructed. I like the way the product feels, smells and works. No negatives to report.</li>
            <li> It did thicken each hair, and did not leave an unpleasant coating, hair felt much healthier, as far a growing new hair, its to soon to tell.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase as there are products that are a lot cheaper that will make your hair feel thicker with more body.&lt;br /&gt;I talked with my stylist and she said &amp;#34;hair grows from the inside, there is nothing you can put on your scalp to grow new hair&amp;#34;.  It kind of makes sense, She said check with your doctor about the medications you are taking, perhaps your body is lacking a necessary vitamin.  So we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well, especially if you have fine hair. Expect to see results in a month or so.</li>
            <li> Hair loss for a woman is not such a great thing.  This product helps keep my hair in good condition and I also have less hair in the drain of my shower.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product. I believe that the hair loss has stopped but it can take months for it to continue to grow. *crossing my fingers*</li>
            <li> This system has really seemed to work. I use it every time I wash my hair which is every two-three days. On in between days I put a little of the foam on my scalp. I love the cooling effect of the products. I&#x27;ve noticed also that my hair feels like it has a little more substance too it. I also think my hair lose has slowed. I still feel like I&#x27;m losing more than normal but it&#x27;s less than before I started using this. I had gastric bypass about 9 months ago which is the cause of my hair loss.</li>
            <li> Have very thin hair due to medications and age. This seems to give me the appearance of thicker hair.  Although, I haven&#x27;t seen any new growth, I do not have to use any hair styling products to make my hair look thicker. This product will be on my &amp;#34;Must Buy&amp;#34; list.</li>
            <li> I bought these products after I read wonderful reviews about it. I have thin, long hair, chemically treated. I tried the products for a week and my hair started falling uncontrollably. I am talking about a handful of hair every time I washed it. I also noticed that the volume diminished drastically and my hair got really, really straw-like dry. I gave it one more week and my hair kept falling more and more. Even my husband asked me what was going on with my hair. After 2 weeks of use I would say Nioxin DID NOT WORK for me. I do not recommend this product as it caused my hair to fall and dry out.</li>
            <li> Have used for 1 month and no results so far.  Actually seems to be drying my hair out more than it was before starting.  Thought this would help w/ THAT issue, too, but after purchasing, I read reviews saying  it also dried their hair out.  Won&#x27;t re-order unless something magical happens in the next couple weeks.</li>
            <li> it works good just wish the conditioner bottle was the same size then shampoo bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for years as my hair often falls out when I get stressed.  My dad even used it when he had chemo and didn&#x27;t lose his hair.  I have recommended it to a friend recently as she&#x27;s going through chemo now.  Her hair has got thinner but she hasn&#x27;t lost it and had really harsh treatment.  I tend to only use it once a week but those on chemo should really use it every time.</li>
            <li> Just tried it, i&#x27;m hoping for positive results. the transaction was perfect</li>
            <li> My hair has the appearance of having more volume and the texture is better. I have received several compliments since I started to use this product.</li>
            <li> Better price than I pay locally. My hair feels healthier...not necessarily thicker. I have used it for 4 months now.</li>
            <li> Amazing product ! My hair actually grew back! - True, I swear. You should use this product - it will change your life :)</li>
            <li> I have experienced noticeable thinning following menopause in my mid-40s. I had high hopes for Nioxin but after giving the product 90 days to see results i gave up. I spent a lot of money investing in the entire system and did not see any improvement. I did see that other reviewers have pointed out, the ingredients have changed from the original formula. Had I been able to try it sooner, perhaps i would have had a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after doing more research, I have been taking evening primrose oil has helped me tremendously. Prior to that I was taking resveratrol and tumeric supplements. Studies have shown that the combination of these two supplements combined reduce hair loss and while they did seem to help, for me the EPO works better. For the cost of these supplements I would try them first. I continue to take all these supplements but I would recommend trying the EPO first.</li>
            <li> Great value fast delivery. I do see a difference in just the first bunch</li>
            <li> wonderful lived it thank you</li>
            <li> My hair seems stronger with help of this product. I would recommend this product to anyone that is having issues with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Give it time to have an effect; it does work.  Make sure you get the correct system for your needs.</li>
            <li> Returned as one of the boxes was unsealed.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good, conditio was not as good as others, so don&#x27;t use it. The treatment is a must, it has slowed the loss, will continue.</li>
            <li> I have used this system for over ten years and this is the best price Ihave found. It appears to help.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. My head feels so good from the tingling of the shampoo and conditioner. I would recommend it to everyone if you have thinning hair and would like to thicken it.</li>
            <li> I love the Nioxin Hair System 4.  I have been using this for over 6 months and can see the results.  I think it helps to also take extra vitamins also with these produsts</li>
            <li> Pleased with results. My hair was thinning --I could see my my scalp. Been using the product for 6 weeks and my hair is supple and shiny with new growth.</li>
            <li> I bought the trial size kit. For me this was not working. Every time I used it my eyes would be red and burning. The conditioner you leave in your hair makes your hair sticky and dirty feeling. With that product in your hair your hair does not respond as usual to drying or hair product. I used it for about 2 months and saw no difference.I also learned it was my ION hair color that was thinning my hair, so this product was working against that factor. So if you are losing hair - consider your brand of hair color ladies- I missed that. But no matter, I would not continue to use it as while it did not effect my scalp with any irritation or itchiness my eyes were a mess every time I used it.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, my hair has become stronger, and It no longer falls out when I brush and dry it.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have my father&#x27;s hair and have extremely thinning hair on the crown.  After using this system for a month there is a very noticeable difference in the thickness and density of my hair. It even looks shinier and healthier than it has in years.  I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I can use on my hair, it actually has helped some of my hair come back. I love the price of the product on Amazon, it is way cheaper than my salon.</li>
            <li> Great treatment, leaves your hair very clean</li>
            <li> Love this hair treatment system.  Don&#x27;t need to use any other product on the market.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try this due to thinning hair on the crown of my head. I can see daylight through it. I started 8 July 2014. I can see a difference after a month - no new hair growth yet, but it has thickened my hair and the thinning isn&#x27;t as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. My hair has been thinning and basically falling out due to grief and stress, this product has really made a huge difference Thank You Thank you!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mother who has thinning hair.  After checking with her she says she sees noticeable improvement in the thickness of her hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the system for almost a month.  I noticed my hair isn&#x27;t falling out like before I started using it.  Will continue to see if growth develops.</li>
            <li> It is only 3 weeks into the treatment but I love the way my  hair looks after the treatment. it is full and shiny.</li>
            <li> Very effective  product. Timely delivery</li>
            <li> It was great arrived right on time I think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I bought it because a girl at the doctor&#x27;s office recommended it and she had this really thick head of hair.  So I bought it thinking it would do for me what it did for her. A year later, I&#x27;m still waiting for anything, any extra little bit of hair, just a few extra strands and nothing extra happened.  I do like the shampoo and conditioner because it gives me a tingly feeling on my scalp, but that&#x27;s about it.  So its just OK and don&#x27;t expect that it will change anything about the quality, thickness, or amount of hair you will achieve with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a couple of months only of the original formula and not this new one I just ordered.  I feel it leaves my hair very dry so after using the conditioner sparingly, I put a coat of Garniar&#x27;s 3-day treatment for 3 mins for more and then my hair feels soft. I will continue to use and see if it works to grow my thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend just yet.</li>
            <li> didnt love this.  My hair looked crappy after and it could not get tangles out. I had to shampoo after and I think that defeats the purpose.  Anyway, I didnt give it the whole try because I just didnt love it.</li>
            <li> Not thickening my hair yet but still hoping</li>
            <li> The shampoo has sodium laurel sulfate in it, which is a harsh detergent.  The solution used after you shampoo leaves your hair sticky and clumpy.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit to try this product.  Too early to tell if it is making more hair grow (product does not claim to do so) but it does make my hair not look so flat and it feels much healthier and stronger.  The shampoo does seem to be a regular size container.  The conditioner and foam are smaller sizes (this is why it is a starter kit).  That said, there is plenty of product for several weeks and I am going to order a larger size of of conditioner and scalp foam - I have plenty of the shampoo left.  Shampoo lathers very well so you don&#x27;t need to use much of it.  Although foam says to put on scalp and hair, I just part my hair and put it on the scalp and put another leave on conditioner on the ends.  I am going to continue to purchase this line.</li>
            <li> It seems to be starting new hair growing, but I&#x27;ll have to wait to see the full impact of the system&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by both my Rheumatologist but also members of my support group for Rheumatoid Arthritis for reversing hair loss caused by taking methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug used to treat immunosuppressive diseases. I wash twice my hair twice a week and use the serum every day, and combined with the Biosil (1 pill per day) and Biotin (5 pills per day) I have seen my hair loss go from filling my brush every two days to now losing what I would consider nearer a normal amount. I highly recommend it in combination with the other two products for anyone taking medication that causes extreme hair loss as a side effect. I and others have found it to be very effective. Lovely mint smell, too!</li>
            <li> Not sure this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> I was using this product for over 4 weeks, I did not see any changes. I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great Product and good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for awhile, and have seen a difference in my hair growth, and overall condition of my hair. I have my hair highlighted, and this product seems to be gentle with my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this set for the first time today, and my hair is bouncy, full and soft. I will check back in a month to report how my hair is doing then. But so far, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I love this!  My hair was getting so thin and it was already very fine but this has really helped my hair..  It has filled in and now has some body.</li>
            <li> Unable to use this product secondary to the effect on my hair.  My hair is thinning-(hence the purchase) and admittedly dry,fine BUT not in terrible condition according to my beautician (who HAD to cut my hair quite- a- bit.) This product damaged my hair so much---&amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; the ends of my hair--left the rest of my hair so dry could hardly get a brush through it as it was so dry/tangled.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different--so it might not have quite so bad an effect on others hair--but for me it was a loser.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in thickness of hair or any less falling out.  Really miss the nice scent of my normal redkin shampoo products.</li>
            <li> Great service and product!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. I can see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I am not a hater.  All of my reviews are based upon my personal experience, obviously, and this one is no different.  My hair stylist mentioned that my hair seemed to be slightly thin and recommended this product, Nioxin.  I was shocked and worried about her comments as I have never really thought about my hair as being thin so I immediately purchased the Nioxin system and waited for the guaranteed results of thicker hair.  So imagine my chagrin to see a dozen precious strands of hair in my hand as I was rinsing out the shampoo.  To see dozens more strands in the drain in the shower. More on the pillow and sheets in the morning when I woke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my hope that I can restore my normal hair status through supplements and continued gentle treatment of my hair.  If it wasn&#x27;t thin before, it sure is now.  DO NOT take that risk if you feel you have thinning hair.  There are other ways.</li>
            <li> Like this product, not really sure if it&#x27;s helping, but have to keep trying.</li>
            <li> Great product! Half the price of Walgreens!</li>
            <li> the only product I have used on a regular basis out of the 3 products in this kit is the cleanser that is specific to processed/dyed hair and it is slowly taking the color out of my hair, I have not noticed any new growth but I have also noticed that my hair is not falling out/breaking as much,the conditioner/scalp therapy I have only used once and the scalp treatment is totally useless to me because I am not out in the sun alot,(possibly not using all 3 products is causing it to be  ineffective) but if I were to continue to purchase anything out of this kit it would only be the cleanser, I have only used this product for a few weeks so I will probably continue thru another bottle to see if it is helpful or not in regrowth</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results from the Nioxin New System Kit#4. My hair feels so much stronger and looks much healthier. I purchased the products about 3 weeks ago and have already seen great improvement. I have noticed less breakage and loss of hair. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who notices that there hair is thinning. I would definitely purchase through Amazon when I need to replenish my product. There prices are much lower than any other store.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t  say if it regrows hair, I haven&#x27;t been using it that long and I am using it with Rogaine.  It has a peppermint smell, which I like.  It cleans very well. I&#x27;m someone with fine greasy hair and this give dries it out nicely. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend it to someone with dry brittle hair. It&#x27;s pricey so I use it 3 times a week and use a cheaper thickening shampoo and conditioner the other days. Doing that would also be a good alternative to those with dry hair who need the product.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not sure how it does it, but yes this product makes my hair thicker. Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination or maybe it&#x27;s for real, but I am sold on this product. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received my product in a timely manor.  So far I like the product.  I like the tingly feeling it gives my scalp.  Being that I only bought a starter kit I&#x27;m not sure I can say for certain that this product is helping with my hair loss.  I went ahead and bought the big bottles. I should be able to make a fare judgement when I am finished. In my search of this product Amazon had the best price.  Groupon didn&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> my hair began falling out in giant clumps about two years ago. having had very thick hair, i lost almost 2/3 of my total hair, there were little ghost hairs in the front by my once rapidly receding hairline. i am now back to half my previous volume, the hair loss has gone from scary sized clumps to a regular amount of hair and that receding hairline is now doing the opposite of receding, whatever that is. i&#x27;ve tried of a variety of regimens, vitamins, supplements and other hair loss shampoos. this was one of the treatments that i tried.  i used it faithfully for a couple two full kits.  the shampoo feels nice and tingly but it dries out my skin and does nothing for the hairloss, which continued unabated. one star because it really didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference after months and months of use</li>
            <li> Great quality and service. Received it in timely manor. Will buy again from this vendor. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only been using this system for a week, but I feel none of the tingling that others do with either the shampoo, or the conditioner. The scalp treatment is horrid...makes my hair very dull, and straw-like. I feel like I&#x27;m losing twice as much hair in the shower as I normally do and THAT is disconcerting when it&#x27;s the reason I bought Nioxin in the first place. I&#x27;m just not impressed with it, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone, and at that point, if my opinion has changed, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> Product takes time to work.  Does not have a pleasant order. Not bad but not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed any thickening yet, but I have only been using for one week. However, my  hair feels really good with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks but I see the improvement already.  My hair is softer.  I have a thyroid problem and my hair is in really bad shape.  But it is better already.</li>
            <li> My husband uses System 2 and loves it.  I purchased this product for his sister who also has thinning hair but perms.  She also has immediately noticed a difference in the thickness and manageablity of her hair.  She is taking this kit with her on a European River Cruise.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and my hair has been thinning for the better part of a decade. I tried rogain when it first started and didnt have great results. Its been getting worse lately, so I decided to break down and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression is WOW. My hair is super shiny and soft.  That itself is enough reason to keep using it! but I do think it covers my &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; better as well. As another reviewer mentioned, I use Toppik, but this morning i barely needed any. I have not had any of the redness/dryness/irritation other folks have mentioned. I do wish the conditioner was bigger - seriously who uses less conditioner than shampoo?! My guess is I will purchase them in liters next time. For now I&#x27;ve been supplementing with my regular conditioner every other wash just to make it last a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do color my hair, and have not noticed any significant fading from the shampoo, but then it hasnt been that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using the Hair Therapy Booster, which I purchased seperatly. It smells horrible. But the whole system seems to be working.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is nice.  It lathers well (not sulfate free) and my hair feels great after use. It helps a lot to control oil (I have extremely fine hair that would normally be oily by the end of the day) I have noticed that a bit less hair is coming out.  I was hoping for better results but unfortunately, I am not willing to use the conditioner or scalp treatment due to the horrible smell.  After using them, when I approached my husband he said &amp;#34;babe, you stink&amp;#34;.  Not the reaction I want to get from those around me!  I contacted the manufacturer to inquire about this and they indicated that perhaps I had received an expired product as it has a three year shelf life.  I looked all over the bottles, but could not find a date.  No issue with stink from the shampoo...so, I am thinking the products I received were fine.  Bottom line, too much money for a product I won&#x27;t/can&#x27;t use.  I might look for the shampoo again, but never the whole system.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I felt confident that this product would help me by my hair not falling out like it has done in the past and I am having the same problem...it has not helped.  Also, my hair does not have a lot of body to it.  I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t  work for me I thought it was something to help with hair growth I&#x27;m not impressed</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks which may not be enough time to rate.  The first few times after using products I had hair fall off.  This scared me because I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair as it is.  I have not had that much hair fall out since then.  The products did make my hair feel thicker but the scalp treatment makes my scalp itch terribly.  I have decided to stop using the scalp treatment but will continue with shampoo and conditioner and see if my hair actually gets thicker or I see new growth.  I figure I should know if it works by the 6th month of use.</li>
            <li> Like it, just wish I didn&#x27;t have to use it.</li>
            <li> Arrived when was supposed to and was as it appeared. I have already used these products, so I will always be happy with this product and will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and I have not noticed any difference. I am going to continue to use it to see if it takes awhile to notice the effects.</li>
            <li> Great price for a typically expensive haircare system, although I wish the Conditioner would be the same size container as the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on Nioxin about six months, using system 4 about three of those months.  I&#x27;m seeing results but they&#x27;re very slow in coming, but I think that&#x27;s because my hair has been unhealthy for a long time.  I&#x27;ve also been through many medication changes over the past few years and am sure that&#x27;s added to it.</li>
            <li> 25 year old caucasian female with thin damaged hair. Used as directed. I didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> It was the product recommended on the Nioxin website for my type of hair.  It is just awful.  It dried out my hair, made my scalp flakey (which is never was before) and my hair dull and without shine. I have stopped using it and would like to return it and say a few words to Nioxin about it!  The only consideration here is that 2 of the 3 products shipped to me were made in Mexico (the Shampo/Cleansing and the Scalp Therapy).  The 3rd product, Scalp Treatment, is made in the U.S.  I don&#x27;t know if the products made in Mexico are made with a different formula or not. In any event, the stuff is terrible and even my hair stylist noticed that my scalp was dry and flakey and my hair without shine.  Awful....I have gone back to using what I had been using before: Avalon Organics Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner (Biotin B-Complex Therapy) and my hair is looking good again and my scalp healthy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s helping my thinning issues at all--it does a good job of stripping oils and buildup</li>
            <li> I am at the six week point now with this and I guess its OK. I had a form of chemo that is for the liver called interferon that absolutely thrashed my hair and made me lose about 80% of it. I feel Nioxin is very drying - I have just now started to rotate it with the Orlando Pita Argan Oil Set which are my favorite hair products OF ALL TIME. That helps - my remaining hair was looking very frizzy with this. But others tell me its growing so I have to be patient I suppose. MY hair just got VERY thin and I had it cut to my shoulders from middle of my back case so much fell out. its already down to the collarbone after six weeks but to me at least is not that much thicker. I am seeing a few little hairs coming back at the scalp. I also take Hairfinity vitamins for hair. The foam that is rubbed in to the scalp must be used sparingly - you don&#x27;t need much cause all it does is dry the scalp if you use too much IMO. I think this is doing SOMETHING I just want to warn that this should be used in tandem with a milder and softer shampoo and conditioner as its a little harsh. Also Im using Orlandos Argan Oil again (just started a couple days ago) and that stuff is THE BOMB!! I massage it into my temples and all over scalp daily.  Im giving myself a year at least to get my hair back. Nioxin has a medicinal peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> My hair has been fuller and thicker from day one of using this product. Love it!!</li>
            <li> It made my hair very dull and flat so I stopped using the shampoo and conditioner. I am still using the pump product and will see how that works.</li>
            <li> not seen new hair growth yet</li>
            <li> Tried it for a few months - really did not notice any difference.  For the money - I would not overly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong .i feel the tingling in my scalp as soon as i put the conditioner ...so i like it so far but no seen the results yet!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the beginning of September.  I am so thrilled with it!&lt;br /&gt; My hair is feeling so much better and looks amazing.  I was very sceptical but it works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more soon.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 51 year old woman whose hair was getting very thin and falling out a lot.</li>
            <li> After 6mo chemotherapy I started using this product. All I know is my hair is growing and it feels like its thickening. I&#x27;ve only been using for approx. 2mo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure something like this has to be used for a long time.  4 weeks into it, I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet!</li>
            <li> Great product for those dealing with hereditary thinning of hair.  It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  This product does not leave a &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; feeling in your hair.</li>
            <li> exactly as represented</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as recommended by my hairdresser who said this was one of the products she learned about in school that instructors said was great for thinning hair. She never tries to sell me anything so I know this was a genuine recommendation. I read mixed reviews on it and decided I had nothing to lose.  The first day was great, the second day was okay and by the third day my scalp itched.  I decided to only use the 3rd step (foam) every other day.  The days I did not use it my scalp was fine.  The 2nd step conditioner is not very moisturizing so in the beginning I would use a light leave in conditioner and by day 6 I was using an additional rinse out conditioner on the ends.  By the 8th day I realized that I had to stop.  I had SO much breakage due to my hair becoming stripped of all moisture.  I made sure that I was using the formula for chemically treated hair.  My hair is now like straw and just running a cool blowdryer through it leaves a pile of hair on the floor with strands ranging from 1/2 inch to 7 inches long. My hair is now so dry and brittle it just snaps off.  I realize that this product works miracles for some people but this is not a product for all.</li>
            <li> Waiting on it to work...been a month. I am hoping for some results. I have really bad thinning hair. I will continue to use with HOPE!!!</li>
            <li> NIOXIN New System Kit #4 1x Cleanser 10.1 oz, 1x Scalp Therapy 5.07 oz... hmmm. There are 3 parts include. One is the shampoo, then a conditioner and then this amazing &amp;#34;scalp therapy&amp;#34; .. sort of a foaming stuff that give your hair body. This is the best on the market fo thinning hair. Fast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li> So far after only a month I have noticed that my hair does seem a little thicker after using NIOXIN but I know it will take a few months longer to actually know for sure. It smells really great too!</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out due to a medical problem. I started using Nioxin at the recommendation of my hair dresser. Within 30 days, not only had it stopped falling out, it started growing back. I was at the point of not wanting to leave my house because I was so embarrassed of my hair. Now it looks better than it has in years and people ask me daily what I&#x27;m using that makes my hair look so good. LOVE THIS STUFF!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!! I used it for a month and saw a difference in my thinning hair. Highly  support this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit but wish I had just purchased the shampoo and scalp therapy individually. I have short hair and the conditioner made it limp. The shampoo has lived up to its promise. I dont see my scalp as much anymore. I use the scalp therapy at night as it causes the hair to stick together. My routine is to use scalp therapy at night and shampoo every morning. I like this product and have ordered a big bottle of the shampoo already.</li>
            <li> Love this product..... My hair looks so full and healthy</li>
            <li> This product does wonders to make my hair look fuller and not so thin.</li>
            <li> It seemed to help but I don&#x27;t know if it did.</li>
            <li> Good product and price</li>
            <li> Excellent. Considerably cheaper than the Salon.</li>
            <li> Very excited to use this product.</li>
            <li> have been using for a little over a month now and I feel like more of my hair is falling out then it was before</li>
            <li> This product really works!! My hair was falling out and thinning because of pregnancy and this system helped to thicken and restore!!</li>
            <li> OK. So I was going to wait at least 30 days to see results, but I literally had to jump on amazon right after my shower because I had to get this out. Right after my shower I proceeded to brush and put conditioning in my hair but I started seeing how much hair I was loosing. It made me so frustrated because I wasn&#x27;t even losing hair like this before I started using this shampoo. It just completely contradicts the nioxin system. I&#x27;ve used it in the past and I do not remember ever seeing dramatic change but I only did it for two months. Nothing gives immediate results. remember that.  I was using Wen cleanser before and that is the BEST but does not make your hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be because the system 4 is too stong for my hair type. If this product really works like it says, I suggest going to the Nioxin website and taking the test to find out what is the best for you. And please use a hot oil treatment at least once a week to prevent hair fall while on this product. It is not fun. I will continue with caution the remainder of the Nioxin Kit and see how it works out.</li>
            <li> It made my hair hard and dry. Not sure why but, will try another product in the future. It&#x27;s not for my hair.</li>
            <li> A hair stylist recommended it. A different stylist recommended it several years ago, also, and I used it then but stopped. I really haven&#x27;t used this long enough to notice any difference yet, but I bought it on the recommendation of people who are familiar with it. I think it takes several weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> I have just started using it. I imagine it takes a bit to feel the difference. My hair feels &amp;#34; fuller&amp;#34; after using the 3 step process.</li>
            <li> What a great shampoo!  Love the tingly sensation that accompanies the use. The jury is still out about reduction in hair loss.  It seems to be less hair in the drain, but that may be my wishful thinking.  Love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel course...and after drying felt very dry and hay- like. Would never recommend this item. Sorry I bought it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many products for my thinning hair but I do like this line.  As recommended, I am not using the scalp treatment, just the cleanser and conditioner.  I then use the Nioxin mousse and hair booster treatment by Nioixn.  My hair looks thicker and full of body and is not stiff, looks soft and shiny.  It does make my scalp itch just a little, but not terribly. Buying my second order today.</li>
            <li> Nice menthol aroma and feel. Gives hair body. Easy to apply after conditioner. Shipping was very efficient. Still wonder why the the conditioners are half the size of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> hair is thicker; does what it says; came on time; the rinse is in a smaller bottle, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the shampoo;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 51 year old perimenopausal woman (gosh, that sounds ridiculous)...anyway, my thinning hair has been bothering me for some time. I tried Biotin for several months and it seemed to help somewhat, but my hair was still rather flat and lackluster and seemed to be coming out quite a bit when showering. I stumbled upon the Nioxin and read the reviews and thought, \\&quot;What the heck\\&quot;...so I gave it a try a couple of months ago and after just the first wash was impressed. My hair looked so lovely and full. And it continues to look full after each wash. I don&#x27;t think it is particularly good for colored hair (my hair color seems to be fading faster than it used to despite wearing a hat while gardening and running)...but it&#x27;s worth it not to feel self conscious anymore about my hair. I won&#x27;t say my hair isn&#x27;t still thin or flat...it is...but it looks and feels much healthier and I am only seeing a few strands in the shower after shampooing. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month. The over all condition of my hair has improved but not it&#x27;s density.  I do not detect renewed growth of hair at this time and I am still losing hair.  What this means it that my hair is still thinning.  I will continue to use the product and will probably purchase it again when it runs out since it is a decent product when compared to other shampoos and conditioners;  It works well if not better than others I have been using in the same price range.  As for the scalp conditioner, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s necessary but it is a part of the regime.  I hope after 3 months of use, I will detect a change in hair density.  To sum it up, after a month&#x27;s use, it&#x27;s either too soon to tell or will not be effective to stop hair loss in my case.</li>
            <li> Love the product. It arrived fast!</li>
            <li> My hair is slowly looking better and better.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my scalp real good. I expected my hair loss to grow in a little better and faster, but I guess everyone is different and at their own pace</li>
            <li> I have been using the products for 1 1/2  months now and really like it.  I started out with the #4 product but my stylist recommended the #3 so I changed over to that one.  Both of them work well.</li>
            <li> Received before I was suppose too get it.  Have only used product a few times.  Too soon to know if it works.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have bought it again.  It has made my hair so much healthier and removed a lot of residue that other hair products have left behind on both my hair and scalp.  Before starting to use Nioxin I was starting to think I was going to need a wig at 32 years old but not anymore!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  My hair seems to have more body after using it.  Recently I saw my hair dresser and she was excited to see thickness coming into my hair.  My thin hair was really thinning more, but due to using Nioxin it is getting stronger, and I don&#x27;t really have to style it because after use of system it falls into place naturally.  I want add that they have a face book page and are very attentive to it by quickly answering all of the questions that are posted.  Due to the fb page I know that they are a reputable and responsible that stands behind its product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a beauty supply store, and ordered another kit from amazon at a much reduced price. However, I am not satisfied with system. My hair was thinning, but I never saw hair in the drain or sink before using this product. Now, after the system&#x27;s use, I do, so I&#x27;m wondering if the product is worsening the condition. I am also taking biotin, a vitamin supplement which was recommended for nails and hair. I will continue with the system for a while to give it a fair trial, but so far, I&#x27;m not recommending this.</li>
            <li> great product. great service!</li>
            <li> I love the Nioxin 4 System. I had been using the WEN lavender before and my hair was breaking off. My hair is in much better condition since using the Nioxin 4 system - much fuller, shinier and healthier. I highly recommend this for thinning, color-treated hair. Wish I had found this a while ago.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair very dry and the leave in treatment burned my scalp. Only used 2 times.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use I noticed this system made my hair fall out even more.  I stopped using it immediately.  Won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> Great product that really works and a great price!</li>
            <li> Have been using system 4 for a week. Right away I noticed that my hair looks and feels fuller. The products don&#x27;t seem to weigh the hair down. The only thing I have to get used to is washing my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I love it the best I have every tried and I have used lots.</li>
            <li> I had used Nioxin in the past but tried other products. Had better results with Nioxin so I&#x27;m using it again</li>
            <li> I feel Much Much better , because it gives volume to my hair, but I don&#x27;t know the result at least take several months to see.</li>
            <li> My expectations were more than I actually got. Hair looks a bit fuller, other than that I am disappointed. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using every day since I received and don&#x27;t yet see any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> product good, helps decrease hair falling out. not sure about regrowth yet, too soon. upset as the picture and the product i received did not match - the picture shows the shampoo and conditioner being equal in size - both 5.1 ml. what i received was a reg size shampoo and a small conditioner. i have long hair, i needed equal shampoo and conditioner.  i specifically ordered from this seller as the pic showed the bottles to be the same size as opposed to other sellers with the big difference in size of the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> used it for 6 months.. just keeps the scalp healthy.. no improvement on hair growth... I am ok with it.. no dry scalp, no itching..</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning at the base of my forehead &amp; Nioxin really does wonders to help with hair production &amp; growth.</li>
            <li> it does a really good job of cleaning my scalp and keeping the flaky patch I&#x27;ve had seen childhood at bay.  My hair does seem to have more body.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are what we&#x27;ve come to expect from the market. It&#x27;s the scalp treatment that move this one up the laddeer of expectations.  An excellant product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help regrow hair. But does keep hair loss at a minimum. My hair loss has stopped since I started using this system. No new regrowth, but no more hair loss either.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much better, and now I feel better about myself.  Looks thicker and less oily.  must try</li>
            <li> Did not do much for my hair but dried out my scalp like crazy.  Got itchiness and dandruff.  As soon as I stopped using it, my scapt felt much better.</li>
            <li> I think I am just now starting to see some results.  I have been using the product for about 6 months.  I did share the shampoo with my 86 year old mother and she hasn&#x27;t experienced any hair regrowth yet but she said her hair stopped falling out after the first use.  She is very excited about that as well as the future outcome.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for 90 days with no noticeable change in my thinning hair.  I like the shampoo, I think it was good for my scalp, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to thicken my hair.  I have since purchased NeuHair and have been using it nightly for 3 weeks and I am beginning to see &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; in the areas where my hair is very thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and I haven&#x27;t seem any results yet, and it&#x27;s been more than two months. I got it because I was told that in a month I could see some results. Nope, not to me, sorry about that.&lt;br /&gt;delivery was perfect timing</li>
            <li> I love this and have begun to see  less hair loss,.  I think this is a very effective hair product for women with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Helped after pregnancy</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my brother to extend the life of his thinning hair, and it did just that.  I have now had to purchase it for my mother who recently underwent chemo.  Her hair seemed to be slow to come back and what did was very fine and downy looking.  I believe this product has increased the growth and thickness of her hair, it has really improved it</li>
            <li> Did not get any benefit from this product. Plus it uses harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist suggested this product about 6 months ago. My hair is so much thicker snd full of body! Wish I knew about it sooner!</li>
            <li> This product feels like it is working and it gets your hair really clean. I just haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my thinning spots yet. I have been using the product for about three weeks now. I know the directions say you need to use for more than 30 days or so before seeing results, so I am still hopeful!</li>
            <li> Great transaction / Great Item at a great Price</li>
            <li> I am almost 70 and my hair is thinning.  I have tried Nioxin 1 and 2 but Number four may be helping.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product and very cost effective when purchased through Amazon.com.  Prices paid at stores carrying this product is at least twice the price.  Recommendthis product to all.</li>
            <li> I found out thru Nioxin they do not sell any of their products through Amazon in any way. You may not be getting the correct product, it may be old, etc. They only sell thru Salons.</li>
            <li> Not great - I&#x27;m still losing my hair!</li>
            <li> My sister bought this kit &amp; was so excited to get it home and start using it; after about two weeks of regular use, she broke out in a rash &amp; had to discontinue use. I ended up looking through the ingredients, this stuff has blood thinners in it among a huge array of pretty intense chemicals. Plus, I&#x27;ve been reading that they recently switched production to Mexico? That just sounds so sketchy to me. If you want a sure fired way to regrow your hair, take better care of it, eat healthier, &amp; stock up on Biotin and Fish Oil. I have found no better treatments to growing out my hair than just simply taking care of it.</li>
            <li> I know some people had great luck with this product as i was hopeful. I had the same issue another reviewer had with more hair falling out after a few uses. The other issue i had was it totally dried my hair out and made it very frizzy. Also the mousse it comes with as soon as i put it on my head got itchy. My hair is dyed due to some greying and wavy. I also want to add that the seller was awesome, this product did arrive within like 3 days of purchase. It just did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> still using it - thank you</li>
            <li> I notice no difference</li>
            <li> Great for the hair. The Scalp Treatment solution makes your hair have lots of volume.</li>
            <li> The scalp treatment definitely makes your hair look thicker, but i have not grown any new hair. And it kind of dulls your hair, not a shiny feel.  I used up the conditioner and am still using the shampoo but probably won&#x27;t reorder them. I also use a foam mouse (another brand) which also makes my hair look thicker, so I will stick with that.  Glad I tried it, you never know how it will for you unless you try.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo. I am on my second week of using it almost every day. I use very little of the conditioner as it dries out my ends. I used the step 3 twice and won&#x27;t use it again. Overall I am satisfied and will only purchase the shampoo for a refill.</li>
            <li> Item came a described, still sealed in box. Great product.</li>
            <li> She likes it and says it works and has helped her regain some of her hair loss. SHe is in her 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> A friend urged me to try Nioxin for my thinning hair and, much to my surprise, it made a significant difference in the texture and manageability of my hair from the first time I used the cleanser, therapy and moisturizer in the System #4 kit.  I am recommending it to others as it really produces the results as advertised.</li>
            <li> I changed from the system 2 to system 4 due to I colored my hair and I am as happy with the system 4 as I was system 2.</li>
