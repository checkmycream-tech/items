            <li>Fantastic T3 Featherweight hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>Once it died, I bought a RUSK Speed Freak, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But this refusal made sure that never to shop again online (Amazon or elsewhere) for electronics.</li>
            <li>Better than buying $20 and $30 hair dryers every year.</li>
            <li>The dryer is very light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer was incredible for three months that it lasted before it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Would have given 5 stars if it actually lived longer than my school semester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best, professional grade, time saving, beauti-fying, weightless hairdryer around.</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Light weight too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny and more.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Makes hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, especially if like me you want beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact I ordered the T3 Featherweight 73808 and received the 83808 very fast, I must say that  I am pleased with the hair dryer and would order another T3.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend making sure the seller is legit.</li>
            <li>Received their T3 which  stated it was a knock off so immediately set the wheel in motion to return it for FULL  Credit and then called T3 to discuss this problem.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer works amazingly fast and leaves my fine, frizzy hair silky, smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, it dries it quickly.  </li>
            <li>Had this been a cheap hair dryer we wouldn&#x27;t bother, but pushing a $100 we expect a higher level of quality and durability.</li>
            <li>Ancient secret of the beautiful people revealed. :)</li>
            <li>so its not like I was just unlucky and received the rare defective one,</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is lightweight, durable and dries my hair quickly and with so much shine.</li>
            <li>I have to continually push the cool button to get the high heat to work.  </li>
            <li>First thing</li>
            <li>I received this around the first week of August.</li>
            <li>We paid quite a bit of money for this hair dryer, thinking that it would last many years.</li>
            <li>I think something I paid $130 for should last more than that.</li>
            <li>I have owned the T3 travel dryer in the past and just loved it.</li>
            <li>The only problem is the on/off switch is easy to inadvertently turn the dryer off when in use.</li>
            <li>But after, I got a new same T3 as a present from my husband about a year ago because we loved it.</li>
            <li>Little Cathy, happy at last!</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>She is very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really all about the hair dryer, ladies.  </li>
            <li>I don,t think this was the real thing.</li>
            <li>a bit more exspensive than other on line</li>
            <li>Keeps the hair free of static and pumps up the volume on my thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I loved this dryer so much but suddenly broken after about a year.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when the high heat doesn&#x27;t automatically come on anymore.  </li>
            <li>Good morning all.&lt;br /&gt;After one year of purchase and heavy usage by my better half, unit still up and running without even a single issue.</li>
            <li>It is misleading to state the motor only weights only 13 ounces, when the dryer, by far, weighs more than that.  </li>
            <li>nope, it seems like the only consistent thing about this blow dryer</li>
            <li>Not sure what the difference is with my original 83808, but should get it in two days!  </li>
            <li>Ultra Lightweight Professional Ionic Tourmaline Hair Dryer.  </li>
            <li>although I do not know how much I will receive, especially after I pay the return shipping.</li>
            <li>I must say that my wife (Professional Hair Stylist)loves the look as the hair dryer dries the hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this blower for my daughter in college after her old one broke.</li>
            <li>It was sent directly to her at school.</li>
            <li>This morning was a sad day; after 10 long, beautiful hair day years, my T3 Featherweight got its wings.  </li>
            <li>I plugged other things into the same outlets and they worked fine.</li>

            <li> but as I now see I&#x27;m not the only victim of the $160 bait &amp; switch.</li>
            <li> So disappointing since I paid over $100 for this blow dryer which is the most I&#x27;ve ever paid.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use this dryer as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair that I blow dry straight</li>
            <li> If you choose to buy one for cheaper you may run the risk of getting one without the UPC, ruinning your 2 year limited warrenty.</li>
            <li> It was used approximately twice a week for less than two months which equals less than 20 times.&lt;br /&gt;According to the return information, my ability to return with a full refund was Sept. 1.  </li>
            <li> Read the description of the product carefully.</li>
            <li> Just goes to show, expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean better.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to let people know that this is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thick hair and it took me FOREVER to get it dry with the T3 Featherweight.  </li>
            <li> and I straighten it with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> Also, when you depress the key for the \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot;, it&#x27; take some effort to hold it down.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly skeptical about buying a $100 hairdryer just for that sheer fact.</li>
            <li> Stop buying other low-end hair dryers that need to be replaced every 1-2 years and spend the extra $$$ on this one that will maybe outlast you ... just don&#x27;t drop it on a tile floor :(</li>
            <li> Does not overheat and lasts for at least 8-10 blow dries per day over 40hrs  of continuous use during all of her conferences/seminars.   </li>
            <li> This review is alittle late</li>
            <li> But I opened it only after few weeks of arrival and as soon as I plugged it in, smoke started from the cord, probably a bad cord.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, I learned this is a common issue with this blow dryer</li>
            <li> Had a bad product and complained  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating and a bit upsetting b/c of the cost.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in Amazon for having this vendor as a source, frankly.  </li>

            <li> I truly am very happy with how light this hairdryer is and how soft my hair feels after drying.  A big improvement over what I was using.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough great things about this hairdryer. I was incredibly skeptical about buying a $100 hairdryer just for that sheer fact. But after doing research on Amazon and some assorted beauty blogs I decided to do it. This is absolutely the best, professional grade, time saving, beauti-fying, weightless hairdryer around. Of course, I am not a connoisseur of luxury hair dryers but using this daily has made my life easier everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend making sure the seller is legit. If you choose to buy one for cheaper you may run the risk of getting one without the UPC, ruinning your 2 year limited warrenty. I have not had any problems with my hairdryer but some people warn of 6 month failures, so always send the warrenty card asap.&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I have owned the T3 travel dryer in the past and just loved it. I went to order through  Amazon who sent me to Discount Jungle.  THIS was a mistake!  Received their T3 which  stated it was a knock off so immediately set the wheel in motion to return it for FULL  Credit and then called T3 to discuss this problem.  FINALLY got Discount Jungle to work  w/me accordingly and T3 sent me the REAL DEAL Featherweight T3 and I am a happy girl  w/happy hair!  Just be SURE that you are getting what you think you are paying for,  in all areas of life!  I may have never had a prob. w/dryer from Discount Jungle BUT   it wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was getting and I think a potential fire hazard to boot.  I am disappointed in Amazon for having this vendor as a source, frankly.  Little Cathy, happy at last!</li>
            <li> Maureen C.      I love the T 3 featherweight hair dryer.  I have very curly hair and I straighten it with a round brush.  The featherweight dryer saves me lots of time.  It is very light, performs beautifully and it is also very quiet  It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I loved this dryer so much but suddenly broken after about a year. But after, I got a new same T3 as a present from my husband about a year ago because we loved it. Today, The dryer stop working again! I guess I would get Solano or Babyliss next time.</li>
            <li> a bit more exspensive than other on line</li>
            <li> Love this great ionic hairdryer.  It is light and easy to use.  Keeps the hair free of static and pumps up the volume on my thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is lightweight, durable and dries my hair quickly and with so much shine. I will NEVER use another hair dryer again!!! Worth every penny, especially if like me you want beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> Good morning all.&lt;br /&gt;After one year of purchase and heavy usage by my better half, unit still up and running without even a single issue. She is very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for this great product.</li>
            <li> The dryer is very light and easy to handle. The only problem is the on/off switch is easy to inadvertently turn the dryer off when in use.</li>
            <li> Read the description of the product carefully. It is misleading to state the motor only weights only 13 ounces, when the dryer, by far, weighs more than that.  Also, when you depress the key for the \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot;, it&#x27; take some effort to hold it down. Not the best functionality.  I would NOT buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love my hairdryer. It makes my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  It keeps my hair healthy and sleek.  I have a lot of hair, it dries it quickly.  Light weight too.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works amazingly fast and leaves my fine, frizzy hair silky, smooth.  It&#x27;s worth every penny and more.  It&#x27;s really all about the hair dryer, ladies.  Ancient secret of the beautiful people revealed. :)</li>
            <li> This morning was a sad day; after 10 long, beautiful hair day years, my T3 Featherweight got its wings.  I do think the only reason it may&#x27;ve died was from an accidental drop last week that loosened the motor, but to no avail, she&#x27;s gone! First thing I did this morning was order another one ... the T3 Featherweight 73808 (replaces 83808) Ultra Lightweight Professional Ionic Tourmaline Hair Dryer.  Not sure what the difference is with my original 83808, but should get it in two days!  I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this dryer works! Fast-drying, light-weight, non-frizzing, BEST HAIR DRYER EVER!!! Have had many friends use it when I shared when traveling together and they&#x27;ve bought one, too!  Stop buying other low-end hair dryers that need to be replaced every 1-2 years and spend the extra $$$ on this one that will maybe outlast you ... just don&#x27;t drop it on a tile floor :(</li>
            <li> I received this around the first week of August. Here it is Sept. and it refused to come on yesterday morning.  I tried the reset button. Tried plugging it into another outlet - nothing. I plugged other things into the same outlets and they worked fine. It was used approximately twice a week for less than two months which equals less than 20 times.&lt;br /&gt;According to the return information, my ability to return with a full refund was Sept. 1.  I am returning it anyway although I do not know how much I will receive, especially after I pay the return shipping.</li>
            <li> Fantastic T3 Featherweight hair dryer!  I must say that my wife (Professional Hair Stylist)loves the look as the hair dryer dries the hair.  Does not overheat and lasts for at least 8-10 blow dries per day over 40hrs  of continuous use during all of her conferences/seminars.   Despite the fact I ordered the T3 Featherweight 73808 and received the 83808 very fast, I must say that  I am pleased with the hair dryer and would order another T3.</li>
            <li> I bought this blower for my daughter in college after her old one broke. After going to 4 stores and looking on line everywhere I decided to buy this one because of the customer comments posted on amazon. It was sent directly to her at school. She said it works good and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this review Feb 2012 and it died March 2013. A bought this b/c of all the great reviews but as I now see I&#x27;m not the only victim of the $160 bait &amp; switch. I&#x27;ve never paid that much for a dryer before but wanted to get the best for my hair&#x27;s health and light weight. It didn&#x27;t overheat it just stopped working while in use. I tried for a week in different outlets but no go. Very frustrating and a bit upsetting b/c of the cost. I can&#x27;t recall if it came w/a warranty but my guess is it&#x27;s only for a year.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> This review is alittle late but I wanted to let people know that this is not worth the money. I head heard great things about the T3 and once my CHI Rocket died after 5 years I bought one. I don,t think this was the real thing. I have long thick curly hair that I blow dry straight and the T3 added 10 minutes to my blowout. It also only lasted about 6 months and then the motor died.  Once it died, I bought a RUSK Speed Freak, which I LOVE. I have also bought one for my mom and best friend and they love it.</li>
            <li> Had a bad product and complained  but then the seller - though it&#x27;s said nowhere in the policy - said that it&#x27;s a week or 2 over the 14 day period! But I opened it only after few weeks of arrival and as soon as I plugged it in, smoke started from the cord, probably a bad cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this refusal made sure that never to shop again online (Amazon or elsewhere) for electronics. I will never do that mistake again.</li>
            <li> We paid quite a bit of money for this hair dryer, thinking that it would last many years. Better than buying $20 and $30 hair dryers every year. To our surprise the T3 Featherweight 73808 stopped working after 13 months. Waiting to see if the seller will refund us our money. Had this been a cheap hair dryer we wouldn&#x27;t bother, but pushing a $100 we expect a higher level of quality and durability.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer was incredible for three months that it lasted before it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Would have given 5 stars if it actually lived longer than my school semester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-Powerful&lt;br /&gt;-Makes hair shiny and smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-not durable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I learned this is a common issue with this blow dryer so its not like I was just unlucky and received the rare defective one, nope, it seems like the only consistent thing about this blow dryer is that it breaks for everyone who purchases it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, or recommend it for anyone with thicker hair.  I have wavy, thick hair and it took me FOREVER to get it dry with the T3 Featherweight.  It&#x27;s a nice/quality dryer... and for thinner hair, it&#x27;s probably great.</li>
            <li> The hair drier just stopped working after 24 months. No dropping or anything like that. I think something I paid $130 for should last more than that. I will contact the seller and write here the result.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hairdryer on the market.  My hair has never looked or felt better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this dryer as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> I have had this since August 2012 and after reviews thought this would be a great purchase.  Imagine my surprise when the high heat doesn&#x27;t automatically come on anymore.  I have to continually push the cool button to get the high heat to work.  So disappointing since I paid over $100 for this blow dryer which is the most I&#x27;ve ever paid.  Just goes to show, expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean better.</li>
