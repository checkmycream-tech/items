    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have used Dove unscented bar soap for years and been very happy with the lack of scent.  </li>
            <li>However, given the excellent price point and the excellent results it is a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Lee Mellott</li>
            <li>So may people like me, were so happy with the product as it was.</li>
            <li>I use it as a shave cream and it works great.</li>
            <li>am now buying Aveeno Fragrance-Free and happy with that.</li>
            <li>Over time the ingredients in Dove Body Wash will build up so that your skin&#x27;s moisture level is greatly improved.</li>
            <li>I know this product is great from Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it, it feels good on the skin, but beware if you truly want unscented.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because I feel it is a good overal product.  </li>
            <li>They gave her seemingly good help of what to do.</li>
            <li>&quot; When I got this home it smelled suspiciously good</li>
            <li>After my best efforts to expel the product, I estimate that about 3/4 remains in the original bottle.</li>
            <li>Read the fine print on the label--it has fragrance in it!!  </li>
            <li>She looks much better but beware!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great smelling body wash, not too strong-a light perfume smell .</li>
            <li>So I was thrilled when I saw that this body wash was \\&quot;unscented.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Dove Body Wash is an excellent product to help the skin retain its natural moisture.</li>
            <li>I used to love this body wash.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Most anything can give me a rash.</li>
            <li>(wonder if that is safe).</li>
            <li>I will probably pry the cap off, or cut the top off, so that I can get the remaining soap out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all the reviewers who love this...</li>
            <li>I am upset--how can a reputable company call a scented product \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; and sleep at night?  </li>
            <li>&#x27;ve used it ever since &amp; been extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li>Well, okay, my wife and kids use it, I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>How a reputable company can be allowed to lie so blantantly is beyond me.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it has helped with my skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this again, better than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>I tried transferring the contents of the bottle into another, more easily squeezed bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sensitive skin formula may have changed a bit over time, but it&#x27;s been great</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light and clean smelling</li>
            <li>You need to give the soap a good rub with a washcloth to make sure it is completely off your skin.</li>
            <li>This wash leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy, and nourished.</li>
            <li>you want lovely, soft skin instead of buying a product that tricks your skin with a temporary good feel that never becomes permanent, try Dove Body Wash instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve trusted Dove&#x27;s products for a long time, but this turned me off of them for good!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t even lightly scented.</li>
            <li>I sound upset?</li>
            <li>a favor - ditch the fruity, scented, cheap soap and treat your skin with care.</li>
            <li>But if you use the wash on a consistent basis this can be alleviated.</li>
            <li>Very nice product, and goes a long way on a washcloth.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the scent it leaves behind, quite nice honestly!</li>
            <li>These bodywashes/shower gels must be potent to be so gently advertised.</li>
            <li>I love this soap so much</li>
            <li>try Dove sensitive soap, its the best soap I have used for my dry skin, and I have tryed alot of diffrent soaps.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product I was struck by the strong scent of flowers and immediately read the ingredients label.  </li>
            <li>I lay my bottle flat on the edge of the tub, and that solves the problem but takes up a fair amount of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(It says \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; boldly on the front of the bottle.)</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful shower lotion, very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>OK, I am sensitive to fragrances and scents in products.</li>
            <li>OK, maybe the soap part works for your sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve continued using this on my body and am not unhappy with it.  </li>
            <li>and she was sooo right.</li>
            <li>Body Wash ingredients clean gently and the residue it leaves results in a protective barrier on the skin to help the skin stay</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, but I stay away from cheap, strongly scented products because they tend to dry out my skin more than more natural products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great for my chronically dry skin, leaving me not only clean but</li>
            <li>It is also a very gentle body wash.</li>
            <li>I checked the ingredients and sure enough it says fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Many body washes create the feeling of skin softness but are actually stripping the body of moisture.</li>
            <li>And you will enjoy soft, sensual skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>How can you trust them to be consistent with their product line??</li>
            <li>sure enough, \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; is in there.</li>
            <li>They have silky, smooth, and soft skin.  </li>
            <li>This supposedly UNSCENTED product is most definitely SCENTED.  </li>
            <li>The SCENT was quite noticeable when I first used it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Plan on about a month of consistent use to get rid of most dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>with a feeling that my skin is softer and more moisturized than before I shower, which is a nice change from traditional soaps, which have always made me feel dried</li>
            <li>It was the only one that would keep my sensitive skin smooth and break out free.</li>
            <li>use it on a daily basis and found each day my skin becoming softer and hydrated.</li>
            <li>(I am sure they would become dry again if I discontinued use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a light smell to it but no added fragrance, so you&#x27;re just smelling the actual ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has a distinctly perfumey scent and if you truly have sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t imagine this working for you.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it, the kids really like the texture.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t use it thanks to its supposedly unscented fragrance.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Dove&#x27;s tricky use of wording on this product, I broke out in hives.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very scent-sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wont be buying this again unless they change the formula back to the original.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, when you read the list of ingredients on the back of the bottle, it says \\&quot;FRAGRANCE.\\&quot; Is this even legal?</li>
            <li>I seriously do not understand how Dove can call this stuff unscented when an odor clings to you for hours after using it.</li>
            <li>key to success with Dove Body Wash is to give it time.</li>
            <li>It actually made my husband and I have drier, itchier skin than usual, even with a good sensitive skin moisturizer being used afterward.  </li>
            <li>I bought this body wash because my piercer recommended it for my new piercing.</li>
            <li>I eagerly went to the store and picked it up, got home and jumped in the shower to scrub my new piercing.</li>
            <li>B001GBF0A2 sensitive skin bars]] are worth considering since bars allegedly last longer than body wash.</li>
            <li>After the first (and only) use of this product, I looked closely at the container</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time, and the entire house began to reek of perfume</li>
            <li>So the skin feels soft to the touch temporarily but quickly becomes dry</li>
            <li>My skin does not feel dry and itcy any more, if you have very dry skin like me</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to mark it down for the packaging, but for the future I would recommend that Dove put it in a bottle that dispenses from the bottom rather than the top.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when she gave me a sample of Dove (most of the products she suggests are expensive and hard to find), but this was a good call.</li>
            <li>I plan to contact Dove directly.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to all perfumes and don&#x27;t wear them.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks for my elbows to become permanently soft.</li>
            <li>I saw this body wash for sensitive skin, with Unscented on the label.</li>
            <li>But if your skin is sensitive to fragrance, like mine, or you have nasal allergies to fragrances,  DO NOT buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why not just say \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and leave it at that?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dove&#x27;s sensitive skin body wash for years.</li>
            <li>If you are scent sensitive avoid this product.</li>
            <li>The Dove brand is going right down the tubes with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I smell clean but no more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a bit more expensive than some bath lotions, but a little goes a loooooong way, so you use less than you would with some of the more watery bath washes I&#x27;ve tried lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is too thick to dispense properly and the bottle is much too large to hang onto.</li>
            <li>My extremely sensitive, dry in the winter skin loves it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is VERY fragrant and while it doesn&#x27;t seem too bad once rinsed, it wasn&#x27;t my favorite smell on earth.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, it is VERY fragrant and while it doesn&#x27;t seem too bad once rinsed, it wasn&#x27;t my favorite smell on earth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And, like other reviewers here, I bought this because I am sensitive to fragrance in soaps.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of soap for very dry skin, Dove Sensitive soap is the only soap that helped my chronic dry skin.</li>
            <li> note that one lukewarm reviewer marked down the product after it was damaged during shipping, and they never actually used it!)</li>
            <li> issue is that it never seems to last as long as a bar of soap will.</li>
            <li> She did not wash this off and awoke the next morning with extreme facial swelling and eyes, red, burning and peeling off</li>
            <li> people have dry elbows and knees in addition to dry body skin, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the bottle is a relatively hard plastic and designed so that you can&#x27;t squeeze it much at all, particularly in the shower where it is slippery and hard to get a strong grasp.</li>
            <li> I could have gotten past it though if the product actually worked as you would expect for a sensitive skin product.  </li>
            <li> I learned that after s&amp;h, it was cheaper to just buy 3 on sale at CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was confused by Dove, at how they label it \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; but the ingredients say \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give this to friends, but for me, because I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances, I&#x27;m using their sensitive skin bar soap, which DEFINITELY doesn&#x27;t have fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The length of time will depend on how dry your skin is.</li>
            <li> This wash doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but also doesn&#x27;t make it feel nourished.</li>
            <li> There might be a tiny, tiny scent, but it&#x27;s essentially imperceptible (\\&quot;unscented\\&quot; is printed on the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist in the past for treatment and recommendations, and Dove works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it had a flat cap, I would store it upside down so that gravity would help dispense the product, but of course, the cap is curved.</li>
            <li> It has a very silky feel to it, almost like a lotion, although it is a little thick.</li>
            <li> I have rough, undesirable skin.  </li>
            <li> Case closed.  </li>
            <li> This is the only soap product my wife can use, and it is not easy to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> only complaint on the product is it is hard to get out of the bottle when you are near the end.</li>
            <li> I am now stuck trying to find some other product that truly has no scent.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me due to it&#x27;s gentleness.</li>
            <li> other harsh chemical smells.</li>
            <li> This body wash is so thick that it&#x27;s hard to shake it down enough to squeeze it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Rather than waste the product, I tried it twice.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this product is heavily scented.</li>
            <li> I never have trouble with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they would change it.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother used an attached small bottle sold with this product, body wash.  </li>
            <li> I am scent sensitive, but convinced myself that it wasn&#x27;t that bad and continued with the shower.</li>
            <li> The product is thick and must be squeezed out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s related (could just be a hormonal thing), but my back and shoulders have also had a terrible acne break-out since using it.  </li>

            <li> disappointing, Dove!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> Then Dove went and changed the formula, and now I have horrible break outs all over.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely disgusting either way.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to love this body wash. It was the only one that would keep my sensitive skin smooth and break out free. Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all. Then Dove went and changed the formula, and now I have horrible break outs all over. I&#x27;m wont be buying this again unless they change the formula back to the original. It&#x27;s a shame. So may people like me, were so happy with the product as it was. I&#x27;m not sure why they would change it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Dove because it said unscented.  It arrived, I opened it and it has a fragrance.  I checked the ingredients and sure enough it says fragrance.  Totally confused how the Dove is labeled unscented but it is not.  The fragrance is not too overwhelming.  I notified Amazon of this issue and applied for a return. I was going to return it, but I had opened one of the bottles and they came in a pack of 3 so I guess I am stuck with it. I use it, it feels good on the skin, but beware if you truly want unscented. I plan to contact Dove directly. I gave it 3 stars because I feel it is a good overal product.  Two star deduction because of the mislabeling.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shower lotion, very thick and moisturizing. I use it as a shave cream and it works great. There is a light smell to it but no added fragrance, so you&#x27;re just smelling the actual ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to mark it down for the packaging, but for the future I would recommend that Dove put it in a bottle that dispenses from the bottom rather than the top. This body wash is so thick that it&#x27;s hard to shake it down enough to squeeze it out of the bottle. I lay my bottle flat on the edge of the tub, and that solves the problem but takes up a fair amount of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a bit more expensive than some bath lotions, but a little goes a loooooong way, so you use less than you would with some of the more watery bath washes I&#x27;ve tried lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Please note that one lukewarm reviewer marked down the product after it was damaged during shipping, and they never actually used it!)</li>
            <li> Bought this inially for my husband and he didn&#x27;t like it at all. Rather than waste the product, I tried it twice. I am sensitive to all perfumes and don&#x27;t wear them. Most anything can give me a rash. This product has a distinctly perfumey scent and if you truly have sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t imagine this working for you. The product is too thick to dispense properly and the bottle is much too large to hang onto. Very unhappy with this product. When I went to the Dove website to send my comments, the Contact Us button wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now buying Aveeno Fragrance-Free and happy with that.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin huh? Then why does it burn when I take a shower but with a generic J &amp; J Baby shampoo it does not start burning and itching after 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The only way Dove can call this \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; is because that must be the name of the fragrance they add to this product.  Unfortunately, it is VERY fragrant and while it doesn&#x27;t seem too bad once rinsed, it wasn&#x27;t my favorite smell on earth.  I could have gotten past it though if the product actually worked as you would expect for a sensitive skin product.  It actually made my husband and I have drier, itchier skin than usual, even with a good sensitive skin moisturizer being used afterward.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s related (could just be a hormonal thing), but my back and shoulders have also had a terrible acne break-out since using it.  Never again!</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of soap for very dry skin, Dove Sensitive soap is the only soap that helped my chronic dry skin. My skin does not feel dry and itcy any more, if you have very dry skin like me try Dove sensitive soap, its the best soap I have used for my dry skin, and I have tryed alot of diffrent soaps.</li>
            <li> Dove Body Wash is an excellent product to help the skin retain its natural moisture. Many body washes create the feeling of skin softness but are actually stripping the body of moisture. So the skin feels soft to the touch temporarily but quickly becomes dry again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove Body Wash ingredients clean gently and the residue it leaves results in a protective barrier on the skin to help the skin stay hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to success with Dove Body Wash is to give it time. Over time the ingredients in Dove Body Wash will build up so that your skin&#x27;s moisture level is greatly improved. And you will enjoy soft, sensual skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people have dry elbows and knees in addition to dry body skin, especially in winter. But if you use the wash on a consistent basis this can be alleviated. The length of time will depend on how dry your skin is. Plan on about a month of consistent use to get rid of most dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on a daily basis and found each day my skin becoming softer and hydrated. It took about 3 weeks for my elbows to become permanently soft. (I am sure they would become dry again if I discontinued use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want lovely, soft skin instead of buying a product that tricks your skin with a temporary good feel that never becomes permanent, try Dove Body Wash instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint on the product is it is hard to get out of the bottle when you are near the end. However, given the excellent price point and the excellent results it is a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Lee Mellott</li>
            <li> This is the only soap product my wife can use, and it is not easy to find in stores.  That&#x27;s why we like Amazon.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother used an attached small bottle sold with this product, body wash.  She thought it was a facial lotion, trial version.  She rubbed it on her face, eyelids and neck. She did not wash this off and awoke the next morning with extreme facial swelling and eyes, red, burning and peeling off ( we didn&#x27;t know if it was her skin or the product).  When she realized what had happened, I called the customer service number for aid.They gave her seemingly good help of what to do. We applied cold compresses and vaseline? (wonder if that is safe). She looks much better but beware! These bodywashes/shower gels must be potent to be so gently advertised.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased a product whose incredibly poor packaging made me vow to never buy it again. The product is thick and must be squeezed out of the bottle. Unfortunately, the bottle is a relatively hard plastic and designed so that you can&#x27;t squeeze it much at all, particularly in the shower where it is slippery and hard to get a strong grasp. If it had a flat cap, I would store it upside down so that gravity would help dispense the product, but of course, the cap is curved. I tried transferring the contents of the bottle into another, more easily squeezed bottle. After my best efforts to expel the product, I estimate that about 3/4 remains in the original bottle. I will probably pry the cap off, or cut the top off, so that I can get the remaining soap out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, like other reviewers here, I bought this because I am sensitive to fragrance in soaps. I was shocked to find this has a fragrance - despite being labeled \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing, Dove!</li>
            <li> I love this soap so much it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use to shower anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for my chronically dry skin, leaving me not only clean but with a feeling that my skin is softer and more moisturized than before I shower, which is a nice change from traditional soaps, which have always made me feel dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue is that it never seems to last as long as a bar of soap will.</li>
            <li> I am truly astounded that this product is labeled unscented.  Seriously Dove, do you hate your customers?  It isn&#x27;t even lightly scented. When I first used this product I was struck by the strong scent of flowers and immediately read the ingredients label.  Shame on you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great smelling body wash, not too strong-a light perfume smell . My whole family uses it, the kids really like the texture. It has a very silky feel to it, almost like a lotion, although it is a little thick. You need to give the soap a good rub with a washcloth to make sure it is completely off your skin.</li>
            <li> and she was sooo right. I was surprised when she gave me a sample of Dove (most of the products she suggests are expensive and hard to find), but this was a good call. My extremely sensitive, dry in the winter skin loves it. I smell clean but no more. Very nice product, and goes a long way on a washcloth.</li>
            <li> OK, I am sensitive to fragrances and scents in products. I saw this body wash for sensitive skin, with Unscented on the label. I thought, \\&quot;Great!\\&quot;  Bought it. Tried it, and wondered why my hands smelled. Read the fine print on the label--it has fragrance in it!!  It is not unscented!!  This is misleading labeling. I thought I would use it by the kitchen sink as a hand wash rather than a body wash, and it has enough fragrance in it that my cat will not eat her food if I touch it after using this product on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all the reviewers who love this...OK, maybe the soap part works for your sensitive skin. But if your skin is sensitive to fragrance, like mine, or you have nasal allergies to fragrances,  DO NOT buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I sound upset? I am upset--how can a reputable company call a scented product \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; and sleep at night?  Why not just say \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and leave it at that? Don&#x27;t make untrue claims on your label.</li>
            <li> I used this product for years, and then Dove changed the formula. Now I can&#x27;t use it thanks to its supposedly unscented fragrance. I have allergies and found myself sneezing every time I tried to use it. I am now stuck trying to find some other product that truly has no scent. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have used Dove unscented bar soap for years and been very happy with the lack of scent.  So I bought the body wash that says it&#x27;s &#x27;Unscented.&#x27;  Horrible!  Absolutely horrible!  If you have sensitivity to scented products, DO NOT buy this product!  The Dove brand is going right down the tubes with this stuff.  How can you trust them to be consistent with their product line?? You can&#x27;t.  After the first (and only) use of this product, I looked closely at the container and there&#x27;s a tiny asterisk next to the word &amp;#34;Unscented&amp;#34; and on the back of the container it says &amp;#34;contains neutralizing fragrance agents.&amp;#34;  So how is this unscented???  1-800-761-DOVE is the number to call and complain.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Dove&#x27;s tricky use of wording on this product, I broke out in hives.  I&#x27;m allergic to \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; which is actually an ingredient (I&#x27;ve learned)--not just a perfume.  \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; is mix of chemicals used to mask other harsh chemical smells. It&#x27;s in practically everything. So I was thrilled when I saw that this body wash was \\&quot;unscented.\\&quot;  Well, it turns out \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; is very different than \\&quot;fragrance free.\\&quot; When I got this home it smelled suspiciously good so i checked the ingredients and sure enough, \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; is in there. Too bad I&#x27;d already used it. I was itching all over for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve trusted Dove&#x27;s products for a long time, but this turned me off of them for good!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t order this again. The product is too difficult to get out of the bottle.  When I buy it elsewhere it takes only a squeeze and the product comes out.</li>
            <li> I had a skin condition several years ago resulting in a visit to the dermatologist.  Part of his instructions was to use Dove Body Wash &amp; I&#x27;ve used it ever since &amp; been extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me due to it&#x27;s gentleness. Despite the fact the label states it is unscented, I use it with a loofah and I absolutely love the scent it leaves behind, quite nice honestly! At times, I use a facecloth and the scent isn&#x27;t as pronounced. It is also a very gentle body wash. I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> My family uses this.  Well, okay, my wife and kids use it, I don&#x27;t.  They have silky, smooth, and soft skin.  I have rough, undesirable skin.  Case closed.  Get it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove&#x27;s sensitive skin body wash for years. I have sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist in the past for treatment and recommendations, and Dove works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive skin formula may have changed a bit over time, but it&#x27;s been great and I haven&#x27;t had any qualms about it. I&#x27;m such a creature of habit that I feel naked without it on the road. This wash leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy, and nourished. There might be a tiny, tiny scent, but it&#x27;s essentially imperceptible (\\&quot;unscented\\&quot; is printed on the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor - ditch the fruity, scented, cheap soap and treat your skin with care. Go Dove or go home! Also, the [[ASIN:B001GBF0A2 sensitive skin bars]] are worth considering since bars allegedly last longer than body wash. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, though.</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware!  This supposedly UNSCENTED product is most definitely SCENTED.  The SCENT was quite noticeable when I first used it in the shower.  I am scent sensitive, but convinced myself that it wasn&#x27;t that bad and continued with the shower. By midmorning I was in such misery from the remaining scent all over my body that I had to go back and take a second shower with another truly UNSCENTED product to make my day bearable.  When I looked at the bottle what did I see as one of the ingredients, FRAGRANCE.  How a reputable company can be allowed to lie so blantantly is beyond me.  If you are scent sensitive avoid this product.</li>
            <li> How on earth can they get away with calling this product unscented? (It says \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; boldly on the front of the bottle.) Just used it for the first time, and the entire house began to reek of perfume and I had to throw open the windows to stop from gagging. I&#x27;m very scent-sensitive. Sure enough, when you read the list of ingredients on the back of the bottle, it says \\&quot;FRAGRANCE.\\&quot; Is this even legal? It&#x27;s definitely disgusting either way.</li>
            <li> I bought this body wash because my piercer recommended it for my new piercing. I eagerly went to the store and picked it up, got home and jumped in the shower to scrub my new piercing. The body wash smells just like Dove&#x27;s bar soap. I turned the bottle around, looked at the ingredients and noted that the 3rd from the last ingredient is fragrance. Bummer! I guess it says \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; not \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;, so it&#x27;s not totally deceptive. The fragrance is very light and clean smelling so I&#x27;ve continued using this on my body and am not unhappy with it.  My skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, but I stay away from cheap, strongly scented products because they tend to dry out my skin more than more natural products. This wash doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but also doesn&#x27;t make it feel nourished. I&#x27;m indifferent to it. I&#x27;d use it again if it was around, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this product is heavily scented. It&#x27;s not just a masking fragrance, it&#x27;s freaking perfume. I seriously do not understand how Dove can call this stuff unscented when an odor clings to you for hours after using it. It&#x27;s very unappealing and should be considered fraudulent labeling. If you have any type of fragrance sensitivity, do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> I know this product is great from Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this offer on Amazon...I learned that after s&amp;h, it was cheaper to just buy 3 on sale at CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was confused by Dove, at how they label it \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; but the ingredients say \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give this to friends, but for me, because I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances, I&#x27;m using their sensitive skin bar soap, which DEFINITELY doesn&#x27;t have fragrance.  I never have trouble with that.</li>
            <li> I love it, it has helped with my skin irritations.  I will buy this again, better than I had hoped for.</li>
