            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I adopted it as a twice-daily habit without a care.</li>
            <li>Not too happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>The Airfloss itself is great.</li>
            <li>I asked my dentist about the airfloss and he also said good product.</li>
            <li>good...</li>
            <li>incredibly efficient and amazingly easy to use.</li>
            <li>Exceptional product</li>
            <li>The oral surgeon recommended this air flosser and we are very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>not as effective as a waterpick</li>
            <li>Although I thought it was going to be more potent; it does a good job cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>Easy to use, the battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>Flossing was always my most dreaded &amp;#34;must</li>
            <li>it is useful and good for teeth than dental floss.</li>
            <li>I love the way my mouth feels after using this.  </li>
            <li>You would think they would have better quality control than this.    </li>
            <li>We love these flossers.  </li>
            <li>I now floss twice a day, and my gums look better than ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased I bought this item!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is okay</li>
            <li>I feel like I am doing something great for my teeth, which, as I get older, I no longer take for granted.</li>
            <li>The air-flosser is easy to use and makes you want to floss every day.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and is great for times when you only have a minute before you run out the door.  </li>
            <li>According to the person I gave these to, Phillips customer service excelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my own Airfloss for several months now and love it!</li>
            <li>and my mouth does feel more fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>particle free feeling I get after using the Sonicare equals the feeling and ,perhaps, even surpasses the the dental office experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>CLEAN,</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, fires a quick jet of water/mouthwash to clean in between teeth.</li>
            <li>Holds enough for two really good uses.  </li>
            <li>Works OK, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t adequately replace flossing.</li>
            <li>and they told me they really didn&#x27;t have anything to clean!  </li>
            <li>the only improvement I am looking for is to change head more easily.</li>
            <li>and she also thinks these are way more fun than regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>So far, greatly superior to standard flossing.  </li>
            <li>Meanwhile I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it sure is easier to use than regular floss</li>
            <li>first...</li>
            <li>&gt; one of all two was out of order  in first week.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have stout shears to open it with</li>
            <li>I have replaced this  item a few times, not due to any issues, just a great health product</li>
            <li>The two-pack is perfect for me because we have a 2nd property that I keep the other one at, instead of bringing one Airfloss back &amp; forth, and I can use that one for traveling when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to big, so it&#x27;s easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely has strong force</li>
            <li>but the Airfloss gets as far down as a level 8!--and that is as good a recommendation as I can get, in my experience.  </li>
            <li>BUT, the Sonicare AIRFLOSS  is my new favorite method  of accomplishing this necessary task ....</li>
            <li>Unique design that blasts a very short burst of air and mouthwash, not a continuous stream (which it can also do if you want)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Much faster and more thorough, especially if you have any pockets between teeth due to crowns or whatever.  </li>
            <li>I should not be getting a refurbished handle when I bought a new one that was defective.    </li>
            <li>so much less messy and evidently much more powerful to get under the gums.  </li>
            <li>Comes with two complete units and tongue brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is a pulse type action.</li>
            <li>Philips was very cordial and helpful accepting it back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging is old style &amp;#34;gash plastic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My dentist&#x27;s hygienist recommended this unit and said that she flosses for a living and was skeptical at first, but now finds that this does a better job than she does and uses it herself at home</li>
            <li>My family uses these almost daily now and we received positive feedback on our last dentist appointments, so all is well.  </li>
            <li>The first few dentist visits were the first time in 40 years I didn&#x27;t get yelled at for not flossing enough.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mother and father, who have sensitive teeth and dentures, respectively.</li>
            <li>but the vendor sent me a different (old) model with just one charger and without tongue</li>
            <li>What I enjoy is filling the tank with half water and half listerine rinse.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and that is, dental floss only gets down as far as a level 4</li>
            <li> At least for me much easier than using floss</li>
            <li> I t definitely reaches the back molars and gums, just not successful in massaging the gums like normal floss.</li>
            <li> Takes a few times of usage to make it work properly.  </li>
            <li> I like it because,a contrary to the other models out there, it does not need a lot of water and does not take counter space.</li>
            <li> The other is still working.</li>
            <li> I will also add that the charger will also charge other induction devices, like power tooth bushes.  </li>
            <li> The other airfloss would not hold a charge and could not be used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; Flossing with dental tape is time consuming, and it&#x27;s an OK method of removing annoying food particles.</li>
            <li> The flosser works grest, but I received a package with missing parts.</li>
            <li> The dead one does not charge but it does blink green a few times then nothing.</li>
            <li> Once you use it you are so disgusted by how much food is left after brushing, that you use it every day.</li>
            <li> The instructions are a little weak</li>
            <li> I hate to floss, and using this makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with Sonicare&#x27;s customer service.   </li>
            <li> But for the equipment failure, this would be a five star rating.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for people who hate flossing.</li>
            <li> I hated flossing before and nothing could make me floss consistently until now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird not quite the string floss substitute, but close.</li>
            <li> not great if you&#x27;re teeth are close together.</li>
            <li> I hated flossing but this product I use every single day.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift, unfortunately one of the units malfunction and was returned to Phillips.</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s not so bad, and, as an added bonus, the Airfloss does a bang up job.  </li>
            <li> Gets into places between my teeth that are either unreachable with a toothbrush or painful with floss.  </li>
            <li> Hate that stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, I&#x27;ve had hygienists swerve into the BRUTAL territory when it comes to using dental floss/tape on my teeth and gums when it comes to the cleaning procedure.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Sandblasting nasty plaque between teeth!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  Flossing was always my most dreaded &amp;#34;must do&amp;#34; practice--now it&#x27;s not so bad, and, as an added bonus, the Airfloss does a bang up job.  My dentist was amazed at my last checkup/cleaning.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy arrived in good time great price would buy again!</li>
            <li> They work great my nephew told me about them he likes his. I asked my dentist about the airfloss and he also said good product.</li>
            <li> I have replaced this  item a few times, not due to any issues, just a great health product</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and is great for times when you only have a minute before you run out the door.  My husband hates to floss often and he loves to use the airfloss.</li>
            <li> get the waterpik instead. way better than this useless gadget</li>
            <li> Although I thought it was going to be more potent; it does a good job cleaning my teeth and my mouth does feel more fresh after using it. I like it because,a contrary to the other models out there, it does not need a lot of water and does not take counter space.</li>
            <li> it is useful and good for teeth than dental floss. the only improvement I am looking for is to change head more easily.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  Gets into places between my teeth that are either unreachable with a toothbrush or painful with floss.  The price for the 2 pack was a great deal, too.  I use it with mouthwash.  I feel like I am doing something great for my teeth, which, as I get older, I no longer take for granted.</li>
            <li> Well I won&#x27;t see my dentist until later this month but if this machine works it will save me a lot of time and money&lt;br /&gt;It definitely has strong force so I&#x27;m hopeful. Meanwhile I&#x27;m giving it four stars because it sure is easier to use than regular floss</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother and father, who have sensitive teeth and dentures, respectively. Works as advertised, fires a quick jet of water/mouthwash to clean in between teeth.</li>
            <li> My family hates to floss, so I purchased these and they work great.  My family uses these almost daily now and we received positive feedback on our last dentist appointments, so all is well.  I have a teenager with braces and she loves using this to get food out of her braces.  I have a younger daughter and she also thinks these are way more fun than regular flossing.  Even my husband who never flossed, uses this all the time now.  This is a winner!</li>
            <li> Sandblasting nasty plaque between teeth!  Felt immediate results in 3 days!</li>
            <li> I love the way my mouth feels after using this.  Very easy to get the hang of it.  Lightweight and comfortable to hold.  I use with mouthwash.  Holds enough for two really good uses.  Uses the same charger as my Philips Sonicare Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I hated flossing but this product I use every single day.  Easy to use, the battery life is good.  Exceptional product</li>
            <li> I purchased the 2 pack.  I just got the item Saturday.  One of the handles did not spray.  I contacted Sonicare and they are sending a replacement.  You would think they would have better quality control than this.    Update:  I contacted them last week about it and they said they are on back order.  I should not be getting a refurbished handle when I bought a new one that was defective.    Update: b21 plus days and still no word on a replacement handle.  Not very happy with Sonicare&#x27;s customer service.   I sent them another e-mail and contacted them by Facebook.</li>
            <li> Great flossing tool.  Comes with two complete units and tongue brushes.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Takes a few times of usage to make it work properly.  After that it works great and would recommend the product to anyone.</li>
            <li> not as effective as a waterpick</li>
            <li> Within a week I could tell a difference.</li>
            <li> We love these flossers.  We have used a water flosser for years and I have recently had an implant done.  The oral surgeon recommended this air flosser and we are very pleased with the results.  What I enjoy is filling the tank with half water and half listerine rinse. It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The Airfloss is a wonder.  It removes food particles that remain after I have used regular floss AND my Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush!  Who knew any remained?  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  I keep one at the office too.  Will give these for Christmas presents!</li>
            <li> I hate to floss, and using this makes it so much easier. It&#x27;s not to big, so it&#x27;s easy to travel with. I now floss twice a day, and my gums look better than ever.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes died last week. The other is still working. The dead one does not charge but it does blink green a few times then nothing.</li>
            <li> good... first...&lt;br /&gt; one of all two was out of order  in first week.</li>
            <li> Easier than dental floss and helping my gums.  I&#x27;m happy to say I adopted it as a twice-daily habit without a care.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dental hygienist--she told me something I did not know and that is, dental floss only gets down as far as a level 4 but the Airfloss gets as far down as a level 8!--and that is as good a recommendation as I can get, in my experience.  The two-pack is perfect for me because we have a 2nd property that I keep the other one at, instead of bringing one Airfloss back &amp; forth, and I can use that one for traveling when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the travel case, you don&#x27;t get it with your shipment; you have to register your product (give some personal info. in addition to UPC code from the package) in order to prompt Philips to send the case to you (in 4-6 weeks).</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift, unfortunately one of the units malfunction and was returned to Phillips. According to the person I gave these to, Phillips customer service excelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had my own Airfloss for several months now and love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased I bought this item!&lt;br /&gt; Flossing with dental tape is time consuming, and it&#x27;s an OK method of removing annoying food particles. BUT, the Sonicare AIRFLOSS  is my new favorite method  of accomplishing this necessary task ....if I want cleaner teeth and cleaner breath.&lt;br /&gt;The CLEAN, particle free feeling I get after using the Sonicare equals the feeling and ,perhaps, even surpasses the the dental office experience.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I&#x27;ve had hygienists swerve into the BRUTAL territory when it comes to using dental floss/tape on my teeth and gums when it comes to the cleaning procedure.&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t happen when I use the SONICARE AIRFLOSS.  I&#x27;m in control, and the cleaning /flossing job gets done with painless efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I&#x27;m relating my experience with this product...BUT, I heartily recommend the SONICARE AIRFLOSS  for those in search of cleaner, healthier teeth and breath!</li>
            <li> As advertised..........</li>
            <li> The flosser works grest, but I received a package with missing parts.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t adequately replace flossing.</li>
            <li> not great if you&#x27;re teeth are close together. I actually think it&#x27;s faster to get flossing sticks</li>
            <li> Have used this for 4 plus years. The first few dentist visits were the first time in 40 years I didn&#x27;t get yelled at for not flossing enough. I went to the dentist last week after a 2 year layoff and they told me they really didn&#x27;t have anything to clean!  Once you use it you are so disgusted by how much food is left after brushing, that you use it every day.</li>
            <li> If you are use to a WaterPic, you may not like this. It is a burst of air with a tiny amount of water. It is a pulse type action. I returned mine to Philips. You have a 90-day Money Back Guarantee. It did cost $13.00 for return postage and insurance. Philips was very cordial and helpful accepting it back.</li>
            <li> The product is okay but the vendor sent me a different (old) model with just one charger and without tongue cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;To me the vendor is not trustworthy at all!</li>
            <li> This is not doing what I thought it would do.  Not too happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after my dentist told me about it. I hated flossing before and nothing could make me floss consistently until now. The air-flosser is easy to use and makes you want to floss every day. Highly recommend it for people who hate flossing.</li>
            <li> The Airfloss itself is great. At least for me much easier than using floss or picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is old style &amp;#34;gash plastic&amp;#34;. Hate that stuff. Make sure you have stout shears to open it with or you may find yourself on the way to the emergency room from packaging inflicted wounds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird not quite the string floss substitute, but close. I t definitely reaches the back molars and gums, just not successful in massaging the gums like normal floss. I recommend using mouthwash instead of water in the fluid chamber.</li>
            <li> This thing is great!  The instructions are a little weak but if you register, they will send you two travel pouches.  So far, greatly superior to standard flossing.  Much faster and more thorough, especially if you have any pockets between teeth due to crowns or whatever.  My dentist&#x27;s hygienist recommended this unit and said that she flosses for a living and was skeptical at first, but now finds that this does a better job than she does and uses it herself at home (she didn&#x27;t try to sell me one).  Unique design that blasts a very short burst of air and mouthwash, not a continuous stream (which it can also do if you want) so much less messy and evidently much more powerful to get under the gums.  I will also add that the charger will also charge other induction devices, like power tooth bushes.  Worked for my braun so that&#x27;s a bonus.  Lastly, I&#x27;m an engineer who loves gadgets (according to my wife), but if this thing works it&#x27;s a must.</li>
            <li> incredibly efficient and amazingly easy to use.</li>
            <li> The airfloss assists in cleaning teeth and toughening gums.  However, it is not a replacement for flossing which should be done before using the airfloss.  Also my recent purchase was a repurchase.  After several months of use the one of the airflosses squirted out the fill hole while squirting out the head,  The other airfloss would not hold a charge and could not be used.  But for the equipment failure, this would be a five star rating.  Lou</li>
