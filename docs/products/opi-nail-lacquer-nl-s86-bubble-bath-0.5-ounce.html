            <li> I love the color, a friend saw this particular color featured in a magazine or on Pinterest, and I bought one for her and one for myself.  Like I said, I love the color, however to get the color shown in the picture, you must apply AT LEAST 3 coats which seems a little excessive to me.  When I use one or two coats, it is &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very sheer color-as expected. Nice formula.</li>
            <li> My favorite natural color!</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted. A nude, clean and shiney nail. This was the look I was going for and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! Product came on time.</li>
            <li> Awesome nude color. The bottle arrived broken the first time but the seller was great and replaced the item for free.  Recommend the seller</li>
            <li> My wife loved this opi</li>
            <li> I love OPI polish and I love this color.  If you want your nails to look neutral, subtle, and natural, yet have more brightness than your natural nails, then this is the polish for you.  For work my nails need to look understated and Bubble Bath became the solution.  I enjoy giving myself a manicure and with Bubble Bath my nails always look clean, neat, and perhaps even sophisticated.  This is my go to color, so I will continue to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Very thin. You have to put a lot of coats in order for it to look like the picture.</li>
            <li> Just as expected. A gorgeous OPI color that goes with anything. It is flattering to any skin tone. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this color. It&#x27;s the sheerest of sheer. It stays on for a long time as well. Goes with anything.</li>
            <li> One of the best soft pinks!  This is my second bottle, because, well, I finished the other! Glad I was able to purchase it, since I bought my original bottle, 2yrs ago.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color and I LOVE OPI nail polish!</li>
            <li> Perfect neutral color for everyday wear!!</li>
            <li> I love a feminine look to my nails and this color does it.  It&#x27;s light enough to provide a great cover without being too bold.  Simple, elegant color.  It&#x27;s my absolute fave!!!</li>
            <li> I generally like to wear the big bold colors in all the seasons. However, this summer I was compelled to wearing a soft, muted nude that was just the right hint of nude color. This lacquer it IT! The color is a soft, shiny nude with just a hint of baby pink. The picture shown is very true to what the color looks like. It is very feminine. It does take about 2-3 coats if you want to have a more opaque look but, I do not know about you, but I generally put on at least 2 coats of traditional bold opaque polish! Moral is--I do not mind having to put on extra coats. The lacquer lasts a long time. And since the color is so nude looking...no need to completely remove the color to reapply...just touch up! It is my new go to. I even went for it on my toes and love it too!</li>
            <li> Excellent neutral color for mani/pedi.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, same color name, lot # etc and loved this product. I reordered it and received a different color. I still love the quality of OPI nail polish but was disappointed by the color &amp;quot;change&amp;quot;. I will still stay with this company, though.</li>
            <li> Easy and great brush to cover entire nail.Fantastic color and anyone can wear it.@nd coat gives you another fantastic color (opi bubble bath)so beautiful and covers very nice.Thank You!</li>
            <li> Great quality polish.....must use at least 3 coats.</li>
            <li> super sheer lacquer, i didn&#x27;t realize that when i ordered it. i probably won&#x27;t ever use it, but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading all of the reviews. it got to me quickly, error was on my end.</li>
            <li> This came on time and I love the color.</li>
