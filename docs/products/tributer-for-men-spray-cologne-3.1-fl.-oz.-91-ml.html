            <li> Bought this product for my dad. This is the second time i&#x27;m buying this product online. He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I got this cologne for my dad. He really wanted it and since it is a MaryKay product, and I could not find a Mary Kay seller around here, I decided to come to Amazon to find it. The bottle came intact. The box was a little ripped on a corner but it was not a major damage.  Great experience buying it online. Saved a lot of time.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this for the past 15 years.  He always gets compliments on how good he smells.  He has tried others, but always comes back to this cologne.</li>
            <li> Men if you are looking for a sent that is clean, noticed but not over powering, please purchase Tribute&lt;br /&gt;by Mary Kay.</li>

            <li> I received an email that the item had shipped 6 days ago but my tracking confirmation has still not confirmed this.  A little disappointed because we were hoping to have it by Christmas.  Don&#x27;t order through PrettyOwls unless you have time to wait!</li>
