            <li>in all, I am very satisfied with the results of this product.</li>
            <li>What kind of business is this???</li>
            <li>This mask smelled nice and had a nice consistancy, but it gave me a rash.  </li>
            <li>and my face is loving this bee venom.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would perform better then it did.</li>
            <li>so it does help to moisturize however do not feel the sensation when I use the lower price product that I think works better from Natures</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fussy about treatments, and read all the reviews I can before purchasing, and I&#x27;m very pleased that I bought this product.</li>
            <li>My bathroom is filled with products that need to be in the garbage because that&#x27;s where they belong.</li>
            <li>Also was able to purchase at a reasonable cost in comparison to many like items.</li>
            <li>(I also purchased the eye serum, I sampled the products first as suggested and found no problem with the try out)!!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you do a patch test first</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anybody looking for a high quality product that gets amazing results at a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li>would recommend giving this product a try if you are looking for a cost conscious, effective, treatment.</li>
            <li>My skin felt softer to the touch, did my wrinkles really begin to fade, it sure looked that way in the mirror.</li>
            <li>She is now in her 3rd week and even more pleased.  </li>
            <li>Did nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely cheaper, but I would say it is not as effective as that product.</li>
            <li>Saw improvement after the first week.  </li>
            <li>would like to try this, but as a result of the potentially falsified reviews, I will wait until there are some more legitimate seeming ones.</li>
            <li>I have alot of wrinkles and love being outside in the sun and have alot of sun damage on my face.</li>
            <li>After first uses, I think it improved my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for the first time and I fell in love with it instantly.</li>
            <li>Just look at older pics of Camilla,Duchess of Cornwall, and look at her now!</li>
            <li>I using that mask for few month and have amazing result .</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and didn&#x27;t expect much but was I amazed.</li>
            <li>I spend so much money and am ripped off because they just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It really seems to work.</li>
            <li>You really can see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I am 56 yrs old and have tried so many different firming and sagging products.</li>
            <li>Within a few short days I could already feel my skin becoming more taut.</li>
            <li>Also, it has almost no smell, which normally I wouldn&#x27;t mind, but I miss the distinctive smell of the Heaven Bee Venom Mask!</li>
            <li>I naturally have very good skin, so any effects would be minimal, but after each use, there is a definite extra glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker, and I think it&#x27;s decent, but I probably would not purchase again.</li>
            <li>Its fine for a night moisturizer but probably not worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good value for money, as a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It smells very old, like old vegetable oil.  </li>
            <li>by the way, I&#x27;ve spoke with others who have bought and used products from this company and they experienced the same treatment, some even worse!</li>
            <li>I have no results with this cream, I even went as far as leaving it on all day as a moisturizer and still did not see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I,m  travel a lot and my skin so sensitive , but this product completely refresh my face</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get the same results as with any mask in a much cheaper price range</li>
            <li>My face is skewed towards an oily combination category, largely due to the all year round warm climate I reside in.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s any advice to take from the reviews of the others, this is it: please do a patch test on the back of your palms for any indication of allergy towards bee venom before direct usage on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old, so my wrinkles have been around for a few years, so I think it will take some time before I really notice a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just beware - even though one write up says to leave it on overnight for more dramatic results, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest doing that the first few times you use this creme.  </li>
            <li>They dried my skin out very BAD,along with creating major puffiness around my face and eyes</li>
            <li>But I can say it gives a faint tingle that suggests it&#x27;s accomplishing something; my skin is always very soft and smooth after I use it; and it has never irritated my face or caused any redness.</li>

            <li> , they all had only one or two, only LarisaM had a second review from earlier than October, and two of them only had reviews on other Nature&#x27;s Beauty products.  </li>
            <li> I was interested in trying this, but then realized that all of the reviews are within a few days to a couple of weeks of each other; between October 9 and November 10, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This made me suspicious</li>
            <li> It is nice and creamy, with a very faint honey smell.  </li>
            <li> In addition to using it as a face pack, I add a little to my daily moisturizer every couple of days and although I have sensitive skin, doing this doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought about asking them for a proper replacement, but I figure they&#x27;re crooks, shipping out old stock to suckers like me.</li>
            <li> True to its organic description, this Bee venom mask doesn&#x27;t contain any strong fragrance except a faint tint of manuka honey, which indicate less artificial flavorings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it once a week for a month or so, so it&#x27;s early days yet, and I can&#x27;t say anything dramatic has happened.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are ytalking about when they talk about their skin tingling and turning pink.  </li>
            <li> Try it for yourself without being taunted by opinions of other reviewers!</li>
            <li> so I looked at the previous reviews of each reviewer</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like some of the reviewers expected to get instant, dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> makes it worse, if you open the products to try them, this company won&#x27;t return/refund you money!!</li>
            <li> 30 days 3-4 times a week and still waiting maybe I need everyday or it does not work for guys.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy nor heavy.  </li>
            <li> I kept it on for an hour and ended up with a (forgive the pun) face that stung for a few hours!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t usually bash products, but this stuff AND shipping was expensive.</li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using the product for just over three months and have begun to share the secret with all of my friends.</li>
            <li> These People lie about their products, and don&#x27;t stand behind them as well!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve not given a review.</li>
            <li> Agree about the fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Too Bad for the rest of us!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These People lie about their products, and don&#x27;t stand behind them as well! They dried my skin out very BAD,along with creating major puffiness around my face and eyes (I also purchased the eye serum, I sampled the products first as suggested and found no problem with the try out)!! NEVER WILL I RECOMMEND this company or their products to ANYONE!&lt;br /&gt;What makes it worse, if you open the products to try them, this company won&#x27;t return/refund you money!! Why you ask, &amp;#34;WE DO NOT REFUND ANY PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN OPENED&amp;#34;! What kind of business is this??? How can you try a product to see if it works if you don&#x27;t open them??&lt;br /&gt;I requested help from Amazon and, well, that wasn&#x27;t any good either!&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to be taken for a ride, I suggest you take your business somewhere else!!!&lt;br /&gt;Oh by the way, I&#x27;ve spoke with others who have bought and used products from this company and they experienced the same treatment, some even worse! Unfortunately, they&#x27;ve not given a review. Too Bad for the rest of us!!</li>
            <li> Just finished jar.  I used every night and could not tell any difference.  Its fine for a night moisturizer but probably not worth the money.</li>
            <li> True to its organic description, this Bee venom mask doesn&#x27;t contain any strong fragrance except a faint tint of manuka honey, which indicate less artificial flavorings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say the effects from the product vary for different users. Try it for yourself without being taunted by opinions of other reviewers! Am very fortunate the mask works fine on my complexion. My face is skewed towards an oily combination category, largely due to the all year round warm climate I reside in. Tingling sensation on my face has been experienced without allergy or redness. Just diminished acne scars, lighten blemishes and dissolved blackheads after 3 days of disciplined application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s any advice to take from the reviews of the others, this is it: please do a patch test on the back of your palms for any indication of allergy towards bee venom before direct usage on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very satisfied with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> This mask smelled nice and had a nice consistancy, but it gave me a rash.  So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any changes on my face after using this.  Nothing.  I could leave it on forever and not feel a thing.  I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are ytalking about when they talk about their skin tingling and turning pink.  Nope.  Nothing.  Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would perform better then it did. It is very thick so it does help to moisturize however do not feel the sensation when I use the lower price product that I think works better from Natures Republic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this at night and do not wash it off till morning hping it will do as it says it should do. 30 days 3-4 times a week and still waiting maybe I need everyday or it does not work for guys.</li>
            <li> It smells very old, like old vegetable oil.  I put it on once and that &amp;#34;old oil&amp;#34; smell was on my skin even after washing it off.  I won&#x27;t put it on.  I thought about asking them for a proper replacement, but I figure they&#x27;re crooks, shipping out old stock to suckers like me. Don&#x27;t usually bash products, but this stuff AND shipping was expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it once a week for a month or so, so it&#x27;s early days yet, and I can&#x27;t say anything dramatic has happened. But I can say it gives a faint tingle that suggests it&#x27;s accomplishing something; my skin is always very soft and smooth after I use it; and it has never irritated my face or caused any redness.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products with claims to reduce the signs of aging, and nothing has worked for me quite as well as the Nature&#x27;s Beauty Organic Bee Venom Mask. Within a few short days I could already feel my skin becoming more taut. I&#x27;ve now been using the product for just over three months and have begun to share the secret with all of my friends. I would recommend this to anybody looking for a high quality product that gets amazing results at a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> This is the only Bee Venom product I have tried, but I am very happy with this product.  It is nice and creamy, with a very faint honey smell.  I noticed the tingling and tightening on my skin immediately.  I use this product daily, and I leave it on all night.  After two weeks of use, I would say that I have noticed some changes.  The texture of my skin seems to be smoothing out.  my skin is softer.  It seems like my wrinkles are starting to diminish.  I am 60 years old, so my wrinkles have been around for a few years, so I think it will take some time before I really notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like some of the reviewers expected to get instant, dramatic results.  Keep in mind, that the before and after pictures of Camilla before, and after, are 5 years apart.  So be patient.  A facelift is the only way to get &#x27;overnight&#x27; results.</li>
            <li> I have no results with this cream, I even went as far as leaving it on all day as a moisturizer and still did not see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The wife has been totally pleased with the product.  Saw improvement after the first week.  She is now in her 3rd week and even more pleased.  She will be giving me the heads up when she want to order her next jar.  Also was able to purchase at a reasonable cost in comparison to many like items.</li>
            <li> I was interested in trying this, but then realized that all of the reviews are within a few days to a couple of weeks of each other; between October 9 and November 10, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This made me suspicious so I looked at the previous reviews of each reviewer, they all had only one or two, only LarisaM had a second review from earlier than October, and two of them only had reviews on other Nature&#x27;s Beauty products.  I am calling shenanigans on the ones from the above dates (with the exception, maybe, of LarisaM&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to try this, but as a result of the potentially falsified reviews, I will wait until there are some more legitimate seeming ones.</li>
            <li> I using that mask for few month and have amazing result . I,m  travel a lot and my skin so sensitive , but this product completely refresh my face and I look younger , then 3 years ago . I rcvd a visual result after 3-4 application . Will recommended this product to my friends .</li>
            <li> I think this product is great.  It is not greasy nor heavy.  Just started using it so cannot rate how it will work as of yet.</li>
            <li> Thirds feel good, I have large pore sensitive skin, this works great and I will continue using it. A good buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to bees and have no issues with using this product.  I leave it on all night.  Skin feels firmer, but I can&#x27;t say I notice a big improvment or change.  Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Have used it 4 times now.  Started cautiously (based on others&#x27; reviews) from 15 minutes and now I am up to about 30 minutes. I naturally have very good skin, so any effects would be minimal, but after each use, there is a definite extra glow. I will continue using.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and didn&#x27;t expect much but was I amazed. I am 56 yrs old and have tried so many different firming and sagging products. My bathroom is filled with products that need to be in the garbage because that&#x27;s where they belong. I spend so much money and am ripped off because they just don&#x27;t work. I have alot of wrinkles and love being outside in the sun and have alot of sun damage on my face. I thought I would try this product because I have heard and seen great results. I have used this product 5 times and I love, love, love this product and I am seeing results already. I could not believe it until I used it and yes wrinkles are not as deep and my face glows. I keep the mask on for 20 minutes and now I am going to leave it on for 30 minutes because I have had no side affect and no burning or stinging and my face is loving this bee venom. Ladies and guys also, please give this a try and you will love it. Just make sure you do a patch test first but I think it will make a big difference in your life, It did mine.</li>
            <li> This product delivers everything it claims!  Just beware - even though one write up says to leave it on overnight for more dramatic results, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest doing that the first few times you use this creme.  I kept it on for an hour and ended up with a (forgive the pun) face that stung for a few hours!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you use with care !!!</li>
            <li> After first uses, I think it improved my skin&#x27;s appearance. I will post an update after more uses and let you know if it works for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would be an inexpensive alternative to Deborah Mitchell&#x27;s Heaven bee venom line. It&#x27;s definitely cheaper, but I would say it is not as effective as that product. It&#x27;s thicker, and I think it&#x27;s decent, but I probably would not purchase again. Also, it has almost no smell, which normally I wouldn&#x27;t mind, but I miss the distinctive smell of the Heaven Bee Venom Mask! Without any smell, this product seems a bit lifeless.</li>
            <li> Agree about the fake reviews.Haven&#x27;t used the product but dont like some of the ingredients anyway and their is no proof this products key ingredients are NZ</li>
            <li> Did nothing extraordinary. Not buying it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty fussy about treatments, and read all the reviews I can before purchasing, and I&#x27;m very pleased that I bought this product. It really seems to work. My skin is smoother and looks more taut. It&#x27;s really good value for money, as a small amount goes a long way. In addition to using it as a face pack, I add a little to my daily moisturizer every couple of days and although I have sensitive skin, doing this doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend giving this product a try if you are looking for a cost conscious, effective, treatment. Just look at older pics of Camilla,Duchess of Cornwall, and look at her now! You really can see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember though, if you are allergic to bee stings it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
            <li> With all the review posted, I was expecting some impressive results. I used the mask three times and didn&#x27;t see the difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money. You&#x27;ll get the same results as with any mask in a much cheaper price range</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for the first time and I fell in love with it instantly. I used it for 4 times and I felt the difference immediately. My skin felt softer to the touch, did my wrinkles really begin to fade, it sure looked that way in the mirror. All my friends are asking  me what I have been using. Am recommending it to all my friends, will order again for sure.</li>
