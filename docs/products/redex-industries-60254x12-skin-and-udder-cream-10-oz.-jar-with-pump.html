            <li>It&#x27;s particularly good for my face as it&#x27;s lightweight and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It feels good - not too greasy - and it works.  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I buy the odorless kind, and yes, it does have a nondescript medicinal smell to it.</li>
            <li>The guys are loving the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most attractive desk accessory, but I love the product</li>
            <li>The item has the same great udder cream inside that is an excellent moisturizer</li>
            <li>it immediately, used it immediately, and love it forever.</li>
            <li>better off just getting the tub.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more, unless I can use [[ASIN:</li>

            <li>I have the 4 oz tube of udderly smooth and like it.  </li>
            <li>Using Udderly Smooth</li>
            <li>I have found that you can use Udderly Smooth on your face, hands, and body.</li>
            <li>Instead of traveling around with 2 or 3 lotions, just pack up Udderly Smooth.</li>
            <li>The best and does not burn raw or tender skin.  </li>
            <li>Works great on dry heels, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li>This product it has light fresh scent, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.  </li>
            <li>Is not greasy, spreads smoothly, and is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Combined with the price, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>After I received and used Udderly Smooth body cream form Amazon, I went back online and bought two more.  </li>
            <li>my hands have an extreme drying/aging condition - and my hands are fairly hard-working hands too.</li>
            <li>but they disapear very fast.</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li>I opted for this one with the pump since it made dispensing the lotion more convenient, but I likely won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, even at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product as a whole feels good as a lotion, but it has synthetic estrogen chemicals in it used as preservatives that are not healthy.</li>
            <li>The large container and the pump makes it so convenient to use.</li>
            <li>The udder cream really did everything it claimed to do.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li>It is the epitome of non greasy and fast absorbing.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>Very soothing during radiation treatment.</li>
            <li>When researching Pacquin, I saw several recommendations for this Udderly Smooth Udder cream.  </li>
            <li>and it was not any better at helping my severely dry winter skin (I live in the northeast US).</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not worth sending back price wise.</li>
            <li>good for medical professionals and physical therapists who have to wash their hands constantly.</li>
            <li>Now that I have a beard, I&#x27;ve discovered it&#x27;s a great moisturizer to keep my stiff, wiry facial hair soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell, but it isn&#x27;t offensive.</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my oncology nurse but this particular item had a pump that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>However, I have used other odorless lotions before, and udderly smooth isn&#x27;t as foul smelling as the others.</li>
            <li>This cream takes care of my dry skin with no odor, no greasiness, quick absorption.</li>
            <li>I know that it was initially developed for cows</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for products that won&#x27;t affect my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin and this never causes any reaction.     </li>
            <li>When I smell the content, I&#x27;m not certain that it is actually the Udderly Smooth Udder Cream.</li>
            <li>So maybe don&#x27;t show the cute decorated lid in the photos if in reality its just a plain white plastic pump lid.</li>
            <li>To top it off, it is inexpensive, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pump tub came in a sealed plastic bag with some oozing in the bag as the screw-on top apparently wasn&#x27;t tight, but the lotion (after first few applications) has my wife oohhhing and ahhhing.  </li>
            <li>while i love the cream, the pump sucks!</li>
            <li>I did not really like that, but otherwise really healed and moisturized my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>My only reservation is that I bought a pump top several years ago, but the cream was too thick to flow through it.</li>
            <li>jobs require them to work in all types of weather, grimy conditions, and it is not hard to obtain rough cracked hands.</li>
            <li>The smell is neither good or bad in my opinion,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They have been using it, and they really like the fact that it isn&#x27;t thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> Makes application much quicker and less messy.</li>
            <li> I use it on the rest of my body as well to quench my skin and relieve the itching my dry skin causes in the winter.</li>
            <li> dry cracked bleeding winter hands.</li>
            <li> Including male lactation, breast cancer, early puberty for women, late puberty for men, etc</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t make you sick, but with enough of them across various products, they can have significant effects on the human body.</li>
            <li> WE have a very dry climate, and every winter, my hands get dry, dry, and start to crack.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, contains nothing (like alcohol or menthol) to sting or dry the skin, is fragrance-free, and sooths face and neck as well as hands and udder!</li>
            <li> My sewing instructor recommends it for sewers, because its it is not greasy and makes the hands so soft that it is easier to handle delicate fabrics without the snagging that dry skin can cause.</li>
            <li> I have hands that crack really bad during the winter and this stuff heals it better than anything else iv&#x27;e tried..</li>
            <li> After a few times using it you have to un-screw slid and force the lotion back to the bottom and center so it can reach the pump..  </li>
            <li> but I am disappointed the lid on the container I received does not have the Holstein cow spots on top, instead it is just a plain white pump I could have gotten anywhere.  </li>
            <li> My fingertips crack open, and get so sore that I can hardly use a keyboard.  </li>
            <li> Love the lotion, hate the pump..   </li>
            <li> I found that amazon dealt with my order with their usual efficiency and would always recommend them to other people</li>
            <li> A little too greasy, it needs to be rubbed in and toweled off.</li>
            <li> While on vacation, our host gave me some of this cream, and within  a  few days, my hands were healed, and the pain was gone.  </li>
            <li> I am usually allergic to scented products.  </li>
            <li> Cream was hard when I received it.</li>
            <li> the cream is so thick that u can&#x27;t get anything to pump!</li>
            <li> Instead of spending all the money on the expensive face care items, buy this inexpensive one and save your money!</li>
            <li> I get bad razor burn on my neck sometimes and the uddercream worked wonders.</li>
            <li> and I hate</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the lotion in the 10 oz is thinner and the lotion in the 10 oz container I got smells awful.</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed!!</li>

            <li> I have been using on my face for years...I am 45 and no one believes that I am this age. I have been stopped and asked what I use on my face. Instead of spending all the money on the expensive face care items, buy this inexpensive one and save your money!</li>
            <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve tried in years.  Is not greasy, spreads smoothly, and is absorbed quickly.  Works great on dry heels, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> my hands have an extreme drying/aging condition - and my hands are fairly hard-working hands too. this cream helps alot!</li>
            <li> I have the 4 oz tube of udderly smooth and like it.  For some reason, the lotion in the 10 oz is thinner and the lotion in the 10 oz container I got smells awful. The only thing I can compare it to is diaper cream.  I won&#x27;t use it, the smell is so gross and it was not any better at helping my severely dry winter skin (I live in the northeast US).</li>
            <li> I found that amazon dealt with my order with their usual efficiency and would always recommend them to other people</li>
            <li> I tried this product from a friend. I was so impressed at how well it worked, I ordered my own.  And it smells heavenly too!</li>
            <li> Cream was hard when I received it. The pump doesn&#x27;t pump up any cream since it only makes a hole in the cream.  Very disappointed. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not worth sending back price wise.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, hate the pump..   After a few times using it you have to un-screw slid and force the lotion back to the bottom and center so it can reach the pump..  Otherwise great product.. I have hands that crack really bad during the winter and this stuff heals it better than anything else iv&#x27;e tried..</li>
            <li> The udder cream really did everything it claimed to do. I get bad razor burn on my neck sometimes and the uddercream worked wonders. I have since stopped having severe razor burn, I still have one or two red bumps but they disapear very fast. The only thing I did not like about the cream is the scent it has. It smells like something that you might smell in a doctor&#x27;s office or at the vet. I know that it was initially developed for cows and so it smells that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Udder Cream for years as an aftershave. It&#x27;s not greasy, contains nothing (like alcohol or menthol) to sting or dry the skin, is fragrance-free, and sooths face and neck as well as hands and udder! Now that I have a beard, I&#x27;ve discovered it&#x27;s a great moisturizer to keep my stiff, wiry facial hair soft. My only reservation is that I bought a pump top several years ago, but the cream was too thick to flow through it.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product about two or three months ago. I&#x27;m always looking for products that won&#x27;t affect my sensitive skin. Using Udderly Smooth I haven&#x27;t had any allergic reactions and my skin actually feels smoother. I made my dad and brother try it as well. They&#x27;re jobs require them to work in all types of weather, grimy conditions, and it is not hard to obtain rough cracked hands. They have been using it, and they really like the fact that it isn&#x27;t thick and greasy. I buy the odorless kind, and yes, it does have a nondescript medicinal smell to it. However, I have used other odorless lotions before, and udderly smooth isn&#x27;t as foul smelling as the others. Besides, it won&#x27;t affect your perfume(s) or body sprays you may currently be using. The guys are loving the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell. I have found that you can use Udderly Smooth on your face, hands, and body. It&#x27;s versatile and fairly inexpensive. Instead of traveling around with 2 or 3 lotions, just pack up Udderly Smooth.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and now find that the best way to order it is thru Amazon.  It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> The container (a pump) had grime on the lid. When I smell the content, I&#x27;m not certain that it is actually the Udderly Smooth Udder Cream. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li> The item was not properly packaged. It was leaking when I received it. I contacted the company immediately and never got a response from them. I would never buy from them again. They should have responded to my problem.</li>
            <li> This cream takes care of my dry skin with no odor, no greasiness, quick absorption. I like the pump jar, although I wish there was a refill I could use...(?)&lt;br /&gt;Got it immediately, used it immediately, and love it forever.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hand cream. It is non greasy and works well to soften overworked hands.  The pump contained is especially nice.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used.  It is the epitome of non greasy and fast absorbing.  Super effective at moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li> while i love the cream, the pump sucks! its so short and the cream is so thick that u can&#x27;t get anything to pump! better off just getting the tub. pump is a total wate of money!</li>
            <li> The smell is neither good or bad in my opinion, just meh.  Regardless of the smell, this lotion is very good.  Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li> The best and does not burn raw or tender skin.  Also can be used as face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This lotion is uh-mazing. I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell, but it isn&#x27;t offensive. It&#x27;s rather neutral. This lotion is the only thing that works to stop my skin from peeling during the winter. I use it on the rest of my body as well to quench my skin and relieve the itching my dry skin causes in the winter. It&#x27;s particularly good for my face as it&#x27;s lightweight and non greasy. I tend to have sensitive skin and this never causes any reaction.     I would highly recommend this to anyone! It&#x27;s awesome :)</li>
            <li> A little too greasy, it needs to be rubbed in and toweled off.</li>
            <li> Almost a day after I bought this, I saw the same product in Wal-Mart for larger volumes at a cheaper price.... Irony&lt;br /&gt;The product as a whole feels good as a lotion, but it has synthetic estrogen chemicals in it used as preservatives that are not healthy. They won&#x27;t make you sick, but with enough of them across various products, they can have significant effects on the human body. Including male lactation, breast cancer, early puberty for women, late puberty for men, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the price, it isn&#x27;t worth it. I opted for this one with the pump since it made dispensing the lotion more convenient, but I likely won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, even at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it is greaseless but leaves my hands smooth.  I use this faithfully while doing my needlework.&lt;br /&gt;Also good for medical professionals and physical therapists who have to wash their hands constantly.</li>
            <li> This was great except for the smell. I did not really like that, but otherwise really healed and moisturized my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I prefer to have pump lotion on my desk just for ease of use. It&#x27;s not the most attractive desk accessory, but I love the product and I hate dry cracked bleeding winter hands. I will be buying more, unless I can use [[ASIN:B0007RB09Q B0007RB09Q]] as a refill.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my oncology nurse but this particular item had a pump that didn&#x27;t work. I would have returned but I didn&#x27;t have the energy.</li>
            <li> I ordered &amp;#34;Udder Cream&amp;#34; not &amp;#34; Body Cream&amp;#34;. It even shows on the label of the pic, &amp;#34;Udder Cream&amp;#34;.  This is NOT the same thing! Very very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Great skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The item has the same great udder cream inside that is an excellent moisturizer but I am disappointed the lid on the container I received does not have the Holstein cow spots on top, instead it is just a plain white pump I could have gotten anywhere.  So maybe don&#x27;t show the cute decorated lid in the photos if in reality its just a plain white plastic pump lid.</li>
            <li> Very soothing during radiation treatment. Doesn&#x27;t sting. Absorbs quickly. Definitely recommend purchasing the pump dispenser. Makes application much quicker and less messy.</li>
            <li> My wife was using an Aveeno product and her mother talked about a discontinued product(Pacquin).  When researching Pacquin, I saw several recommendations for this Udderly Smooth Udder cream.  The pump tub came in a sealed plastic bag with some oozing in the bag as the screw-on top apparently wasn&#x27;t tight, but the lotion (after first few applications) has my wife oohhhing and ahhhing.  A thumbs-up.</li>
            <li> After I received and used Udderly Smooth body cream form Amazon, I went back online and bought two more.  It feels good - not too greasy - and it works.  I am usually allergic to scented products.  This product it has light fresh scent, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies.  It&#x27;s glorious.</li>
            <li> The large container and the pump makes it so convenient to use. It is not greasy and absorbs rapidly. My sewing instructor recommends it for sewers, because its it is not greasy and makes the hands so soft that it is easier to handle delicate fabrics without the snagging that dry skin can cause.</li>
            <li> WE have a very dry climate, and every winter, my hands get dry, dry, and start to crack.  My fingertips crack open, and get so sore that I can hardly use a keyboard.  While on vacation, our host gave me some of this cream, and within  a  few days, my hands were healed, and the pain was gone.  Even better, the cream does  not leave your hands feeling greasy or oily.  To top it off, it is inexpensive, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this for anyone who has a similar problem.</li>
