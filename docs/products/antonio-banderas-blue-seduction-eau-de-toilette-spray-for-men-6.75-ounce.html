            <li>All I have to say is EXCITED, haven&#x27;t been able to find in my area for some time!</li>

            <li>There is nothing that smells better</li>

            <li>Wonderful smell that will definitely get you noticed by everyone around you.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love it and my husband too.</li>
            <li>fragance, long lasting, excellent price, good size.&lt;br /&gt;perfect!</li>
            <li>This cologne has a very nice clean scent very highly recommended</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s so cheap here.</li>
            <li>Nice aquatic, fresh smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>Blue Seduction is a great, clean, fresh, citrusy fragrance that everyone loves &amp; you&#x27;ll never get a better deal for your money!</li>
            <li>Smells great, you have enough cologne for a year.</li>
            <li>Recently i&#x27;ve been trying to use up and ditch the not so great cheapos i&#x27;ve picked up over the years and stick to my staples - acqua di gio, polo, d&amp;g, egoiste etc..</li>
            <li>Excellent aroma very seductive, really great not to strong but long lasting perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably gotten more possitive comments from both men &amp; women from wearing this fragrance than any other I own!</li>
            <li>I quickly pulled out my phone and used my Amazon app and found I could purchase for 1/2 and free shipping.</li>
            <li>buy in future and recommended, good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, thanks a ton.</li>
            <li>Product was shipped and received quickly.  </li>
            <li>He goes through it quick since he uses it all the time which</li>
            <li>very grateful and pleased with you, thank you very much for your help</li>
            <li>This cologne by Antonio Banderas is a crisp, clean scent.</li>
            <li>This one right here has always been my chick magnet;)</li>
            <li>Anyhow, blue seduction will remain in the line up simply because it is a great cologne -</li>
            <li>It was a fatherÂ´s day gift and he told us that it is a great spray for men, also the bottle is big enough to last more than 3 months</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li>Blue Seduction is simply one of the most under rated fragrances available!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>And lastly for $35 you cannot buy a better scent period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw for the guys that like colognes that women dig</li>
            <li>though all i mentioned are better than blue seduction, then again they cost double and triple the amount:)</li>
            <li>Still love the smell, get a lot of compliments, been using the same Cologne for the last 5 years, and still love the smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years now, buying the only size that was available (1.7oz) at a major department store.</li>
            <li>I had a really small size bottle and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t wear or smell like a cheap cologne, it can definitely hang with the higher up colognes - though I wouldn&#x27;t pay a premium price for it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Thanks for everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stating to think that I didn&#x27;t get the real thing.</li>
            <li>This stuff can be worn daily, sprayed well without worry since it is cheap.</li>
            <li>I really suggest this for you guys.</li>
            <li>Just 2 sprays is good enough to last the entire day.</li>
            <li>The price is better than in other places!</li>
            <li>Very strong fragrance lasting insanely long!</li>
            <li>quality colognes basically, less is more concept.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Decent fragrance, not as fresh as I had expected.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy saving half.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Black seduction as I got my first bottle of black</li>
            <li>I believe this is not the real thing, something is different.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for casual wear.</li>
            <li>It fades away too fast, I had bought my last one at the store and it seemed to last way longer</li>

            <li> Been buying this for years and every time I think I&#x27;ll try something new, I just end up missing this.</li>
            <li> One application lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> But little long lasting...</li>
            <li> We have paid the same price in a local store for less than half the size.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the 6.75oz was a misprint, until I checked the bottle when it arrived a few days later.</li>
            <li> Read carefully.</li>
            <li> From the least expensive  like Jovan &amp; Moschino to the high end classic&#x27;s by Killian, Creed &amp; Tom Ford.</li>
            <li> Was delivered faster than expected!</li>
            <li> but I can smell less musk.</li>
            <li> at this price point at least.</li>
            <li> they like to touch my chest and randomly smell me.</li>
            <li> Lasts max 5 minutes:((( too bad product</li>
    </ol>

            <li> All I have to say is EXCITED, haven&#x27;t been able to find in my area for some time!</li>
            <li> It was a fatherÂ´s day gift and he told us that it is a great spray for men, also the bottle is big enough to last more than 3 months</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and sexy. My hubby loves this cologne! He goes through it quick since he uses it all the time which, I&#x27;m okay with heh&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not expensive. Lasts longer then i thought for a cheaper cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price for the size either!</li>
            <li> Was good value for money. Just 2 sprays is good enough to last the entire day. Very strong fragrance lasting insanely long!</li>
            <li> Very light fresh smell, great for those people that spray on a ton and have no regard for others around them like myself. Been buying this for years and every time I think I&#x27;ll try something new, I just end up missing this.</li>
            <li> Good perfume,It is really delicious, purchase arrived in perfect condition, great fragance. I should have purchased more than one, very good. thank you!</li>
            <li> Blue Seduction is simply one of the most under rated fragrances available! I&#x27;ve probably gotten more possitive comments from both men &amp; women from wearing this fragrance than any other I own! And I have hundreds! I&#x27;m a fragrance buff. From the least expensive  like Jovan &amp; Moschino to the high end classic&#x27;s by Killian, Creed &amp; Tom Ford. Blue Seduction is a great, clean, fresh, citrusy fragrance that everyone loves &amp; you&#x27;ll never get a better deal for your money! 6.7 onces for under $30?!! AMAZING!!! You&#x27;ll never regret buying it!</li>
            <li> This cologne by Antonio Banderas is a crisp, clean scent. I would highly recommend it to anyone. The price was great also!</li>
            <li> My husband likes it a lot and I love the way he smells! The price is better than in other places!</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very nice clean scent very highly recommended</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy saving half. I visited a local perfume shop and this size was pricey. I quickly pulled out my phone and used my Amazon app and found I could purchase for 1/2 and free shipping.</li>
            <li> smells so good, bought it for my boyfriend for christmas and ended up keeping it! great smell lasted me forever</li>
            <li> smells good. the honeys love it. they like to touch my chest and randomly smell me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years now, buying the only size that was available (1.7oz) at a major department store. This is a much better buy. I thought that the 6.75oz was a misprint, until I checked the bottle when it arrived a few days later. I will be buying more in the future. One application lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> My favorite colonge. There is nothing that smells better</li>
            <li> the smell is awesome, the bottle is nice, the fact of paying like 30$ for a 6.75 ounce perfume that smell so good is awesome.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle! Was delivered faster than expected!</li>
            <li> The scent does not last long!</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I wear and I love that it&#x27;s so cheap here. It arrived before time so I was happy about that also. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Great light summery smell.  I had a really small size bottle and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great and I just love the scent as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this mens frangrance</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell that will definitely get you noticed by everyone around you. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a while now and will continue to keep it as an option in my collection.</li>
            <li> Excellent, would recommend</li>
            <li> Very nice smell it&#x27;s good for casual wear. But little long lasting... Spray twice a day... Smell bergamot  cardamom but I can smell less musk. I don&#x27;t find apple smell, cappuccino it&#x27;s ok I don&#x27;t like apple cappuccino smell.. But it&#x27;s nice I like it better than Black seduction as I got my first bottle of black seduction.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy in future and recommended, good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- HP</li>
            <li> muy exquisito y la presentaciÃ³n es fenomenal, lo recomiendo para toda ocasion 100% recomendado tanto para dama como caballero de seguro le va a gustar</li>
            <li> This is an awesome bottle of cologne for such a wonderful price and the arrival was very quick and would recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> Very responsible in delivery, excellent quality is a great fragrance. Thanks for everything.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Smelled it on a co worker, asked what it was called, bought my own.  Great smell, great price, great buy.  Love it, thanks a ton.</li>
            <li> I believe this is not the real thing, something is different. It doesn&#x27;t last long. I used to sell perfumes and colognes and I know how long they should last. Personally I don&#x27;t buy it off. I thought you should all know that.</li>
            <li> It fades away too fast, I had bought my last one at the store and it seemed to last way longer...... I&#x27;m stating to think that I didn&#x27;t get the real thing.</li>
            <li> Antonio Banderas Blue Seduction Eau De Toilette Spray for Men, 6.75 Ounce exelent</li>
            <li> Nice aquatic, fresh smelling cologne. Smells similar to acqua di gio yet at the same time different. I have a ton of colognes(100s) and this is one of my faves. Recently i&#x27;ve been trying to use up and ditch the not so great cheapos i&#x27;ve picked up over the years and stick to my staples - acqua di gio, polo, d&amp;g, egoiste etc.. quality colognes basically, less is more concept. Anyhow, blue seduction will remain in the line up simply because it is a great cologne - at this price point at least. $35 bucks for a 200ml bottle is amazing! it doesn&#x27;t wear or smell like a cheap cologne, it can definitely hang with the higher up colognes - though I wouldn&#x27;t pay a premium price for it. Odds are if you are buying a 6.7oz bottle you know what you are getting. If you are on the fence just pick up a 50-100ml for $25-35, that is what I did and I have no problems committing to the bigger bottle. This stuff can be worn daily, sprayed well without worry since it is cheap. Definite thumbs up. And lastly for $35 you cannot buy a better scent period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw for the guys that like colognes that women dig, this is one em, along with acqua di gio, d&amp;g, d&amp;g, issey miyake, le male etc.. though all i mentioned are better than blue seduction, then again they cost double and triple the amount:)</li>
            <li> I want to eat my husband up when he wears this cologne!!</li>
            <li> I love it and my husband too. Excellent aroma very seductive, really great not to strong but long lasting perfume.</li>
