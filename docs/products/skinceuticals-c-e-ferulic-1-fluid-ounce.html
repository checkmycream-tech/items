            <li>Amazing product for aging, sun spots, wrinkles!</li>
            <li>Great product and good delivery</li>
            <li>It makes your skin bright</li>
            <li>You could even space it out every 3 days or so and if you have an event coming up where you want your face to look really good, use it 3 days in a row before the event.</li>
            <li>You should apply a good moisturizer after the serum has been absorbed.inkles</li>
            <li>Maybe 3 stars isn&#x27;t fair because not everyone deals with rosacea.</li>
            <li>This is the most incredible product ever, and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and this is a good choice</li>
            <li>l have used skin ceuticals for over 2 years now and l am very pleased with their products,creams thank you</li>
            <li>Now, I do still have some fine lines, and yes, some wrinkles too, but I had not received comments about having beautiful skin for about 12 years.  </li>
            <li>Now, I do still have some fine lines, and yes, some wrinkles too, but I had not received comments about having beautiful skin for about 12 years.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>So glad my deatologist recommended it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Priced way better than the manufactures website!</li>
            <li>Use this all the time, love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58:)  SOLD!</li>
            <li>bright and smooth!</li>
            <li>The product is amazing, I can see a substantial change in the amount of moisture in my skin when using this product combined with the B5 gel.  </li>
            <li>I used it for two weeks and saw some amazing results.</li>
            <li>Oxidized vitamin C will do more harm than good.</li>
            <li>Excellent product would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Been using for years and makes my skin look nice.</li>
            <li>I heard the SkinCeuticals products are effective.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, but i dont like to rece this without box.</li>
            <li>The product itself is excellent: if you haven&#x27;t tried a good vitamin C topical you need to do it for your skin - increased protection from sun exposure / clarification and brightening of skin / improved skin tone and elasticity.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine who is an esthetician gave me a facial and told me this was the best to keep your skin looking really good.</li>
            <li>Love it and love what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product for your skin.</li>
            <li>It is the most effective treatment for hyper pigmentation issues.</li>
            <li>I found an excellent dermatologist, and the first thing that she recommended was a CO2 treatment to correct the light brown sunspots that I had been accumulating over the years.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast service!</li>
            <li>Zits gone, face is very smooth, cheeks are rosy and glowing even.</li>
            <li>I feel really healthy when I use this on my face.</li>
            <li>The best facial serum</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I paid a lot more from my surgeon</li>
            <li>LOVE IT..</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to do with this, but my aestitition gave me a sample.</li>
            <li>Keeping my skin hydrated and nourished is a top priority.</li>
            <li>CE Ferulic, thanks to my beauty adviser, has been a great help.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter,and looks better every week.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite skin product..</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>This antioxidant combination enhances protection against damaging UV rays to better prevent visible signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should apply a good moisturizer after the serum has been absorbed.</li>
            <li>Do not purchase products from Advanced Skincare LLC!</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I am sure many people have used this with no side effects whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely yours Jennifer Marciano</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed as this product is pricey and had great reviews...</li>
            <li>I have been using it every day since then and love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for 8 years.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year, love it.  </li>
            <li>Many years using this F.A.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worked in with a routine if many products.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>Love everything about it, the perfume, the texture and the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I try many beauty items but this is a staple of mine..</li>
            <li>Everything was ok.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing this product at my drs office and it was much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>Of course, what I didn&#x27;t realize was that once the bags went away, the skin was more wrinkled as the bags had been stretching that skin,</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the SkinCeuticals product to see if they diminish the wrinkles now as they did the bags from my eyes.  :-)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me.</li>
            <li>Love skin ceuticals products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s approved by a dermatologist, many products are.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it...</li>
            <li>I have used this product consistently for years (and loved it), but never purchased it from this company on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but the smell goes away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are a great natural sunscreen and antioxidant.</li>
            <li>The skin around my chin was drying, then peeling, then becoming inflamed.</li>
            <li>I will continue using SkinCeuticals products however I will be purchasing them from the SkinCeutical website or a spa salon that is a SkinCeutical retailer to ensure that the product is handled correctly so that it will stay fresh and work effectively.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick.  </li>
            <li>Living in the arid Southwest and also growing more &amp;#34;senior,&amp;#34; I do not take for granted that my face will continue looking fresh and healthy unless I nurture it.</li>
            <li>found it too strong for my neck.</li>
            <li>I had loved TNS but the new TNS formula has an overpowering perfume smell.  </li>
            <li>Every couple of days is fine to keep your skin glowing.</li>
            <li>This was recommended as being fine for people with rosacea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m watching fine lines diminish.</li>
            <li>The rest of my face and neck/chest was fine</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m 48 and have acne prone skin, brown spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li>So, maybe I don&#x27;t look a whole lot younger, but I do look better, much better, because now I have beautiful</li>
            <li>So, maybe I don&#x27;t look a whole lot younger, but I do look better, much better, because now I have beautiful</li>
            <li>Smooth and even.</li>
            <li>So, again, fantastic product; caveat emptor with regard to vendor.</li>
            <li>E Ferulic is a revolutionary antioxidant combination that delivers advanced environmental protection against photoaging by neutralizing free radicals that cause accelerated signs of aging.</li>
            <li>Neutralizes damaging free radicals and protects skin&#x27;s breakdown from oxidative stress.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Provides advanced environmental protection against damaging free radicals induced by UVA, UVB, and infrared radiation A</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>I did buy samples and from an online vendor that was credible.</li>
            <li>I like this product and trust that  the skinceutical line is good for my mature skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t loved this product as much as some of the people I talked to, which tells me that perhaps my skin just isn&#x27;t right for it.</li>
            <li>, I have been receiving the most positive comments from acquaintances, friends, and total strangers that I have \\&quot;beautiful skin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>, I have been receiving the most positive comments from acquaintances, friends, and total strangers that I have \\&quot;beautiful skin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Heard so many positive reviews I had to try it !  </li>
            <li>At first the smell put me off, but this is a very good vitamin C product that has become my daily &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and quick absorption into your skin .  </li>
            <li>On weekend mornings I skip foundation and use TiSilc tinted sunblock as I spend more time in the sun running errands and need the higher SPF.  </li>
            <li>I already used a full bottle.</li>
            <li>Hope it&#x27;s not bad..</li>
            <li>I am 42, have light complexion and a reasonably smooth skin of which I always took good care, but I also have dark sun spots on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper here than I have found it anywhere else locally (or even online unless a skincare site is having a great sale)</li>
            <li>I know my skin will benefit from this product tremendously, but I just can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li>love it, makes my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Product was delivered quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I made the unwise choice to buy on Amazon (via Beauty Perfect) to get a better deal.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my face look smooth and feel soft.</li>
            <li>It drys quickly, leaving a</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast thought!</li>
            <li>Good , same exact thing .</li>
            <li>A real find to help deal with aging skin!!</li>
            <li>The entire line is amazing and a must have for anti aging.</li>
            <li>This stuff is definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and my skin looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still deciding whether this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Getting a bottle of clear product from this company has been challenging; I received product from them that was almost brown in color.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t offer to replace my product with a verified fresh product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about six weeks now, and this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Once absorbed, this serum cannot be washed or rubbed off.  </li>
            <li>Once absorbed, this serum cannot be washed or rubbed off.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>right..</li>
            <li>Well, I was moderately impressed with a few claims, especially the claim that stated that Once absorbed, this serum can&#x27;t be washed or rubbed off.  </li>
            <li>Well, I was moderately impressed with a few claims, especially the claim that stated that Once absorbed, this serum can&#x27;t be washed or rubbed off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mid-40&#x27;s and have tried and discarded a huge number of prescrip and over-the-counter skin products for my adult acne, rosacea and seb derm.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the cardboard box in which it was shipped, I noticed there was what appeared to be yellowed product stained on the Skinceuticals box, as if it had leaked.</li>
            <li>Nothing works as well as this for soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it, my husband thought I smelled like a meat smoker.</li>
            <li>Upon the recommendation of my dermatologist, the first product I tried was SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist first recommended this product years ago and it helped my rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, wondering if it doens my skin anygood!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years, first purchase on Amazon for this</li>
            <li>It is the first thing I put on in the morning, then my moisturizer and sunblock.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any change but many people around me, told me I look younger.</li>
            <li>i noticed an improvement in my skin texture the morning after I first used it.</li>
            <li>I wouldve invested in better facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I use this as my first step every morning and would not be without it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for several years</li>
            <li>I will have used this product for almost a month now and really like it!</li>
            <li>The SkinCeuticals was delivered quickly and new as promised.</li>
            <li>and I can see a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It started to get really dry and zits started popping up and the lines were becoming more obvious.</li>
            <li>This bottle was fresh and the liquid was colorless as it should be when new.</li>
            <li>The addition of ferulic acid to 15% pure L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C ) and 1% alpha tocopherol (vitamin E)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The addition of ferulic acid to 15% pure L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C ) and 1% alpha tocopherol (vitamin E)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only good thing I see is that skin never feels dry with it.  </li>
            <li>I see a noticeable difference since starting skinceuticals and receive many compliments for my 60 year old skin!</li>
            <li>Maybe the first bottle was older ?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and the bottle I received from this seller doesn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>And it does work very well.</li>
            <li>I noticed after a week of using it that my skin was much like</li>
            <li>It was so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helps repair sun damage...fine lines and discoloration.</li>
            <li>10 stars thank you so much for your business.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It was a bit more oily than expected.</li>
            <li>I followed the suggestion to check if it&#x27;s a real.</li>
            <li>I do not know if it is a real product??</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen such a light color.</li>
            <li>I am very desapointed.</li>
            <li>So I think even I don&#x27;t see it that the product really improved my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I find it really protects my skin.  </li>
            <li>i did not like that this serum came without the box/packaging; the color is different from the one i ususally buy, so i hope this is the real thing!!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Not certain if this high end brand is better than the others or not - it is sticky</li>
            <li>My guess is that whatever causes that smell is an essential ingredient to get the full benefits of the product.</li>
            <li>Performs as expected and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think it is good to use it a for few months and then give your skin a break from it for a month or so then go back to it</li>
            <li>Take this from an older view.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look tight and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love how tight it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Since then I have  seen the product rated highly by Allure Magazine.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended by my dermatologist</li>
            <li>The vitamin C is highly concentrated.  </li>
            <li>my derm highly recommended this.</li>
            <li>i would HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 45 year old African American women and we are prone to hyper pigmentation this product smoothed out the fine lines underneath my eyes and kind of made the sun spot seem a little lighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use this for years and it really helped eliminate early stage wrinkles on my forehead and elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Is supposed to be good for the skin, but I find it&#x27;s irritating on the chest area.</li>
            <li>I love the product but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Just because something sounds amazing doesn&#x27;t mean it is.</li>
            <li>I never ordered from Amazon, not sure it&#x27;s the real deal, my skin usually looks glowing and beautiful, but I am not experiencing it with this product, might be a forged product.</li>
            <li>I have been buying it for years and can&#x27;t live a day without it.</li>
            <li>Product in new condition.  </li>
            <li>-product was a cheap imitation of what it was supposed to be and not acceptable</li>
            <li>Turns out I got a cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using since 2 weeks ago and my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the vitamin smell (I am very sensitive to smells)</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The serum&#x27;s price was  more than I usually spend on beauty products but I purchased  it anyway.  </li>
            <li>My p.m. routine is Aveeno Positively Radiant Clnsr to remove eye makeup, then Aqua Glycolic cleanser, then at bedtime RoC Deep Wrinkle night cream.</li>
            <li>This product actually did nothing positive.</li>
            <li>It smells a little, but I like the light texture of it.</li>
            <li>The difference in the product was drastic, the product was a clear color and after two weeks of using it, my skin felt softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset that I spent so much money on a product that I can&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin look younger!</li>
            <li>However, the bottle, itself, appeared completely sealed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item is old.</li>
            <li>(Lipids can be defined as naturally occurring compounds that store energy, give structure to cell</li>
            <li>/&gt;  doubles the photoprotective power to 8 times the skin&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>(Lipids can be defined as naturally occurring compounds that store energy, give structure to cell</li>
            <li>/&gt;  doubles the photoprotective power to 8 times the skin&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>but I am not putting that stuff near my face again.</li>
            <li>I am not going to go near that question.</li>
            <li>My a.m. routine is Aqua Glycolic Cleanser (massaged on dry skin, then rinsed off), then C E Ferulic, then after 10 minutes a foundation with UVA and UVB sunscreen OR powder if the weather is hot and humid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using C E Ferulic since my very young-looking, but not really young, dermatologist recommended it, and plan to keep using it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>My first complaint is the aweful smell of a hot dog on your face and the shine accompanying it.</li>
            <li>My bottle was oxidized ( liquid should be clear, not yellow).</li>
            <li>you really need to be careful.</li>
            <li>I have an occasional zit or two and oily skin (early 30&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>I have mature skin and spend a lot of time outside.</li>
            <li>I happened to be in a bigger city than where I live and I purchased the same product at a spa salon that was a SkinCeuticals retailer.</li>
            <li>It is worth experimenting with to see if it works for you, even if its more expensive than other products.</li>
            <li>Every day, I dab/pat a few drops all over my face right after morning shower and before applying moisturizer and sun screen.  </li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old woman who within the last year suddenly had bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>First of all the smell is pretty unappealing but it does go away throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Now, I had previously bought  hundreds of dollars&#x27; worth skin care products from QVC, HSN, and from so many late night infomercials, and very few ever gave me more than either very minor or very temporary results, if any results at all, so I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but totally worth it.</li>

            <li> Amazing product for aging, sun spots, wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Great product and good delivery</li>
            <li> It makes your skin bright</li>
            <li> You could even space it out every 3 days or so and if you have an event coming up where you want your face to look really good, use it 3 days in a row before the event.</li>
            <li> You should apply a good moisturizer after the serum has been absorbed.inkles</li>
            <li> Maybe 3 stars isn&#x27;t fair because not everyone deals with rosacea.</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible product ever, and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and this is a good choice</li>
            <li> l have used skin ceuticals for over 2 years now and l am very pleased with their products,creams thank you</li>
            <li> Now, I do still have some fine lines, and yes, some wrinkles too, but I had not received comments about having beautiful skin for about 12 years.  </li>
            <li> Now, I do still have some fine lines, and yes, some wrinkles too, but I had not received comments about having beautiful skin for about 12 years.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> So glad my deatologist recommended it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Priced way better than the manufactures website!</li>
            <li> Use this all the time, love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58:)  SOLD!</li>
            <li> bright and smooth!</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, I can see a substantial change in the amount of moisture in my skin when using this product combined with the B5 gel.  </li>
            <li> I used it for two weeks and saw some amazing results.</li>
            <li> Oxidized vitamin C will do more harm than good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Been using for years and makes my skin look nice.</li>
            <li> I heard the SkinCeuticals products are effective.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but i dont like to rece this without box.</li>
            <li> The product itself is excellent: if you haven&#x27;t tried a good vitamin C topical you need to do it for your skin - increased protection from sun exposure / clarification and brightening of skin / improved skin tone and elasticity.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who is an esthetician gave me a facial and told me this was the best to keep your skin looking really good.</li>
            <li> Love it and love what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product for your skin.</li>
            <li> It is the most effective treatment for hyper pigmentation issues.</li>
            <li> I found an excellent dermatologist, and the first thing that she recommended was a CO2 treatment to correct the light brown sunspots that I had been accumulating over the years.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast service!</li>
            <li> Zits gone, face is very smooth, cheeks are rosy and glowing even.</li>
            <li> I feel really healthy when I use this on my face.</li>
            <li> The best facial serum</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I paid a lot more from my surgeon</li>
            <li> LOVE IT..</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to do with this, but my aestitition gave me a sample.</li>
            <li> Keeping my skin hydrated and nourished is a top priority.</li>
            <li> CE Ferulic, thanks to my beauty adviser, has been a great help.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter,and looks better every week.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite skin product..</li>
            <li> and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> This antioxidant combination enhances protection against damaging UV rays to better prevent visible signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You should apply a good moisturizer after the serum has been absorbed.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase products from Advanced Skincare LLC!</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I am sure many people have used this with no side effects whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Sincerely yours Jennifer Marciano</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed as this product is pricey and had great reviews...</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day since then and love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for 8 years.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year, love it.  </li>
            <li> Many years using this F.A.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worked in with a routine if many products.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> Love everything about it, the perfume, the texture and the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I try many beauty items but this is a staple of mine..</li>
            <li> Everything was ok.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing this product at my drs office and it was much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> Of course, what I didn&#x27;t realize was that once the bags went away, the skin was more wrinkled as the bags had been stretching that skin,</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the SkinCeuticals product to see if they diminish the wrinkles now as they did the bags from my eyes.  :-)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me.</li>
            <li> Love skin ceuticals products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s approved by a dermatologist, many products are.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it...</li>
            <li> I have used this product consistently for years (and loved it), but never purchased it from this company on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but the smell goes away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are a great natural sunscreen and antioxidant.</li>
            <li> The skin around my chin was drying, then peeling, then becoming inflamed.</li>
            <li> I will continue using SkinCeuticals products however I will be purchasing them from the SkinCeutical website or a spa salon that is a SkinCeutical retailer to ensure that the product is handled correctly so that it will stay fresh and work effectively.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick.  </li>
            <li> Living in the arid Southwest and also growing more &amp;#34;senior,&amp;#34; I do not take for granted that my face will continue looking fresh and healthy unless I nurture it.</li>
            <li> found it too strong for my neck.</li>
            <li> I had loved TNS but the new TNS formula has an overpowering perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> Every couple of days is fine to keep your skin glowing.</li>
            <li> This was recommended as being fine for people with rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m watching fine lines diminish.</li>
            <li> The rest of my face and neck/chest was fine</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 48 and have acne prone skin, brown spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li> So, maybe I don&#x27;t look a whole lot younger, but I do look better, much better, because now I have beautiful</li>
            <li> So, maybe I don&#x27;t look a whole lot younger, but I do look better, much better, because now I have beautiful</li>
            <li> Smooth and even.</li>
            <li> So, again, fantastic product; caveat emptor with regard to vendor.</li>

            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> I did buy samples and from an online vendor that was credible.</li>
            <li> I like this product and trust that  the skinceutical line is good for my mature skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t loved this product as much as some of the people I talked to, which tells me that perhaps my skin just isn&#x27;t right for it.</li>
            <li> , I have been receiving the most positive comments from acquaintances, friends, and total strangers that I have \\&quot;beautiful skin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> , I have been receiving the most positive comments from acquaintances, friends, and total strangers that I have \\&quot;beautiful skin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Heard so many positive reviews I had to try it !  </li>
            <li> At first the smell put me off, but this is a very good vitamin C product that has become my daily &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and quick absorption into your skin .  </li>
            <li> On weekend mornings I skip foundation and use TiSilc tinted sunblock as I spend more time in the sun running errands and need the higher SPF.  </li>
            <li> I already used a full bottle.</li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s not bad..</li>
            <li> I am 42, have light complexion and a reasonably smooth skin of which I always took good care, but I also have dark sun spots on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper here than I have found it anywhere else locally (or even online unless a skincare site is having a great sale)</li>
            <li> I know my skin will benefit from this product tremendously, but I just can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> love it, makes my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I made the unwise choice to buy on Amazon (via Beauty Perfect) to get a better deal.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my face look smooth and feel soft.</li>
            <li> It drys quickly, leaving a</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast thought!</li>
            <li> Good , same exact thing .</li>
            <li> A real find to help deal with aging skin!!</li>
            <li> The entire line is amazing and a must have for anti aging.</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and my skin looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still deciding whether this is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Getting a bottle of clear product from this company has been challenging; I received product from them that was almost brown in color.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t offer to replace my product with a verified fresh product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six weeks now, and this product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Once absorbed, this serum cannot be washed or rubbed off.  </li>
            <li> Once absorbed, this serum cannot be washed or rubbed off.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost</li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> right..</li>
            <li> Well, I was moderately impressed with a few claims, especially the claim that stated that Once absorbed, this serum can&#x27;t be washed or rubbed off.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m mid-40&#x27;s and have tried and discarded a huge number of prescrip and over-the-counter skin products for my adult acne, rosacea and seb derm.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the cardboard box in which it was shipped, I noticed there was what appeared to be yellowed product stained on the Skinceuticals box, as if it had leaked.</li>
            <li> Nothing works as well as this for soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, my husband thought I smelled like a meat smoker.</li>
            <li> Upon the recommendation of my dermatologist, the first product I tried was SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist first recommended this product years ago and it helped my rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, wondering if it doens my skin anygood!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, first purchase on Amazon for this</li>
            <li> It is the first thing I put on in the morning, then my moisturizer and sunblock.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change but many people around me, told me I look younger.</li>
            <li> i noticed an improvement in my skin texture the morning after I first used it.</li>
            <li> I wouldve invested in better facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I use this as my first step every morning and would not be without it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for several years</li>
            <li> I will have used this product for almost a month now and really like it!</li>
            <li> The SkinCeuticals was delivered quickly and new as promised.</li>
            <li> and I can see a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It started to get really dry and zits started popping up and the lines were becoming more obvious.</li>
            <li> This bottle was fresh and the liquid was colorless as it should be when new.</li>
            <li> The addition of ferulic acid to 15% pure L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C ) and 1% alpha tocopherol (vitamin E)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The addition of ferulic acid to 15% pure L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C ) and 1% alpha tocopherol (vitamin E)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only good thing I see is that skin never feels dry with it.  </li>
            <li> I see a noticeable difference since starting skinceuticals and receive many compliments for my 60 year old skin!</li>
            <li> Maybe the first bottle was older ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and the bottle I received from this seller doesn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> And it does work very well.</li>
            <li> I noticed after a week of using it that my skin was much like</li>
            <li> It was so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really helps repair sun damage...fine lines and discoloration.</li>
            <li> 10 stars thank you so much for your business.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It was a bit more oily than expected.</li>
            <li> I followed the suggestion to check if it&#x27;s a real.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it is a real product??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen such a light color.</li>
            <li> I am very desapointed.</li>
            <li> So I think even I don&#x27;t see it that the product really improved my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I find it really protects my skin.  </li>
            <li> i did not like that this serum came without the box/packaging; the color is different from the one i ususally buy, so i hope this is the real thing!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not certain if this high end brand is better than the others or not - it is sticky</li>
            <li> My guess is that whatever causes that smell is an essential ingredient to get the full benefits of the product.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think it is good to use it a for few months and then give your skin a break from it for a month or so then go back to it</li>
            <li> Take this from an older view.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look tight and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love how tight it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> Since then I have  seen the product rated highly by Allure Magazine.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was highly recommended by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> The vitamin C is highly concentrated.  </li>
            <li> my derm highly recommended this.</li>
            <li> i would HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 45 year old African American women and we are prone to hyper pigmentation this product smoothed out the fine lines underneath my eyes and kind of made the sun spot seem a little lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this for years and it really helped eliminate early stage wrinkles on my forehead and elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Is supposed to be good for the skin, but I find it&#x27;s irritating on the chest area.</li>
            <li> I love the product but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Just because something sounds amazing doesn&#x27;t mean it is.</li>
            <li> I never ordered from Amazon, not sure it&#x27;s the real deal, my skin usually looks glowing and beautiful, but I am not experiencing it with this product, might be a forged product.</li>
            <li> I have been buying it for years and can&#x27;t live a day without it.</li>
            <li> Product in new condition.  </li>
            <li> -product was a cheap imitation of what it was supposed to be and not acceptable</li>
            <li> Turns out I got a cheap imitation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using since 2 weeks ago and my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the vitamin smell (I am very sensitive to smells)</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The serum&#x27;s price was  more than I usually spend on beauty products but I purchased  it anyway.  </li>
            <li> My p.m. routine is Aveeno Positively Radiant Clnsr to remove eye makeup, then Aqua Glycolic cleanser, then at bedtime RoC Deep Wrinkle night cream.</li>
            <li> This product actually did nothing positive.</li>
            <li> It smells a little, but I like the light texture of it.</li>
            <li> The difference in the product was drastic, the product was a clear color and after two weeks of using it, my skin felt softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset that I spent so much money on a product that I can&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin look younger!</li>
            <li> However, the bottle, itself, appeared completely sealed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is old.</li>
            <li> (Lipids can be defined as naturally occurring compounds that store energy, give structure to cell</li>
            <li> /&gt;  doubles the photoprotective power to 8 times the skin&#x27;s natural</li>

            <li> /&gt;  doubles the photoprotective power to 8 times the skin&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> but I am not putting that stuff near my face again.</li>
            <li> I am not going to go near that question.</li>
            <li> My a.m. routine is Aqua Glycolic Cleanser (massaged on dry skin, then rinsed off), then C E Ferulic, then after 10 minutes a foundation with UVA and UVB sunscreen OR powder if the weather is hot and humid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using C E Ferulic since my very young-looking, but not really young, dermatologist recommended it, and plan to keep using it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> My first complaint is the aweful smell of a hot dog on your face and the shine accompanying it.</li>
            <li> My bottle was oxidized ( liquid should be clear, not yellow).</li>
            <li> you really need to be careful.</li>
            <li> I have an occasional zit or two and oily skin (early 30&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> I have mature skin and spend a lot of time outside.</li>
            <li> I happened to be in a bigger city than where I live and I purchased the same product at a spa salon that was a SkinCeuticals retailer.</li>
            <li> It is worth experimenting with to see if it works for you, even if its more expensive than other products.</li>
            <li> Every day, I dab/pat a few drops all over my face right after morning shower and before applying moisturizer and sun screen.  </li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old woman who within the last year suddenly had bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> First of all the smell is pretty unappealing but it does go away throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Now, I had previously bought  hundreds of dollars&#x27; worth skin care products from QVC, HSN, and from so many late night infomercials, and very few ever gave me more than either very minor or very temporary results, if any results at all, so I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong when the bottle arrived with out a box, the label had some faded/blurred image/printing, it didn&#x27;t smell right and certainly didn&#x27;t feel the same as the product I was buying at Bliss.</li>
            <li> If any parts of my face feel dry I may dab a little Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer without SPF on them.     </li>
            <li> No , the serum is clear and it should be a dark yellow</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the product inside was not consistent with what I have received in the past; it was clear, but with a different consistency (less oily feel) and had a distinct taste (when you put several drops on your face, inevitably,  it will migrate to your mouth).</li>
            <li> I just received this from Amazon and the color is almost clear and not the yellow color as I previously bought.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> This new bottle has no strong smell (or I&#x27;m starting to get use of it ?).</li>
            <li> product was recommended to me - seems to further dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> However, before I spent that high price I decided to do a little research on this serum</li>
            <li> I found out the product from Stanford Medical Center when I had Sun burned problem on my face.</li>
            <li> Product was orange - not clear like it is suppose to be</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions for use:&lt;br /&gt;In the morning after cleansing and toning, apply 4-5 drops to a dry face, neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions for use:&lt;br /&gt;In the morning after cleansing and toning, apply 4-5 drops to a dry face, neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not oily it dry at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased from 3 other vendors since 2009 on Amazon and other product received has been clear (which, BTW, only slightly starts to yellow at the end of the bottle which usually lasts 3 months for me with daily use).</li>
            <li> When I received the product, it  was a dark yellow color</li>
            <li> I had previously tried various vitamin C serums, including one from Skinceuticals, and they were too drying and caused peeling.  </li>
            <li> I noticed no change after a month and a half, and still needed to put the same amount of moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> I am a little concern that this is not the same product as what I bought at the doctors office.</li>
            <li> he only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> My husband said that my skin looked younger after I had used it for a few weeks, startling because he rarely notices anything.  </li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> I decided to start using it again and just within a few days, it looks so different.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it is for your face and it&#x27;s worth it to spend.</li>
            <li> nd within expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Quicker than expected delivery.  </li>
            <li> Within a week, the whole lower half of my face was covered in probably two dozen large painful zits.  </li>
            <li> Last winter as I was approaching my mid-sixties, I finally decided that it was time for me to make some adjustments, as I had been unhappy about my reflection in the mirror for the last five years.  </li>
            <li> It has a different texture, color and scent than usual.  </li>
            <li> I do use the Skinceuticals line because I think you should use a &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; of products as they are meant to work with each other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this every other day until it&#x27;s gone, because it WORKS, but I won&#x27;t buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> As such, hard to say whether or not it works...</li>
            <li> my skin starting looking pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This product was dark yellow/old</li>
            <li> I would rather to spend money for my smooth skin face than keeping ugly dark sports all over my face.</li>
            <li> It even has removed some sun damage (dark spots) over a period of time.</li>
            <li> If there was a vitamin C, the color should be dark ( after 48 hours).Now</li>
            <li> but I would rather miss out on other things in life to have this!</li>
            <li> Previously I purchased this item from a salon.  </li>
            <li> The salon product was stronger and looked and felt less diluted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s price, but I use a much less pricier moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> this product also slightly moisturizes as well.</li>
            <li> After a scan of the ingredients, I couldn&#x27;t figure out which ingredient was responsible for that awful smoky smell, so I went to a retailer and looked at a couple of other well-known brands with a similar ingredient list, and one of them had that same smoky smell.</li>
            <li> also helps a little with my sun damage.</li>
            <li> I add a little aloe Vera with it and massage into my face am &amp; pm-</li>
            <li> Owe a lot to this little brown bottle</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use it everyday either.</li>
            <li> Using it everyday is just a waste of the product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Use a few drops each morning...</li>
            <li> I drip a few drops on a plate and leave 48 hours.</li>
            <li> One of the few products I have used for years.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Since it seems to work, I will continue to use everyday.</li>
            <li> However, the SkinCeuticals product removed the bags within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your $.</li>
            <li> Visible difference in a few days.</li>
            <li> been using this for a few years.</li>
            <li> To me, it is a dramatic improvement for only a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried less expensive products, but they just aren&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> first bottle I used had a bad smell of roasted bacon</li>
            <li> It improves the quality of my skin, lightening it and taking blotchiness and dull look away but also acts as a slight sun block.</li>
            <li> Fades spots and eliminates small growths with consist ante use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and this is a small portion of what I read and learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure ...</li>
            <li> Small wrinkles have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how this works, but I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li> It was a different color and smells weird.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed that it has made a difference in my skin, plus it smells bad!  too much money!!  </li>
            <li> My skin was dull and after using this product I saw immediate results.  </li>
            <li> i even use it under the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> It is not a cheap product and I should not have to deal with this for this price!!!</li>
            <li> I read a review by a dermatologist approximately 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours, my face was on fire and required a dose of prescription steroid cream and some cold cloths to stop the burning.</li>
            <li> but I had never experienced this before.  </li>
            <li> I had photodamage when I started using it and the skin Ceuticals sunblock 30, and the photodamage has not gotten any worse.  </li>
            <li> Smells awful - not something I want anywhere near my face.</li>
            <li> I hate rating a product with fewer stars simply due to the vendor.</li>
            <li> So, either this product was contaminated on shipping or is a fake.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> and it is NOT GOOD! !!</li>
            <li> (of course), so rather than toss this expensive stuff, I use it on my hands.</li>
            <li> I was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very negative experience!!</li>
            <li> expensive experiment for me - very disappointed</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> I am giving this one star because I hate how feels.....</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> However this stuff made me BREAK OUT terribly.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wear this under my makeup and it makes my skin glow. I&#x27;ve tried less expensive products, but they just aren&#x27;t the same. This stuff is definitely worth its price.</li>
            <li> At first the smell put me off, but this is a very good vitamin C product that has become my daily &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product!  My dermatologist recommended I use.  My skin was dull and after using this product I saw immediate results.  I even use on the backs of my hands and can see a big difference as well.  I am 51 years old and my skin looks better than ever.  Smooth and even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Not certain if this high end brand is better than the others or not - it is sticky also!!ll I&#x27;ve been thru several bottles-</li>
            <li> Love it! Great price!</li>
            <li> Omg, this stuff is a miracle worker. You get what you pay for with this product, I&#x27;ll never use anything else. One day and you&#x27;ll see a difference!</li>
            <li> I just started using it. Delivery was very quick.  It smells a little, but I like the light texture of it. Looking forward to seeing results.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! It really makes your skin look younger!</li>
            <li> Horrible! Save your money!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermotologist- it s part of my daily skin care routine.</li>
            <li> -product was a cheap imitation of what it was supposed to be and not acceptable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still deciding whether this is worth the money. I love the product but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  So glad my deatologist recommended it!</li>
            <li> I feel really healthy when I use this on my face. I love it!</li>
            <li> A real find to help deal with aging skin!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and the bottle I received from this seller doesn&#x27;t seem like the real thing.  It has a different texture, color and scent than usual.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The best facial serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a longtime user of SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic. The product itself is excellent: if you haven&#x27;t tried a good vitamin C topical you need to do it for your skin - increased protection from sun exposure / clarification and brightening of skin / improved skin tone and elasticity. Yes, the smell is a mix of bacon and set off fireworks - it fades within a minute of application. I hate rating a product with fewer stars simply due to the vendor. However, if I combined ratings like that it would be 5 stars for product and 2 stars for this vendor. Getting a bottle of clear product from this company has been challenging; I received product from them that was almost brown in color. When I contacted them, they said if the serum has browned that doesn&#x27;t affect efficacy and they didn&#x27;t offer to replace my product with a verified fresh product. Change in serum color does show aging / oxidation / reduced efficacy; this product has a shelf life. I&#x27;ve purchased from 3 other vendors since 2009 on Amazon and other product received has been clear (which, BTW, only slightly starts to yellow at the end of the bottle which usually lasts 3 months for me with daily use). So, again, fantastic product; caveat emptor with regard to vendor.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My doctor recommended it. It helps with anti aging</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does.  Fades spots and eliminates small growths with consist ante use.&lt;br /&gt;I found it too strong for my neck.</li>
            <li> I use this daily.  It works!</li>
            <li> Watery, sticky, smells like vitamins.  It does tighten. I prefer the emollient gel version of this in Dr. Gross c, e, feruluc triple protect eye.  Just use it on your face too.  Best morning face ever when you use it as a night cream and it smells pleasant, too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product consistently for years (and loved it), but never purchased it from this company on Amazon. When I first opened the cardboard box in which it was shipped, I noticed there was what appeared to be yellowed product stained on the Skinceuticals box, as if it had leaked. However, the bottle, itself, appeared completely sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the product inside was not consistent with what I have received in the past; it was clear, but with a different consistency (less oily feel) and had a distinct taste (when you put several drops on your face, inevitably,  it will migrate to your mouth). So, either this product was contaminated on shipping or is a fake.</li>
            <li> My skin looks younger since using this. It actually glows. Love it</li>
            <li> In a local magazine article on skin care several Dallas female dermatologists said they used this product, so I tried it.     I&#x27;m mid-40&#x27;s and have tried and discarded a huge number of prescrip and over-the-counter skin products for my adult acne, rosacea and seb derm.  I use this every morning.  It has not caused me any breakouts, or irritated my rosacea.  I had previously tried various vitamin C serums, including one from Skinceuticals, and they were too drying and caused peeling.  For some reason this one does not. (Maybe the vitamin E alleviates any irritation from the C?)    My a.m. routine is Aqua Glycolic Cleanser (massaged on dry skin, then rinsed off), then C E Ferulic, then after 10 minutes a foundation with UVA and UVB sunscreen OR powder if the weather is hot and humid.  On weekend mornings I skip foundation and use TiSilc tinted sunblock as I spend more time in the sun running errands and need the higher SPF.  I then put Neutrogena Drytouch waterproof sunblock on the backs of my hands and on my forearms.  (I keep a tube in the car in case I forget until I start driving to work).    My p.m. routine is Aveeno Positively Radiant Clnsr to remove eye makeup, then Aqua Glycolic cleanser, then at bedtime RoC Deep Wrinkle night cream. If any parts of my face feel dry I may dab a little Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer without SPF on them.     I bought some Skinceuticals B5 gel to use this winter when the air gets a lot dryer and the heat runs in my house.  It helps the skin retain moisture which is not a problem for me in summer but sometimes is in winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years now, purchasing from a Dermotologist office. I never ordered from Amazon, not sure it&#x27;s the real deal, my skin usually looks glowing and beautiful, but I am not experiencing it with this product, might be a forged product. So dissapointed. Going to have it tested.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It fades scars, improves skin clarity and tone. It restores a brilliant &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;  I have AA skin and I had some scars -- maderma did not work but this stuff with palmers cocoa butter night blend with retinol did the trick. Only drawback -- the price. I wish they could make a smaller size or bring back the travel pack.</li>
            <li> This item is old. The serum has darkened substantially and I am not convinced of its efficacy. I will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I have used this antioxidant treatment for years ever since I had a basal cell skin cancer on my face over 10 years ago.  It was recommended by the skin care surgeon to use as a preventative for any future cancers.  Every day, I dab/pat a few drops all over my face right after morning shower and before applying moisturizer and sun screen.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent and recommended to me by skin care clinic.</li>
            <li> Clearly a great product. Was recommended to me by my cosmetic doctor.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I paid a lot more from my surgeon so I&#x27;m happy about the price. And it does work very well.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.. WORKS WONDERS</li>
            <li> Be careful. My bottle was oxidized ( liquid should be clear, not yellow). Oxidized vitamin C will do more harm than good. Tried to contact seller and got no response.</li>
            <li> Nothing works as well as this for soft, smooth skin. A friend of mine who is an esthetician gave me a facial and told me this was the best to keep your skin looking really good. She was right. Even getting regular photofacials does not compare to what this product does. I noticed after a week of using it that my skin was much like it was when I was a kid. It just had a different feel to it. It was so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I stopped using it and my skin starting looking pretty bad. It started to get really dry and zits started popping up and the lines were becoming more obvious. I decided to start using it again and just within a few days, it looks so different. Zits gone, face is very smooth, cheeks are rosy and glowing even. I think it is good to use it a for few months and then give your skin a break from it for a month or so then go back to it so you skin doesn&#x27;t get too used to it. This is how I use it. It&#x27;s pretty expensive, but totally worth it. It lasts forever. I have had this one bottle for over a year now. You don&#x27;t have to use it everyday either. Every couple of days is fine to keep your skin glowing. Using it everyday is just a waste of the product in my opinion. You could even space it out every 3 days or so and if you have an event coming up where you want your face to look really good, use it 3 days in a row before the event. It works wonders.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to do with this, but my aestitition gave me a sample. Wow!  This has made such a difference in the texture and look of my skin. I do use the Skinceuticals line because I think you should use a &amp;#34;line&amp;#34; of products as they are meant to work with each other. I see a noticeable difference since starting skinceuticals and receive many compliments for my 60 year old skin!</li>
            <li> Keeping my skin hydrated and nourished is a top priority. Living in the arid Southwest and also growing more &amp;#34;senior,&amp;#34; I do not take for granted that my face will continue looking fresh and healthy unless I nurture it. CE Ferulic, thanks to my beauty adviser, has been a great help.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My face feels and looks amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> product was recommended to me - seems to further dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive experiment for me - very disappointed</li>
            <li> No , the serum is clear and it should be a dark yellow</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and will continue as it is the best anti-aging product I have found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six weeks now, and this product is worth every penny. My skin is brighter,and looks better every week.</li>
            <li> Best product. Expensive but I would rather miss out on other things in life to have this! Try it and you will see. Great!</li>
            <li> Really helps repair sun damage...fine lines and discoloration. Use a few drops each morning...then follow with sunscreen. Great product. I use two bottles a year. Have used for three years.</li>
            <li> I read a review by a dermatologist approximately 10 years ago. The serum&#x27;s price was  more than I usually spend on beauty products but I purchased  it anyway.  I was hooked.  Since then I have  seen the product rated highly by Allure Magazine.  I have always had luck with Allure&#x27;s reviews.  It is not a miracle serum but if used on a consistant basis definately improves the skin.</li>
            <li> I am giving this one star because I hate how feels..... It is so sticky...I can&#x27;t stand it. I don&#x27;t know if it works because I only use it occasionally because it&#x27;s so sticky....Not my favorite skin product..</li>
            <li> Great product and good delivery</li>
            <li> My husband said that my skin looked younger after I had used it for a few weeks, startling because he rarely notices anything.  I&#x27;ve been using C E Ferulic since my very young-looking, but not really young, dermatologist recommended it, and plan to keep using it.  It works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years. I only needed 3 bottles in this time. I just received this from Amazon and the color is almost clear and not the yellow color as I previously bought. I am a little concern that this is not the same product as what I bought at the doctors office. Everyone comments that my skim is beautiful from this product! I use 5 drops in the morning on my face and neck. I following up with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my plastic surgeon and my dermatologist.  My skin looks great.  I use glytone cleanser, this serum, Obaji Luxe moisturizer and Elta-MD sunscreen.  I am 43 and my skin has never looked better.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but the smell goes away pretty quickly.  Much cheaper here than I have found it anywhere else locally (or even online unless a skincare site is having a great sale)</li>
            <li> I think it helps my skin.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. I know my skin will benefit from this product tremendously, but I just can&#x27;t stand the smell. The first time I applied it, my husband thought I smelled like a meat smoker. I am not kidding. Even my kiddos asked me where the pulled pork is. After a scan of the ingredients, I couldn&#x27;t figure out which ingredient was responsible for that awful smoky smell, so I went to a retailer and looked at a couple of other well-known brands with a similar ingredient list, and one of them had that same smoky smell. My guess is that whatever causes that smell is an essential ingredient to get the full benefits of the product. I&#x27;ll use this every other day until it&#x27;s gone, because it WORKS, but I won&#x27;t buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> Last winter as I was approaching my mid-sixties, I finally decided that it was time for me to make some adjustments, as I had been unhappy about my reflection in the mirror for the last five years.  I found an excellent dermatologist, and the first thing that she recommended was a CO2 treatment to correct the light brown sunspots that I had been accumulating over the years.  After my face had healed, she then suggested the line of SkinCeuticals to continue my skin care regiment.  Now, I had previously bought  hundreds of dollars&#x27; worth skin care products from QVC, HSN, and from so many late night infomercials, and very few ever gave me more than either very minor or very temporary results, if any results at all, so I was a bit skeptical.  Upon the recommendation of my dermatologist, the first product I tried was SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic.  However, before I spent that high price I decided to do a little research on this serum and this is a small portion of what I read and learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Research:&lt;br /&gt;C E Ferulic is a revolutionary antioxidant combination that delivers advanced environmental protection against photoaging by neutralizing free radicals that cause accelerated signs of aging. This antioxidant combination enhances protection against damaging UV rays to better prevent visible signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Ingredient 1&lt;br /&gt;15% L-ascorbic acid: Neutralizes damaging free radicals and protects skin&#x27;s breakdown from oxidative stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Ingredient 2&lt;br /&gt;1% alpha tocopherol (vitamin E): Neutralizes free radicals and replenishes skin&#x27;s lipids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Ingredient 3&lt;br /&gt;0.5% ferulic acid: This plant-based antioxidant neutralizes free radicals, helps inhibit UV-induced skin discolorations, and has anti-inflammatory properties&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Provides advanced environmental protection against damaging free radicals induced by UVA, UVB, and infrared radiation A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Increases firmness and replenishes lipids to visibly reduce wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;  Definition: (Lipids can be defined as naturally occurring compounds that store energy, give structure to cell&lt;br /&gt;  membranes, and transmit signals.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Once absorbed, this serum cannot be washed or rubbed off.  It remains effective for a minimum of 72 hours,&lt;br /&gt;  making it an excellent addition to sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  The addition of ferulic acid to 15% pure L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C ) and 1% alpha tocopherol (vitamin E)&lt;br /&gt;  doubles the photoprotective power to 8 times the skin&#x27;s natural protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions for use:&lt;br /&gt;In the morning after cleansing and toning, apply 4-5 drops to a dry face, neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well, I was moderately impressed with a few claims, especially the claim that stated that Once absorbed, this serum can&#x27;t be washed or rubbed off.  It remains effective for a minimum of 72 hours, making it an excellent addition to sunscreen.  I have now been using this serum every morning for six months, and starting from about 3 months ago, I have been receiving the most positive comments from acquaintances, friends, and total strangers that I have \\&quot;beautiful skin.\\&quot;  Now, I do still have some fine lines, and yes, some wrinkles too, but I had not received comments about having beautiful skin for about 12 years.  So, maybe I don&#x27;t look a whole lot younger, but I do look better, much better, because now I have beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a final note:  Remember that face serums are not moisturizers, they work by &#x60;tightening&#x27; the skin and reducing the size of pores.  You should apply a good moisturizer after the serum has been absorbed.inkles&lt;br /&gt;  Definition: (Lipids can be defined as naturally occurring compounds that store energy, give structure to cell&lt;br /&gt;  membranes, and transmit signals.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  Once absorbed, this serum cannot be washed or rubbed off.

            <li> Not sure ... But doesn&#x27;t smell right.. Hope it&#x27;s not bad.. It is suppose to tingle when applied .... But it doesn&#x27;t !... Arrived very fast thought!</li>
            <li> The product is great, the price was great, delivery was great- what&#x27;s left to say?</li>
            <li> Good , same exact thing .</li>
            <li> Been using for years and makes my skin look nice.</li>
            <li> love it, makes my skin smooth and soft.  also helps a little with my sun damage.</li>
            <li> I add a little aloe Vera with it and massage into my face am &amp; pm- awesome!</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended this after TNS Recovery Serum was changed to add an enormous amount of fragrance.  I had loved TNS but the new TNS formula has an overpowering perfume smell.  Well, this doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume, it does smell like cooked pork.  I&#x27;m a vegetarian so the smell was intolerable.  I have maturing skin but it is still oily during the summer.  This didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin leaving a tacky feel.</li>
            <li> Very negative experience!! I received oxidized product.... Was very disappointed. It is not a cheap product and I should not have to deal with this for this price!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Perfectly packaged and product just like the version from my doctors office. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product, great results. I like how my skin looks since I started using it: bright and smooth! Worth the cost</li>
            <li> I like this product and trust that  the skinceutical line is good for my mature skin.  Previously I purchased this item from a salon.  There seems to be a difference between what I got through Amazon and the salon.  The salon product was stronger and looked and felt less diluted.  Maybe maybe not....  Packaging is identical.  Saved money buying on Amazon but I think I&#x27;ll purchase from salon again next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THE BEST...Have been using it for about 5 years.  Every time I stop I notice a change and it is NOT GOOD! !!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed that it has made a difference in my skin, plus it smells bad!  too much money!!  I went back to josie maran argan oil.</li>
            <li> This product was dark yellow/old</li>
            <li> Do not purchase products from Advanced Skincare LLC!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for serveral years now.  It makes your skin bright and you see improved reduction of pores.  Small wrinkles have disappeared.  I can&#x27;t see the antioxidants working, but I feel that it is.  Love it.  Intend to continue using for the next several years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this skin care for about 10 years now. I found out the product from Stanford Medical Center when I had Sun burned problem on my face. It is expensive, but it is for your face and it&#x27;s worth it to spend. I would rather to spend money for my smooth skin face than keeping ugly dark sports all over my face.</li>
            <li> Maybe 3 stars isn&#x27;t fair because not everyone deals with rosacea. This was recommended as being fine for people with rosacea. For me, it was not. Within a few hours, my face was on fire and required a dose of prescription steroid cream and some cold cloths to stop the burning. I am sure many people have used this with no side effects whatsoever.  If you have any type of skin condition- you really need to be careful. I know it is from my rosacea that it burned- I don&#x27;t have rosacea on my hands (of course), so rather than toss this expensive stuff, I use it on my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m watching fine lines diminish.</li>
            <li> GREAT ! GREAT !  You can see the difference after about 10 days of use.</li>
            <li> In a plastic surgeon gave me a sample of this one time, and it lasted me three months he only need a little bit. This is the most incredible product ever, and&lt;br /&gt;I want everyone to know about it!&lt;br /&gt;Gets rid of wrinkles chap lips to try and scan it tightens the skin NDS you look way younger I give this project 10 stars thank you so much for your business.&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely yours Jennifer Marciano</li>
            <li> Product was orange - not clear like it is suppose to be</li>
            <li> The SkinCeuticals was delivered quickly and new as promised. It was a bit more oily than expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t loved this product as much as some of the people I talked to, which tells me that perhaps my skin just isn&#x27;t right for it. I noticed no change after a month and a half, and still needed to put the same amount of moisturizer on. It didn&#x27;t add any moisture or change the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised. Speedy delivery.  I have used this product about a year and I can see a positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. I&#x27;ve use this for years and it really helped eliminate early stage wrinkles on my forehead and elsewhere. It is worth experimenting with to see if it works for you, even if its more expensive than other products.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 10 years - my skin looks great as I age!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> I have been buying it for years and can&#x27;t live a day without it.</li>
            <li> Use this every day! Love it and love what it does for my skin! It even has removed some sun damage (dark spots) over a period of time. I won&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It improves the quality of my skin, lightening it and taking blotchiness and dull look away but also acts as a slight sun block.</li>
            <li> i did not like that this serum came without the box/packaging; the color is different from the one i ususally buy, so i hope this is the real thing!!!</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, I can see a substantial change in the amount of moisture in my skin when using this product combined with the B5 gel.  It is easy to use and quick absorption into your skin .  A must for everyones cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> Excelent product. I&#x27;m using since 2 weeks ago and my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a  timely manner. When I received the product, it  was a dark yellow color and it did not appear to be working after two months of using the product as directed. When I finished the bottle, I decided to continue using it for another month to see if I obtained any results as  I heard the SkinCeuticals products are effective. I happened to be in a bigger city than where I live and I purchased the same product at a spa salon that was a SkinCeuticals retailer. The difference in the product was drastic, the product was a clear color and after two weeks of using it, my skin felt softer. I will continue using SkinCeuticals products however I will be purchasing them from the SkinCeutical website or a spa salon that is a SkinCeutical retailer to ensure that the product is handled correctly so that it will stay fresh and work effectively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for my delivery but C E  Ferulic is a staple in my daily toilette. I turned my daughter  on to it and we&#x27;re both happy</li>
            <li> I used it for over a month now and do not see any improvement.  I am 42, have light complexion and a reasonably smooth skin of which I always took good care, but I also have dark sun spots on my cheeks and forehead. The serum when applied feels sticky (even after an hour, and even if I apply only 2-3 drops when they recommend 4-5) and it is rather difficult to apply any make up on top of it (it either cakes - for powders or rolls off - for cream). The only good thing I see is that skin never feels dry with it.  Very dissapointed as this product is pricey and had great reviews...</li>
            <li> Amazing product for aging, sun spots, wrinkles! Lasts 6 mo-1 year too!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist first recommended this product years ago and it helped my rosacea.  I have been using it every day since then and love how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use this because it&#x27;s oily &amp; it broke me out severely! I&#x27;m very upset that I spent so much money on a product that I can&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are a great natural sunscreen and antioxidant.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is the real deal.  Didn&#x27;t come Ina box.  Doesn&#x27;t look or feel the same.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for 8 years.  There is no residue and it lasts forever.  I alternate with a daily moisturizer and apply to neck and chest as well.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product for your skin. It&#x27;s great for reducing wrinkles and makes skin glow!</li>
            <li> I bought this after my facialist recommended I do so to help build up some of the collagen/volume in my face. First of all the smell is pretty unappealing but it does go away throughout the day.  However this stuff made me BREAK OUT terribly.  Within a week, the whole lower half of my face was covered in probably two dozen large painful zits.  I have an occasional zit or two and oily skin (early 30&#x27;s) but I had never experienced this before.  Had to go to the derm to be prescribed an antibiotic.  The rest of my face and neck/chest was fine but I am not putting that stuff near my face again.</li>
            <li> Heard so many positive reviews I had to try it !  Does what it says well, see how my skin looks in a couple of months</li>
            <li> I have used this product before. It arrived in A One condition. I will order again</li>
            <li> Great product and fast service!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Vit C anti aging products.. and this is a good choice</li>
            <li> Wow!!!  That&#x27;s wonderful! I could see difference on my face on second time!  I loved it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Tightens while making skin glow!  Wrinkles minimized!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year, love it.  Unfortunately, I made the unwise choice to buy on Amazon (via Beauty Perfect) to get a better deal. Turns out I got a cheap imitation.  I knew something was wrong when the bottle arrived with out a box, the label had some faded/blurred image/printing, it didn&#x27;t smell right and certainly didn&#x27;t feel the same as the product I was buying at Bliss.</li>
            <li> For years I have been using this product. Firs time ordered through Amazon.  I was a disappointment.It is a completely different  CE FERULIC ACID.Absolutely no tingling after applying to the face.How can it be, the same company produces two different FERULIC ACID?? I followed the suggestion to check if it&#x27;s a real. I drip a few drops on a plate and leave 48 hours. Color does not change.If there was a vitamin C, the color should be dark ( after 48 hours).Now I do not know if it is a real product?? Many years using this F.A. I&#x27;ve never seen such a light color. The question arises about the quality of the CE FERULIC ACID.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Not sure how this works, but I&#x27;ve been using for years. Always compliments on my skin.....it&#x27;s worked in with a routine if many products.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. My skin has a very nice glow after using this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but i dont like to rece this without box. The store have to write this before we shop. I am very desapointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my face look smooth and feel soft. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> One of the few products I have used for years. I can still see the difference every time I put it on my skin. I just turned 50. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great seller!</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It makes my skin look tight and healthy.  I was worried about the vitamin smell (I am very sensitive to smells) but it does not bother me at all. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Performs as expected and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, wondering if it doens my skin anygood!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!!! I&#x27;m a 45 year old African American women and we are prone to hyper pigmentation this product smoothed out the fine lines underneath my eyes and kind of made the sun spot seem a little lighter. I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week and my husband said it looks like I&#x27;m glowing and he does not know that I&#x27;m using this product. I&#x27;m very happy with my results can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like In 4 weeks. So happy I purchased.</li>
            <li> Use it every morning! It was highly recommended by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> Priced way better than the manufactures website!</li>
            <li> l have used skin ceuticals for over 2 years now and l am very pleased with their products,creams thank you</li>
            <li> I love how tight it makes my skin feel.  I follow up with skinceuticals moisturizer! Not oily it dry at all</li>
            <li> Love everything about it, the perfume, the texture and the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, first purchase on Amazon for this and it is the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product that truly helps my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells awful - not something I want anywhere near my face. As such, hard to say whether or not it works...</li>
            <li> The vitamin C is highly concentrated.  It is the first thing I put on in the morning, then my moisturizer and sunblock.  It makes your skin radiant in addition to protecting it.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I have used it for years and my skin is very nice for 73!  I get a lot of compliments on my skin. It&#x27;s price, but I use a much less pricier moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> Thank you .. Product arrived in tact..nd within expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully well used with sunscreen. Is supposed to be good for the skin, but I find it&#x27;s irritating on the chest area.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. I try many beauty items but this is a staple of mine.. Start and finish the day with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and couldn&#x27;t live without it. The entire line is amazing and a must have for anti aging.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time, love it!</li>
            <li> Everything was ok. The purchase arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing this product at my drs office and it was much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I found it on Amazon. This product works great on my skin. It drys quickly, leaving a&lt;br /&gt;nice feeling.</li>
            <li> It was a different color and smells weird. Not like last time either. There was a tampering plastic still on it tho so idk</li>
            <li> I already used a full bottle. I didn&#x27;t notice any change but many people around me, told me I look younger. Someone even ask me if I had injections or botox. So I think even I don&#x27;t see it that the product really improved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The first bottle I used had a bad smell of roasted bacon (the smell didn&#x27;t last at all on the skin). This new bottle has no strong smell (or I&#x27;m starting to get use of it ?). The product is also lighter in color. Maybe the first bottle was older ? Anyway, It didn&#x27;t affect the efficacy of the product&lt;br /&gt;Since it seems to work, I will continue to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Great product been using for years</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old woman who within the last year suddenly had bags under my eyes.  :-(  I started using the skin tightener products that eliminated that problem somewhat.  However, the SkinCeuticals product removed the bags within a few weeks.  Of course, what I didn&#x27;t realize was that once the bags went away, the skin was more wrinkled as the bags had been stretching that skin, unbeknownst to me.  However, now when I use the skin tightener product (from Peter Thomas Roth), the wrinkles are completed removed as the bags must have been what was holding back the skin tightener from working as well as I see it now can.  I will continue to use the SkinCeuticals product to see if they diminish the wrinkles now as they did the bags from my eyes.  :-)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 48 and have acne prone skin, brown spots and fine lines. my derm highly recommended this. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work for me. i noticed an improvement in my skin texture the morning after I first used it. it smells like hotdogs but it works well! i even use it under the delicate eye area. this product also slightly moisturizes as well. i would HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love skin ceuticals products. My skin looks great all the time</li>
            <li> This bottle was fresh and the liquid was colorless as it should be when new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least 5 years. I had photodamage when I started using it and the skin Ceuticals sunblock 30, and the photodamage has not gotten any worse.  I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot and I find this product invaluable, I find it really protects my skin.  You can&#x27;t beat the price from this seller, compared to local retail stores.</li>
            <li> The skin around my chin was drying, then peeling, then becoming inflamed. It would then scab then start the process over again and I began to notice the skin raising and beginning to scar. Upon a recommendation from a friend, I purchased this product, in addition to the Skinceuticals facial sunblock. Within three days, the skin stopped peeling and hasn&#x27;t returned since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbs within 2 minutes, skin looks moisturized and luminous after application. Wears well under makeup.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your $. My first complaint is the aweful smell of a hot dog on your face and the shine accompanying it.If I could go back I wouldve invested in better facial sunscreen.This is an ALL HYPE  product. Take this from an older view. Just because something sounds amazing doesn&#x27;t mean it is. This product actually did nothing positive. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s approved by a dermatologist, many products are. Save your time! I did buy samples and from an online vendor that was credible. If you have to try it look for samples (vials) to try!</li>
            <li> I have used this antioxident for years.  I have perfect skin, no skin damage, no sun or age spots, no  visible pores.  I use this as my first step every morning and would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Visible difference in a few days.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years...can&#x27;t imagine my skin without it! I have mature skin and spend a lot of time outside. This serum has changed the texture over time and I am always complimented on my skin. Owe a lot to this little brown bottle</li>
            <li> It is the most effective treatment for hyper pigmentation issues.</li>
            <li> Not as advertised. I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Quicker than expected delivery.  Product in new condition.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several days and I see an improvement in my skin.  To me, it is a dramatic improvement for only a few days of use.  Will definitely continue to use this.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for everyone, but my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for several years</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Feels great on skin</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife. She loves it so, 5 stars. Does it work? I am not going to go near that question.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 years. A student guessed my age at 40....I&#x27;m 58:)  SOLD!</li>
            <li> Together with hydrating gel I get the. Best results&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and love it...this site was $50.00 cheaper than my Dermatologist office!</li>
            <li> been using this for a few years. Very happy</li>
            <li> My friend gave me her travel size to use. I used it for two weeks and saw some amazing results. I have acne prone skin and this product actually helps. I will have used this product for almost a month now and really like it!</li>
