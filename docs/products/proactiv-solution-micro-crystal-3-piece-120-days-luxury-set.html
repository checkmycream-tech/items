            <li>I love it!  </li>

            <li>amazing product for acnes...don&#x27;t hesitate to use it...turns your skin 100% ...</li>
            <li>If you have this kind you HAVE to see a physician and it will save you a lot of money to do that.</li>
            <li>and I have made her an apt because I fear she has my cystic acne curse.</li>
            <li>you for your kind feedback!&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
            <li>buy a product called &amp;#34;Exposed&amp;#34; or buy proactive as well as some kind of face wash that has &amp;#34;acid salycilic&amp;#34; on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my whiteheads as effectively as I want it to.</li>
            <li>My skin still isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s way better.&lt;br /&gt;These huge bottles are a good value and were fresh, not expiring anytime soon.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin Amazing and that&#x27;s shat matters :)</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and this is the best over the counter product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered Proactiv from the official website and used it with great success but gotten sketchy service.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants quality products and good prices!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that i can buy this luxury set its so huge and its a good price.</li>
            <li>Too good to be true.</li>
            <li>clog is a very important reason for creating acnes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see my son&#x27;s cute face again.</li>
            <li>I am so glad thati ordered this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so awesome to see all the different prices.</li>
            <li>This was an awesome buy and it will last 4mths.</li>
            <li>and my face is looking better</li>
            <li>After purchasing a trial sample, and achieving results in no time at all, I decided I needed more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Glad to have gotten it from here.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my wife and her skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>For a $70 product, I was expecting much better expiration dates.</li>
            <li>3 Piece Set was just as described with appropriate expiration dates.  </li>
            <li>Product met with my expectation, i am enjoying using and i have no reaction at all.</li>
            <li>You have to use all three products to receive the most benefits.</li>
            <li>You can still eat most dairy products, but eat them sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love that I can order on here &amp; don&#x27;t get set up on the automatic renewals.</li>
            <li>but I use it nightly and my skin has never looked better or felt smoother.</li>
            <li>...use ACNEFREE: its a third the price of proactive and has AMAZING results!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many others were scammed by Proactive having your account number and charging over a couple hundred dollars a month before you even noticed</li>
            <li>I also love the face cream, which moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to buy the product this way as opposed to getting into one of their subscriptions/memberships because I don&#x27;t want to be pressured into buying it more than I need.</li>
            <li>My Favorite Brand.</li>
            <li>but now i don&#x27;t have to worry abut it as proactiv is the love of my life</li>
            <li>Will be buying many more times :)</li>
            <li>She leaves it on all night and her skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and at such an awesome price!!  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t prevent breakouts 100%, but it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>this is by far the best and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Purchased this a week ago and so far its working great.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again :)  Most importantly, saw great results after a month or so.  </li>
            <li>She has tried other product but Proactive seems work the best.</li>
            <li>We will always be getting pro active from this vender great job and fare price , my wife loves it !</li>
            <li>It is in fact an OKAY product for some people, but there is nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li>Watching her progression first hand was amazing, so I figured why not try it myself on areas I could use improvement.</li>
            <li>This is not a big worry for me since is more like a trade-off of the greater good of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The Cost: I went off of it for a while because of cost and the auto-draft issues I had with the Guthy-Renker company.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s skin is beautiful again and her confidence it back!</li>
            <li>This is an authentic product and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice large bottles.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly for heavy acne.</li>
            <li>It did however turn my sheets and pillow case light brown</li>
            <li>Cheaper to buy here and get free shipping.</li>
            <li>ACNE FREE gave me the results that proactiv was supposed to...</li>
            <li>It took several months, but his skin looks great now and we will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>Not only is the Amazon price is wonderful but it&#x27;s better than ordering directly through Proactiv since they charge your credit card every month which I just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li>The product is fabulous, it</li>
            <li>use an oil free lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use this step too often to be honest.  </li>
            <li>The combo of those 2 products does enough to keep me happy.  </li>
            <li>great product i used to be a member on proactiv.com and was really paying too much for it.  </li>
            <li>I am an adult with acne and it does a good job.</li>
            <li>If you have a more mild case I am sure this will help and it seems very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Have tried many, many, many different treatment.</li>
            <li>Okay, so for anyone of you out there wondering if Proactiv really works...it does!</li>
            <li>For the price you pay and the size you get totally worth it!</li>
            <li>This product works great as long as you are faithful with it.  </li>
            <li>For me it took two months, but it was well worth waiting for!  </li>
            <li>Luckily, Amazon.com began offering the larger sets through Great Skin Concepts which qualifies for Super Saver Shipping (which I love!)&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I have used these product for a good year, but lately found that it is a bit &amp;#34;GRITTY&amp;#34; for my skin; now I have moved on to using Proactiv+; still good value for money.</li>
            <li>I love the large size</li>
            <li>We will most certainly order again when he runs out.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and smooth right after use.</li>
            <li>At the age of 24 I&#x27;ve been battling acne more the better part of 10 years now, it has been an emotional self esteem crushing roller coaster that I&#x27;ve been dying to get off of.  </li>
            <li>I am questioning whether or not this is true proactiv.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use if I am in a hurry and just want to clean my face quickly.  </li>
            <li>After 3-4 weeks of use the improvements  were quick and drastic.</li>
            <li>Proactiv is helping my daughters face tremendously</li>
            <li>Came in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li>Product as described, quick shipment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchasing the 3 most used items in a Proactiv kit makes more financial sense to me.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this set for my grandson, it has helped him tremendously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products over the years, this is the first one that truly works and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Several family members use this and all are very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>its always quick and exactly what she orders !</li>
            <li>I particularly like the 120 day set, as it lasts the longest and is the most economical to buy.</li>
            <li>I am very happy I was able to fine this in larger sizes for about the same price as the smaller sets.</li>
            <li>Used this claimed new ingredient one many times.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different, some may be more sensitive to this treatment then others, but compared to the acne that i had before using this i&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>It takes consistent use to work and may not be the answer for everyone, but it has made a significant difference for them.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been usng Proactiv for several years now, and I love it!</li>
            <li>exactly!</li>
            <li>I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when I found out that I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Great value, saves me the trouble of reordering every month.</li>
            <li>This products is the only one I would recommend for any kind of skin.</li>
            <li>Breakouts rarely occur now and when they do, they are milder.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, I used to laugh at all those infomercials too.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old son has been using Proactive for about a year and we love it.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was exactly as pictured and described on the site.  </li>
            <li>I received the product quickly, it was exactly what it stated it was.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and find the larger size an economical way to keep a good quantity on hand.</li>
            <li>This system leaves my skin feeling, clean, soft, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>His face improved right away within five days.  </li>
            <li>This product was the BEST value I found on the market, before I ordered directly from the company on line first, the size was much smaller and more expensive, then I found this 8 Fl  size, the price was AMAZING for the quantity.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, how smooth your face will feel after you use it with the Vitamin C serum, never leaving your skin dry and flaky like most skin products on the market.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>You will need to adjust the regimen based on your skin type and the level of your acne, because the product is drying and may be too strong for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Went to the mall to buy the real proactiv, then it quickly fixes everything.</li>
            <li>The products were just as described, arrived quickly, and were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>were they will put you on a monthly contract unless you are very, very, very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using tons of stuff to get rid of my acnes but nothing was working very much.</li>
            <li>The cleanser has fine micro-beads that gently stimulate the skin while cleansing, the toner is effective without being harsh.</li>
            <li>I love that the Proactiv line comes in these larger sizes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this set.</li>
            <li>the end they will fight you by telling you that you will have to pay the first three months,</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of getting them off of Amazon especially as a Prime member.</li>
            <li>Compared the bottles with the ones I got most recently from Proactiv</li>
            <li>I have been using it for over one year and found that immediately from the first use my skin felt softer and looked brighter.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time to purchase on line instead of the store.</li>
            <li>You also need to use it exactly as recommended.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try Amazon, and while the service was much better, I had a totally different experience with the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I have been using Proactive for years and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well</li>
            <li>Does not get rid of all blemishes, but definitely works better compared to salicylic &amp; benzoyl over the counter treatments.</li>
            <li>I always buy this exact kit from the same seller and am always extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Teen daughter started using it and it seemed to help for a month or two at most.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time buying it from Amazon</li>
            <li>The bottles arrived sealed and had many months left before the expiration date on the bottom.</li>
            <li>This product works immediately after first use.</li>
            <li>Proactiv is an amazing product and the only one that keeps my sensitive skin clear and oil free.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I never thought I&#x27;d try this product until a friend of mine who was suffering from extreme acne and breakout was recommended Proactiv from her Esthetician.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 8 days now and the big bright red pimples he had are gone.</li>
            <li>I purchased this trio for my daughter and it lasts much longer than the ones she first got in the mail.  </li>
            <li>So, if you were concerned about how long it lasts for the price, you can probably get more than what&#x27;s advertised.  </li>
            <li>Amazon Prime usually does a good job with their 2-3 day shipping, so it arrives fast when I need</li>
            <li>A large volume set, don&#x27;t need to shop as often.</li>
            <li>Certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>a background, I had some pretty decent breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Though make sure sufficient moisture lotion  is applied, my skin gets very dry after Proactiv.</li>
            <li>This works as great as the last time i used Proactive a few years ago.</li>
            <li>In fact the product is available at any drug store in generic form....and probably much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>The micro-crystals really do exfoliate.</li>
            <li>do way I expectas  and delivered was fast</li>
            <li>This acne treatment clears my face up really fast.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;d be in tears getting ready every morning.</li>
            <li>I am very displeased about this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>on skin, but this set really clears up the skin.</li>
            <li>I would much rather use Clinique Acne Formula, which uses salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>It took about three months to see my acne begin to really fade away.  </li>
            <li>It really damages your skin.  </li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t tell as much with that color.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>We buy this stuff all the time and it is so much cheaper to get this in bulk with prime.</li>
            <li>This product was priced reasonable.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t talk too much.</li>
            <li>drink as much water as</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t where their product is coming and if the contents are real.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try, it will really start paying off after about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have really oily, tanned skin.</li>
            <li>Find a medicine that works and use it until it stops working, Test different medicines and have a backup for when your current medicine seems to stop being as effective as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to use Amazon to buy this product as the actual Proactive site seems like a complete scam and hassle.</li>
            <li>In the first three days using proactive, I was hopeful because his skin looked a slight bit better.</li>
            <li>Clearasil, Murad, Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, Oxy, and early on even Proactiv which didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>This mask really helps clean deep into those pores and get all the junk off your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried many other products that did not work and had allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>To her surprise, the bottles were bigger than she originally assumed they would be.  </li>
            <li>Originally purchased it for my teenage son, but I tried it and was hooked.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a light user, be forewarned that the product will most likely expire before you can get half way through the bottles.</li>
            <li>like this deal better - eliminating the recurring charges on my credit card and purchasing the large set for a slightly cheaper price  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone on a budget with moderate to severe acne (since the drawbacks would probably be too much for mild acne that can be controlled with milder products.)</li>
            <li>These big bottles are very useful as I don&#x27;t live in the US and thus can&#x27;t buy the product all the time.</li>
            <li>you’re worried about your skin becoming dry because of using this product, you only need to augment the use of this product with a powerful [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that since I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv, I&#x27;ve scheduled less appointments with my Esthetician, resulting in more money in my pockets.</li>
            <li>I think, even if it did only last that amount of time though, confidence and a clean face is worth 75-100</li>
            <li>For example, for my daughter who has mild acne, she only uses it 1x a</li>
            <li>I think i may come back for more later.</li>
            <li>The classic was not working for me.</li>
            <li>I love these big bottles that last a while!</li>
            <li>Also, after slamming Proactiv, I should have a solution for you: Id just like to say that I bought \\&quot;university medical acne free sensitive skin and acne kit\\&quot; and my acne cleared in about 1 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li>so if you can get around the price, then I would highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes but it just didn&#x27;t pay off for me.</li>
            <li>Even better,it was not an old set like so many other sellers are doing.</li>
            <li>We saved a little money and we love getting it in the mail box versus going to the mall.</li>
            <li>There have been times when I have run out and used cheaper drugstore brand acne cleansing products - such as Clean &amp; Clear and Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>do amazing on hard acne.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a couple months now and it really helps clear up my face.</li>
            <li>This will help keep your face moisturized when using a powerful cleanser like Proactive, without clogging your pores with excess materials that you’d find in traditional cream moisturizers.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a heavy user and plan to use it twice per day, this is probably one of the better deals you can find.</li>
            <li>All skin types are different but it is worth trying before you spend money at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>, if u want the new stuff, and if u are daily user of proactiv, go ahead and purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bif u rarely use it, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I used the product less often than they reccomended, and while it was effective, the 120 supply only lasted a month.</li>
            <li>I recommend the new Proactiv formula.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s fully sealed(brand new).</li>
            <li>this is the new stuff that has micro crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con :</li>
            <li>so I took her off it and started using organic herbal soap and epsom salt with water to splash on wet clean skin and it hardens.  </li>
            <li>My skin has always been very clear on proactiv</li>
            <li>I bought this for my grandson 16 years old and for an over the counter treatment it WORKS!  </li>
            <li>I would ONLY buy this from here because of the HORROR stories I have heard about ordering from the proactive website, due to you not being able to stop them billing your card once you no longer need it.</li>
            <li>I have been an avid Proactiv user for several years now</li>
            <li>my face instantly felt cleaner after the first wash</li>
            <li>this is the exact same item u get for signing up for proactiv.com.....</li>
            <li>The Proactiv system left my skin clean, but only to oil up again in a couple hours.</li>
            <li>Proactiv or seller just send me old version istead of new one?&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>This is the only product that when used consistently will leave me with clear skin.</li>
            <li>It’s important to use serum instead of a cream because you’re applying a lot less to your face</li>
            <li>the last three shipments I have ordered have been delivered a full three to four days earlier than promised.  </li>
            <li>A nice alternative for those with the same issue, as Proactiv is not cheap!</li>
            <li>I had only mild acne flair ups as a teen and thought that was the end of it-</li>
            <li>This is a bit harsh on my face, but since I&#x27;ve used the moisturizer it is fine.</li>
            <li>it clear my son  pimple.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter is going to be 14 years old soon, and the Proactiv Solutions have truly helped her complexion  and her self-esteem.</li>
            <li>so the drying was a complete surprise.  </li>
            <li>I am 36 years old and will never stop Proactiv.</li>
            <li>Been using it since i was 16yrs old</li>
            <li>I wonder if it is actually the real Proactiv product.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old</li>
            <li>I AM 54 AND GET ADULT ACNE</li>
            <li>My skin is somewhat sensitive and I get razor burn, ingrown hairs, and zits all along my jawline.  </li>
            <li>Try Lerosett&#x27;s Natural Clay Mask.  </li>
            <li>It contains NO chemicals and uses all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Early pregnancy breakouts had me looking for something to get my face glowing...</li>
            <li>As far as how well this product works, it works well for me.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions completely...</li>
            <li>The experience has burned me on Proactiv completely.</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old</li>
            <li>Luxury Set and check the components with set that i had before with old formula</li>
            <li>But with this seller I found this product is not that old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for acne products for months for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s completely motivated by the results.</li>
            <li>Once as a teenager and once as an adult.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the expiration date was not the month I ordered it, but 6 months in the future.</li>
            <li>My progress is come along slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>As a 30 year-old woman with annoying breakouts, I thought this product worked GREAT!!</li>
            <li>My pores are slowly shrinking and I love the results I get.</li>
            <li>Two of the three bottles were as described, but the 4 ounce bottle was exactly the same size as my current 3 ounce bottle...</li>
            <li>Sometimes I would try and skip using one or the other products because I would run out of one or more before the other ran out.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this for teen acne.</li>
            <li>Pls explaine to me why new formula are exactly similar to the old one if its need to contain some Micro Crystals?</li>
            <li>It is what I expected, them items arrived very quickly and the bottle sizes were what I expected to get.</li>
            <li>I normally use the \\&quot;Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I found elsewhere on Amazon a large size of the cleanser only and will probably purchase that next time as my daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to go through steps 2 and 3 as often.  </li>
            <li>I have been a proactiv user for a very long time and it has always worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I like the larger proactiv bottles and these cost as much as the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>History: I have extremely sensitive skin and moderate adult acne.  </li>
            <li>The few zits I do get are extremely small and go away in a few days, the larger zits aren&#x27;t billowing up into massive cysts and go away pretty quick on their own.  </li>
            <li>clean&#x60;s my face like no other product does</li>
            <li>But the only problem is that it leaves your skin pretty dry and itchy...</li>
            <li>I could see the effects the next morning and after using the products for a month, my face is clear.</li>
            <li>and I have found that this is the only product that will help clear up my oily skin from acne.</li>
            <li>I would recommend at least trying it, but it really take about 6 months to a year to really know whether any product is working for you!</li>
            <li>I have tried everything on the market (especially over the counter medications) since I developed acne after my daughter was born.  </li>
            <li>I had seen tv commercials about Proactiv and it was recommended by our family doctor for my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s recently forming acne problems.</li>
            <li>My 13-year old son has been using Proactiv to keep his teenage acne under control.</li>
            <li>I actually believe that you need to provide me with a complete REFUND or purchase credit.</li>
            <li>but I thought I&#x27;d try it now for my adult acne and same results.</li>
            <li>The results are not immediate--the acne will appear worse, before it gets better.</li>
            <li>Ordering Proactiv on their own web site is extremely expensive when you live outside of the US and you can only order very small bottles that run out very quickly.</li>
            <li>my face is finally starting to calm down.  </li>
            <li>The only other negative is that it exfoliates so well that he always has white flakes on the top of his shirt, but really that just shows it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>If you have a more serious acne problem this will NOT work!</li>
            <li>Also, you will still get pimples here and there using the product, but if you have a bad acne problem like teenage boys, you&#x27;ll be happy with one or two here and there.</li>
            <li>IT DID NOT DRY OUT MY SKIN AND ACNE</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with minor acne looking to clear their skin.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old twin sons had begun minor break out.  </li>
            <li>It helps me control the small acne I have sometimes on my face, now it&#x27;s rare when I have acne, but I do use it every day.</li>
            <li>In a few hours though it got pretty oily.</li>
            <li>I had called their Customer Service previously and asked that my shipments be sent in a 3 month frequency, but I was still receiving too much product and having to pay for it without having actually used it.</li>
            <li>These products seem to be identical to the ones I bought directly from the Proactiv company, but with one nice twist:  they are less expensive when you buy them on Amazon.</li>

            <li> 3 Piece Set was just as described with appropriate expiration dates.  </li>
            <li> Product met with my expectation, i am enjoying using and i have no reaction at all.</li>
            <li> You have to use all three products to receive the most benefits.</li>
            <li> You can still eat most dairy products, but eat them sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love that I can order on here &amp; don&#x27;t get set up on the automatic renewals.</li>
            <li> but I use it nightly and my skin has never looked better or felt smoother.</li>
            <li> ...use ACNEFREE: its a third the price of proactive and has AMAZING results!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many others were scammed by Proactive having your account number and charging over a couple hundred dollars a month before you even noticed</li>
            <li> I also love the face cream, which moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to buy the product this way as opposed to getting into one of their subscriptions/memberships because I don&#x27;t want to be pressured into buying it more than I need.</li>
            <li> My Favorite Brand.</li>
            <li> but now i don&#x27;t have to worry abut it as proactiv is the love of my life</li>
            <li> Will be buying many more times :)</li>
            <li> She leaves it on all night and her skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and at such an awesome price!!  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent breakouts 100%, but it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> this is by far the best and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this a week ago and so far its working great.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again :)  Most importantly, saw great results after a month or so.  </li>
            <li> She has tried other product but Proactive seems work the best.</li>
            <li> We will always be getting pro active from this vender great job and fare price , my wife loves it !</li>
            <li> It is in fact an OKAY product for some people, but there is nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li> Watching her progression first hand was amazing, so I figured why not try it myself on areas I could use improvement.</li>
            <li> This is not a big worry for me since is more like a trade-off of the greater good of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The Cost: I went off of it for a while because of cost and the auto-draft issues I had with the Guthy-Renker company.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin is beautiful again and her confidence it back!</li>
            <li> This is an authentic product and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice large bottles.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly for heavy acne.</li>
            <li> It did however turn my sheets and pillow case light brown</li>
            <li> Cheaper to buy here and get free shipping.</li>
            <li> ACNE FREE gave me the results that proactiv was supposed to...</li>
            <li> It took several months, but his skin looks great now and we will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Not only is the Amazon price is wonderful but it&#x27;s better than ordering directly through Proactiv since they charge your credit card every month which I just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with.</li>
            <li> The product is fabulous, it</li>
            <li> use an oil free lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this step too often to be honest.  </li>
            <li> The combo of those 2 products does enough to keep me happy.  </li>
            <li> great product i used to be a member on proactiv.com and was really paying too much for it.  </li>
            <li> I am an adult with acne and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> If you have a more mild case I am sure this will help and it seems very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Have tried many, many, many different treatment.</li>
            <li> Okay, so for anyone of you out there wondering if Proactiv really works...it does!</li>
            <li> For the price you pay and the size you get totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This product works great as long as you are faithful with it.  </li>
            <li> For me it took two months, but it was well worth waiting for!  </li>
            <li> Luckily, Amazon.com began offering the larger sets through Great Skin Concepts which qualifies for Super Saver Shipping (which I love!)&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I have used these product for a good year, but lately found that it is a bit &amp;#34;GRITTY&amp;#34; for my skin; now I have moved on to using Proactiv+; still good value for money.</li>
            <li> I love the large size</li>
            <li> We will most certainly order again when he runs out.</li>
            <li> My face felt clean and smooth right after use.</li>
            <li> At the age of 24 I&#x27;ve been battling acne more the better part of 10 years now, it has been an emotional self esteem crushing roller coaster that I&#x27;ve been dying to get off of.  </li>
            <li> I am questioning whether or not this is true proactiv.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use if I am in a hurry and just want to clean my face quickly.  </li>
            <li> After 3-4 weeks of use the improvements  were quick and drastic.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is helping my daughters face tremendously</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li> Product as described, quick shipment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchasing the 3 most used items in a Proactiv kit makes more financial sense to me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my grandson, it has helped him tremendously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other products over the years, this is the first one that truly works and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Several family members use this and all are very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> its always quick and exactly what she orders !</li>
            <li> I particularly like the 120 day set, as it lasts the longest and is the most economical to buy.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I was able to fine this in larger sizes for about the same price as the smaller sets.</li>
            <li> Used this claimed new ingredient one many times.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different, some may be more sensitive to this treatment then others, but compared to the acne that i had before using this i&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> It takes consistent use to work and may not be the answer for everyone, but it has made a significant difference for them.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been usng Proactiv for several years now, and I love it!</li>
            <li> exactly!</li>
            <li> I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when I found out that I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Great value, saves me the trouble of reordering every month.</li>
            <li> This products is the only one I would recommend for any kind of skin.</li>
            <li> Breakouts rarely occur now and when they do, they are milder.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, I used to laugh at all those infomercials too.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son has been using Proactive for about a year and we love it.</li>
            <li> Its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was exactly as pictured and described on the site.  </li>
            <li> I received the product quickly, it was exactly what it stated it was.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and find the larger size an economical way to keep a good quantity on hand.</li>
            <li> This system leaves my skin feeling, clean, soft, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> His face improved right away within five days.  </li>
            <li> This product was the BEST value I found on the market, before I ordered directly from the company on line first, the size was much smaller and more expensive, then I found this 8 Fl  size, the price was AMAZING for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, how smooth your face will feel after you use it with the Vitamin C serum, never leaving your skin dry and flaky like most skin products on the market.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> You will need to adjust the regimen based on your skin type and the level of your acne, because the product is drying and may be too strong for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Went to the mall to buy the real proactiv, then it quickly fixes everything.</li>
            <li> The products were just as described, arrived quickly, and were reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> were they will put you on a monthly contract unless you are very, very, very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using tons of stuff to get rid of my acnes but nothing was working very much.</li>
            <li> The cleanser has fine micro-beads that gently stimulate the skin while cleansing, the toner is effective without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I love that the Proactiv line comes in these larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this set.</li>
            <li> the end they will fight you by telling you that you will have to pay the first three months,</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of getting them off of Amazon especially as a Prime member.</li>
            <li> Compared the bottles with the ones I got most recently from Proactiv</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over one year and found that immediately from the first use my skin felt softer and looked brighter.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time to purchase on line instead of the store.</li>
            <li> You also need to use it exactly as recommended.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try Amazon, and while the service was much better, I had a totally different experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Proactive for years and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well</li>
            <li> Does not get rid of all blemishes, but definitely works better compared to salicylic &amp; benzoyl over the counter treatments.</li>
            <li> I always buy this exact kit from the same seller and am always extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Teen daughter started using it and it seemed to help for a month or two at most.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time buying it from Amazon</li>
            <li> The bottles arrived sealed and had many months left before the expiration date on the bottom.</li>
            <li> This product works immediately after first use.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is an amazing product and the only one that keeps my sensitive skin clear and oil free.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I never thought I&#x27;d try this product until a friend of mine who was suffering from extreme acne and breakout was recommended Proactiv from her Esthetician.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 8 days now and the big bright red pimples he had are gone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trio for my daughter and it lasts much longer than the ones she first got in the mail.  </li>
            <li> So, if you were concerned about how long it lasts for the price, you can probably get more than what&#x27;s advertised.  </li>
            <li> Amazon Prime usually does a good job with their 2-3 day shipping, so it arrives fast when I need</li>
            <li> A large volume set, don&#x27;t need to shop as often.</li>
            <li> Certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> a background, I had some pretty decent breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Though make sure sufficient moisture lotion  is applied, my skin gets very dry after Proactiv.</li>
            <li> This works as great as the last time i used Proactive a few years ago.</li>
            <li> In fact the product is available at any drug store in generic form....and probably much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> The micro-crystals really do exfoliate.</li>
            <li> do way I expectas  and delivered was fast</li>
            <li> This acne treatment clears my face up really fast.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;d be in tears getting ready every morning.</li>
            <li> I am very displeased about this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> on skin, but this set really clears up the skin.</li>
            <li> I would much rather use Clinique Acne Formula, which uses salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> It took about three months to see my acne begin to really fade away.  </li>
            <li> It really damages your skin.  </li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t tell as much with that color.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> We buy this stuff all the time and it is so much cheaper to get this in bulk with prime.</li>
            <li> This product was priced reasonable.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t talk too much.</li>
            <li> drink as much water as</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t where their product is coming and if the contents are real.</li>
            <li> Anyways, this stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try, it will really start paying off after about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have really oily, tanned skin.</li>
            <li> Find a medicine that works and use it until it stops working, Test different medicines and have a backup for when your current medicine seems to stop being as effective as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to use Amazon to buy this product as the actual Proactive site seems like a complete scam and hassle.</li>
            <li> In the first three days using proactive, I was hopeful because his skin looked a slight bit better.</li>
            <li> Clearasil, Murad, Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, Oxy, and early on even Proactiv which didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> This mask really helps clean deep into those pores and get all the junk off your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried many other products that did not work and had allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> To her surprise, the bottles were bigger than she originally assumed they would be.  </li>
            <li> Originally purchased it for my teenage son, but I tried it and was hooked.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a light user, be forewarned that the product will most likely expire before you can get half way through the bottles.</li>
            <li> like this deal better - eliminating the recurring charges on my credit card and purchasing the large set for a slightly cheaper price  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone on a budget with moderate to severe acne (since the drawbacks would probably be too much for mild acne that can be controlled with milder products.)</li>
            <li> These big bottles are very useful as I don&#x27;t live in the US and thus can&#x27;t buy the product all the time.</li>
            <li> you’re worried about your skin becoming dry because of using this product, you only need to augment the use of this product with a powerful [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that since I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv, I&#x27;ve scheduled less appointments with my Esthetician, resulting in more money in my pockets.</li>
            <li> I think, even if it did only last that amount of time though, confidence and a clean face is worth 75-100</li>
            <li> For example, for my daughter who has mild acne, she only uses it 1x a</li>
            <li> I think i may come back for more later.</li>
            <li> The classic was not working for me.</li>
            <li> I love these big bottles that last a while!</li>
            <li> Also, after slamming Proactiv, I should have a solution for you: Id just like to say that I bought \\&quot;university medical acne free sensitive skin and acne kit\\&quot; and my acne cleared in about 1 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li> so if you can get around the price, then I would highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but it just didn&#x27;t pay off for me.</li>
            <li> Even better,it was not an old set like so many other sellers are doing.</li>
            <li> We saved a little money and we love getting it in the mail box versus going to the mall.</li>
            <li> There have been times when I have run out and used cheaper drugstore brand acne cleansing products - such as Clean &amp; Clear and Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> do amazing on hard acne.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple months now and it really helps clear up my face.</li>
            <li> This will help keep your face moisturized when using a powerful cleanser like Proactive, without clogging your pores with excess materials that you’d find in traditional cream moisturizers.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a heavy user and plan to use it twice per day, this is probably one of the better deals you can find.</li>
            <li> All skin types are different but it is worth trying before you spend money at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> , if u want the new stuff, and if u are daily user of proactiv, go ahead and purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bif u rarely use it, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I used the product less often than they reccomended, and while it was effective, the 120 supply only lasted a month.</li>
            <li> I recommend the new Proactiv formula.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s fully sealed(brand new).</li>
            <li> this is the new stuff that has micro crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con :</li>
            <li> so I took her off it and started using organic herbal soap and epsom salt with water to splash on wet clean skin and it hardens.  </li>
            <li> My skin has always been very clear on proactiv</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson 16 years old and for an over the counter treatment it WORKS!  </li>
            <li> I would ONLY buy this from here because of the HORROR stories I have heard about ordering from the proactive website, due to you not being able to stop them billing your card once you no longer need it.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid Proactiv user for several years now</li>
            <li> my face instantly felt cleaner after the first wash</li>
            <li> this is the exact same item u get for signing up for proactiv.com.....</li>
            <li> The Proactiv system left my skin clean, but only to oil up again in a couple hours.</li>
            <li> Proactiv or seller just send me old version istead of new one?&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> This is the only product that when used consistently will leave me with clear skin.</li>
            <li> It’s important to use serum instead of a cream because you’re applying a lot less to your face</li>
            <li> the last three shipments I have ordered have been delivered a full three to four days earlier than promised.  </li>
            <li> A nice alternative for those with the same issue, as Proactiv is not cheap!</li>
            <li> I had only mild acne flair ups as a teen and thought that was the end of it-</li>
            <li> This is a bit harsh on my face, but since I&#x27;ve used the moisturizer it is fine.</li>
            <li> it clear my son  pimple.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is going to be 14 years old soon, and the Proactiv Solutions have truly helped her complexion  and her self-esteem.</li>
            <li> so the drying was a complete surprise.  </li>
            <li> I am 36 years old and will never stop Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Been using it since i was 16yrs old</li>
            <li> I wonder if it is actually the real Proactiv product.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old</li>
            <li> I AM 54 AND GET ADULT ACNE</li>
            <li> My skin is somewhat sensitive and I get razor burn, ingrown hairs, and zits all along my jawline.  </li>
            <li> Try Lerosett&#x27;s Natural Clay Mask.  </li>
            <li> It contains NO chemicals and uses all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Early pregnancy breakouts had me looking for something to get my face glowing...</li>
            <li> As far as how well this product works, it works well for me.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions completely...</li>
            <li> The experience has burned me on Proactiv completely.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old</li>
            <li> Luxury Set and check the components with set that i had before with old formula</li>
            <li> But with this seller I found this product is not that old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for acne products for months for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s completely motivated by the results.</li>
            <li> Once as a teenager and once as an adult.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the expiration date was not the month I ordered it, but 6 months in the future.</li>
            <li> My progress is come along slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> As a 30 year-old woman with annoying breakouts, I thought this product worked GREAT!!</li>
            <li> My pores are slowly shrinking and I love the results I get.</li>
            <li> Two of the three bottles were as described, but the 4 ounce bottle was exactly the same size as my current 3 ounce bottle...</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would try and skip using one or the other products because I would run out of one or more before the other ran out.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this for teen acne.</li>
            <li> Pls explaine to me why new formula are exactly similar to the old one if its need to contain some Micro Crystals?</li>
            <li> It is what I expected, them items arrived very quickly and the bottle sizes were what I expected to get.</li>
            <li> I normally use the \\&quot;Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I found elsewhere on Amazon a large size of the cleanser only and will probably purchase that next time as my daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to go through steps 2 and 3 as often.  </li>
            <li> I have been a proactiv user for a very long time and it has always worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li> I like the larger proactiv bottles and these cost as much as the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> History: I have extremely sensitive skin and moderate adult acne.  </li>
            <li> The few zits I do get are extremely small and go away in a few days, the larger zits aren&#x27;t billowing up into massive cysts and go away pretty quick on their own.  </li>
            <li> clean&#x60;s my face like no other product does</li>
            <li> But the only problem is that it leaves your skin pretty dry and itchy...</li>
            <li> I could see the effects the next morning and after using the products for a month, my face is clear.</li>
            <li> and I have found that this is the only product that will help clear up my oily skin from acne.</li>
            <li> I would recommend at least trying it, but it really take about 6 months to a year to really know whether any product is working for you!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market (especially over the counter medications) since I developed acne after my daughter was born.  </li>
            <li> I had seen tv commercials about Proactiv and it was recommended by our family doctor for my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s recently forming acne problems.</li>
            <li> My 13-year old son has been using Proactiv to keep his teenage acne under control.</li>
            <li> I actually believe that you need to provide me with a complete REFUND or purchase credit.</li>
            <li> but I thought I&#x27;d try it now for my adult acne and same results.</li>
            <li> The results are not immediate--the acne will appear worse, before it gets better.</li>
            <li> Ordering Proactiv on their own web site is extremely expensive when you live outside of the US and you can only order very small bottles that run out very quickly.</li>
            <li> my face is finally starting to calm down.  </li>
            <li> The only other negative is that it exfoliates so well that he always has white flakes on the top of his shirt, but really that just shows it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> If you have a more serious acne problem this will NOT work!</li>
            <li> Also, you will still get pimples here and there using the product, but if you have a bad acne problem like teenage boys, you&#x27;ll be happy with one or two here and there.</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT DRY OUT MY SKIN AND ACNE</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with minor acne looking to clear their skin.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old twin sons had begun minor break out.  </li>
            <li> It helps me control the small acne I have sometimes on my face, now it&#x27;s rare when I have acne, but I do use it every day.</li>
            <li> In a few hours though it got pretty oily.</li>
            <li> I had called their Customer Service previously and asked that my shipments be sent in a 3 month frequency, but I was still receiving too much product and having to pay for it without having actually used it.</li>
            <li> These products seem to be identical to the ones I bought directly from the Proactiv company, but with one nice twist:  they are less expensive when you buy them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The first few weeks, I got a little dryness on my face, but really not that much.  </li>
            <li> I have thrown away all of my other facial soaps and cleansers because this seems to do the trick in keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li> Proactiv sells other accompanying things but our experience has been that the 3 step set I&#x27;m reviewing is completely satisfactory for what we need.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the original!</li>
            <li> Over the years, due to the high cost of Proactiv, I&#x27;ve tried using other products on different occasions, such as the cheaper Acne Free Clear Skin System AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion), always with disastrous effect.</li>
            <li> I still get breakouts from time to time but they are smaller and less severe than they were before and they clear up quicker.  </li>
            <li> I am back to using my Proactiv and the dry patches, bumps, and red spots are gone.</li>
            <li> but no result till finally I realised not only once single thing can remove all of your acnes.</li>
            <li> how  long it is going to last because I&#x27;ve just start using it.</li>
            <li> i mean i read everything and didn&#x27;t miss a detail; I followed the instructions EXACTLY how they said to.  </li>
            <li> crazy and more pimples are coming back.</li>
            <li> The only thing she does not like about the product is that it can leave the skin feeling really dry.</li>
            <li> He also had red spots from old acne that remained for a few months as well, but they eventually faded.</li>
            <li> It did little to clear my acne.</li>
            <li> Helps to control my acne, it&#x27;s just difficult to use during summer when i want to go to the lake and enjoy the sun.</li>
            <li> Product: It has cleared up my skin dramatically with only minimal dryness.  </li>
            <li> The containers were bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this may have been sitting in your shelves for a long time and had rendered INEFFECTIVE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> But..use this too long, my skin gets use to it.</li>
            <li> However, for me, it is not for the long term.</li>
            <li> The only other drawback is the lotion causing discoloring of the necklines of shirts and pillowcases over time.</li>
            <li> She has tried numerous other products...</li>
            <li> So, I back off 1-2 months by using other skin care that does not have benzoyl peroxide in it.</li>
            <li> It used to dry my skin a lot, but I figured out that I was just using it too often.</li>
            <li> It does dry out my face a bit but</li>
            <li> Moisturizer if dry skin occurs for step 2.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think it helps dry out oils and help your complexion.  </li>
            <li> I use all three products twice a day every single day.  </li>
            <li> Does the job as it has clearly done in the past.</li>
            <li> Thinking that it was hormone related, I tried natural, herbal and synthetic hormone balancing systems that only seemed to make the breakouts worse.  </li>
            <li> After what we had heard about Pro Active, we spent extra to get it.  </li>
            <li> Any product that is new has the late expiration date.</li>
            <li> Use it daily, once at night before bed, leave on for a half hour, then wash off.  </li>
            <li> They are cyst type acne pimples that do not form a white or black head.</li>
            <li> and I think half of the stuff is still left.  </li>
            <li> , this kid is so bad, he&#x27;ll have pot marks all over his face!&amp;#34; The difference in just 8 days is astonishing.</li>
            <li> I got unlucky as I took after my mom more than my dad, my mom had bad acne when she was my age</li>
            <li> I had been these bad acnes for more than 14 years.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t go away for her completely until she was in her late 20&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive, but if it works, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> My face cleared up within a week with minimal dryness.</li>
            <li> Its expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> per kit, and it&#x27;s really not affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The weather has been very humid so that could be the cause for the poor skin</li>
            <li> The face scrub which has some rough particles in there that give you a good/cleaned feeling.  </li>
            <li> arrived on time and was as expected.</li>
            <li> Look out for sellers palming off old crap at high new product prices.</li>
            <li> A few things to keep in mind: when he first started using it, his face broke out even worse.</li>
            <li> Money, well spent!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product has an expiration date of exactly 4 months from the date I purchased.</li>
            <li> It is working well for my son and he prefers this product over any other anti acne medication we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> We have tried the other products and they just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Other acne treatments never helped me at all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the problem is, but what I received from this seller was not the same thing that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not willing to roll the dice again.</li>
            <li> We had tried other products but, they hadn&#x27;t worked.  </li>
            <li> daily, which you can get on here, or I usually pick it up at Macy&#x27;s on sale.  </li>
            <li> I think it over dried my skin because it got a little red</li>
            <li> One suffers from severe acne while the other has a mild case.</li>
            <li> This item came packaged but, something is not right with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son and he saw dramatic improvement in a short time.</li>
            <li> small dried up pimples, a cluster of maybe 4 or 5 slightly discolored spots which just last week had me thinking, &amp;#34;Oh boy</li>
            <li> It took about two weeks for that to settle down.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mean to disappoint potential buyers and acne sufferers, but please, don&#x27;t make my mistake in buying this.  </li>
            <li> This is acne that starts from deep within the skin instead on the surface of your face in shallow pores.  </li>
            <li> although half the cost.  </li>
            <li> my face feels less oily..</li>
            <li> and there was some slight peeling.</li>
            <li> The cost for the soap and espom salts about $3 per month or less.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am unhappy with the results as it does not seem to be effective (it uses benzoyl peroxide).  </li>
            <li> Very few pimples left, and even at PMS time, no more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;ll occasionally get 1 or 2 still (every few weeks),</li>
            <li> The commercials I&#x27;ve seen just gave me the impression of any other random ad that you see, that this would be complete BS.  </li>
            <li> During the summer i typically use this once at night before bed (this leads to a little bit of acne).</li>
            <li> Because it was so bad I was on the verge of bringing him to a dermatologist, I figured forking out $70 to give proactive a try was worth it.</li>
            <li> I do recommend buying the green tea moisturizer (sold separately) to go along with the treatments to take care of the dryness.</li>
            <li> I use the their Green Tea Moisturizer every day, too...</li>
            <li> then you would creams (just a few drops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do know a couple of people that say they have tried it and that it does not work for them (both oily skin types as well), but I suppose there will be a few outliers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I called a few times about this, but they didn&#x27;t seem to make the changes to my account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I suffered from Cystic acne, which is the worst kind.</li>
            <li> the green tea moisturizer fixes</li>
            <li> but, their faces are broken out like before, after regular use!</li>
            <li> I stopped after finding out I was pregnant and 2 weeks later my face broke out in a terrible rash.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend who has pretty bad acne</li>
            <li> She developed terrible acne on her forehead and chin and became so self-conscious that it started effecting her self confidence and the kids at school certainly didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> For those with cystic acne, these are those deep, large, and very painful zits that can seem to take a month to go away.  </li>
            <li> I started with moderate (not too bad, actually I guess, \\&quot;average\\&quot; skin)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stinky but it calms his skin down a lot, making the spots less red and inflamed and also less painful for him.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried ProActiv in the past and it&#x27;s worked, so this was just a matter of re-stocking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please watch for the small letters</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t do a double blind test, but according to her complexion, this stuff works well.</li>
            <li> When i use it during winter i use it when i wake up and before bed in small amounts (this leads to maybe one pimple to two pimples a week).</li>
            <li> The number of days this is supposed to last is laughable.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter twice to give it plenty of time to work but the results have been very poor, nothing like what is represented on the TV commercials</li>
            <li> Honestly, I really really wish I just had the skin that I had BEFORE proactive :(  </li>
            <li> Be patient.....as hard as it can be, you just have to remind yourself that it will go away one day.  </li>
            <li> and I hardly ever get spots.</li>
            <li> I did some reading and found out that this is common.</li>
            <li> I mean zits on zits all over blemishes.  </li>
            <li> to fix when ever I have excessive breakouts!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t happen all the time, but I normally had 3-5 zits that could be extremely annoying.  </li>
            <li> serious bang for buck.  </li>
            <li> i have mild to severe acne and when im stressed out i breakout badly!!</li>
            <li> I had bad shoulder and back acne.</li>
            <li> Try cutting milk and other dairy products out of your diet altogether and see if it helps.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who has acne, sorry to say but there is no magical cure to everyone&#x27;s acne, because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so so disappointed to say that after 4 months of this, I was left with SEVERE ACNE....</li>
            <li> When you first start using it, it will pull all that nasty stuff that&#x27;s been sitting in your pours, up to the surface.</li>
            <li> I got it for my 12 year old son, who has a bad acne!</li>
            <li> Friends had told me their faces broke out worse after using this product.</li>
            <li> But once you stop using it your skin will be 10 times worse than it was to start with.</li>
            <li> They put something in it that you HAVE to keep using it, your face literally gets addicted to this drug.</li>
            <li> While this product is reasonably priced for a 4 month supply, the expiration dates are pathetic.</li>
            <li> I use them not just for one month but for 3 or 4 months and still, my breakouts just get worse.</li>
            <li> I had an extreme reaction to the product; painful swelling, redness, then</li>
            <li> Remember when you were in high school and some kids had that awful acne covering their faces?</li>
            <li> A fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It become quite expensive for me when I used to receive it on a bi-monthly basis, so I stopped using and tried cheaper alternatives - like drug store cleansers and scrubs, but none of them worked.</li>
            <li> much, much, much worse than it was when I even started!  </li>
            <li> And who did wrong promotion:</li>
            <li> My pimples just grow larger and my acne become worst.</li>
            <li> expensive and there are cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> The selling competition is crazy.</li>
            <li> my skin goes crazy.</li>
            <li> Your sheets and pillow cases suck up all the oils from your skin and as you layyour head on your pillow at night, a dirty pillow case is just fuel for the fire...</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit 8 months ago, I&#x27;m sorry, but this does not work at all!  </li>
            <li> I wish Proactiv was cheapr, it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I was very wrong!  </li>
            <li> It is terrible for you, bottom line.</li>
            <li> Milk is your worst anyway, don&#x27;t believe me?  </li>
            <li> it was awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a vicious cycle.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Super fast shipping.Everything perfect.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for heavy acne.</li>
            <li> Remember when you were in high school and some kids had that awful acne covering their faces? That&#x27;s how my 15-year-old&#x27;s face was starting to look. I went through all the acne products at Wal-Mart with no results. Because it was so bad I was on the verge of bringing him to a dermatologist, I figured forking out $70 to give proactive a try was worth it. Man oh man! In the first three days using proactive, I was hopeful because his skin looked a slight bit better. It&#x27;s been 8 days now and the big bright red pimples he had are gone. He has one or two small dried up pimples, a cluster of maybe 4 or 5 slightly discolored spots which just last week had me thinking, &amp;#34;Oh boy, this kid is so bad, he&#x27;ll have pot marks all over his face!&amp;#34; The difference in just 8 days is astonishing. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this for teen acne. I can see my son&#x27;s cute face again. He&#x27;s happy too. He uses it in the morning and at night when he showers.</li>
            <li> This products is the only one I would recommend for any kind of skin. Works great. Will always buy it</li>
            <li> I basically bought this item for my teenage girls. One suffers from severe acne while the other has a mild case. We&#x27;ve tried ProActiv in the past and it&#x27;s worked, so this was just a matter of re-stocking.&lt;br /&gt;The product delivers in time! The results are not immediate--the acne will appear worse, before it gets better. You will need to adjust the regimen based on your skin type and the level of your acne, because the product is drying and may be too strong for sensitive skin. For example, for my daughter who has mild acne, she only uses it 1x a day.&lt;br /&gt;Beware when buying this on sites like Ebay, b/c the seller may be getting rid of expired product. Always check the customer reviews!</li>
            <li> Came fast. Been using proactive for years. Used this claimed new ingredient one many times. Know my skin. Without a doubt ingredients in the bottle was not what is claimed. A fake.</li>
            <li> This is the second order I have placed online for this product. My granddaughter is going to be 14 years old soon, and the Proactiv Solutions have truly helped her complexion  and her self-esteem. Great price for all three products! If you go thru the Proactive website, they will only allow you to order at discount prices if you subscribe to a monthly plan with them. I would rather buy it when she needs it...not when they want to send it to me. I would recommend it to anyone who wants quality products and good prices!</li>
            <li> I am so glad thati ordered this product. I always use this product and could not wait until it came in. I will order again.</li>
            <li> This product is something I will continue to order. The selling competition is crazy. It&#x27;s so awesome to see all the different prices. It gives me the opportunity to order all kinds of different ways. Some come with extra bonus. This showed up earlier. I am very happy with this buy.</li>
            <li> I like the larger proactiv bottles and these cost as much as the smaller ones. This was an awesome buy and it will last 4mths.</li>
            <li> I will never buy this again. The product bleached my pillow cases and my shirt. They need to have a disclaimer that their product may bleach clothing. Never again!</li>
            <li> For the size of these bottles I thought the price was great.  It was the same price for the 6oz bottles on Proactiv&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> ProActiv works for me where a lot of higher-grade acne solutions would not. &#x27;Nuff said. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years now and have had excellent results. You have to find what works for you, and this just may be it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! The micro-crystals really do exfoliate. This is a bit harsh on my face, but since I&#x27;ve used the moisturizer it is fine. This is the only product that when used consistently will leave me with clear skin. If you&#x27;re ambivalent, try the 60 day set. It may seem expensive, but if it works, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> do way I expectas  and delivered was fast</li>
            <li> this is a great product, and a great size!</li>
            <li> Proactive is the best! To this day, it still helps me and is now doing wonders for my teenage daughter!</li>
            <li> This acne treatment clears my face up really fast. I use it in the night before I go to bed and I see results the next day! Very good</li>
            <li> serious bang for buck.  and, we don&#x27;t have to keep ordering it every month.</li>
            <li> Proactiv Solution Micro Crystal Luxury set is a great acne fighter and money saver.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Proactiv on and off for 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;My History: I have extremely sensitive skin and moderate adult acne.  I have tried everything on the market (especially over the counter medications) since I developed acne after my daughter was born.  I had only mild acne flair ups as a teen and thought that was the end of it- I was very wrong!  Thinking that it was hormone related, I tried natural, herbal and synthetic hormone balancing systems that only seemed to make the breakouts worse.  The last resort has been Proactiv solution.&lt;br /&gt;The Product: It has cleared up my skin dramatically with only minimal dryness.  I do recommend buying the green tea moisturizer (sold separately) to go along with the treatments to take care of the dryness. I have really oily skin so the drying was a complete surprise.  I noticed when I skip moisturizing I will have one or two cystic acne flair ups until I get it back under control.  The only other drawback is the lotion causing discoloring of the necklines of shirts and pillowcases over time. This is not a big worry for me since is more like a trade-off of the greater good of the product.&lt;br /&gt;The Cost: I went off of it for a while because of cost and the auto-draft issues I had with the Guthy-Renker company. Luckily, Amazon.com began offering the larger sets through Great Skin Concepts which qualifies for Super Saver Shipping (which I love!)&lt;br /&gt;In Short:&lt;br /&gt;Great priced set and the last three shipments I have ordered have been delivered a full three to four days earlier than promised.  Would recommend to anyone on a budget with moderate to severe acne (since the drawbacks would probably be too much for mild acne that can be controlled with milder products.)</li>
            <li> I had seen tv commercials about Proactiv and it was recommended by our family doctor for my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s recently forming acne problems. I did some research and found most people like the product but don&#x27;t like dealing with the manufacturer because they force you to get a subscription and make it difficult to cancel. The perfect solution, I order this 120 day supply from Amazon and when it&#x27;s almost used up, I order again. My daughter loves it and in the year or so since she&#x27;s been using it we&#x27;ve seen her acne problem go from moderate to virtually nothing. It&#x27;s around $20 a month so if you can get around the price, then I would highly recommend giving it a try. Proactiv sells other accompanying things but our experience has been that the 3 step set I&#x27;m reviewing is completely satisfactory for what we need.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for 2 1/2 months with no change in my acne.  I have stop using it and my face is looking better, what&#x27;s up with that!!!</li>
            <li> Two of the three bottles were as described, but the 4 ounce bottle was exactly the same size as my current 3 ounce bottle...Why is 4 ounces written on the bottle??!!  Its actually 3 ounces.  Also, why are there 4 items in the picture when there are only 3 items sold in the set??</li>
            <li> This product works great for me.  I love the large size - I do not have to worry about having to reorder often.</li>
            <li> I love that the Proactiv line comes in these larger sizes. They last for months, so It&#x27;s a great value... and the product speaks for itself. I have been using the three step system for about six years. There have been times when I have run out and used cheaper drugstore brand acne cleansing products - such as Clean &amp; Clear and Neutrogena. Each time, my acne would creep back. I am 36 years old and will never stop Proactiv. I use the their Green Tea Moisturizer every day, too... it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I was sceptical. Friends had told me their faces broke out worse after using this product. I, however, had the opposite experience! My acne was gone within a week. Breakouts rarely occur now and when they do, they are milder. I love this!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Have tried many, many, many different treatment. BUT, have to stick with it. Miss one day and the zits will be back!</li>
            <li> I love proactive!!! Been using it since i was 16yrs old and it still works for me!! i have mild to severe acne and when im stressed out i breakout badly!! But proactive is my savior! I use it and my acne dissapears. I love the fact that i can buy this luxury set its so huge and its a good price. I got my order in 3 days!I will buy from this seller again.im very happy with my order.</li>
            <li> My 13-year old son has been using Proactiv to keep his teenage acne under control. These products seem to be identical to the ones I bought directly from the Proactiv company, but with one nice twist:  they are less expensive when you buy them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. No issues in packaging and met all of my expectations as I had hoped.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I could see the effects the next morning and after using the products for a month, my face is clear. I am so grateful that it worked.</li>
            <li> Okay, so for anyone of you out there wondering if Proactiv really works...it does! Don&#x27;t worry, I used to laugh at all those infomercials too. To be honest, I never thought I&#x27;d try this product until a friend of mine who was suffering from extreme acne and breakout was recommended Proactiv from her Esthetician. Watching her progression first hand was amazing, so I figured why not try it myself on areas I could use improvement. After purchasing a trial sample, and achieving results in no time at all, I decided I needed more. My friend had purchased this set, so I had to find it, and I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re worried about your skin becoming dry because of using this product, you only need to augment the use of this product with a powerful [[ASIN:B00I0N24TY Vitamin C Serum, like this one]]. This will help keep your face moisturized when using a powerful cleanser like Proactive, without clogging your pores with excess materials that you’d find in traditional cream moisturizers. It’s important to use serum instead of a cream because you’re applying a lot less to your face then you would creams (just a few drops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is Proactive on Amazon is also unmatched, especially for a product such as this. I&#x27;ve noticed that since I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv, I&#x27;ve scheduled less appointments with my Esthetician, resulting in more money in my pockets. It truly is a win win. Not to mention, how smooth your face will feel after you use it with the Vitamin C serum, never leaving your skin dry and flaky like most skin products on the market. Overall, I love this set. Money, well spent!</li>
            <li> Worked great. I had bad shoulder and back acne. All gone after about two weeks. It did however turn my sheets and pillow case light brown but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The containers were bigger than I expected.  Good product.  I have used it before.  My progress is come along slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson 16 years old and for an over the counter treatment it WORKS!  His face improved right away within five days.  but if he misses a day you can tell the acne will come back.  I&#x27;m Impressed !!</li>
            <li> Does proactive work, yes. But once you stop using it your skin will be 10 times worse than it was to start with. They put something in it that you HAVE to keep using it, your face literally gets addicted to this drug. I stopped after finding out I was pregnant and 2 weeks later my face broke out in a terrible rash. I figured it was from hormones but after going to the dermatologist he clarified that it was from proactive and all I could do was get back on it or wait it out. Here I am 4 months later an still have this pimply rash on my face. Thank god I stopped working or I&#x27;d be in tears getting ready every morning. I submitted pictures. Please do not buy this product!! It is terrible for you, bottom line.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage son and he saw dramatic improvement in a short time. I started using it for the occasional breakout and now use it every day. We&#x27;re on our third re-order. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Glad to have gotten it from here. It works great. Took about 3 weeks to see improvements. After 3-4 weeks of use the improvements  were quick and drastic. Very glad to have made the purchase. I would ONLY buy this from here because of the HORROR stories I have heard about ordering from the proactive website, due to you not being able to stop them billing your card once you no longer need it.</li>
            <li> My son uses these products.  He is happy with the results.  He keeps trying to get the dermatologist to give him pills, but they keep offering some &amp;#34;duo&amp;#34; medicine.  He keeps using Proactive.</li>
            <li> This item came packaged but, something is not right with this product. I have been a proactiv users for years and my skin has never reacted like this. I gave it a week. My oily skin is not drying out like crazy and more pimples are coming back. My doctor already corrected the hormonal imbalace in my skin with medication years ago. This product is not what it is sold by this seller. Too good to be true.</li>
            <li> This is the same as always. Only difference is increased price. Does the job as it has clearly done in the past.</li>
            <li> The product did not work. It was overpriced. I wonder if it is actually the real Proactiv product. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay and the size you get totally worth it! Will buy again rather than go through company</li>
            <li> My wife orders this from this site ... its always quick and exactly what she orders ! We will always be getting pro active from this vender great job and fare price , my wife loves it !</li>
            <li> Proactiv is the best treatment for acne prone skin. However, the proactiv kit that I received expires this month September 2013. I am very displeased about this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful system.  My 14 year old and I both have acne.  within a 2 week period, we have experienced wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I help my wife to order this product using the proactiv website. Please watch for the small letters were they will put you on a monthly contract unless you are very, very, very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end they will fight you by telling you that you will have to pay the first three months, even when you only needed/wanted 30 days supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife didn&#x27;t get any good results from the product anyway.</li>
            <li> Does what it says.  Bought it for my wife and her skin has never looked better.  She has tried numerous other products...this is by far the best and worth the price. Gulp.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! Every time I try something different my skin goes crazy. I am very happy I was able to fine this in larger sizes for about the same price as the smaller sets.</li>
            <li> Excellent and very true based from its description at Amazon.com. My kids are using it and very effective to them. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Working as mechanic and get oil, etc. on skin, but this set really clears up the skin. Haven&#x27;t had blackheads anymore.</li>
            <li> While this product is reasonably priced for a 4 month supply, the expiration dates are pathetic. Not everyone can use this product twice per day as recommended. I was hoping to extend this product for 7-8 months since I would only be using it once per day. Unfortunately, this product has an expiration date of exactly 4 months from the date I purchased. For a $70 product, I was expecting much better expiration dates. It seems I&#x27;m not the only who has had this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a heavy user and plan to use it twice per day, this is probably one of the better deals you can find. If you&#x27;re a light user, be forewarned that the product will most likely expire before you can get half way through the bottles.</li>
            <li> Proactiv Solution Micro Crystal 3 Piece Set was just as described with appropriate expiration dates.  Would purchase from buyer again.</li>
            <li> It is working well for my son and he prefers this product over any other anti acne medication we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My teen age daughter tried this brand a couple years ago. Then I read an article in Consumer Reports that said there were some cheaper brands that should work similarly. Well, after a couple months, she begged me to return to buying the Proactiv. We didn&#x27;t do a double blind test, but according to her complexion, this stuff works well.</li>
            <li> I ran out of Proactiv in December. I tried many other products that did not work and had allergic reactions. I am back to using my Proactiv and the dry patches, bumps, and red spots are gone. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is the second or third time that i have ordered this product,It had worked for my wife and son in law.But this time it did not help&lt;br /&gt;my step son at all!!!!??? I feel like this may have been sitting in your shelves for a long time and had rendered INEFFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;So I actually believe that you need to provide me with a complete REFUND or purchase credit.I can not supply you with the&lt;br /&gt;remainder of this product as my stepson lives overseas.</li>
            <li> Proactiv works great for both of my teenagers acne. We have tried the other products and they just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> The product is good as it is advetised. Though make sure sufficient moisture lotion  is applied, my skin gets very dry after Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid Proactiv user for several years now and I have found that this is the only product that will help clear up my oily skin from acne. It used to dry my skin a lot, but I figured out that I was just using it too often. Over the years, I&#x27;ve come to know what my skin needs and I use it once a day, at night. I do know a couple of people that say they have tried it and that it does not work for them (both oily skin types as well), but I suppose there will be a few outliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It become quite expensive for me when I used to receive it on a bi-monthly basis, so I stopped using and tried cheaper alternatives - like drug store cleansers and scrubs, but none of them worked. I finally gave in and decided to purchase it again, but this time, from Amazon. I had called their Customer Service previously and asked that my shipments be sent in a 3 month frequency, but I was still receiving too much product and having to pay for it without having actually used it. I called a few times about this, but they didn&#x27;t seem to make the changes to my account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this deal better - eliminating the recurring charges on my credit card and purchasing the large set for a slightly cheaper price  and when I need it. Amazon Prime usually does a good job with their 2-3 day shipping, so it arrives fast when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I haven&#x27;t had great experiences in the effectiveness of their Customer Care, I think the product itself is great. It was such a relief when I started using it again - my face instantly felt cleaner after the first wash and I could see results after just a couple of days. For this reason, and because I like the Amazon Prime shipping, I give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product works great as long as you are faithful with it.  If you miss days, you are not going to see the results you want.  And it takes about a month or two for the results to show up like you want them to.  But be patient and they will come.  Also, you will still get pimples here and there using the product, but if you have a bad acne problem like teenage boys, you&#x27;ll be happy with one or two here and there.</li>
            <li> Helps to control my acne, it&#x27;s just difficult to use during summer when i want to go to the lake and enjoy the sun. During the summer i typically use this once at night before bed (this leads to a little bit of acne). When i use it during winter i use it when i wake up and before bed in small amounts (this leads to maybe one pimple to two pimples a week). Everyone is different, some may be more sensitive to this treatment then others, but compared to the acne that i had before using this i&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Product met with my expectation, i am enjoying using and i have no reaction at all.I think i may come back for more later. Thank you</li>
            <li> My daughter received this in the mail.  To her surprise, the bottles were bigger than she originally assumed they would be.  Love the convenience of getting them off of Amazon especially as a Prime member.</li>
            <li> This has worked well for my wife and step-daughter.  It takes consistent use to work and may not be the answer for everyone, but it has made a significant difference for them.  I purchased the larger version and it arrived.  While it does not have the packaging, the bottles are identical but larger.  I highly recommend it and find the larger size an economical way to keep a good quantity on hand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Originally purchased it for my teenage son, but I tried it and was hooked.  All skin types are different but it is worth trying before you spend money at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is an amazing product and the only one that keeps my sensitive skin clear and oil free. You have to use all three products to receive the most benefits.</li>
            <li> I AM 54 AND GET ADULT ACNE IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM IT DID NOT DRY OUT MY SKIN AND ACNE IS GONE</li>
            <li> I recommend the new Proactiv formula. The classic was not working for me. I tried this one and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Tried these products as a teen and they didn&#x27;t work but I thought I&#x27;d try it now for my adult acne and same results. I use them not just for one month but for 3 or 4 months and still, my breakouts just get worse.</li>
            <li> I have almost two years using Proactive and it helped me with my acne.... This is the basic 3 steps. It helps me control the small acne I have sometimes on my face, now it&#x27;s rare when I have acne, but I do use it every day.</li>
            <li> Excellent products at a great price! I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter twice to give it plenty of time to work but the results have been very poor, nothing like what is represented on the TV commercials</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple months now and it really helps clear up my face. Good price for this product also....  will buy again!</li>
            <li> Best value for the price. Cheaper to buy here and get free shipping. Plus, the larger bottles last longer.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using pro activ for years. This is an authentic product and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Nice large bottles.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I know I hear people say they didn&#x27;t like proactive, but I definitely works for me. Leaves my skin Amazing and that&#x27;s shat matters :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend who has pretty bad acne (she&#x27;s 26). Did nothing for her. Will not be purchasing Proactiv products in the future.</li>
            <li> At the age of 24 I&#x27;ve been battling acne more the better part of 10 years now, it has been an emotional self esteem crushing roller coaster that I&#x27;ve been dying to get off of.  I unfortunately suffer from a more severe form of acne, cystic acne.  This is acne that starts from deep within the skin instead on the surface of your face in shallow pores.  I&#x27;ve tried almost every acne medication out there to no avail...  Clearasil, Murad, Clean &amp; Clear, Neutrogena, Oxy, and early on even Proactiv which didn&#x27;t work.  Now that I&#x27;m 24 my face is finally starting to calm down.  My skin is somewhat sensitive and I get razor burn, ingrown hairs, and zits all along my jawline.  I&#x27;ve been using a combination of Lerosett Acne Clay Mask with Proactiv and to my amazement it&#x27;s worked.  My face hasn&#x27;t been breaking out at all.  The few zits I do get are extremely small and go away in a few days, the larger zits aren&#x27;t billowing up into massive cysts and go away pretty quick on their own.  For anyone who has acne, sorry to say but there is no magical cure to everyone&#x27;s acne, because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can offer is solutions that seemed to help me, and they may help you, they may not...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  Find a medicine that works and use it until it stops working, Test different medicines and have a backup for when your current medicine seems to stop being as effective as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) AVOID DAIRY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.  This has always been a myth, but I speak from experience here folks.  For those with cystic acne, these are those deep, large, and very painful zits that can seem to take a month to go away.  Milk is your worst anyway, don&#x27;t believe me?  Try cutting milk and other dairy products out of your diet altogether and see if it helps.  You can still eat most dairy products, but eat them sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Change your sheets and pillow cases regularly.  Your sheets and pillow cases suck up all the oils from your skin and as you layyour head on your pillow at night, a dirty pillow case is just fuel for the fire...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Try Lerosett&#x27;s Natural Clay Mask.  It contains NO chemicals and uses all natural ingredients.  Use it daily, once at night before bed, leave on for a half hour, then wash off.  This mask really helps clean deep into those pores and get all the junk off your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.)  Be patient.....as hard as it can be, you just have to remind yourself that it will go away one day.  I got unlucky as I took after my mom more than my dad, my mom had bad acne when she was my age and it didn&#x27;t go away for her completely until she was in her late 20&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Cleanses without drying out your skin. I have thrown away all of my other facial soaps and cleansers because this seems to do the trick in keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li> this is the exact same item u get for signing up for proactiv.com.....although half the cost.  great product i used to be a member on proactiv.com and was really paying too much for it.  so i canceled and a couple of months when i ran out of my last bottle, found this on amazon and ordered immediately.  proactive charges u 3 payments of $30 for the 120 day supply, why pay that when u can get it all for $50</li>
            <li> Love that I can order on here &amp; don&#x27;t get set up on the automatic renewals. Same product as you get through ProActiv, just don&#x27;t have to deal with them.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and this is the best over the counter product.  I know because I have tried everything including pricy prescriptions.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever.. works well. Early pregnancy breakouts had me looking for something to get my face glowing... Proactiv did the trick for me. I don&#x27;t necessarily use it 2 times a day, because I find it can be drying to the skin but I use it nightly and my skin has never looked better or felt smoother.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the advertising.  Needless to say, I am unhappy with the results as it does not seem to be effective (it uses benzoyl peroxide).  I would much rather use Clinique Acne Formula, which uses salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this product . . .</li>
            <li> I have used these product for a good year, but lately found that it is a bit &amp;#34;GRITTY&amp;#34; for my skin; now I have moved on to using Proactiv+; still good value for money.</li>
            <li> Got this set as a way to save some money on the Proactiv system.  Came quickly and was exactly as pictured and described on the site.  Compared the bottles with the ones I got most recently from Proactiv and they are identical in labeling and ingredients.  They are sealed in plastic just like they are when they come from Proactiv, they are just not in the box like they would be from Proactiv.    As far as how well this product works, it works well for me.  I have been using it for over one year and found that immediately from the first use my skin felt softer and looked brighter.  It cleared up my blackheads around my nose within a month.  It took about three months to see my acne begin to really fade away.  I still get breakouts from time to time but they are smaller and less severe than they were before and they clear up quicker.  I use all three products twice a day every single day.  I would recommend at least trying it, but it really take about 6 months to a year to really know whether any product is working for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv for about six years now and it has been working mircales ever since. Other acne treatments never helped me at all but Proactiv has cleared my skin and I hardly ever get spots. It&#x27;s increadible, a life saver! These big bottles are very useful as I don&#x27;t live in the US and thus can&#x27;t buy the product all the time. Ordering Proactiv on their own web site is extremely expensive when you live outside of the US and you can only order very small bottles that run out very quickly. I wish Proactiv was cheapr, it is very expensive. Yet, it works wonders and I wouldn&#x27;t replace it with anything! I love these big bottles that last a while!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit 8 months ago, I&#x27;m sorry, but this does not work at all!  I followed the directions completely...i mean i read everything and didn&#x27;t miss a detail; I followed the instructions EXACTLY how they said to.  I washed my face twice a day and exfoliated and scrubbed as instructed...I am so so disappointed to say that after 4 months of this, I was left with SEVERE ACNE....much, much, much worse than it was when I even started!  I started with moderate (not too bad, actually I guess, \\&quot;average\\&quot; skin) but after Proactiv, it turned so SEVERE...I mean zits on zits all over blemishes.  Honestly, I really really wish I just had the skin that I had BEFORE proactive :(  I really don&#x27;t mean to disappoint potential buyers and acne sufferers, but please, don&#x27;t make my mistake in buying this.  It really damages your skin.  Also, after slamming Proactiv, I should have a solution for you: Id just like to say that I bought \\&quot;university medical acne free sensitive skin and acne kit\\&quot; and my acne cleared in about 1 1/2 months.  ACNE FREE gave me the results that proactiv was supposed to...anyway, this is just my advice...use ACNEFREE: its a third the price of proactive and has AMAZING results!!!!!  Just my opinion...you should not let proactive screw you over.</li>
            <li> Several family members use this and all are very pleased with the product. This is the first time to purchase on line instead of the store. We saved a little money and we love getting it in the mail box versus going to the mall.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is helping my daughters face tremendously</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son has been using Proactive for about a year and we love it. A few things to keep in mind: when he first started using it, his face broke out even worse. I did some reading and found out that this is common. When you first start using it, it will pull all that nasty stuff that&#x27;s been sitting in your pours, up to the surface. It took about two weeks for that to settle down. He also had red spots from old acne that remained for a few months as well, but they eventually faded. You also need to use it exactly as recommended. If my son skips a cleansing, he will start to break out again. And lastly, yes, it&#x27;s going to bleach your towels. I just bought tan, you can&#x27;t tell as much with that color.  It took several months, but his skin looks great now and we will continue to use this. I also bought him the body wash. Summer and football have caused some acne on his shoulders, so the body wash has helped with that.</li>
            <li> I have been getting this product for my grandaughter for some time now and it works for her and this was a great value Thanks</li>
            <li> gave it 5 stars works wonders will recomend it in future to anyone who is need of it. great product!</li>
            <li> Great value, saves me the trouble of reordering every month. Would definitely buy again :)  Most importantly, saw great results after a month or so.  Remember to follow the instructions, twice per day... etc.  I was lazy and did once per day and results weren&#x27;t as evident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered Proactiv from the official website and used it with great success but gotten sketchy service. So I decided to try Amazon, and while the service was much better, I had a totally different experience with the product. I don&#x27;t know what the problem is, but what I received from this seller was not the same thing that I have used in the past. I had an extreme reaction to the product; painful swelling, redness, then sensitivity and peeling-- it was awful. The experience has burned me on Proactiv completely. I&#x27;m just not willing to roll the dice again. When the product works my skin looks beautiful, but when it doesn&#x27;t I can&#x27;t leave the house.</li>
            <li> I AM STILL ON VACATION, AND I WILL SOON GIVE THIS GIFT TO MY GRANDSON, BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, I CHOOSE TO DO THIS RATING. AFTER TRULY TRYING THE PRODUCT, I WILL THEN RECOMMEND IT TO EVERY ONE IN MY COUNTRY.</li>
            <li> amazing product for acnes...don&#x27;t hesitate to use it...turns your skin 100% ...i&#x27;been fighting pimples all my life, finally I ve found the cure</li>
            <li> This product is great.  The price is fair and my daughter loves it.  Came in the mail quickly. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> great product. I can already tell that it&#x27;s working .. my face feels less oily..thanks Pro A&lt;br /&gt;get yours today</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found you must use all the products in order for it to work properly. Sometimes I would try and skip using one or the other products because I would run out of one or more before the other ran out. But all work great together. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Purchased this a week ago and so far its working great. Seeing some progress on my face and my back. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many others were scammed by Proactive having your account number and charging over a couple hundred dollars a month before you even noticed and it was such a hassle to fight them and get your money back if ALL you wanted was the initial $19.99 trial product. I find the product to work great and appreciate not having to get it through Proactive and be taken advantage of. Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> As a 30 year-old woman with annoying breakouts, I thought this product worked GREAT!! My face cleared up within a week with minimal dryness. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to use Amazon to buy this product as the actual Proactive site seems like a complete scam and hassle. I would recommend this product to anyone with minor acne looking to clear their skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this item sent to my son in the Navy .He was so happy for this size.I am glade picked this item .I will recommend this item to my friends as they need.</li>
            <li> If you have a more serious acne problem this will NOT work! Trust me. I am 43 years old and I suffered from Cystic acne, which is the worst kind. They are cyst type acne pimples that do not form a white or black head. If you have this kind you HAVE to see a physician and it will save you a lot of money to do that. No wash, cream or pad is going to get rid of it. If you have a more mild case I am sure this will help and it seems very gentle on the skin. It just didn&#x27;t do a thing for my daughter and I have made her an apt because I fear she has my cystic acne curse.</li>
            <li> Dear all,&lt;br /&gt;i just got my set of Proactiv Solution Micro Crystal 3 piece 120 days Luxury Set and check the components with set that i had before with old formula and they are equal (word to word). Pls explaine to me why new formula are exactly similar to the old one if its need to contain some Micro Crystals? And who did wrong promotion: Proactiv or seller just send me old version istead of new one?&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your kind feedback!&lt;br /&gt;Anna</li>
            <li> I purchased this trio for my daughter and it lasts much longer than the ones she first got in the mail.  I found elsewhere on Amazon a large size of the cleanser only and will probably purchase that next time as my daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to go through steps 2 and 3 as often.  A nice alternative for those with the same issue, as Proactiv is not cheap!</li>
            <li> it clear my son  pimple.</li>
            <li> A wonderful experience.</li>
            <li> Most of the times it&#x27;s a matter of great concern with the cosmetics is the Expiration Date. But with this seller I found this product is not that old. Any product that is new has the late expiration date. Also it&#x27;s fully sealed(brand new). I already ordered another one for gift.</li>
            <li> Well my daughter loves it. She is accustomed  to the product. But your service excellent, excellent and one more time excellent. We are from Aruba. Keep the good work going.The product reach  by our adress before expecting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edgar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for acne products for months for my 12 year old. She developed terrible acne on her forehead and chin and became so self-conscious that it started effecting her self confidence and the kids at school certainly didn&#x27;t help. I bought every over the counter product imaginable and was about to take her to a dermatologist but after watching the commercials and after my friend with flawless skin said she swears by it - I decided to given it a try. I am amazed at how well this product works. My daughter&#x27;s skin is beautiful again and her confidence it back! I didn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d keep up with the 3-step process 2xs a day but she&#x27;s completely motivated by the results. Not only is the Amazon price is wonderful but it&#x27;s better than ordering directly through Proactiv since they charge your credit card every month which I just didn&#x27;t feel comfortable with. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been usng Proactiv for several years now, and I love it! I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when I found out that I would not be able to take my acne medications during a pregnancy. The Proactiv commercials claim that you will see results in 2 weeks. For me it took two months, but it was well worth waiting for!  Over the years, due to the high cost of Proactiv, I&#x27;ve tried using other products on different occasions, such as the cheaper Acne Free Clear Skin System AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion), always with disastrous effect. You know the saying you get what you pay for...exactly! So, now I&#x27;m back with my Proactiv. Its expensive, but well worth it. The cleanser has fine micro-beads that gently stimulate the skin while cleansing, the toner is effective without being harsh. I also love the face cream, which moisturizing without being greasy.  This system leaves my skin feeling, clean, soft, and smooth.  I love it!  I particularly like the 120 day set, as it lasts the longest and is the most economical to buy.</li>
            <li> Love using the product and happy with results and look forward to using the product going forward to have beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I would recommend for ALL ages. I have been using Proactive for years and it has never failed me.</li>
            <li> My 17-year-old daughter likes this.  It doesn&#x27;t prevent breakouts 100%, but it does a pretty good job.  I prefer to buy the product this way as opposed to getting into one of their subscriptions/memberships because I don&#x27;t want to be pressured into buying it more than I need.</li>
            <li> Product as described, quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I am an adult with acne and it does a good job. It does dry out my face a bit but the green tea moisturizer fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t do amazing on hard acne.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using Proactiv on and off for several years now. When I purchase the kits from the company, we end up with items that never get used, like the mask.  Every time I pay the bill for the kit, another kit is sent.  The kits are costly - averaging $100. per kit, and it&#x27;s really not affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing the 3 most used items in a Proactiv kit makes more financial sense to me.  These units are larger than what you receive from Proactive, and obviously last longer.  It&#x27;s a good deal!</li>
            <li> My Favorite Brand. This works as great as the last time i used Proactive a few years ago. I missed using Proactive for my skin care routine. My pores are slowly shrinking and I love the results I get. I paid for express shipping and it came on time. Its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Quick response !!! Awesome product !! I got it for my 12 year old son, who has a bad acne!</li>
            <li> My 13 year old twin sons had begun minor break out.  We had tried other products but, they hadn&#x27;t worked.  After what we had heard about Pro Active, we spent extra to get it.  Initially, there was some relief but, their faces are broken out like before, after regular use!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my teenage daughter.  She swears by it!! It&#x27;s a great product!! Would definately recommend this product to anyone with problems with acne.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my grandson, it has helped him tremendously. We will most certainly order again when he runs out.</li>
            <li> We buy this stuff all the time and it is so much cheaper to get this in bulk with prime.</li>
            <li> The product is fabulous, it clean&#x60;s my face like no other product does, my skin was always a problem but now i don&#x27;t have to worry abut it as proactiv is the love of my life, it saved me&gt;</li>
            <li> pro : yes! this is the new stuff that has micro crystal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con : i received treatment cream that has 1/13 Expiration date, WTF?&lt;br /&gt;  also, the cleanser has 2/13 expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So , if u want the new stuff, and if u are daily user of proactiv, go ahead and purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bif u rarely use it, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The number of days this is supposed to last is laughable. I used the product less often than they reccomended, and while it was effective, the 120 supply only lasted a month. At this price, it I just use the Oxy facewash with a Clairol acne scrub to replace step 1. Oxy pads instead of step 3. Moisturizer if dry skin occurs for step 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product works well, but cost and deception about quantity will prevent me from ordering again.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well I have started seeing solutions in about 3 weeks of use. But the only problem is that it leaves your skin pretty dry and itchy...</li>
            <li> Does not get rid of all blemishes, but definitely works better compared to salicylic &amp; benzoyl over the counter treatments.</li>
            <li> I always buy this exact kit from the same seller and am always extremely satisfied. Everything comes individually shrink wrapped, like it does when you buy from the actual Proactiv company. Works great, always quality product. Will be buying many more times :)</li>
            <li> It is in fact an OKAY product for some people, but there is nothing special about it.  In fact the product is available at any drug store in generic form....and probably much cheaper.  And it did NOT work for us, which is why we are now under a doctor&#x27;s treatment.</li>
            <li> The Proactiv system left my skin clean, but only to oil up again in a couple hours. It did little to clear my acne. My skin is pretty oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the pictured regimen twice. Once as a teenager and once as an adult. Both times I used for them for around 2 months. Until I ran out of product. My face felt clean and smooth right after use. In a few hours though it got pretty oily. I think it over dried my skin because it got a little red and there was some slight peeling. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in my acne though. I had high hopes but it just didn&#x27;t pay off for me.</li>
            <li> This product was priced reasonable.Even better,it was not an old set like so many other sellers are doing.Look out for sellers palming off old crap at high new product prices.</li>
            <li> I had been these bad acnes for more than 14 years. I have been using tons of stuff to get rid of my acnes but nothing was working very much. you mention: soaps, creams, face washes, pills, anything you mention i tried almost once but no result till finally I realised not only once single thing can remove all of your acnes. you have to do a bunch of activities to get rid of these damn acnes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realised there are two things that are very effective in fighting with acnes.&lt;br /&gt;1. Benzonyl proxide: this one fight against acne viruses on your face.&lt;br /&gt;2. Acid Salicilic: this one fight against clogs on your face. clog is a very important reason for creating acnes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in order to get rid of your acnes you have to have sometihng that has both.&lt;br /&gt;proactive only has benzonyl proxide which is no enough by itself.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t talk too much. buy a product called &amp;#34;Exposed&amp;#34; or buy proactive as well as some kind of face wash that has &amp;#34;acid salycilic&amp;#34; on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you do all of these stuff you can&#x27;t get rid of your acnes unless you do below things:&lt;br /&gt;1. change the sheet of your pillow every two days.&lt;br /&gt;2. drink as much water as you can&lt;br /&gt;3. eatch vegetables and fruits&lt;br /&gt;4. do some physical activities like jogging&lt;br /&gt;5. do not touch your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you do all the above things within 3 months I assure you, that you will have the best amazing face ever.&lt;br /&gt;the above things were my expereience during these years fighting with acnes.</li>
            <li> Teen daughter started using it and it seemed to help for a month or two at most.  Her face looked red a lot though.  Now it hasn&#x27;t helped at all so I took her off it and started using organic herbal soap and epsom salt with water to splash on wet clean skin and it hardens.  She leaves it on all night and her skin has never looked better.  No reside of soap with the herbal soap and espom salts draw out toxins.  After 2 weeks of use her skin looks glowing, not red and inflammed!  Very few pimples left, and even at PMS time, no more breakouts.  What a difference.  The cost for the soap and espom salts about $3 per month or less.  Proactiv A LOT more! I cannot imagine what those chemicals do to the body either.  Not so good.</li>
            <li> I suggest you don&#x27;t buy here. It just messed up my face. My pimples just grow larger and my acne become worst. Went to the mall to buy the real proactiv, then it quickly fixes everything. I don&#x27;t where their product is coming and if the contents are real. I also don&#x27;t know if they are FDA approved.</li>
            <li> expensive and there are cheaper alternatives. works great for zits and pimples. use an oil free lotion afterwards. doesn&#x27;t seem to work on my whiteheads as effectively as I want it to. works great on blackheads though.</li>
            <li> I have been a proactiv user for a very long time and it has always worked very well for me.  This is my first time buying it from Amazon and I am noticing some differences.  My skin has always been very clear on proactiv but when I started using this set my skin started breaking out.  I am questioning whether or not this is true proactiv.  The weather has been very humid so that could be the cause for the poor skin but I doubt it since I work in an air conditioned office all day and am rarely outside.</li>
            <li> My husband uses Proactiv on his neck to combat pseudofolliculitis barbae tthat occur because he has to shave daily for work. It&#x27;s stinky but it calms his skin down a lot, making the spots less red and inflamed and also less painful for him. The only other negative is that it exfoliates so well that he always has white flakes on the top of his shirt, but really that just shows it&#x27;s working. Great bargain through amazon getting the larger size without a subscription.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other products over the years, this is the first one that truly works and does a good job.  The commercials I&#x27;ve seen just gave me the impression of any other random ad that you see, that this would be complete BS.  But hey, it does work.  There are 3 components.  1) The face scrub which has some rough particles in there that give you a good/cleaned feeling.  2) The liquid cleaner that you apply to a cotton ball.  I don&#x27;t really use this step too often to be honest.  3)  A \\&quot;renewing treatment\\&quot; that almost applies like a moisturizer, but I think it helps dry out oils and help your complexion.  I use steps 1 and 3 about twice daily.  Step 2 I&#x27;ll use if I am in a hurry and just want to clean my face quickly.  Anyways, this stuff really does work.  I took a shot on it because it was 75$ or so for 120 day supply.  I&#x27;m probably 120 days in and I think half of the stuff is still left.  So, if you were concerned about how long it lasts for the price, you can probably get more than what&#x27;s advertised.  I think, even if it did only last that amount of time though, confidence and a clean face is worth 75-100$ every 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a background, I had some pretty decent breakouts.  I probably fell into the medium breakout range.  They didn&#x27;t happen all the time, but I normally had 3-5 zits that could be extremely annoying.  I mean, I&#x27;ll occasionally get 1 or 2 still (every few weeks), but, this product gets rid of them within a couple days, versus the week or 2 they might linger before.  The first few weeks, I got a little dryness on my face, but really not that much.  I normally use the \\&quot;Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion,\\&quot; daily, which you can get on here, or I usually pick it up at Macy&#x27;s on sale.  This is a very good lotion for your face.  The combo of those 2 products does enough to keep me happy.  Give it a try, it will really start paying off after about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter. She has tried other product but Proactive seems work the best. A large volume set, don&#x27;t need to shop as often.</li>
            <li> Wish it was cheaper, but this has been my go-to fix when ever I have excessive breakouts!</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t have acne anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and at such an awesome price!!  I have 2 kids and this will last them months!</li>
            <li> It is what I expected, them items arrived very quickly and the bottle sizes were what I expected to get.</li>
            <li> The products were just as described, arrived quickly, and were reasonably priced. The bottles arrived sealed and had many months left before the expiration date on the bottom. I am happy. Thank you for a quality product.</li>
            <li> works great. love it. arrived on time and was as expected. Will buy again. Certainly recommend it. Go for it.</li>
            <li> This product was the BEST value I found on the market, before I ordered directly from the company on line first, the size was much smaller and more expensive, then I found this 8 Fl  size, the price was AMAZING for the quantity. I will definitely order here from Amazon in the future.  I wanted next day shipping as I had to travel, it arrived on time! CHOOSE THIS VALUE AND SIZE for the price.</li>
            <li> The best product around! 120 day set is great. Proactiv is great. Works just like they day that it should.</li>
            <li> Product was not as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product works immediately after first use. I don&#x27;t know yet how  long it is going to last because I&#x27;ve just start using it.</li>
            <li> great deal on a great product!</li>
            <li> Proactiv is the only thing that has ever worked for my severe acne. I&#x27;ve tried everything, Clinique, Dermalogica and prescription, as well as everything from the drugstore. Only this helps. My skin still isn&#x27;t perfect, but it&#x27;s way better.&lt;br /&gt;These huge bottles are a good value and were fresh, not expiring anytime soon.</li>
            <li> im very satisfied with my purchase its awesome!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the original!</li>
            <li> It works as explained.  The only thing she does not like about the product is that it can leave the skin feeling really dry.</li>
            <li> I flip flop with my skin care. It&#x27;s great once I put it one for about 4-6 months. But..use this too long, my skin gets use to it. Then, acne flourishes again. So, I back off 1-2 months by using other skin care that does not have benzoyl peroxide in it. Once I get back on it again, it clears up. It&#x27;s a vicious cycle. For me, I must use all the products to make it work. I have really oily, tanned skin. So, finding something similar to this that works is a novelty. It does the job. However, for me, it is not for the long term.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly, it was exactly what it stated it was.  I appreciated the expiration date was not the month I ordered it, but 6 months in the future.</li>
