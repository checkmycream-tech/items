            <li>this floss works awesome.</li>
            <li>The best way to describe it, is it&#x27;s like using a thinner version of a rubber band.</li>

            <li>excellent product.</li>
            <li>The best dental floss ever made.</li>
            <li>Best dental floss on the market!</li>
            <li>If you have closely spaced teeth, I have found this brand to be the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>Ingenious idea created by Reach!!!  </li>
            <li>What I like about it is its \\&quot;Listerine flavor;\\&quot; very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Cleans your teeth beautifully  and doesn&#x27;t slip out of your fingers while  you&#x27;re flossing.</li>
            <li>However, this incovenience was outweighed by the great cleaning job and taste.  </li>
            <li>some this may be a great floss, but for me it&#x27;s a pass.</li>
            <li>When flossing my built-in retainer, the Reach floss does a great job.</li>
            <li>Always great.</li>
            <li>It stretches a bit, so I find it great for every area I need to floss.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to the stretchiness, this is great.</li>
            <li>great product and price.</li>
            <li>THESE ARE GREAT;  I USE THE FLOSS</li>
            <li>Great product and service.  </li>
            <li>Great dental floss for my family and me.  </li>
            <li>Just LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>Nice flavor too!</li>
            <li>The Listerine addition leaves a pleasant taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works well and has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>This works great to get a good and safe cleaning!</li>
            <li>To be honest, it is not that great.</li>
            <li>This leads to superior performance.</li>
            <li>My wife says it does a good job on her teeth.</li>
            <li>The greatest thing is that it seems better at being shred-resistant, thus promoting a more pleasant flossing experience.</li>
            <li>However, the material has a kind of flaky texture, so when I look at it to see how effective it was, I can&#x27;t tell!</li>
            <li>It glides between the teeth with a refreshing taste and leaves your mouth feeling great</li>
            <li>I have had great results with this floss and have not been able to come up with any cons to ofset the pros.</li>
            <li>I love my Reach Floss!  </li>
            <li>I am sure one day it will also be taken off the market, but until it is, I buy in bulk!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this floss!</li>
            <li>, Johnson &amp; Johnson has done Glide one better!</li>
            <li>Very effective floss and leaves my teeth really clean!</li>
            <li>The Listerine flavor is nice</li>
            <li>, however, you can be more maneuverable with floss sticks which surprisingly Reach</li>
            <li>The Reach floss does not, and it feels nice on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also got some kind of Listerine coating so that after you floss your mouth feels fresher.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice for a change.</li>
            <li>: the floss comes in a semi-transparent container that stands upright on its own.</li>
            <li>Reach&#x27;s superior performance makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>She feels this floss is the best because it really cleans the teeth.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m super happy to be able to get it here on Amazom!</li>
            <li>After all the purpose is to get your teeth clean and this does a great job of it.</li>
            <li>The BEST thing I&#x27;ve ever done as far as shopping is concerned!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of force to fit it between them and slides easily while doing a wonderful job getting the space clean.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dental floss, and recommended by my dentist, it&#x27;s kind of like a satin ribbon</li>
            <li>and this is her favorite kind of floss.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy on your mouth, and very effective.</li>
            <li>My husband also liked it because he felt it gripped his tooth better thereby getting a bit more friction to remove plaque.</li>
            <li>: The item is easy to dispense, has a pleasant taste and fits easily between teeth.</li>
            <li>According to their own marketing, it slides like Glide but works better, is shred resistant, and is equipped with \\&quot;microgrooves\\&quot; to remove more plaque.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and orderd and great service.....</li>
            <li>Item as advertised, fair price, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this floss because it doesn&#x27;t shred and doesn&#x27;t seemed to be waxed, so it does a much better job of scraping the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Love the stretchiness of this floss.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This floss is interesting.</li>
            <li>After using this product for a week, I have to say I love it compared to the ancient wax/no wax string.  </li>
            <li>While these claim to remove more plaque</li>
            <li>I am mostly used to it, but I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>I could think of better flavors than Listerine</li>
            <li>allows you to get a better, tighter grip.</li>
            <li>While others may not have to be as picky about their floss, my dental work necessitates better floss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for a while and decided to hold off on writing a review until I&#x27;ve had more of a chance to try out the dental floss.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that the floss doesn&#x27;t gouge my fingers.</li>
            <li>I sure love this.</li>
            <li>So glad to find this brand on Amazon.</li>
            <li>When I saw that this was compared to Glide brand, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; flavor, also, and if you&#x27;ve ever used Listerine you know why -- its flavor can be overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Thus, it covers more surface area and is easier to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im in love with this floss.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this floss and I am so glad she did.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this floss.</li>
            <li>I love this floss.</li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect floss</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to find that Amazon had it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it gets between your teeth, and then springs out.  </li>
            <li>Much better than Oral B and Glide.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different flosses and this is the best one that I have found.  </li>
            <li>I saw it on the bathroom counter and it looked interesting, so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>I was instantly impressed by how much better it felt compared to the Oral B Glide I&#x27;ve used for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another thing I love about it is that it&#x27;ll never shred or break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so they cover the opening of your mouth more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until I discover a better floss, this is going to be it for me.</li>
            <li>But as it turns out, there is a bit more to this stuff.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s more like a ribbon than a</li>
            <li>Reach&#x27;s Total Care is actually very good!  </li>
            <li>Me, I sure don&#x27;t mind having a bit of color on the sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than unflavored I suppose,</li>
            <li>Absolutely top rate dental floss.  </li>
            <li>Buying two is as  much more  as four (I think)</li>
            <li>I love this floss.</li>
            <li>I received some in a gift pack from my dentist, and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>floss is much better to go between the gum and the teeth.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommended this because I have a problem with most flosses ripping.</li>
            <li>Sure, it costs a bit more but for me and my mouth there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>I love this floss...</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, my wife prefers Oral B VS.</li>
            <li>Maybe her flossing technique is better than mine?</li>
            <li>This product works great for people who don&#x27;t have much room between their teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love this floss.  </li>
            <li>Has a great taste and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I like it most because it does not shred.</li>
            <li>Grips better than the slippery wax floss.</li>
            <li>&quot; While it might not be scientific evidence, if twice as many people think it works better, that seems significant in its own way.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is a very unique dental floss.  </li>
            <li>The material is pretty stretchy and feels good on the teeth and on the fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>people mentioned that it will snap like a rubber-band, and that is kind of true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very reasonable in price when you consider that you need a shorter piece and that it does not break or shred.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery and service were excellent - I highly recommend this floss.</li>
            <li>The Listerine flavor is very mild and I would have given it five stars had the flavor been more noticeable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break or snag like so many do and glides easily.  </li>
            <li>It smells and tastes lightly of mint, which was refreshing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice having a fresh flavor from flossing.</li>
            <li>Really does a good job on my teeth.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a stretchy quality to it that helps you really get a good hold on the string.  </li>
            <li>Effective and leave a fresh taste after use.</li>
            <li>It slides between teeth easily, and gets the job done, but the stretchiness and bounce of it is taking some getting used to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, it doesn&#x27;t slip off my fingers and doesn&#x27;t dig into them painfully.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stretches, doesnt break, and glides easily in and out between your teeth and stetches easily around them.</li>
            <li>The micro groves seem to make it clean better.</li>
            <li>floss is nylon with \\&quot;microgrooves\\&quot; and is designed to stretch so it will easily go between teeth.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t, and the stretchiness does make it slide easily between teeth.  </li>
            <li>But it breaks so easily.</li>
            <li>The floss is also quite strong - I use use it for hanging flashlights on my garage pegboard.</li>
            <li>While the Listerine scent is strong before flossing, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve &#x27;tasted&#x27; it at all.  </li>
            <li>Although it is smooth, it cleans my teeth well, and it is easy to grasp.  </li>
            <li>That seemed fine.</li>
            <li>then quickly popped out!</li>
            <li>The kind I like, easy to find here not so much in the store, and the price is better.by a LOT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got to be the elastic-ness of this floss that I love so much!!  </li>
            <li>and I wish it was available through subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>Whatever it is, this floss is comfortable to use and it works.  </li>
            <li>Light Listerine flavor, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Total care is a joy to use.  </li>
            <li>This bran has great elasticity and is pliable enough not to snag.</li>
            <li>But it does a fantastic job of cleaning, even when there are fillings or repairs that can shred fiber type flosses.  </li>
            <li>and so reaches everywhere and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that I have yet to have a piece split open while flossing my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it and gave me a free unit.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I received a sample at my dentist and liked it so much I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, Amazon came through again.</li>
            <li>Cleans more thoroughly, exercises my gums, and leaves a fresh flavor in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I like the flavor, too; feel very fresh after flossing.</li>
            <li>Very handy for back</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I can reach more areas, more comfortably, when using floss picks instead of normal floss.</li>
            <li>Most important is there is a very mild roughness to the material that really scrapes off the plaque.</li>
            <li>Do note that this item contains 30 yards not the 50 yards that are in the original.</li>
            <li>I asked her what kind of floss it was, and she told me it was this new product made by Reach.  </li>
            <li>In short, if I could tell that this floss was effective I would like it a lot more.</li>
            <li>Wow, this dental floss really works great.  </li>
            <li>, it has a surface that seems to really clean all surfaces of my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It&#x27;s an interesting purple shade, which is pretty much an aesthetic thing, but might help you in getting kids to floss more.  </li>
            <li>I found it slipped very well between my teeth and was very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Strong: this is right on par with Glide</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Overall, good floss</li>
            <li>Do any of them really work better than the rest?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did read a negative review of this product, however, this is the BEST floss I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li>that for my situation, I find Reach Total Care to be superior to Oral B&#x27;s Glide.</li>
            <li>The fact that this floss is waxed allows it to glide pretty easily between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than conventional floss,&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more flexible and does a better job.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, it does not break as easily, and has a little more give.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, too.</li>
            <li>but it is mild an inoffensive to one who is not a mint fan.  </li>
            <li>For those of us who floss everyday (and you really should) , this product is GREAT !</li>
            <li>There is a mild mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>The elasticity makes it comfortable to hold and is soooo gentle on the gums (while still getting all the gunk out from in between the teeth!)  </li>
            <li>I encourage others who have experienced frustration with &#x27;normal&#x27; floss to try Reach Total Care and see the difference.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like those too much because they broke easily and quite often.</li>
            <li>Interestingly enough, many reviewers for Oral B&#x27;s Glide say that they don&#x27;t fray easily.</li>
            <li>It is still  available as Listerine Gentle Gum Care Woven Floss, Mint.  </li>
            <li>Listerine Gentle Gum Care Woven Floss, Mint is still available in 50 yards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>It also made my mouth feel really fresh after flossing</li>
            <li>The minty flavor also gives you that fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>The tape will stretch so it is rare that it will break.  </li>
            <li>I check 3 stores online worth buying...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break, doesn&#x27;t shred, tastes fresh and does the job.certain because all floss comes in packages of differing lengths and sizes.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break, doesn&#x27;t shred, tastes fresh and does the job.</li>
            <li>Total Care Floss is much more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>There are so many other flosses that work better for me.</li>
            <li>should: slides easily between teeth, slides along between your gums and teeth, and easily slides (snaps) back out.</li>
            <li>exactly right or keep changing your grip.</li>
            <li>product,at least, makes the whole process 10X more effective and tastes good too!&lt;br /&gt;I got an A+ from the hygeniest at my last cleaning because of this floss</li>
            <li>feels more gentle than normal</li>
            <li>very* easily and doesn&#x27;t shred or break or leave strands, but I just don&#x27;t get the same \\&quot;scrubbed\\</li>
            <li>Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Reach Total Care Dental Fresh Mint Floss is a very fine product.  </li>
            <li>but in any case like SO many things at Amazon it comes to the house, costs less and is just so much more convenient</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is so much better than any other kind of floss that it&#x27;s worth whatever it costs.</li>
            <li>I have tight gaps between my teeth and the Reach Total Care holds up the best without tearing.</li>
            <li>It definitely picks up way more than another popular flat ribbon brand.</li>
            <li>I have been faithfully flossing everyday (even twice a day sometimes) because it is such a great floss!  </li>
            <li>The rough surface is also better at material removal than smooth waxed</li>
            <li>However, if you are not currently flossing at all and are considering starting that routine, I think you will be making a great improvement in your dental health whichever floss product you choose.</li>
            <li>I normally use &#x27;Glide&#x27; floss -- I have multiple dental implants, and have found Glide to be the best at sliding in between the tightly placed crowns &amp; coming back out without catching or fraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was very gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li>This is more a thin rubber band type stretchy tape that perfectly fits in the crevices of dental work (I have multiple fillings/crowns that shred traditional floss) and cleanly removes debris!</li>
            <li>It has a little stretch and seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Total Care floss does a much better job.  </li>
            <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t be what I&#x27;d grab first.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I first used it.</li>
            <li>This may not seem like much at first, but the stretchyness means that you do not have to get the length</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time while staying at my sister&#x27;s house during a visit.</li>
            <li>It also does a better job of cleaning than regular floss in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is very convenient!</li>
            <li>The strings are smooth and do actually pick up more floss than my old brand.  </li>
            <li>Reach Total Care floss is the latest in floss technology.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Reach Total Care makes the claim that it removes 2x more plaque than Glide.  </li>
            <li>it does pretty well.</li>
            <li>&quot; So I&#x27;m admittedly an infrequent user, but I&#x27;ve become much better about flossing regularly since that embarrassing day.</li>
            <li>I really like this floss!  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li>One last point, many people say that Oral B&#x27;s don&#x27;t make them bleed.</li>
            <li>I like it that much!</li>
            <li>I am sure some people have bleeding issues when flossing with certain kinds of floss on a constant basis, but these are outliers.</li>
            <li>Having so many in one package is very helpful to me because I live so far from town and now the stores here have stopped carrying this item.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s by far the best floss I have ever used for my many crowns - almost impossible to break.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is elastic so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt my fingers when wrap around them, and it cleans a lot easier and better thanks to the same elasticity.</li>
            <li>all time favorite floss is by the same company, [[ASIN:B001E96QJK Reach Gentle Gum Care Woven Dental Floss, Fluoride, 50-Yard Dispensers (</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS FLOSS because it makes it much easier to reach my back teeth and get between the others that are close together.  </li>
            <li>I liked the flavor, grip was strong and it didn&#x27;t break between my crowns - especially tough test as most flosses just snap in two like toothpicks!  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using Reach Total Care Floss, I can attest to the fact that it is a nice option if you are looking to keep your teeth clean!  </li>
            <li>flavor is a very light mint, and I&#x27;m a fan of the pink color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Total Care is fine for removing debris that gets stuck between teeth after eating, and I use it for that purpose.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent floss.</li>
            <li>also feel the Reach floss does a better job flossing, it seems to turn up more gunk than the Glide, possibly because it&#x27;s a little</li>
            <li>Really like this dental floss</li>
            <li>This floss seems to clean FAR better than the typical string floss.  </li>
            <li>Coming from the string type floss, which you use as a tow rope if needed, I was not used to just how much \\&quot;give\\&quot; the floss had.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>I use Listerine sometimes, but it&#x27;s for its germ-killing properties thanks to the alcohol content.</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t really feel the effect of the microgrooves.</li>
            <li>Really cleans between the teeth.</li>
            <li>It makes flossing a lot easier and you don&#x27;t need as much floss to do the job.</li>
            <li>Because of the stretch I got the sensation it was getting very close to my tooth as I pulled.  </li>
            <li>While the flavor of Listerine is an added bonus, I really don&#x27;t like how the string has elasticity to it.  </li>
            <li>My whole family loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>It really gets around your teeth and REALLY gets every bit of food out.</li>
            <li>I didnt think there could be much of a difference in dental floss brands, but this made me a believer.</li>
            <li>The flexible tape seems to be absolutely shred-proof, as well.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing, invigorating, gees I bought 6 of them to make sure I never run out, well 6 will last me a few years.</li>
            <li>But this floss is a third type: it&#x27;s the smooth ribbon-like floss that I like, but it&#x27;s got stretch to it - a lot of stretch.</li>
            <li>The problem is that while it works, I feel like I can&#x27;t control it very well, and when it pops out from between your teeth it springs out like a slingshot.</li>
            <li>My dentist turned me on to this stuff and it really works well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really don&#x27;t see any negatives with this product.  </li>
            <li>Total Care does the job, but I don&#x27;t feel as comfortable using it as I do with the string variety.</li>
            <li>The flavor doesn&#x27;t do much, or even taste like much, and it might as well not be flavored.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no way for me to possibly determine if Total Care truly removes up to two times more plaque than Glide, but I think I&#x27;m more of a Glide user and will go back regardless of that fact.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t snap as Much with a capital M, there is a level of elasticity to Reach&#x27;s</li>
            <li>really like this floss.</li>
            <li>several years ago I was taught by a professional dental hygienist on &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; flossing technique - I really love it &amp; will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is pink; very unique.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, bottom line, this floss works better for me than any of the other kinds I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other floss we have tried.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands before and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>The floss does not fray and the  mint taste is not over the top like some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li>However, some of the ribbon flosses (looking at you, Crest) didn&#x27;t seem to remove as much plaque as the older \\&quot;string\\&quot; flosses did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I floss with total care my mouth feels refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>I love this floss; bear in mind, this is not your typical wax-coated thread, however.</li>
            <li>Reach Total Care Floss costs more than standard dental flosses.</li>
            <li>The product works particularly well in between the front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular version is flavored with Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;Historically, floss has evolved from silk, then nylon, to multi-thickness nylon, to resin coated nylon, to Gore-Tex (Glide).  </li>
            <li>&quot; feeling that I get with the older Dentotape product.</li>
            <li>I don’t particularly care for it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this floss over all others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting consistently high marks from my dentist when I visit.</li>
            <li>and I like it more than any other floss I&#x27;ve used as far as the amount needed to floss, the freshness in your mouth afterward, and the strength of the floss (the fact that it doesn&#x27;t break or get caught in your teeth).</li>
            <li>Maybe she doesn&#x27;t have as many tight spaces between her teeth ( although her teeth seems normal).</li>
            <li>with just the essence of mint instead of the candy-like sweetness, but because my hands became a sticky mess using them,  This floss is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>took to the ribbon type flosses quickly because they were generally easier to get between all my teeth, even those with barely any gap between them.  </li>
            <li>I bought so much of it because I am giving it away as Christmas gifts (along with several of my other favorite things).</li>
            <li>I also feel that the Reach Total Care gets your teeth and gums way cleaner than any other floss, plus it is more gentle.  </li>
            <li>The floss right of the container and the floss from between my teeth look the same to me.</li>
            <li>However, this is not strong or overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li>This one is on the higher end of the scale, but in big dental health picture a small investment that could yield big returns.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  a good product.  </li>
            <li>This one is on the higher end of the scale, but in big dental health picture a small investment that could yield big returns.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  a good product.  </li>
            <li>I have very tight fitting teeth and</li>
            <li>It seems a bit expensive but it really does a good job.</li>
            <li>I like the flavor, too, slightly minty but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I love the way it gets rid of plaque--the long thin fibers help clean well and feels better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is pretty tough as well, so it rarely breaks and if it does, the break is clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a traditional floss but a flexible floss tape, which makes it very easy to slide into tight spaces between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Slips easily between even tight teeth.</li>
            <li>I have tight teeth, and it slides between them easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how efficient it is (could they fit more floss if they made it slightly rounder?)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a pleasant touch of flavor, less than the usual mint flavors used in floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really looking for this Total Care floss to not follow in my old brands footsteps.  </li>
            <li>for several years, it&#x27;s served me well, but trying the Reach floss makes me realize how much nicer floss can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The container stands up by itself on the counter, and the transparent plastic means you can see just how much you have left.</li>
            <li>Reach has developed dental floss from a piece of waxed string to a state of the art dental ribbon.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old</li>
            <li>Really wanted the product but couldn&#x27;t find in stores locally.</li>
            <li>but sort of irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:  does it actually remove twice as much plaque as Glide?  </li>
            <li>So far, no quantitative evidence supports this claim which could work two ways with consumers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with this floss that for a waxed floss</li>
            <li>You see, my teeth are so close together that I would frequently have floss rip and get stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li>More expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s thicker stretchy material also means that it cleans more thoroughly when the gap between the teeth are bigger, yet because it is stretchy, it can still go into narrow gaps without any problem.</li>
            <li>I stopped in a grocery store and the only one they had was Reach Total Care Floss (fresh mint flavor).</li>
            <li>Reach Total Care looks like a thin strip, like Glide (rather than looking like thread), and works just as good as Glide.</li>
            <li>It may be more expensive than regular threaded floss, but I feel that it&#x27;s totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>If you tried to use it exactly like any other normal floss, it will snap out from the gap between your teeth like a rubber-band, and food debris will shoot out onto your bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a flat tape than a round string, so it is gentler on the gums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of REACH floss but not this particular one.  </li>
            <li>This is similar to \\&quot;glide\\&quot; products but has a less smooth texture.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve had several instances where my strand broke as I was getting to the molars and had to get a new piece.</li>
            <li>I much prefer it over regular floss or the white tape.</li>
            <li>Maybe manufactured slightly less thick or flexible, but I need to use a few more times to be sure.</li>
            <li>and it is becoming hard to find locally</li>
            <li>Twice, while using the floss, the floss broke despite the apparent elasticity.  </li>
            <li>Probably will end up going to back to my old dental floss.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break and the floss&#x27;s ribs apparently catch all the plaque; my dental hygienist raves about the condition of my teeth.</li>
            <li>The floss is tasty and slips easily between the teeth but is thick enough to loosen particles wedged in the gums.  </li>
            <li>but it may take a number of uses to get accustomed to the texture because it&#x27;s pretty different from other kinds of dental floss.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel and look of the floss - it is some sort of thin rubbery material in pink.</li>
            <li>Its a little disconcerting at first because it seems as if it will snap.  </li>
            <li>sister had less positive remarks about the floss:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I</li>
            <li>new Reach Total Care floss is similar to Glide, but I actually believe it to be a bit better, at least for people like me who have implants or other artifial dental/tooth</li>
            <li>Has been replaced by Listerine floss, apparently the same thing.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it tends to break when stretched too far.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I would go as far as to say that this is the floss I am going to stick with for a long time to come!</li>
            <li>So choosing a floss really boils down to personal preference.  </li>
            <li>Wow, wide enough, thin enough, strong enough, lasts enough, it stretches making it navigate enough.</li>

            <li> The best dental floss ever made.</li>
            <li> Best dental floss on the market!</li>
            <li> If you have closely spaced teeth, I have found this brand to be the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> Ingenious idea created by Reach!!!  </li>
            <li> What I like about it is its \\&quot;Listerine flavor;\\&quot; very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Cleans your teeth beautifully  and doesn&#x27;t slip out of your fingers while  you&#x27;re flossing.</li>
            <li> However, this incovenience was outweighed by the great cleaning job and taste.  </li>
            <li> some this may be a great floss, but for me it&#x27;s a pass.</li>
            <li> When flossing my built-in retainer, the Reach floss does a great job.</li>
            <li> Always great.</li>
            <li> It stretches a bit, so I find it great for every area I need to floss.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the stretchiness, this is great.</li>
            <li> great product and price.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GREAT;  I USE THE FLOSS</li>
            <li> Great product and service.  </li>
            <li> Great dental floss for my family and me.  </li>
            <li> Just LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Nice flavor too!</li>
            <li> The Listerine addition leaves a pleasant taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works well and has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> This works great to get a good and safe cleaning!</li>
            <li> To be honest, it is not that great.</li>
            <li> This leads to superior performance.</li>
            <li> My wife says it does a good job on her teeth.</li>
            <li> The greatest thing is that it seems better at being shred-resistant, thus promoting a more pleasant flossing experience.</li>
            <li> However, the material has a kind of flaky texture, so when I look at it to see how effective it was, I can&#x27;t tell!</li>
            <li> It glides between the teeth with a refreshing taste and leaves your mouth feeling great</li>
            <li> I have had great results with this floss and have not been able to come up with any cons to ofset the pros.</li>
            <li> I love my Reach Floss!  </li>
            <li> I am sure one day it will also be taken off the market, but until it is, I buy in bulk!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this floss!</li>
            <li> , Johnson &amp; Johnson has done Glide one better!</li>
            <li> Very effective floss and leaves my teeth really clean!</li>
            <li> The Listerine flavor is nice</li>
            <li> , however, you can be more maneuverable with floss sticks which surprisingly Reach</li>
            <li> The Reach floss does not, and it feels nice on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also got some kind of Listerine coating so that after you floss your mouth feels fresher.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice for a change.</li>
            <li> : the floss comes in a semi-transparent container that stands upright on its own.</li>
            <li> Reach&#x27;s superior performance makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> She feels this floss is the best because it really cleans the teeth.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m super happy to be able to get it here on Amazom!</li>
            <li> After all the purpose is to get your teeth clean and this does a great job of it.</li>
            <li> The BEST thing I&#x27;ve ever done as far as shopping is concerned!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of force to fit it between them and slides easily while doing a wonderful job getting the space clean.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dental floss, and recommended by my dentist, it&#x27;s kind of like a satin ribbon</li>
            <li> and this is her favorite kind of floss.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy on your mouth, and very effective.</li>
            <li> My husband also liked it because he felt it gripped his tooth better thereby getting a bit more friction to remove plaque.</li>
            <li> : The item is easy to dispense, has a pleasant taste and fits easily between teeth.</li>
            <li> According to their own marketing, it slides like Glide but works better, is shred resistant, and is equipped with \\&quot;microgrooves\\&quot; to remove more plaque.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and orderd and great service.....</li>
            <li> Item as advertised, fair price, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this floss because it doesn&#x27;t shred and doesn&#x27;t seemed to be waxed, so it does a much better job of scraping the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Love the stretchiness of this floss.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This floss is interesting.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a week, I have to say I love it compared to the ancient wax/no wax string.  </li>
            <li> While these claim to remove more plaque</li>
            <li> I am mostly used to it, but I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> I could think of better flavors than Listerine</li>
            <li> allows you to get a better, tighter grip.</li>
            <li> While others may not have to be as picky about their floss, my dental work necessitates better floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while and decided to hold off on writing a review until I&#x27;ve had more of a chance to try out the dental floss.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that the floss doesn&#x27;t gouge my fingers.</li>
            <li> I sure love this.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this brand on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I saw that this was compared to Glide brand, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; flavor, also, and if you&#x27;ve ever used Listerine you know why -- its flavor can be overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Thus, it covers more surface area and is easier to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im in love with this floss.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this floss and I am so glad she did.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this floss.</li>
            <li> I love this floss.</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect floss</li>
            <li> so I was pleased to find that Amazon had it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it gets between your teeth, and then springs out.  </li>
            <li> Much better than Oral B and Glide.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different flosses and this is the best one that I have found.  </li>
            <li> I saw it on the bathroom counter and it looked interesting, so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> I was instantly impressed by how much better it felt compared to the Oral B Glide I&#x27;ve used for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing I love about it is that it&#x27;ll never shred or break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so they cover the opening of your mouth more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until I discover a better floss, this is going to be it for me.</li>
            <li> But as it turns out, there is a bit more to this stuff.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s more like a ribbon than a</li>
            <li> Reach&#x27;s Total Care is actually very good!  </li>
            <li> Me, I sure don&#x27;t mind having a bit of color on the sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than unflavored I suppose,</li>
            <li> Absolutely top rate dental floss.  </li>
            <li> Buying two is as  much more  as four (I think)</li>
            <li> I love this floss.</li>
            <li> I received some in a gift pack from my dentist, and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> floss is much better to go between the gum and the teeth.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this because I have a problem with most flosses ripping.</li>
            <li> Sure, it costs a bit more but for me and my mouth there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> I love this floss...</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, my wife prefers Oral B VS.</li>
            <li> Maybe her flossing technique is better than mine?</li>
            <li> This product works great for people who don&#x27;t have much room between their teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love this floss.  </li>
            <li> Has a great taste and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I like it most because it does not shred.</li>
            <li> Grips better than the slippery wax floss.</li>
            <li> &quot; While it might not be scientific evidence, if twice as many people think it works better, that seems significant in its own way.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is a very unique dental floss.  </li>
            <li> The material is pretty stretchy and feels good on the teeth and on the fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> people mentioned that it will snap like a rubber-band, and that is kind of true.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very reasonable in price when you consider that you need a shorter piece and that it does not break or shred.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery and service were excellent - I highly recommend this floss.</li>
            <li> The Listerine flavor is very mild and I would have given it five stars had the flavor been more noticeable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break or snag like so many do and glides easily.  </li>
            <li> It smells and tastes lightly of mint, which was refreshing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice having a fresh flavor from flossing.</li>
            <li> Really does a good job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a stretchy quality to it that helps you really get a good hold on the string.  </li>
            <li> Effective and leave a fresh taste after use.</li>
            <li> It slides between teeth easily, and gets the job done, but the stretchiness and bounce of it is taking some getting used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold, it doesn&#x27;t slip off my fingers and doesn&#x27;t dig into them painfully.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stretches, doesnt break, and glides easily in and out between your teeth and stetches easily around them.</li>
            <li> The micro groves seem to make it clean better.</li>
            <li> floss is nylon with \\&quot;microgrooves\\&quot; and is designed to stretch so it will easily go between teeth.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t, and the stretchiness does make it slide easily between teeth.  </li>
            <li> But it breaks so easily.</li>
            <li> The floss is also quite strong - I use use it for hanging flashlights on my garage pegboard.</li>
            <li> While the Listerine scent is strong before flossing, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve &#x27;tasted&#x27; it at all.  </li>
            <li> Although it is smooth, it cleans my teeth well, and it is easy to grasp.  </li>
            <li> That seemed fine.</li>
            <li> then quickly popped out!</li>
            <li> The kind I like, easy to find here not so much in the store, and the price is better.by a LOT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got to be the elastic-ness of this floss that I love so much!!  </li>
            <li> and I wish it was available through subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Whatever it is, this floss is comfortable to use and it works.  </li>
            <li> Light Listerine flavor, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Total care is a joy to use.  </li>
            <li> This bran has great elasticity and is pliable enough not to snag.</li>
            <li> But it does a fantastic job of cleaning, even when there are fillings or repairs that can shred fiber type flosses.  </li>
            <li> and so reaches everywhere and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that I have yet to have a piece split open while flossing my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it and gave me a free unit.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I received a sample at my dentist and liked it so much I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, Amazon came through again.</li>
            <li> Cleans more thoroughly, exercises my gums, and leaves a fresh flavor in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I like the flavor, too; feel very fresh after flossing.</li>
            <li> Very handy for back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I can reach more areas, more comfortably, when using floss picks instead of normal floss.</li>
            <li> Most important is there is a very mild roughness to the material that really scrapes off the plaque.</li>
            <li> Do note that this item contains 30 yards not the 50 yards that are in the original.</li>
            <li> I asked her what kind of floss it was, and she told me it was this new product made by Reach.  </li>
            <li> In short, if I could tell that this floss was effective I would like it a lot more.</li>
            <li> Wow, this dental floss really works great.  </li>
            <li> , it has a surface that seems to really clean all surfaces of my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It&#x27;s an interesting purple shade, which is pretty much an aesthetic thing, but might help you in getting kids to floss more.  </li>
            <li> I found it slipped very well between my teeth and was very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Strong: this is right on par with Glide</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Overall, good floss</li>
            <li> Do any of them really work better than the rest?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did read a negative review of this product, however, this is the BEST floss I&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li> that for my situation, I find Reach Total Care to be superior to Oral B&#x27;s Glide.</li>
            <li> The fact that this floss is waxed allows it to glide pretty easily between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better than conventional floss,&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more flexible and does a better job.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, it does not break as easily, and has a little more give.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, too.</li>
            <li> but it is mild an inoffensive to one who is not a mint fan.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who floss everyday (and you really should) , this product is GREAT !</li>
            <li> There is a mild mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> The elasticity makes it comfortable to hold and is soooo gentle on the gums (while still getting all the gunk out from in between the teeth!)  </li>
            <li> I encourage others who have experienced frustration with &#x27;normal&#x27; floss to try Reach Total Care and see the difference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like those too much because they broke easily and quite often.</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, many reviewers for Oral B&#x27;s Glide say that they don&#x27;t fray easily.</li>
            <li> It is still  available as Listerine Gentle Gum Care Woven Floss, Mint.  </li>
            <li> Listerine Gentle Gum Care Woven Floss, Mint is still available in 50 yards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It also made my mouth feel really fresh after flossing</li>
            <li> The minty flavor also gives you that fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> The tape will stretch so it is rare that it will break.  </li>
            <li> I check 3 stores online worth buying...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break, doesn&#x27;t shred, tastes fresh and does the job.certain because all floss comes in packages of differing lengths and sizes.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break, doesn&#x27;t shred, tastes fresh and does the job.</li>
            <li> Total Care Floss is much more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> There are so many other flosses that work better for me.</li>
            <li> should: slides easily between teeth, slides along between your gums and teeth, and easily slides (snaps) back out.</li>
            <li> exactly right or keep changing your grip.</li>
            <li> product,at least, makes the whole process 10X more effective and tastes good too!&lt;br /&gt;I got an A+ from the hygeniest at my last cleaning because of this floss</li>
            <li> feels more gentle than normal</li>
            <li> very* easily and doesn&#x27;t shred or break or leave strands, but I just don&#x27;t get the same \\&quot;scrubbed\\</li>
            <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Reach Total Care Dental Fresh Mint Floss is a very fine product.  </li>
            <li> but in any case like SO many things at Amazon it comes to the house, costs less and is just so much more convenient</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is so much better than any other kind of floss that it&#x27;s worth whatever it costs.</li>
            <li> I have tight gaps between my teeth and the Reach Total Care holds up the best without tearing.</li>
            <li> It definitely picks up way more than another popular flat ribbon brand.</li>
            <li> I have been faithfully flossing everyday (even twice a day sometimes) because it is such a great floss!  </li>
            <li> The rough surface is also better at material removal than smooth waxed</li>
            <li> However, if you are not currently flossing at all and are considering starting that routine, I think you will be making a great improvement in your dental health whichever floss product you choose.</li>
            <li> I normally use &#x27;Glide&#x27; floss -- I have multiple dental implants, and have found Glide to be the best at sliding in between the tightly placed crowns &amp; coming back out without catching or fraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was very gentle on the gums.  </li>
            <li> This is more a thin rubber band type stretchy tape that perfectly fits in the crevices of dental work (I have multiple fillings/crowns that shred traditional floss) and cleanly removes debris!</li>
            <li> It has a little stretch and seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Total Care floss does a much better job.  </li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t be what I&#x27;d grab first.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I first used it.</li>
            <li> This may not seem like much at first, but the stretchyness means that you do not have to get the length</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time while staying at my sister&#x27;s house during a visit.</li>
            <li> It also does a better job of cleaning than regular floss in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is very convenient!</li>
            <li> The strings are smooth and do actually pick up more floss than my old brand.  </li>
            <li> Reach Total Care floss is the latest in floss technology.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Reach Total Care makes the claim that it removes 2x more plaque than Glide.  </li>
            <li> it does pretty well.</li>
            <li> &quot; So I&#x27;m admittedly an infrequent user, but I&#x27;ve become much better about flossing regularly since that embarrassing day.</li>
            <li> I really like this floss!  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li> One last point, many people say that Oral B&#x27;s don&#x27;t make them bleed.</li>
            <li> I like it that much!</li>
            <li> I am sure some people have bleeding issues when flossing with certain kinds of floss on a constant basis, but these are outliers.</li>
            <li> Having so many in one package is very helpful to me because I live so far from town and now the stores here have stopped carrying this item.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s by far the best floss I have ever used for my many crowns - almost impossible to break.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is elastic so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt my fingers when wrap around them, and it cleans a lot easier and better thanks to the same elasticity.</li>
            <li> all time favorite floss is by the same company, [[ASIN:B001E96QJK Reach Gentle Gum Care Woven Dental Floss, Fluoride, 50-Yard Dispensers (</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FLOSS because it makes it much easier to reach my back teeth and get between the others that are close together.  </li>
            <li> I liked the flavor, grip was strong and it didn&#x27;t break between my crowns - especially tough test as most flosses just snap in two like toothpicks!  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using Reach Total Care Floss, I can attest to the fact that it is a nice option if you are looking to keep your teeth clean!  </li>
            <li> flavor is a very light mint, and I&#x27;m a fan of the pink color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Total Care is fine for removing debris that gets stuck between teeth after eating, and I use it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent floss.</li>
            <li> also feel the Reach floss does a better job flossing, it seems to turn up more gunk than the Glide, possibly because it&#x27;s a little</li>
            <li> Really like this dental floss</li>
            <li> This floss seems to clean FAR better than the typical string floss.  </li>
            <li> Coming from the string type floss, which you use as a tow rope if needed, I was not used to just how much \\&quot;give\\&quot; the floss had.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> I use Listerine sometimes, but it&#x27;s for its germ-killing properties thanks to the alcohol content.</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t really feel the effect of the microgrooves.</li>
            <li> Really cleans between the teeth.</li>
            <li> It makes flossing a lot easier and you don&#x27;t need as much floss to do the job.</li>
            <li> Because of the stretch I got the sensation it was getting very close to my tooth as I pulled.  </li>
            <li> While the flavor of Listerine is an added bonus, I really don&#x27;t like how the string has elasticity to it.  </li>
            <li> My whole family loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> It really gets around your teeth and REALLY gets every bit of food out.</li>
            <li> I didnt think there could be much of a difference in dental floss brands, but this made me a believer.</li>
            <li> The flexible tape seems to be absolutely shred-proof, as well.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing, invigorating, gees I bought 6 of them to make sure I never run out, well 6 will last me a few years.</li>
            <li> But this floss is a third type: it&#x27;s the smooth ribbon-like floss that I like, but it&#x27;s got stretch to it - a lot of stretch.</li>
            <li> The problem is that while it works, I feel like I can&#x27;t control it very well, and when it pops out from between your teeth it springs out like a slingshot.</li>
            <li> My dentist turned me on to this stuff and it really works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really don&#x27;t see any negatives with this product.  </li>
            <li> Total Care does the job, but I don&#x27;t feel as comfortable using it as I do with the string variety.</li>
            <li> The flavor doesn&#x27;t do much, or even taste like much, and it might as well not be flavored.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no way for me to possibly determine if Total Care truly removes up to two times more plaque than Glide, but I think I&#x27;m more of a Glide user and will go back regardless of that fact.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t snap as Much with a capital M, there is a level of elasticity to Reach&#x27;s</li>
            <li> really like this floss.</li>
            <li> several years ago I was taught by a professional dental hygienist on &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; flossing technique - I really love it &amp; will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is pink; very unique.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, bottom line, this floss works better for me than any of the other kinds I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any other floss we have tried.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands before and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> The floss does not fray and the  mint taste is not over the top like some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> However, some of the ribbon flosses (looking at you, Crest) didn&#x27;t seem to remove as much plaque as the older \\&quot;string\\&quot; flosses did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I floss with total care my mouth feels refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this floss; bear in mind, this is not your typical wax-coated thread, however.</li>
            <li> Reach Total Care Floss costs more than standard dental flosses.</li>
            <li> The product works particularly well in between the front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular version is flavored with Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;Historically, floss has evolved from silk, then nylon, to multi-thickness nylon, to resin coated nylon, to Gore-Tex (Glide).  </li>
            <li> &quot; feeling that I get with the older Dentotape product.</li>
            <li> I don’t particularly care for it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this floss over all others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting consistently high marks from my dentist when I visit.</li>
            <li> and I like it more than any other floss I&#x27;ve used as far as the amount needed to floss, the freshness in your mouth afterward, and the strength of the floss (the fact that it doesn&#x27;t break or get caught in your teeth).</li>
            <li> Maybe she doesn&#x27;t have as many tight spaces between her teeth ( although her teeth seems normal).</li>
            <li> with just the essence of mint instead of the candy-like sweetness, but because my hands became a sticky mess using them,  This floss is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> took to the ribbon type flosses quickly because they were generally easier to get between all my teeth, even those with barely any gap between them.  </li>
            <li> I bought so much of it because I am giving it away as Christmas gifts (along with several of my other favorite things).</li>
            <li> I also feel that the Reach Total Care gets your teeth and gums way cleaner than any other floss, plus it is more gentle.  </li>
            <li> The floss right of the container and the floss from between my teeth look the same to me.</li>
            <li> However, this is not strong or overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li> This one is on the higher end of the scale, but in big dental health picture a small investment that could yield big returns.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  a good product.  </li>
            <li> This one is on the higher end of the scale, but in big dental health picture a small investment that could yield big returns.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  a good product.  </li>
            <li> I have very tight fitting teeth and</li>
            <li> It seems a bit expensive but it really does a good job.</li>
            <li> I like the flavor, too, slightly minty but not too strong.</li>
            <li> I love the way it gets rid of plaque--the long thin fibers help clean well and feels better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is pretty tough as well, so it rarely breaks and if it does, the break is clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a traditional floss but a flexible floss tape, which makes it very easy to slide into tight spaces between teeth.  </li>
            <li> Slips easily between even tight teeth.</li>
            <li> I have tight teeth, and it slides between them easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how efficient it is (could they fit more floss if they made it slightly rounder?)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a pleasant touch of flavor, less than the usual mint flavors used in floss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really looking for this Total Care floss to not follow in my old brands footsteps.  </li>
            <li> for several years, it&#x27;s served me well, but trying the Reach floss makes me realize how much nicer floss can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The container stands up by itself on the counter, and the transparent plastic means you can see just how much you have left.</li>
            <li> Reach has developed dental floss from a piece of waxed string to a state of the art dental ribbon.</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old</li>
            <li> Really wanted the product but couldn&#x27;t find in stores locally.</li>
            <li> but sort of irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:  does it actually remove twice as much plaque as Glide?  </li>
            <li> So far, no quantitative evidence supports this claim which could work two ways with consumers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with this floss that for a waxed floss</li>
            <li> You see, my teeth are so close together that I would frequently have floss rip and get stuck between my teeth.</li>
            <li> More expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s thicker stretchy material also means that it cleans more thoroughly when the gap between the teeth are bigger, yet because it is stretchy, it can still go into narrow gaps without any problem.</li>
            <li> I stopped in a grocery store and the only one they had was Reach Total Care Floss (fresh mint flavor).</li>
            <li> Reach Total Care looks like a thin strip, like Glide (rather than looking like thread), and works just as good as Glide.</li>
            <li> It may be more expensive than regular threaded floss, but I feel that it&#x27;s totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> If you tried to use it exactly like any other normal floss, it will snap out from the gap between your teeth like a rubber-band, and food debris will shoot out onto your bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a flat tape than a round string, so it is gentler on the gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of REACH floss but not this particular one.  </li>
            <li> This is similar to \\&quot;glide\\&quot; products but has a less smooth texture.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve had several instances where my strand broke as I was getting to the molars and had to get a new piece.</li>
            <li> I much prefer it over regular floss or the white tape.</li>
            <li> Maybe manufactured slightly less thick or flexible, but I need to use a few more times to be sure.</li>
            <li> and it is becoming hard to find locally</li>
            <li> Twice, while using the floss, the floss broke despite the apparent elasticity.  </li>
            <li> Probably will end up going to back to my old dental floss.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break and the floss&#x27;s ribs apparently catch all the plaque; my dental hygienist raves about the condition of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The floss is tasty and slips easily between the teeth but is thick enough to loosen particles wedged in the gums.  </li>
            <li> but it may take a number of uses to get accustomed to the texture because it&#x27;s pretty different from other kinds of dental floss.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel and look of the floss - it is some sort of thin rubbery material in pink.</li>
            <li> Its a little disconcerting at first because it seems as if it will snap.  </li>
            <li> sister had less positive remarks about the floss:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I</li>
            <li> new Reach Total Care floss is similar to Glide, but I actually believe it to be a bit better, at least for people like me who have implants or other artifial dental/tooth</li>
            <li> Has been replaced by Listerine floss, apparently the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it tends to break when stretched too far.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I would go as far as to say that this is the floss I am going to stick with for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> So choosing a floss really boils down to personal preference.  </li>
            <li> Wow, wide enough, thin enough, strong enough, lasts enough, it stretches making it navigate enough.</li>
            <li> Some context; Previous to using Reach Total Care floss, I was using Oral B&#x27;s Glide which are highly rated.</li>
            <li> Like all floss, it is hard to grip and use, but, trying to not to hold that against it,I really do not see anything very special about this floss at all, besides that it is pink.  </li>
            <li> stretchy rubber floss of Reach Total Care does not cut into my fingers nearly as much like other floss, and that alone is enough for me to pick it over other floss.</li>
            <li> At home, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to test whether this floss actually removes twice as much plaque -</li>
            <li> Here are a few highlights of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My old floss had a major flaw--</li>
            <li> hate the old stuff, I love the new stuff.  </li>
            <li> With very tight contacts between my teeth, I found this floss to work very well.  </li>
            <li> Now I have enough to last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> She says that she now flosses daily, as it makes a previously difficult task easy.  </li>
            <li> I logged on to find the dental floss had jumped drastically in price when I looked for my usual Reach gentle woven dental floss.</li>
            <li> It is a flat ribbon of floss with ridges on it</li>
            <li> Reach Floss is different from other flosses in several key characteristics.</li>
            <li> That can be a positive or negative depending on if you like Listerine or not.</li>
            <li> I have very tight teeth and therefore normal flosses are constantyl breaking or getting stuck.</li>
            <li> This particular floss is hard to find locally</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive though; I got it from Amazon fulfilling for about $17 and I have prime 2-day free shipping.</li>
            <li> (I can actually feel the floss drag against the surface of my teeth, which I don&#x27;t feel with the Crest \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; floss.)  </li>
            <li> The strange thing is the quantity.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t have wide enough gaps to use these?</li>
            <li> This is definitely different than any other type of floss I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have one rough spot that nearly always snags and usually shreds dental floss, but I&#x27;ve had none of that problem with the Reach Total Care</li>
            <li> About 30 years ago, I asked my dentist what I could do, in addition to brushing and regular check-ups, to preserve my teeth and reduce the number of cavities and other dental woes he would find every time I visited him.</li>
            <li> too bad J&amp;J aren&#x27;t distributing this anymore because it&#x27;s much better than the regular Reach product.</li>
            <li> You also need to have completely dry fingers when using the product or it will slip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find where I live, thus my online order.</li>
            <li> But, this one is my second choice, hands down over everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I think it boils down to a matter of preference since everyone&#x27;s set of teeth are so different.</li>
            <li> There is still much less friction compared to a traditional floss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like waxed flosses because they don&#x27;t seem to pick up as much stuff, and especially not as much as the non-waxed woven</li>
            <li> I have used this floss for years but can no longer find it at local stores (perhaps the ADA has black listed it because it takes away their work).</li>
            <li> Reach Total Care is durable, but does not get caught in between tight teeth.</li>
            <li> &quot; When I answered with the first lame excuse for not complying that I could think of, \\&quot;Oh, who has the time for that,\\&quot; his response shocked me into becoming an instant floss-believer.</li>
            <li> After she was done cleaning my teeth, she gave me my little bag of goodies and put an extra thing of that floss in there for me!  </li>
            <li> Being one who flosses daily, I was a little put off by the floss itself.</li>
            <li> It would sting a little bit when it hit my upper or lower lip.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfactory; I had been unable to find it in local stores after my dental hygienist recommended it.</li>
            <li> The pink color is just a novelty</li>
            <li> surface is rough, i.e. the microgrooves, also making it easier to hold.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not much you can say about floss, is there?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt them to be &#x27;rough&#x27; on my teeth or get stuck, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My floss of choice has always been J&amp;J Reach Dentotape ([[ASIN:B003XDVERE Reach,  Reach Dentotape, Designed for wide spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> but it will shred if you have any rough spots.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting to my back teeth and between some of my others.  </li>
            <li> have this in my medicine cabinet next to my \\&quot;old\\&quot; Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach plain waxed floss, but I find myself reaching for this one every time.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are REALLY close together, and sometimes certain flosses are hard to get in between my teeth without jamming it in and then cutting my gums.  </li>
            <li> I find Glide to be too slick; not only does it not seem to clean my teeth effectively, it&#x27;s awkward to work with because it&#x27;s slippery to hold onto</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the breakage problem that I have sometimes with other floss.  </li>
            <li> as I was not able to find it in regular box stores.</li>
            <li> We first received it as a sample, but have been unable to find it despite looking in a number of stores.  </li>
            <li> other band floss, doesn&#x27;t scrunch and lose its flatness if you tug on it.</li>
            <li> It is thin and stretchy, so it can really get in those tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> None of this is difficult--I can still floss at roughly the same speed as with normal floss, and the change in how I hold the floss and shape my mouth and how I move my hands are not more difficult--</li>
            <li> suppose some people won&#x27;t mind this odd lack of control and weird springy action, and it actually works at flossing, so I&#x27;ll give it two stars.</li>
            <li> I have a few very tight teeth and regular dental floss</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Hard to find &amp;#34;Reach total care floss&amp;#34</li>
            <li> AT LEAST ONCE DAILY.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s not much to get excited or disappointed about when it comes to floss.</li>
            <li> He recommended to floss at night, when blood circulation slows down and you&#x27;ll cause less bleeding during flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly elastic</li>
            <li> That being said, I typically floss after brushing my teeth, so my mouth still has a toothpaste like taste!&lt;br</li>
            <li> teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The flavoring is typical dental floss flavoring with a hint of Listerine.  </li>
            <li> or it could induce the thought process that flossing can be done half as often.  </li>
            <li> And I like the slightly flavored Listerine taste.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found another floss that shreds and breaks less.  </li>
            <li> It gets the hard to reach areas and removes material in one attempt that would require sever tries with other flosses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars except that it just feels weird to floss with something so rubbery when you&#x27;re used to normal floss.</li>
            <li> Some compalin that this floss will pepper your mirror with mess.  </li>
            <li> If you have tight spaces between your teeth, you might like this</li>
            <li> It flexes to get between the tight teeth and holds together without shearing.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m the only one who doesn&#x27;t really like this floss, but it is very thin and it is almost like using a thin rubber band to floss with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a rubber feel that is really nice on the gums -- however, this creates a horrible twang against the teeth that makes it uncomfortable to use normally.</li>
            <li> While it took me a little while to get used to the \\&quot;rubber-like\\&quot; texture, this floss works well.</li>
            <li> Recommend it, even if a little pricier.</li>
            <li> You can get between every tooth without pain or digging no matter how little space there is.  </li>
            <li> it would peel away and sometimes leave little bits of itself in-between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This is a little \\&quot;plastic-y\\&quot; and it could be gentler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always dreaded flossing and often did not even go to the trouble.  </li>
            <li> Stretchy: this floss is very slightly stretchy...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, a slingshot is exactly what you DON&#x27;T want behind a piece of food that may have been stuck between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was afraid it would snap at some point, but it&#x27;s surprisingly tough.</li>
            <li> However, unlike other reviewers, I found the strength of the floss to be somewhat weak.  </li>
            <li> , it makes the flossing feel utterly pointless.</li>
            <li> usually go into a store and get J&amp;J Reach floss.  </li>
            <li> It usually does the job, no matter the brand.</li>
            <li> (I tried a Listerine flavor, but I am not sure flavor matters all that much, at least not to me).</li>
            <li> Dental professionals usually have no complaints about any of them; their biggest complaint is those of us that don&#x27;t use them.  </li>
            <li> It was a little less expensive, and having purchased a pack of 6, don&#x27;t have to shop for this for a while.</li>
            <li> Thin: this stuff is, I believe, even thinner than Glide, meaning it gets in tight places with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did have a hard time with the elasticity of the floss.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t slip away from my fingers when trying to get to hard to reach teeth.  </li>
            <li> Oddly hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> thought maybe expensive pink floss might make it easier to floss.</li>
            <li> - I think it&#x27;s an acquired taste to say the least.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flimsy, so I can&#x27;t floss without it breaking at least once.  </li>
            <li> No more pulling, twisting or breaking floss!</li>
            <li> I mean, either it works or it doesn&#x27;t I suppose.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if he was actually serious - he may have just been trying to make a point - he was like that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous</li>
            <li> I guess it just feels a little weird, which is why I give it four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> the thin strands just seem to be too flimsy.</li>
            <li> The flavor is like Listerine (without the alcohol burn), but merely having a flavor doesn&#x27;t really mean anything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and rubbery and feels like flossing with a very thin rubber band.</li>
            <li> But for me, it&#x27;s useless and is going to sit in a drawer for emergencies (or guests).</li>
            <li> and she seems impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Value:  difficult to ascertain because all floss comes in packages of differing lengths and sizes.  </li>
            <li> I think this product has been discontinued, and I am very sad about that.  </li>
            <li> I hate waxed because it is basically useless, and I really hated it when flosses started adding sweeteners about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing the thing partly because my Glide floss catches on the wire/parts and splits.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t hate flossing?&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t blame me if u hate it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> But my dad hated it.  </li>
            <li> I always hated flossing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this floss because it doesn&#x27;t shred and doesn&#x27;t seemed to be waxed, so it does a much better job of scraping the teeth.  It&#x27;s also sturdy enough to thread between teeth to floss wired teeth.  It&#x27;s too bad J&amp;J aren&#x27;t distributing this anymore because it&#x27;s much better than the regular Reach product.</li>
            <li> I logged on to find the dental floss had jumped drastically in price when I looked for my usual Reach gentle woven dental floss. It is still  available as Listerine Gentle Gum Care Woven Floss, Mint.  Do note that this item contains 30 yards not the 50 yards that are in the original. Listerine Gentle Gum Care Woven Floss, Mint is still available in 50 yards.</li>
            <li> I love my Reach Floss!  Came quickly, too.</li>
            <li> Really like this dental floss and it is becoming hard to find locally</li>
            <li> Love the stretchiness of this floss. I always seek out this type and I wish it was available through subscribe &amp; save.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and orderd and great service.....</li>
            <li> I recently went to my dental hygienist for my teeth cleaning. During the cleaning, she was using this floss.  It was very gentle on the gums.  I asked her what kind of floss it was, and she told me it was this new product made by Reach.  After she was done cleaning my teeth, she gave me my little bag of goodies and put an extra thing of that floss in there for me!  I have been faithfully flossing everyday (even twice a day sometimes) because it is such a great floss!  The elasticity makes it comfortable to hold and is soooo gentle on the gums (while still getting all the gunk out from in between the teeth!)  It may be more expensive than regular threaded floss, but I feel that it&#x27;s totally worth it!  Ingenious idea created by Reach!!!  I hope this product stays on the market forever!  :)</li>
            <li> This floss is interesting. What I like about it is its \\&quot;Listerine flavor;\\&quot; very pleasant. Being one who flosses daily, I was a little put off by the floss itself. Unlike traditional \\&quot;string\\&quot; floss, Reach&#x27;s version is made of a stretchy, purple plastic. It slides between teeth easily, and gets the job done, but the stretchiness and bounce of it is taking some getting used to. I guess it just feels a little weird, which is why I give it four stars instead of five. It&#x27;s fully functional, however. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a week, I have to say I love it compared to the ancient wax/no wax string.  This floss seems to clean FAR better than the typical string floss.  However, unlike other reviewers, I found the strength of the floss to be somewhat weak.  Twice, while using the floss, the floss broke despite the apparent elasticity.  However, this incovenience was outweighed by the great cleaning job and taste.  Also, this floss did not seem to cut into my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a hard time with the elasticity of the floss.  Coming from the string type floss, which you use as a tow rope if needed, I was not used to just how much \\&quot;give\\&quot; the floss had.  It took about a week to get used to the change and adjust my flossing techniques.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this floss on and off for awhile and I&#x27;ve decided I just don&#x27;t like it. The Listerine flavor is nice but I&#x27;ve become spoiled on floss picks. I&#x27;ve found that I can reach more areas, more comfortably, when using floss picks instead of normal floss. While these claim to remove more plaque I feel that&#x27;s only against standard floss, however, you can be more maneuverable with floss sticks which surprisingly Reach doesn&#x27;t offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some this may be a great floss, but for me it&#x27;s a pass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B001FWXSBU Glide Floss]] for several years, it&#x27;s served me well, but trying the Reach floss makes me realize how much nicer floss can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 things I like best about the Reach floss.&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s easy to hold, it doesn&#x27;t slip off my fingers and doesn&#x27;t dig into them painfully.&lt;br /&gt;2. When flossing my built-in retainer, the Reach floss does a great job. I hate flossing the thing partly because my Glide floss catches on the wire/parts and splits. The Reach floss does not, and it feels nice on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;I also feel the Reach floss does a better job flossing, it seems to turn up more gunk than the Glide, possibly because it&#x27;s a little thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;It has a rubber feel that is really nice on the gums -- however, this creates a horrible twang against the teeth that makes it uncomfortable to use normally. I am mostly used to it, but I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is a very light mint, and I&#x27;m a fan of the pink color.&lt;br /&gt;The container stands up by itself on the counter, and the transparent plastic means you can see just how much you have left. I&#x27;m not sure how efficient it is (could they fit more floss if they made it slightly rounder?) but I like the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister had less positive remarks about the floss:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I thought maybe expensive pink floss might make it easier to floss. Regretfully, it didn&#x27;t. I liked the feel and look of the floss - it is some sort of thin rubbery material in pink. It smells and tastes lightly of mint, which was refreshing. However, the material has a kind of flaky texture, so when I look at it to see how effective it was, I can&#x27;t tell! The floss right of the container and the floss from between my teeth look the same to me. I really don&#x27;t like that, it makes the flossing feel utterly pointless. In short, if I could tell that this floss was effective I would like it a lot more. As it is, I am going to search for a different brand.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent floss. It&#x27;s more like a flat tape than a round string, so it is gentler on the gums. The material is pretty stretchy and feels good on the teeth and on the fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why would anyone want to flavor floss with Listerine? I use Listerine sometimes, but it&#x27;s for its germ-killing properties thanks to the alcohol content. But I&#x27;ve never craved the flavor - I think it&#x27;s an acquired taste to say the least. Putting Listerine flavor on floss makes it taste gross and does nothing to improve the anti-germ qualities since there&#x27;s actually no alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t really feel the effect of the microgrooves. There is still much less friction compared to a traditional floss. At home, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to test whether this floss actually removes twice as much plaque - so I&#x27;m writing that off as some marketing hype.</li>
            <li> Always great. Really cleans between the teeth.</li>
            <li> This is definitely different than any other type of floss I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s thin and rubbery and feels like flossing with a very thin rubber band. The first time I used it I was afraid it would snap at some point, but it&#x27;s surprisingly tough. It makes flossing a lot easier and you don&#x27;t need as much floss to do the job. It&#x27;s also got some kind of Listerine coating so that after you floss your mouth feels fresher. I&#x27;d give it five stars except that it just feels weird to floss with something so rubbery when you&#x27;re used to normal floss. But overall it&#x27;s a great product and I like it more than any other floss I&#x27;ve used as far as the amount needed to floss, the freshness in your mouth afterward, and the strength of the floss (the fact that it doesn&#x27;t break or get caught in your teeth).</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s heard the lectures from the dentists and hygenists over and over.  You have to floss routinely in addition to brushing to keep plaque from building up, forming tartar, and causing gum disease, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, the choice was simple.  Get Johnson &amp; Johnson \\&quot;string\\&quot; floss in wax or no wax.  Now, however, there are all kinds of flosses popping up.  Oral-B, Crest with a \\&quot;ribbon floss,\\&quot; and Johnson &amp; Johnson/Reach with this Total Care stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took to the ribbon type flosses quickly because they were generally easier to get between all my teeth, even those with barely any gap between them.  However, some of the ribbon flosses (looking at you, Crest) didn&#x27;t seem to remove as much plaque as the older \\&quot;string\\&quot; flosses did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Total Care floss does a much better job.  Perhaps that&#x27;s attributable to the so-called \\&quot;micro groove\\&quot; technology.  (I can actually feel the floss drag against the surface of my teeth, which I don&#x27;t feel with the Crest \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; floss.)  Whatever it is, this floss is comfortable to use and it works.  I&#x27;m a convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This variety of Total Care has \\&quot;Listerine Fresh\\&quot; mint flavor.  That&#x27;s just window dressing.  The flavor is like Listerine (without the alcohol burn), but merely having a flavor doesn&#x27;t really mean anything.  It&#x27;s not as if the floss itself has germ-killing mouthwash on it.  I could think of better flavors than Listerine mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line, this floss works better for me than any of the other kinds I&#x27;ve tried.  At the end of my last cleaning, my dentist actually gave me a reel of it, so I guess he&#x27;s on board, too.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Reach Total Care Dental Fresh Mint Floss is a very fine product.  It gets the hard to reach areas and removes material in one attempt that would require sever tries with other flosses.  I was leery of the Mint taste but it is mild an inoffensive to one who is not a mint fan.  I plan to use this product in the future and recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> This is a very unique dental floss.  It is similiar to Glide in that it is like a tape, but different in that it is like an elastic.  I found it slipped very well between my teeth and was very comfortable.  Because of the stretch I got the sensation it was getting very close to my tooth as I pulled.  I didn&#x27;t have the breakage problem that I have sometimes with other floss.  My husband also liked it because he felt it gripped his tooth better thereby getting a bit more friction to remove plaque. The Listerine flavor is very mild and I would have given it five stars had the flavor been more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of REACH floss but not this particular one.  While the flavor of Listerine is an added bonus, I really don&#x27;t like how the string has elasticity to it.  I like the string to not give and snap.  If this was all that was in the drawer, I&#x27;d still use it but it wouldn&#x27;t be what I&#x27;d grab first.</li>
            <li> While it took me a little while to get used to the \\&quot;rubber-like\\&quot; texture, this floss works well. It also made my mouth feel really fresh after flossing so I guess the Listerine flavoring helps. The pink color is just a novelty but it&#x27;s nice for a change. Overall, good floss but it may take a number of uses to get accustomed to the texture because it&#x27;s pretty different from other kinds of dental floss.</li>
            <li> The best floss. My whole family loves this stuff. It works better than any other floss we have tried. More expensive but worth it. I hope the company starts manufacturing it again.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a sample of this at my last checkup. I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I first used it. It&#x27;s slightly elastic so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums, and you can snap it out from your teeth without feeling like you&#x27;re going to lose one. It really gets around your teeth and REALLY gets every bit of food out. Easy to use, easy on your mouth, and very effective. I like the flavor, too, slightly minty but not too strong. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is so much better than any other kind of floss that it&#x27;s worth whatever it costs.</li>
            <li> I always dreaded the task of flossing until I have this one. I am actually looking forward to flossing now. It is elastic so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt my fingers when wrap around them, and it cleans a lot easier and better thanks to the same elasticity. I like the fact that it is pink; very unique. I like the flavor, too; feel very fresh after flossing. It is a bit expensive though; I got it from Amazon fulfilling for about $17 and I have prime 2-day free shipping. You can try the one without the listerine flavor for a cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002UUTCZM Reach Total Care Floss 90-Yard, (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years now, I think, and I do like it. I have used other brands before and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have this history of finding a floss I like and then before I know it, it is taken off the market.  I am picky.  I hate waxed because it is basically useless, and I really hated it when flosses started adding sweeteners about 10 years ago.  Not just because they seemed &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; with just the essence of mint instead of the candy-like sweetness, but because my hands became a sticky mess using them,  This floss is my new favorite.  I am sure one day it will also be taken off the market, but until it is, I buy in bulk!  Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t shred AT ALL.</li>
            <li> For those of us who floss everyday (and you really should) , this product is GREAT ! It glides between the teeth with a refreshing taste and leaves your mouth feeling great</li>
            <li> Best floss on the market.  Break resistant.</li>
            <li> I love this floss; bear in mind, this is not your typical wax-coated thread, however. This is more a thin rubber band type stretchy tape that perfectly fits in the crevices of dental work (I have multiple fillings/crowns that shred traditional floss) and cleanly removes debris! Light Listerine flavor, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t hate flossing?&lt;br /&gt;This product,at least, makes the whole process 10X more effective and tastes good too!&lt;br /&gt;I got an A+ from the hygeniest at my last cleaning because of this floss&lt;br /&gt;and my trusty Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I normally use &#x27;Glide&#x27; floss -- I have multiple dental implants, and have found Glide to be the best at sliding in between the tightly placed crowns &amp; coming back out without catching or fraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Reach Total Care floss is similar to Glide, but I actually believe it to be a bit better, at least for people like me who have implants or other artifial dental/tooth components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Stretchy: this floss is very slightly stretchy... allows you to get a better, tighter grip. Stretchiness is similar to that of monofilament fishing line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Thin: this stuff is, I believe, even thinner than Glide, meaning it gets in tight places with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Strong: this is right on par with Glide I think -- generic flosses, even the &#x27;hi-tech&#x27; types that attempt to mimic the name brands, tend to fray on my implant crowns, but this stuff performs wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Flavored: it&#x27;s nice having a fresh flavor from flossing. I like the Listerine Mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Package design: the floss comes in a semi-transparent container that stands upright on its own. A tiny detail, but I thought it was a neat design choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: I use this floss regularly now and will probably stick with it. While others may not have to be as picky about their floss, my dental work necessitates better floss. This stuff fits the bill. I encourage others who have experienced frustration with &#x27;normal&#x27; floss to try Reach Total Care and see the difference.</li>
            <li> Wow, this dental floss really works great.  The floss does not fray and the  mint taste is not over the top like some of the other brands.  I have had great results with this floss and have not been able to come up with any cons to ofset the pros.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while and decided to hold off on writing a review until I&#x27;ve had more of a chance to try out the dental floss. To be honest, it is not that great. I&#x27;m used to thicker floss and the thin strands just seem to be too flimsy. Probably will end up going to back to my old dental floss. If you have tight spaces between your teeth, you might like this, otherwise, give it a pass.</li>
            <li> Very satisfactory; I had been unable to find it in local stores after my dental hygienist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I finally found a dental floss that works well for me. I have very tight fitting teeth and this floss works awesome. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of force to fit it between them and slides easily while doing a wonderful job getting the space clean. I also love the fact that the floss doesn&#x27;t gouge my fingers. The floss also leaves a Listerine flavor to your mouth when you are done. That can be a positive or negative depending on if you like Listerine or not.</li>
            <li> I sure love this. I didnt think there could be much of a difference in dental floss brands, but this made me a believer. I allmost look forward to flossing now. The best way to describe it, is it&#x27;s like using a thinner version of a rubber band. It stretches, doesnt break, and glides easily in and out between your teeth and stetches easily around them. No more pulling, twisting or breaking floss! Makes flossing a breeze. Nice flavor too!</li>
            <li> The best floss ever! Cleans your teeth beautifully  and doesn&#x27;t slip out of your fingers while  you&#x27;re flossing. Slips easily between even tight teeth. I was very happy to find this product on Amazon  as I was not able to find it in regular box stores.</li>
            <li> Has been replaced by Listerine floss, apparently the same thing.  Really does a good job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Reach has developed dental floss from a piece of waxed string to a state of the art dental ribbon. Total care is a joy to use.  The container is well designed and does not fall apart when you pull the floss.  The floss is tasty and slips easily between the teeth but is thick enough to loosen particles wedged in the gums.  When I floss with total care my mouth feels refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> As anyone who goes to a dentist every 6 months would have done, I have tried several different brands of flosses. This one comes as big surprise! The greatest thing is that it seems better at being shred-resistant, thus promoting a more pleasant flossing experience. (I tried a Listerine flavor, but I am not sure flavor matters all that much, at least not to me).</li>
            <li> This is the best floss I have used! I have very tight teeth and therefore normal flosses are constantyl breaking or getting stuck. This bran has great elasticity and is pliable enough not to snag. I am 70 years old so been flossing a lot of years and I am sold on this one!</li>
            <li> So glad to find this brand on Amazon. It was a little less expensive, and having purchased a pack of 6, don&#x27;t have to shop for this for a while. Reach Total Care is durable, but does not get caught in between tight teeth. It has a little stretch and seems to do a good job. Recommend it, even if a little pricier.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> When I saw that this was compared to Glide brand, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it.  I find Glide to be too slick; not only does it not seem to clean my teeth effectively, it&#x27;s awkward to work with because it&#x27;s slippery to hold onto (even wound around my fingers, it slides off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have either of these issues with the Reach Total Care.  Although it is smooth, it cleans my teeth well, and it is easy to grasp.  It&#x27;s not a traditional floss but a flexible floss tape, which makes it very easy to slide into tight spaces between teeth.  However, it has enough traction to work well in the wider spaces.  The flexible tape seems to be absolutely shred-proof, as well.  I have one rough spot that nearly always snags and usually shreds dental floss, but I&#x27;ve had none of that problem with the Reach Total Care floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered about the \\&quot;Listerine Fresh\\&quot; flavor, also, and if you&#x27;ve ever used Listerine you know why -- its flavor can be overwhelming.  However, this is not strong or overwhelming at all.  It&#x27;s just a pleasant touch of flavor, less than the usual mint flavors used in floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this in my medicine cabinet next to my \\&quot;old\\&quot; Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach plain waxed floss, but I find myself reaching for this one every time.  When I run out, I definitely will seek out this one for my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Reach Floss is different from other flosses in several key characteristics. This leads to superior performance. It is a ribbon not a thread. Thus, it covers more surface area and is easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surface is rough, i.e. the microgrooves, also making it easier to hold. The rough surface is also better at material removal than smooth waxed surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it stretches. This may not seem like much at first, but the stretchyness means that you do not have to get the length exactly right or keep changing your grip. The length adjusts to your need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one downside: the cost. Reach Total Care Floss costs more than standard dental flosses. However, it is competitive with Oral-B Floss Tape. Reach&#x27;s superior performance makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> The best floss , in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Wow, wide enough, thin enough, strong enough, lasts enough, it stretches making it navigate enough. It didn&#x27;t fray leaving strands stuck between your teeth. Refreshing, invigorating, gees I bought 6 of them to make sure I never run out, well 6 will last me a few years. Im in love with this floss. Can you tell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Stretchy and grippy, it has a surface that seems to really clean all surfaces of my teeth. Doesn&#x27;t cut gums, either. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this floss and I am so glad she did. This floss is elastic (some form of plastic.) It dord not get stringy nor break off between the teeth if your teeth are close together like mine. I love, love, love this floss.</li>
            <li> Happy to find this product! Maybe manufactured slightly less thick or flexible, but I need to use a few more times to be sure.</li>
            <li> Really wanted the product but couldn&#x27;t find in stores locally.</li>
            <li> Thought I was ordering a woven floss but not so.  Giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this floss. I finally found the perfect floss</li>
            <li> This is a newer generation of floss.  You can get between every tooth without pain or digging no matter how little space there is.  I highly recommend this floss over all others.</li>
            <li> I like the ribbon floss - works well on my teeth.  The floss is also quite strong - I use use it for hanging flashlights on my garage pegboard. Almost like fishing line.</li>
            <li> With very tight contacts between my teeth, I found this floss to work very well.  It was hard to find in stores so I was pleased to find that Amazon had it.  Now I have enough to last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this floss by my dental hygienist.  I love the way it gets between your teeth, and then springs out.  It&#x27;s almost like an elastic band.  I bought so much of it because I am giving it away as Christmas gifts (along with several of my other favorite things).</li>
            <li> Use this all the time.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is an excellent floss.  It stretches yet does not break, fits in between the tightest teeth and removes lodged food.  The minty flavor also gives you that fresh feeling.  Much better than Oral B and Glide.</li>
            <li> Stretchy!  i like the way it handles.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m the only one who doesn&#x27;t really like this floss, but it is very thin and it is almost like using a thin rubber band to floss with.  It is stretchy and sometimes it would pop me if it got stuck between my teeth  then quickly popped out! It would sting a little bit when it hit my upper or lower lip.  My hygienist  gave it to me as a freebie, but next time I&#x27;ll tell her &amp;#34;no thanks&amp;#34;...  There are so many other flosses that work better for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different flosses and this is the best one that I have found.  There is a mild mint flavor.  Most important is there is a very mild roughness to the material that really scrapes off the plaque. The tape will stretch so it is rare that it will break.  I have tight teeth, and it slides between them easily.  It seems a bit expensive but it really does a good job.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time while staying at my sister&#x27;s house during a visit. I saw it on the bathroom counter and it looked interesting, so I gave it a shot. I was instantly impressed by how much better it felt compared to the Oral B Glide I&#x27;ve used for several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stretchy rubber floss of Reach Total Care does not cut into my fingers nearly as much like other floss, and that alone is enough for me to pick it over other floss. But that&#x27;s not all--it&#x27;s thicker stretchy material also means that it cleans more thoroughly when the gap between the teeth are bigger, yet because it is stretchy, it can still go into narrow gaps without any problem. Another thing I love about it is that it&#x27;ll never shred or break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people mentioned that it will snap like a rubber-band, and that is kind of true. If you tried to use it exactly like any other normal floss, it will snap out from the gap between your teeth like a rubber-band, and food debris will shoot out onto your bathroom mirror. To remedy the problem, what you should do, is to keep your fingers closer, and when you pull the floss out from a gap between teeth, keep your hands close to your mouth, and reshape the contour of your lips so they cover the opening of your mouth more. Also, pull a bit slower on the floss and using a back and forth motion when necessary. None of this is difficult--I can still floss at roughly the same speed as with normal floss, and the change in how I hold the floss and shape my mouth and how I move my hands are not more difficult--simply different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I discover a better floss, this is going to be it for me.</li>
            <li> Reach is the easiest way to dental floss.  It leaves your mouth smelling of mint, and it never breaks between your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got to be the elastic-ness of this floss that I love so much!!  I have to buy online cause I can&#x27;t get it locally I check 3 stores online worth buying... I gotta say yes.  But my dad hated it.  So don&#x27;t blame me if u hate it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST dental floss!</li>
            <li> the only floss I use. its the best</li>
            <li> Some compalin that this floss will pepper your mirror with mess.  But it does a fantastic job of cleaning, even when there are fillings or repairs that can shred fiber type flosses.  After all the purpose is to get your teeth clean and this does a great job of it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not much you can say about floss, is there? I mean, either it works or it doesn&#x27;t I suppose. But as it turns out, there is a bit more to this stuff. Here&#x27;s the thing: I&#x27;ve used basically two types of floss, the old-school type that shreds when you use it, and the new-school Teflon-type stuff, that&#x27;s more like a ribbon than a thread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate the old stuff, I love the new stuff.  But this floss is a third type: it&#x27;s the smooth ribbon-like floss that I like, but it&#x27;s got stretch to it - a lot of stretch. It&#x27;s almost like flossing with a rubber band, it&#x27;s so stretchy. The problem is that while it works, I feel like I can&#x27;t control it very well, and when it pops out from between your teeth it springs out like a slingshot. Unfortunately, a slingshot is exactly what you DON&#x27;T want behind a piece of food that may have been stuck between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose some people won&#x27;t mind this odd lack of control and weird springy action, and it actually works at flossing, so I&#x27;ll give it two stars. But for me, it&#x27;s useless and is going to sit in a drawer for emergencies (or guests). As an aside, my wife also disliked it intensely and refuses to use it.</li>
            <li> I was going to give this a 3 because I don&#x27;t like how elastic it is.  Then I asked my teen daughter to try it.  She loves it - because its so elastic.  So I&#x27;m giving it a 4.  Also, I thought it had Listerine in it, but it is only Listerene \\&quot;flavored\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Recently, Dr. Oz did a show about timing - when to do all the things during your daily routine.  He recommended to floss at night, when blood circulation slows down and you&#x27;ll cause less bleeding during flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually go into a store and get J&amp;J Reach floss.  I like waxed ribbon types, and it works well enough.  Reach&#x27;s Total Care is actually very good!  I liked the flavor, grip was strong and it didn&#x27;t break between my crowns - especially tough test as most flosses just snap in two like toothpicks!  The smell is leaves in my mouth is awesome. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> Like all floss, it is hard to grip and use, but, trying to not to hold that against it,I really do not see anything very special about this floss at all, besides that it is pink.  I feel like it actually made my breath taste worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is nothing special.  Even for people who like to floss.</li>
            <li> I have tight gaps between my teeth and the Reach Total Care holds up the best without tearing. The Listerine addition leaves a pleasant taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have a few very tight teeth and regular dental floss just shreds and get caught between my teeth. My dentist turned me on to this stuff and it really works well. It is a flat ribbon of floss with ridges on it and it is somewhat stretchy. It flexes to get between the tight teeth and holds together without shearing. It also does a better job of cleaning than regular floss in my opinion. The micro groves seem to make it clean better. Great product !</li>
            <li> Having so many in one package is very helpful to me because I live so far from town and now the stores here have stopped carrying this item. This is very convenient!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dental floss, and recommended by my dentist, it&#x27;s kind of like a satin ribbon and so reaches everywhere and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using Reach Total Care Floss, I can attest to the fact that it is a nice option if you are looking to keep your teeth clean!  Here are a few highlights of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My old floss had a major flaw-- it would peel away and sometimes leave little bits of itself in-between my teeth.  I was really looking for this Total Care floss to not follow in my old brands footsteps.  Thankfully, it didn&#x27;t!  I am happy to report that I have yet to have a piece split open while flossing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t slip away from my fingers when trying to get to hard to reach teeth.  It has a bit of a stretchy quality to it that helps you really get a good hold on the string.  Very handy for back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s an interesting purple shade, which is pretty much an aesthetic thing, but might help you in getting kids to floss more.  Me, I sure don&#x27;t mind having a bit of color on the sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- While the Listerine scent is strong before flossing, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve &#x27;tasted&#x27; it at all.  That being said, I typically floss after brushing my teeth, so my mouth still has a toothpaste like taste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  The strings are smooth and do actually pick up more floss than my old brand.  I&#x27;ve never felt them to be &#x27;rough&#x27; on my teeth or get stuck, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really don&#x27;t see any negatives with this product.  It does it&#x27;s job and it does it&#x27;s job well!</li>
            <li> This is another in the J&amp;J Reach dental floss category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The item is easy to dispense, has a pleasant taste and fits easily between teeth. This is similar to \\&quot;glide\\&quot; products but has a less smooth texture. The product works particularly well in between the front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;ve had several instances where my strand broke as I was getting to the molars and had to get a new piece. You also need to have completely dry fingers when using the product or it will slip.</li>
            <li> Reach Total Care floss is the latest in floss technology.  According to their own marketing, it slides like Glide but works better, is shred resistant, and is equipped with \\&quot;microgrooves\\&quot; to remove more plaque.  This particular version is flavored with Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;Historically, floss has evolved from silk, then nylon, to multi-thickness nylon, to resin coated nylon, to Gore-Tex (Glide).  Dental professionals usually have no complaints about any of them; their biggest complaint is those of us that don&#x27;t use them.  So choosing a floss really boils down to personal preference.  Do any of them really work better than the rest?&lt;br /&gt;Reach Total Care makes the claim that it removes 2x more plaque than Glide.  This is based on \\&quot;consumer acceptance and perceived benefit of two floss technologies.\\&quot; While it might not be scientific evidence, if twice as many people think it works better, that seems significant in its own way.&lt;br /&gt;This floss is nylon with \\&quot;microgrooves\\&quot; and is designed to stretch so it will easily go between teeth.  Its a little disconcerting at first because it seems as if it will snap.  It won&#x27;t, and the stretchiness does make it slide easily between teeth.  It also makes it snap back out, which I didn&#x27;t care for.  It does not shred, nor does it leave fibers stuck between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The flavoring is typical dental floss flavoring with a hint of Listerine.  Better than unflavored I suppose, but sort of irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:  does it actually remove twice as much plaque as Glide?  So far, no quantitative evidence supports this claim which could work two ways with consumers.  It could promote sales (this one is the best!) or it could induce the thought process that flossing can be done half as often.  It does work like dental floss should: slides easily between teeth, slides along between your gums and teeth, and easily slides (snaps) back out. I&#x27;ll edit this review if I see my hygienist and she seems impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Value:  difficult to ascertain because all floss comes in packages of differing lengths and sizes.  This one is on the higher end of the scale, but in big dental health picture a small investment that could yield big returns.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  a good product.  Doesn&#x27;t break, doesn&#x27;t shred, tastes fresh and does the job.certain because all floss comes in packages of differing lengths and sizes.  This one is on the higher end of the scale, but in big dental health picture a small investment that could yield big returns.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  a good product.

            <li> About 30 years ago, I asked my dentist what I could do, in addition to brushing and regular check-ups, to preserve my teeth and reduce the number of cavities and other dental woes he would find every time I visited him. \\&quot;Simple,\\&quot; he said, \\&quot;start flossing.\\&quot; When I answered with the first lame excuse for not complying that I could think of, \\&quot;Oh, who has the time for that,\\&quot; his response shocked me into becoming an instant floss-believer. \\&quot;Well, then skip brushing and just floss.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if he was actually serious - he may have just been trying to make a point - he was like that. But it worked on me and I have been flossing (in addition to brushing) ever since. My floss of choice has always been J&amp;J Reach Dentotape ([[ASIN:B003XDVERE Reach,  Reach Dentotape, Designed for wide spaced teeth. Unflavored, Waxed Floss,100 Yard (Pack of 6)]]). The purpose of flossing is to remove plaque (the bacterial film that hardens into tartar and causes cavities and gum disease) between teeth and below the gum line, and the Dentotape just \\&quot;feels\\&quot; like it does a thorough job. It&#x27;s not entirely comfortable, but I really get the sense that I have cleaned what needed cleaning after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Total Care Floss is much more comfortable to use. It slides *very* easily and doesn&#x27;t shred or break or leave strands, but I just don&#x27;t get the same \\&quot;scrubbed\\&quot; feeling that I get with the older Dentotape product. The Total Care is fine for removing debris that gets stuck between teeth after eating, and I use it for that purpose. But for daily preventive maintenance, I&#x27;ll stay with the Dentotape. However, if you are not currently flossing at all and are considering starting that routine, I think you will be making a great improvement in your dental health whichever floss product you choose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky with dental floss. I don&#x27;t usually like waxed flosses because they don&#x27;t seem to pick up as much stuff, and especially not as much as the non-waxed woven flosses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised with this floss that for a waxed floss it does pretty well. It definitely picks up way more than another popular flat ribbon brand. The fact that this floss is waxed allows it to glide pretty easily between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My all time favorite floss is by the same company, [[ASIN:B001E96QJK Reach Gentle Gum Care Woven Dental Floss, Fluoride, 50-Yard Dispensers (Pack of 6)]], and I would pick it any day over this product. But, this one is my second choice, hands down over everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My hygienist once handed me a container of dental floss and asked, \\&quot;What, do you just give this to your friends or...?\\&quot; So I&#x27;m admittedly an infrequent user, but I&#x27;ve become much better about flossing regularly since that embarrassing day. Take my opinions for what you will!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not much to get excited or disappointed about when it comes to floss. It usually does the job, no matter the brand. Total Care does the job, but I don&#x27;t feel as comfortable using it as I do with the string variety. This is a little \\&quot;plastic-y\\&quot; and it could be gentler. The flavor doesn&#x27;t do much, or even taste like much, and it might as well not be flavored. Or it could be a different flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way for me to possibly determine if Total Care truly removes up to two times more plaque than Glide, but I think I&#x27;m more of a Glide user and will go back regardless of that fact.</li>
            <li> Absolutely top rate dental floss.  Oddly hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I really like this floss!  It is thin and stretchy, so it can really get in those tight spaces.  My teeth are REALLY close together, and sometimes certain flosses are hard to get in between my teeth without jamming it in and then cutting my gums.  This works great to get a good and safe cleaning!</li>
            <li> This works so well but it will shred if you have any rough spots.</li>
            <li> Just like the blades, it&#x27;s dental floss. The kind I like, easy to find here not so much in the store, and the price is better.by a LOT. The strange thing is the quantity. If you buy 3 they are cheaper than if you buy four. Buying two is as  much more  as four (I think) but in any case like SO many things at Amazon it comes to the house, costs less and is just so much more convenient it&#x27;s ridiculous Amazon is great an Amazon PRIME just RULES!! The BEST thing I&#x27;ve ever done as far as shopping is concerned! Just LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I love this floss. It stretches a bit, so I find it great for every area I need to floss. And I like the slightly flavored Listerine taste. This particular floss is hard to find locally so I&#x27;m super happy to be able to get it here on Amazom!</li>
            <li> I think this product has been discontinued, and I am very sad about that.  I haven&#x27;t found another floss that shreds and breaks less.  I also feel that the Reach Total Care gets your teeth and gums way cleaner than any other floss, plus it is more gentle.  I will be looking for a replacement product when my stash runs out, and I&#x27;m hoping I can find something similar.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what we wanted.  Thanks</li>
            <li> My daughter is away at college and this is her favorite kind of floss.  We first received it as a sample, but have been unable to find it despite looking in a number of stores.  I found it atAmazon and sent 6 packages to her.  She says that she now flosses daily, as it makes a previously difficult task easy.  If it weren&#x27;t for shipping charges, I would order it from you on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I love the way it gets rid of plaque--the long thin fibers help clean well and feels better than any other floss I&#x27;ve tried. But it breaks so easily. It breaks three to four times every time I floss--which is why I bought three six-packs.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it and gave me a free unit.&lt;br /&gt;It feels more gentle than normal floss.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other band floss, doesn&#x27;t scrunch and lose its flatness if you tug on it.</li>
            <li> It seems overpriced to me. My wife says it does a good job on her teeth.</li>
            <li> I received some in a gift pack from my dentist, and fell in love with it. Better than conventional floss,&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more flexible and does a better job.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist. Hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> excellent product. thank you for offering it</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a sample and it&#x27;s by far the best floss I have ever used for my many crowns - almost impossible to break.&lt;br /&gt;It is very reasonable in price when you consider that you need a shorter piece and that it does not break or shred.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery and service were excellent - I highly recommend this floss.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting to my back teeth and between some of my others.  I&#x27;ve always dreaded flossing and often did not even go to the trouble.  I LOVE THIS FLOSS because it makes it much easier to reach my back teeth and get between the others that are close together.  The stretchy material is also easier on my fingers that often got pinched by regular floss.</li>
            <li> I used Oral B Glide for years but now I start to use REACH.&lt;br /&gt;EACH floss is much better to go between the gum and the teeth. The elasticity of the string is very helpful to go to narrow gaps.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommendation.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this because I have a problem with most flosses ripping. She feels this floss is the best because it really cleans the teeth. It&#x27;s hard to find where I live, thus my online order. I LOVE this floss!</li>
            <li> I was traveling last week and forgot to bring along my dental floss. I stopped in a grocery store and the only one they had was Reach Total Care Floss (fresh mint flavor). That seemed fine. I bought and have been using it ever since. I don’t particularly care for it. It’s stretchy, somewhat like a rubber band. Plus, it tends to break when stretched too far. Otherwise, it works well and has a pleasant taste. I doubt that I’d buy it again, unless it was the only choice as in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> Item as advertised, fair price, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I received a sample at my dentist and liked it so much I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  Very effective floss and leaves my teeth really clean!</li>
            <li> The best dental floss ever made. Well designed and well made. It doesn&#x27;t break and the floss&#x27;s ribs apparently catch all the plaque; my dental hygienist raves about the condition of my teeth. I have used this floss for years but can no longer find it at local stores (perhaps the ADA has black listed it because it takes away their work). Fortunately, Amazon came through again. Sure, it costs a bit more but for me and my mouth there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the stretchiness, this is great. Cleans more thoroughly, exercises my gums, and leaves a fresh flavor in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I love this floss...I did read a negative review of this product, however, this is the BEST floss I&#x27;ve ever used...several years ago I was taught by a professional dental hygienist on &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; flossing technique - I really love it &amp; will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Buying floss is like choosing between shoes. I think it boils down to a matter of preference since everyone&#x27;s set of teeth are so different. Nonetheless I will give my opinion on these. Some context; Previous to using Reach Total Care floss, I was using Oral B&#x27;s Glide which are highly rated. I didn&#x27;t like those too much because they broke easily and quite often. Maybe I don&#x27;t have wide enough gaps to use these? Interestingly enough, many reviewers for Oral B&#x27;s Glide say that they don&#x27;t fray easily. Goes to show each person&#x27;s situation is different than the next. What&#x27;s more, my wife prefers Oral B VS. Reach Total Care. Maybe her flossing technique is better than mine? Maybe she doesn&#x27;t have as many tight spaces between her teeth ( although her teeth seems normal). All I know that for my situation, I find Reach Total Care to be superior to Oral B&#x27;s Glide. They don&#x27;t snap as Much with a capital M, there is a level of elasticity to Reach&#x27;s that is non-existent to Oral B&#x27;s which contributes to longer-lasting floss and they are a tad thinner than Oral B&#x27;s which may also add to its duress in my case. One last point, many people say that Oral B&#x27;s don&#x27;t make them bleed. Sounds like a lot of horsec*ck! From my experience experience, the only reason I bled when flossing with any floss was because my gum lines were not use to the aggressive act of flossing. After a week or so of flossing, I would not bleed. And that&#x27;s using all sorts of flossing. So I think people sometimes don&#x27;t know what they are talking about. I am sure some people have bleeding issues when flossing with certain kinds of floss on a constant basis, but these are outliers. I am not addressing those folks.</li>
            <li> Best dental floss on the market!</li>
            <li> This product works great for people who don&#x27;t have much room between their teeth.  I haven&#x27;t had it shred at all and I have quite a bit of dental work.</li>
            <li> I love this floss.  Has a great taste and works very well.  My dentist office uses this one.</li>
            <li> I like it most because it does not shred. It is pretty tough as well, so it rarely breaks and if it does, the break is clean. I much prefer it over regular floss or the white tape. I&#x27;m getting consistently high marks from my dentist when I visit.</li>
            <li> I keep buying this in amazon. great product and price.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GREAT;  I USE THE FLOSS AT LEAST ONCE DAILY.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t purchase this again when I&#x27;m done with the six pack.  I&#x27;ll probably give some or all of them away.  It&#x27;s flimsy, so I can&#x27;t floss without it breaking at least once.  That&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> Great product and service.  Hard to find &amp;#34;Reach total care floss&amp;#34; locally, but this was a painless experience.  If you have closely spaced teeth, I have found this brand to be the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great dental floss for my family and me.  It doesn&#x27;t break or snag like so many do and glides easily.  Hard to find in stores so ordering on line is a piece of cake!</li>
            <li> Grips better than the slippery wax floss. Effective and leave a fresh taste after use.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, it does not break as easily, and has a little more give.</li>
            <li> I always hated flossing. You see, my teeth are so close together that I would frequently have floss rip and get stuck between my teeth. Well, when Crest came out with their Glide floss, I finally found a floss that worked for me the way that floss should, and I thought I will stick with this floss forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Johnson &amp; Johnson has done Glide one better! Reach Total Care looks like a thin strip, like Glide (rather than looking like thread), and works just as good as Glide. But, this floss is impregnated with Listerine, with gives your mouth that extra feeling of cleanness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this floss. As a matter of fact, I would go as far as to say that this is the floss I am going to stick with for a long time to come! I like it that much!</li>
