            <li>Easy to apply and very effective.</li>
            <li>I have told my mom, friends, and co-workers about this amazing deodorant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this item from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>There has been zero residue on my clothing which is a nice change from the sparkly residue that sometimes finds its way onto my darker shirts.  </li>
            <li>I will say it kind of worked.  </li>
            <li>I was out mowing my lawn in heat and humidity, working up a nice sweat</li>
            <li>Why this is more surprising to me than to others</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do find that it isn&#x27;t as good as clinical strength, but I don&#x27;t think most people need protection on the clinical strength level.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest ...</li>
            <li>the scent while pleasant was overwhelmingly strong.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothing, and is a very good price.</li>
            <li>It smell good, goes on smooth and no underarm rash.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say, I absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>It is a controversial topic, I get that, there is a lot of conflicting evidence, I get that.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent, really smells good and works great for gym, office, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked feeling confident all day and there were no marks that ruined my clothes.  </li>
            <li>All of these qualities - love, love, love!</li>
            <li>It dries very fast, smells great</li>
            <li>A winner for sure.</li>
            <li>I love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I really love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it through subscribe and save because I needed a couple more items</li>
            <li>I love gel deodorant.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the smell of most deodorants.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, i keep buying it because it&#x27;s my favorite...</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>The scent was refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love that it outlasted my run and the rest of my day.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the non-whitening gel.</li>
            <li>I think this deodorant is better in warmer months because it is cooling.  </li>
            <li>once I tried this I was in love.  </li>
            <li>It is simply magic.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I will continue buy it.</li>
            <li>Awesome - works just like the solid but no smear...</li>
            <li>being that I am this lovely sweating chick.....</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I was able to try this deodorant at no cost to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this product because it has now become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even purchased 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the product, I was pleased -</li>
            <li>I got one for free from bzz agent and just love it.</li>
            <li>Great protection, no more tshirt spots, great price</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, the fact that it increased in fresh smell when my body warmed up and that others could smell it, but didn&#x27;t know it was deodorant.</li>
            <li>I received this as a special trial and now I have switched!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- warm, clean scent (vs pear which is cool, clean)&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I LOVE to smell fresh!</li>
            <li>However, I tried the clean scent and had a much better turnout.</li>
            <li>Quick drying, also leaving me dry all day, no marks on my clothes, and a great smell to top it off!  </li>
            <li>my wife says she loves secret smells great works great</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to try it if it wasn&#x27;t for BzzAgent and getting it free.</li>
            <li>and I still smell fabulous.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this product Free through Bzzagent to try and review.</li>
            <li>I tried this one because I got it for free through buzzagent to try and review.</li>
            <li>Got it free</li>
            <li>so I was asked to try it out for free by bzzagent......</li>
            <li>When bzzagent sent me a free one to try</li>
            <li>Got a it free to try as part of a promotion.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, we all wear deodorant to mask that lovely body odor in hopes of smelling good all day long.  </li>
            <li>I was more than willing to give it a chance, when bzzagent gave me the opportunity to test it</li>
            <li>I was excited  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, dries so quick and does not leave marks on my shirt.  </li>
            <li>I can tell you that it does not feel gooey, it has great odor control and keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li>but it does work by keeping u dry and smells great- scent</li>
            <li>This deodorant does last more than 24 hours, which is incredibly nice.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is amazing for busy people.  </li>
            <li>Living in South Florida and being a frequent runner, I need an effective antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li>Works good, but I&#x27;ve learned that I&#x27;m not a big fan of gel type deodorant.</li>
            <li>full disclosure</li>
            <li>I truly love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It last all day and keep you smelling good.  </li>
            <li>I used to think that solids would provide more odor protection, but they really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I tried the clear gel and surprisingly I liked it.</li>
            <li>Thanks bzzagent for the free sample and finding something that works for me in this SoFLo heat AGAIN!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product if you&#x27;re cleaning around your house and don&#x27;t want to build up sweat.  </li>
            <li>I got this free through BzzAgent, and was pretty excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and lasts for hours with no marks.</li>
            <li>more than once I had found myself re-applying mid afternoon for more wetness protection.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly...</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve been very happy, and will likely go and buy this.</li>
            <li>Just be prepared for a quick AHHH moment</li>
            <li>but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, but within 30 minutes to 1 hour of working, I had sweaty underarms&lt;br /&gt;3.)</li>
            <li>I have tried many deodorants on the market (including men deodorant products) and have not been completely satisfied with their results, especially when it comes to odor control on days that I have been exercising, out all day etc.</li>
            <li>I now have a new deodorant!!!!</li>
            <li>My New Favorite Deodorant....</li>
            <li>I really think the gel is great for not leaving white marks, but again, the sticky wetness it leaves at first, I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>First i noticed clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I have recently taken up running, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t make it through a good run.</li>
            <li>Pros: Very fast-drying which is important to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again it protects you while making you smell fresh.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stick it out a full 48 hours because I had to bathe and wash my hair, the sample lasted longer than I did, haha!</li>
            <li>Well worth buying, wish you could buy it in the UK.</li>
            <li>I love this clear gel.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make me feel sticky like the others and the fresh scent</li>
            <li>I am always willing to try a new product and love it when it works👍.</li>
            <li>I was almost sure I wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied and would resort to using my other deodorant.  </li>
            <li>either way, this deodorant runs out pretty quickly with every day use.</li>
            <li>I like the packaging, the color, the scent and the applicator; the click system is nice (these minor details affect my buying, I&#x27;m OCD like that).</li>
            <li>::) keeps me dry and smelling fresh even after a 14hr shift!</li>
            <li>This is a great antiperspirant and keeps me dry and smelling good for most of the day in the crazy heat of South Florida.  </li>
            <li>It leaves no marks on your clothing at all, you never smell and it dries super fast.  </li>
            <li>( that&#x27;s what happen to me first time</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt sticky or smelly even when it gets hot at work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy with how perfume like it smells, but that smell doesn&#x27;t really linger.  </li>
            <li>so I wanted to make sure this product did actually last for 48 hours.</li>
            <li>It is sticky for the first 20 minutes after application</li>
            <li>Great scent and long lasting antiperspirant!</li>
            <li>First day I was nervous trying this out.....</li>
            <li>, I could wash up and put on my favorite invisible solid.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and will definitely be recommending it.</li>
            <li>Being a BzzAgent, I received a sample of Secret Outlast clear gel, and have been pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li>After trying many different products over the years, Secret Outlast Clear Gel is by far the most effective and now my favorite.</li>
            <li>I honest thought it would be like every other deodorant on the market until I went hiking.  </li>
            <li>It dries pretty fast if you do not overly apply it, or you will end up with sticky armpits and excess product that peels off</li>
            <li>Dry and smelling great all day long!</li>
            <li>I love how long this product works!</li>
            <li>Well, because I am the type of person that has to often reapply her deodorant, I think I would on certain occasions.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free from buzzagent for the sole purpose of trying out and reviewing it.       </li>
            <li>wetness not so much.  </li>
            <li>But the whole thing doesn&#x27;t jazz me up so much.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I just wish that it didn&#x27;t go so fast.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it really worked.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Yet, I really like the gel.</li>
            <li>It dries extremely fast and you wont even notice you have it on.  </li>
            <li>I found that as I was sweating, the deodorant&#x27;s smell became more noticeable and it also became wet and sticky.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t perspiring much, and I didn&#x27;t apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To give you a background, I am a woman who works at a office but is constantly running from one side to the other, and I want to guarantee that whenever I am I am smell good.</li>
            <li>Even when I wait for 10 minutes or so to make sure it has had a chance to dry completely before putting on my clothes, the pits still end up looking all funky.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and fresh, vaguely like baby powder, and not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>Like I mentioned, I&#x27;m usually not a fan of gels, but that cool, wet feeling, also went away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have returned to my tried and true Degree solid.</li>
            <li>As far as effectiveness of the product, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>no white marks, long lasting pleasant smell, and sweat blocker.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and odor free all day.</li>
            <li>this particular day</li>
            <li>pretty awesome considering it has been over 90 degrees outside for the past few days.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes and it smells nice, but it&#x27;s not one that I&#x27;d rely on if you&#x27;re an active person outside like I am.  </li>
            <li>I was dry and smelt fresh all day!</li>
            <li>or if I am working up what normally results in a sweat.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I am protected at least 2-3 days with one application.</li>
            <li>When I first received this product for free to try out as part of a BzzAgent campaign, there was a LOT I disliked: the fragrance, the gel formula, waiting for it to dry, the cool feel of the alcohol evaporating.  </li>
            <li>well&lt;br /&gt;- long-lasting (I live in Florida, so this is CRUCIAL)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a new deodorant that lasts.  </li>
            <li>Cant live with out it,</li>
            <li>They assumed I had a new perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this in the future, this one I got for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>but I also felt that I used the whole stick of deodorant much quicker than a stick of invisible solid.    </li>
            <li>I will say that the gel does dry incredibly quick</li>
            <li>Thankfully I was very surprised with it.</li>
            <li>This works well in terms of keeping you smelling fresh, but the gel formula seems to leave strange marks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>The chemicals and potential health risks are higher on my priority</li>
            <li>I am usually not a fan of gel deodorants.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised because normally by 3 PM I need to re-up and freshen up.</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling when I first apply it, but that wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and provides strong protection during my busy day and through stress.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive secret outlast protecting clear gel deodrant from Bzz agent for free.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it does not get my black clothes white 😄...</li>
            <li>aight did try clear as it claims</li>
            <li>Does it go on clear and stay clear?</li>
            <li>/&gt;- gel - dries clear and absorbs in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel</li>
            <li>I tested it for over a month, it keep me clean and smelling well, no white marks after it dry.</li>
            <li>no whit marks goes on clear stays clears.....</li>
            <li>wow, this product stands up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It wears off fast if I&#x27;m just walking around outside.  </li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how well this deodorant worked.  </li>
            <li>I am currently rotating this with the only aluminum free deodorant that actually works (SoftnDri).</li>
            <li>but so far I like this one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see spending more money on something that doesn&#x27;t significantly work better than other, less expensive antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a very sweaty person by nature, but i do live in hotlanta, ga, where the afternoons can really bring the heat!</li>
            <li>The gel goes on smoothly, covers thoroughly with no sticky residue and dries very fast due to the slight amount of alcohol.</li>
            <li>so I could let everyone if Iiked it, and I do goes on super easy and did not leave any white behind</li>
            <li>This product wore off very quickly and didn&#x27;t last 1 hour much less the 48 hours as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>I had used secret some years ago but stopped and switched to another brand because I didn&#x27;t feel like it kept me fresh and dry during most of the day.</li>
            <li>and you really need something to keep you dry.  </li>
            <li>and I love Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I did give this deodorant 4/5 stars is that I can&#x27;t stand the wet feeling of the gel before it dries and it burns when applying after freshly shaving.  </li>
            <li>Dried quick</li>
            <li>It dries fast, its not sticky (which has been a problem with other products in the past), it smells fresh and it really lasts 48+ hours.</li>
            <li>Yes indeed, the secret might be that you only need to apply a little bit of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel in order to get a wonderful result!</li>
            <li>Just one crank of the knurled pump at the bottom expresses enough of the gel through the small holes at the top to swipe the entire underarm area.</li>
            <li>Btw,i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li>Not only did the gel dry quickly but it did last all day and night and some of the next day.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is a clear gel and dries with NO white marks.</li>
            <li>Since I can no longer find the old formula, I am going to have to find a different brand.</li>
            <li>As a mom to three young children, sometimes, I find myself awakened to chaos leaving my shower to later in the day than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Secret Outlast for 10 days, hoping it will get better as I go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m slightly picky when it comes to deodorants , I thought the scent was a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I normally wear degree solid, but received Secret Outlast in the mail free from Bzz Agent .</li>
            <li>I received this Secret Outlast Clear Gel product free to try from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>I realize all our bodies are different and require different levels of protection but so far this product gets an A+</li>
            <li>, I am more of a Secret Invisible solid kinda girl!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by how fast Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel dried on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Usually I stay away from clear gel deodorants, because I don&#x27;t like the cool, wet feeling when applying them.  </li>
            <li>One of the reasons I don&#x27;t normally like gel deodorants is because of the wet feeling that seems to take forever to go away, this was not like that though.</li>
            <li>Thank you Secret for getting it right!!</li>
            <li>I received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Completely Clean Deodorant as part of the BzzAgent product campaign.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry almost immediately and the odor control has so far lasted me all day.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel will be the only antiperspirant I use from here on out!</li>
            <li>I would consider trying a different scent, so next time I got to the store I&#x27;m going to check out the selection of Secret&#x27;s completely clean clear gel.</li>
            <li>If you loose the cap and then the top get a little dried out</li>
            <li>I tend to buy Secret&#x27;s Gel deodorant because I have a slightly darker skin tone and its kind of risky that solids may show up really white.</li>
            <li>Past experience has shown that they don&#x27;t dry quickly, and I end up leaving marks on my clothing.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that my daughter doesn&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s really cold when u first apply it, other than that we just love this product.</li>
            <li>To my complete surprise, after putting this Secret Outlast on after my nightly shower I was still feeling very fresh and dry the next morning and throughout the ENTIRE day.</li>

            <li> I have told my mom, friends, and co-workers about this amazing deodorant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this item from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> There has been zero residue on my clothing which is a nice change from the sparkly residue that sometimes finds its way onto my darker shirts.  </li>
            <li> I will say it kind of worked.  </li>
            <li> I was out mowing my lawn in heat and humidity, working up a nice sweat</li>
            <li> Why this is more surprising to me than to others</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do find that it isn&#x27;t as good as clinical strength, but I don&#x27;t think most people need protection on the clinical strength level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest ...</li>
            <li> the scent while pleasant was overwhelmingly strong.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothing, and is a very good price.</li>
            <li> It smell good, goes on smooth and no underarm rash.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say, I absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> It is a controversial topic, I get that, there is a lot of conflicting evidence, I get that.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent, really smells good and works great for gym, office, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked feeling confident all day and there were no marks that ruined my clothes.  </li>
            <li> All of these qualities - love, love, love!</li>
            <li> It dries very fast, smells great</li>
            <li> A winner for sure.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> but I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it through subscribe and save because I needed a couple more items</li>
            <li> I love gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the smell of most deodorants.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, i keep buying it because it&#x27;s my favorite...</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> The scent was refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love that it outlasted my run and the rest of my day.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the non-whitening gel.</li>
            <li> I think this deodorant is better in warmer months because it is cooling.  </li>
            <li> once I tried this I was in love.  </li>
            <li> It is simply magic.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I will continue buy it.</li>
            <li> Awesome - works just like the solid but no smear...</li>
            <li> being that I am this lovely sweating chick.....</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I was able to try this deodorant at no cost to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this product because it has now become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even purchased 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the product, I was pleased -</li>
            <li> I got one for free from bzz agent and just love it.</li>
            <li> Great protection, no more tshirt spots, great price</li>
            <li> I liked the smell, the fact that it increased in fresh smell when my body warmed up and that others could smell it, but didn&#x27;t know it was deodorant.</li>
            <li> I received this as a special trial and now I have switched!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- warm, clean scent (vs pear which is cool, clean)&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I LOVE to smell fresh!</li>
            <li> However, I tried the clean scent and had a much better turnout.</li>
            <li> Quick drying, also leaving me dry all day, no marks on my clothes, and a great smell to top it off!  </li>
            <li> my wife says she loves secret smells great works great</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to try it if it wasn&#x27;t for BzzAgent and getting it free.</li>
            <li> and I still smell fabulous.</li>
            <li> and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this product Free through Bzzagent to try and review.</li>
            <li> I tried this one because I got it for free through buzzagent to try and review.</li>
            <li> Got it free</li>
            <li> so I was asked to try it out for free by bzzagent......</li>
            <li> When bzzagent sent me a free one to try</li>
            <li> Got a it free to try as part of a promotion.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, we all wear deodorant to mask that lovely body odor in hopes of smelling good all day long.  </li>
            <li> I was more than willing to give it a chance, when bzzagent gave me the opportunity to test it</li>
            <li> I was excited  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, dries so quick and does not leave marks on my shirt.  </li>
            <li> I can tell you that it does not feel gooey, it has great odor control and keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li> but it does work by keeping u dry and smells great- scent</li>
            <li> This deodorant does last more than 24 hours, which is incredibly nice.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing for busy people.  </li>
            <li> Living in South Florida and being a frequent runner, I need an effective antiperspirant/deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works good, but I&#x27;ve learned that I&#x27;m not a big fan of gel type deodorant.</li>
            <li> full disclosure</li>
            <li> I truly love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It last all day and keep you smelling good.  </li>
            <li> I used to think that solids would provide more odor protection, but they really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I tried the clear gel and surprisingly I liked it.</li>
            <li> Thanks bzzagent for the free sample and finding something that works for me in this SoFLo heat AGAIN!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product if you&#x27;re cleaning around your house and don&#x27;t want to build up sweat.  </li>
            <li> I got this free through BzzAgent, and was pretty excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and lasts for hours with no marks.</li>
            <li> more than once I had found myself re-applying mid afternoon for more wetness protection.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly...</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve been very happy, and will likely go and buy this.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared for a quick AHHH moment</li>
            <li> but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, but within 30 minutes to 1 hour of working, I had sweaty underarms&lt;br /&gt;3.)</li>
            <li> I have tried many deodorants on the market (including men deodorant products) and have not been completely satisfied with their results, especially when it comes to odor control on days that I have been exercising, out all day etc.</li>
            <li> I now have a new deodorant!!!!</li>
            <li> My New Favorite Deodorant....</li>
            <li> I really think the gel is great for not leaving white marks, but again, the sticky wetness it leaves at first, I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> First i noticed clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I have recently taken up running, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t make it through a good run.</li>
            <li> Pros: Very fast-drying which is important to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again it protects you while making you smell fresh.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stick it out a full 48 hours because I had to bathe and wash my hair, the sample lasted longer than I did, haha!</li>
            <li> Well worth buying, wish you could buy it in the UK.</li>
            <li> I love this clear gel.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me feel sticky like the others and the fresh scent</li>
            <li> I am always willing to try a new product and love it when it works👍.</li>
            <li> I was almost sure I wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied and would resort to using my other deodorant.  </li>
            <li> either way, this deodorant runs out pretty quickly with every day use.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging, the color, the scent and the applicator; the click system is nice (these minor details affect my buying, I&#x27;m OCD like that).</li>
            <li> ::) keeps me dry and smelling fresh even after a 14hr shift!</li>
            <li> This is a great antiperspirant and keeps me dry and smelling good for most of the day in the crazy heat of South Florida.  </li>
            <li> It leaves no marks on your clothing at all, you never smell and it dries super fast.  </li>
            <li> ( that&#x27;s what happen to me first time</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt sticky or smelly even when it gets hot at work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy with how perfume like it smells, but that smell doesn&#x27;t really linger.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted to make sure this product did actually last for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> It is sticky for the first 20 minutes after application</li>
            <li> Great scent and long lasting antiperspirant!</li>
            <li> First day I was nervous trying this out.....</li>
            <li> , I could wash up and put on my favorite invisible solid.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and will definitely be recommending it.</li>
            <li> Being a BzzAgent, I received a sample of Secret Outlast clear gel, and have been pretty impressed.  </li>
            <li> After trying many different products over the years, Secret Outlast Clear Gel is by far the most effective and now my favorite.</li>
            <li> I honest thought it would be like every other deodorant on the market until I went hiking.  </li>
            <li> It dries pretty fast if you do not overly apply it, or you will end up with sticky armpits and excess product that peels off</li>
            <li> Dry and smelling great all day long!</li>
            <li> I love how long this product works!</li>
            <li> Well, because I am the type of person that has to often reapply her deodorant, I think I would on certain occasions.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from buzzagent for the sole purpose of trying out and reviewing it.       </li>
            <li> wetness not so much.  </li>
            <li> But the whole thing doesn&#x27;t jazz me up so much.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I just wish that it didn&#x27;t go so fast.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it really worked.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Yet, I really like the gel.</li>
            <li> It dries extremely fast and you wont even notice you have it on.  </li>
            <li> I found that as I was sweating, the deodorant&#x27;s smell became more noticeable and it also became wet and sticky.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t perspiring much, and I didn&#x27;t apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To give you a background, I am a woman who works at a office but is constantly running from one side to the other, and I want to guarantee that whenever I am I am smell good.</li>
            <li> Even when I wait for 10 minutes or so to make sure it has had a chance to dry completely before putting on my clothes, the pits still end up looking all funky.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and fresh, vaguely like baby powder, and not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned, I&#x27;m usually not a fan of gels, but that cool, wet feeling, also went away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have returned to my tried and true Degree solid.</li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness of the product, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> no white marks, long lasting pleasant smell, and sweat blocker.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and odor free all day.</li>
            <li> this particular day</li>
            <li> pretty awesome considering it has been over 90 degrees outside for the past few days.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes and it smells nice, but it&#x27;s not one that I&#x27;d rely on if you&#x27;re an active person outside like I am.  </li>
            <li> I was dry and smelt fresh all day!</li>
            <li> or if I am working up what normally results in a sweat.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I am protected at least 2-3 days with one application.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product for free to try out as part of a BzzAgent campaign, there was a LOT I disliked: the fragrance, the gel formula, waiting for it to dry, the cool feel of the alcohol evaporating.  </li>
            <li> well&lt;br /&gt;- long-lasting (I live in Florida, so this is CRUCIAL)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a new deodorant that lasts.  </li>
            <li> Cant live with out it,</li>
            <li> They assumed I had a new perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this in the future, this one I got for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> but I also felt that I used the whole stick of deodorant much quicker than a stick of invisible solid.    </li>
            <li> I will say that the gel does dry incredibly quick</li>
            <li> Thankfully I was very surprised with it.</li>
            <li> This works well in terms of keeping you smelling fresh, but the gel formula seems to leave strange marks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> The chemicals and potential health risks are higher on my priority</li>
            <li> I am usually not a fan of gel deodorants.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised because normally by 3 PM I need to re-up and freshen up.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling when I first apply it, but that wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and provides strong protection during my busy day and through stress.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive secret outlast protecting clear gel deodrant from Bzz agent for free.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it does not get my black clothes white 😄...</li>
            <li> aight did try clear as it claims</li>
            <li> Does it go on clear and stay clear?</li>
            <li> /&gt;- gel - dries clear and absorbs in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel</li>
            <li> I tested it for over a month, it keep me clean and smelling well, no white marks after it dry.</li>
            <li> no whit marks goes on clear stays clears.....</li>
            <li> wow, this product stands up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wears off fast if I&#x27;m just walking around outside.  </li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how well this deodorant worked.  </li>
            <li> I am currently rotating this with the only aluminum free deodorant that actually works (SoftnDri).</li>
            <li> but so far I like this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see spending more money on something that doesn&#x27;t significantly work better than other, less expensive antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very sweaty person by nature, but i do live in hotlanta, ga, where the afternoons can really bring the heat!</li>
            <li> The gel goes on smoothly, covers thoroughly with no sticky residue and dries very fast due to the slight amount of alcohol.</li>
            <li> so I could let everyone if Iiked it, and I do goes on super easy and did not leave any white behind</li>
            <li> This product wore off very quickly and didn&#x27;t last 1 hour much less the 48 hours as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> I had used secret some years ago but stopped and switched to another brand because I didn&#x27;t feel like it kept me fresh and dry during most of the day.</li>
            <li> and you really need something to keep you dry.  </li>
            <li> and I love Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I did give this deodorant 4/5 stars is that I can&#x27;t stand the wet feeling of the gel before it dries and it burns when applying after freshly shaving.  </li>
            <li> Dried quick</li>
            <li> It dries fast, its not sticky (which has been a problem with other products in the past), it smells fresh and it really lasts 48+ hours.</li>
            <li> Yes indeed, the secret might be that you only need to apply a little bit of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel in order to get a wonderful result!</li>
            <li> Just one crank of the knurled pump at the bottom expresses enough of the gel through the small holes at the top to swipe the entire underarm area.</li>
            <li> Btw,i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> Not only did the gel dry quickly but it did last all day and night and some of the next day.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is a clear gel and dries with NO white marks.</li>
            <li> Since I can no longer find the old formula, I am going to have to find a different brand.</li>
            <li> As a mom to three young children, sometimes, I find myself awakened to chaos leaving my shower to later in the day than I wanted.  </li>
            <li> my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Secret Outlast for 10 days, hoping it will get better as I go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slightly picky when it comes to deodorants , I thought the scent was a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I normally wear degree solid, but received Secret Outlast in the mail free from Bzz Agent .</li>
            <li> I received this Secret Outlast Clear Gel product free to try from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> I realize all our bodies are different and require different levels of protection but so far this product gets an A+</li>
            <li> , I am more of a Secret Invisible solid kinda girl!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how fast Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel dried on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Usually I stay away from clear gel deodorants, because I don&#x27;t like the cool, wet feeling when applying them.  </li>
            <li> One of the reasons I don&#x27;t normally like gel deodorants is because of the wet feeling that seems to take forever to go away, this was not like that though.</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret for getting it right!!</li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Completely Clean Deodorant as part of the BzzAgent product campaign.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry almost immediately and the odor control has so far lasted me all day.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel will be the only antiperspirant I use from here on out!</li>
            <li> I would consider trying a different scent, so next time I got to the store I&#x27;m going to check out the selection of Secret&#x27;s completely clean clear gel.</li>
            <li> If you loose the cap and then the top get a little dried out</li>
            <li> I tend to buy Secret&#x27;s Gel deodorant because I have a slightly darker skin tone and its kind of risky that solids may show up really white.</li>
            <li> Past experience has shown that they don&#x27;t dry quickly, and I end up leaving marks on my clothing.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that my daughter doesn&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s really cold when u first apply it, other than that we just love this product.</li>
            <li> To my complete surprise, after putting this Secret Outlast on after my nightly shower I was still feeling very fresh and dry the next morning and throughout the ENTIRE day.</li>
            <li> So far, I think the Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel is on par with the solid deodorants I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately secret completely clean outlast gel did nothing to change my mind.  </li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean sample through Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> It does not leave stains on my delicate clothes while keeping me fresh all day long.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the product&#x27;s claim of lasting for 48 hours as I haven&#x27;t gone that long without showering.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for a clear deodrant for work becuase we have to wear all black</li>
            <li> I like this because it goes on dry and doesn&#x27;t make white marks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Dove for a few years now and am used to a soft solid.</li>
            <li> and I have tried numerous other brands and Secrets actually work.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- not good to leave in a hot car, thins out and goes everywhere</li>
            <li> no sticky underarms for long lengths of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gives protection for a long time</li>
            <li> It was a really strange feeling.</li>
            <li> It lasted all day, even when I walked up 5 flights of stairs because the elevator was taking too long.  </li>
            <li> I Could to believe that this lasted so long</li>
            <li> lasted all day long.  </li>
            <li> so I am very active and no stranger to daily outside activities and lots of activity.</li>
            <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give this five stars is that I think it is pricey in comparison to other products.  </li>
            <li> I have to let it dry adn</li>
            <li> Does it keep you dry?</li>
            <li> They wanted to know if I was dry all day</li>
            <li> Within seconds it was dry</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry  </li>
            <li> and I was still dry,</li>
            <li> It dried almost immediately and felt no different than my invisible solid.</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried clear gel deodorants that haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear clear gel, but</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast gel really works!</li>
            <li> I had expected for it to feel sticky and have trouble drying like all other clear gels I had tried.</li>
            <li> No more white marks on my clothes or white build up under my arms.</li>
            <li> and I never really feel dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> How can you put on something wet to sty dry.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel totally fulfill my expectations:</li>
            <li> 15 minutes after I put the gel on my underarms would still feel wet and sticky.</li>
            <li> For regular, everyday use, I don&#x27;t know that I will buy this product for myself.</li>
            <li> (Thanks to Secret for allowing me to try it).</li>
            <li> i think \\&quot;squishes\\&quot; the gel and cuts down on how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, as I kept wearing the product over the course of several weeks, I noticed those factors less and less.  </li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that it only works when I&#x27;m inside and away from heat and a lot of physical activity.  </li>
            <li> No more white residue on your underarms and no more white marks on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell a waft of perfumy scent from my armpits throughout the day as I do with other products.</li>
            <li> I applied this product yesterday (was a little reluctant, not a big fan of deodorant gel products), it dried within seconds,</li>
            <li> I have to say I tried this new Secret as a part of a campaign.  </li>
            <li> I always apply deodorant every day so it was hard to try to see who would last longer; me or the deodorant.</li>
            <li> my biggest complaint was how long I feel like my underarms are just wet.  </li>
            <li> Secret outlast clear gel  </li>
            <li> In fact, I waited for a day that I would be working around the house, so just in case this product was a let down</li>
            <li> Solids previously stained some of my workout clothes, but this has not done so.</li>
            <li> even black silk t-shirts go on without a trace.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very active at work.</li>
            <li> it takes a little bit of time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Little to no odor protection.</li>
            <li> Needless to say the entire day I was dry.</li>
            <li> I had use other Secret deorants, The basic Secret deorant, that doesnt work for me and the Secret Clinical Strength (Which I love) but was too expensive.</li>
            <li> While it is cold in the winter, it dries fast.</li>
            <li> She sweats heavily under her arms and was looking for a deodorant that could combat that.</li>
            <li> am giving this product a 4/5 for a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> applied this deodorant before attending work, and it dried within around 7 seconds clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate that goopy, wet underarm feeling from typical clear gel antiperspirants/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use gel deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I also should say I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel antiperspirant or deodorant in the past.</li>
            <li> Usually after a run it smells like I never put deodorant on.</li>
            <li> and I was not really sure of it before I tried it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative that will be with the similar effectiveness that the Clinial Strength but not as expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like gel deodorant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Secret has done with this formula, but I haven&#x27;t used my other deodorant since using this a month ago.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does the job, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a clumpy mess on your underarm or your clothes.</li>
            <li> I tried Secret Outlast and it was wet and cold when applied , within 45 seconds it was dry .</li>
            <li> So researching a little I found out about the Secret</li>
            <li> In South Florida, during the summer months your sweat glands are be overactive, to say the least</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s late afternoon now</li>
            <li> I have always been a secret girl.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Secret Outlast and its everlasting smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Secret Clinical wearer, and although it stains my clothes, I&#x27;ll stick to what I know works when I have to get sweaty</li>
            <li> Since Secret moved to this Outlast formula, it doesn&#x27;t work at preventing moisture at all.  </li>
            <li> I tried this as a sample from Secret and BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I let them know I was testing this deodorant for BzzAgent and Secret.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast was not like that.</li>
            <li> Poor wetness protection.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Protecting Power Gel Deodorant as part of a BzzKit from Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li> This one proved me wrong on both accounts.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Secret for making a deodrant that works and stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I had posted an earlier review about the unscented version and hated it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used the clinical secret brand which works, but is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> maybe is that I have really bad night sweats.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> and I hate when I wear deodrant and it shows.</li>
            <li> I would rather have cold pits than stinky pits!!!!</li>

            <li> Yes indeed, the secret might be that you only need to apply a little bit of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Gel in order to get a wonderful result! Living in South Florida and being a frequent runner, I need an effective antiperspirant/deodorant. Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel totally fulfill my expectations: no white marks, long lasting pleasant smell, and sweat blocker. It dries pretty fast if you do not overly apply it, or you will end up with sticky armpits and excess product that peels off ( that&#x27;s what happen to me first time I used the Gel!). I am glad I have received the product as part of a promotion from the brand so that I can now get rid of my old disappointing Dove roll-on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use gel deodorants.  Past experience has shown that they don&#x27;t dry quickly, and I end up leaving marks on my clothing.  This one proved me wrong on both accounts.  Quick drying, also leaving me dry all day, no marks on my clothes, and a great smell to top it off!  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this in the future, this one I got for free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I sweat under my arms, especially in the summer time and I have tried numerous other brands and Secrets actually work. It smell good, goes on smooth and no underarm rash.  I have used the clinical secret brand which works, but is very expensive.  Needless to say, this works just as well and the price is so much better.  Goes on smooth, dries so quick and does not leave marks on my shirt.  A winner for sure. #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> So far, I think the Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel is on par with the solid deodorants I&#x27;ve used in the past. Personally, I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling when I first apply it, but that wears off quickly. I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it not working, and have no complaints. I really think the gel is great for not leaving white marks, but again, the sticky wetness it leaves at first, I don&#x27;t like. It does smell great though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item from BzzAgent in exchange for my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product for free to try out as part of a BzzAgent campaign, there was a LOT I disliked: the fragrance, the gel formula, waiting for it to dry, the cool feel of the alcohol evaporating.  However, as I kept wearing the product over the course of several weeks, I noticed those factors less and less.  The product just works.  I haven&#x27;t felt sticky or smelly even when it gets hot at work or if I am working up what normally results in a sweat.  There has been zero residue on my clothing which is a nice change from the sparkly residue that sometimes finds its way onto my darker shirts.  I can&#x27;t comment on the product&#x27;s claim of lasting for 48 hours as I haven&#x27;t gone that long without showering.  Considering how well it works over the 24 hours or so between showers, I don&#x27;t doubt that I could get another day out of one application.  The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give this five stars is that I think it is pricey in comparison to other products.  I can&#x27;t see spending more money on something that doesn&#x27;t significantly work better than other, less expensive antiperspirants.  If price is not a consideration for you, then go for it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This works well in terms of keeping you smelling fresh, but the gel formula seems to leave strange marks on my clothes.  Even when I wait for 10 minutes or so to make sure it has had a chance to dry completely before putting on my clothes, the pits still end up looking all funky.</li>
            <li> My New Favorite Deodorant.... I have to say I tried this new Secret as a part of a campaign.  I can honestly say, I absolutely LOVE it.  It leaves no marks on your clothing at all, you never smell and it dries super fast.  I love, love this product.  Thank you Secret for getting it right!!</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product as a promotional brand and I love Secret Outlast Clear Gel. It&#x27;s long lasting and provides strong protection during my busy day and through stress.</li>
            <li> Works good, but I&#x27;ve learned that I&#x27;m not a big fan of gel type deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love how long this product works! It absorbs quickly into the skin and lasts for hours with no marks. This product is great!</li>
            <li> full disclosure I got this product for free from buzzagent for the sole purpose of trying out and reviewing it.       I also should say I&#x27;ve never been a fan of gel antiperspirant or deodorant in the past. Unfortunately secret completely clean outlast gel did nothing to change my mind.  my biggest complaint was how long I feel like my underarms are just wet.  15 minutes after I put the gel on my underarms would still feel wet and sticky. the scent while pleasant was overwhelmingly strong.  as for the 24 to 48 hour wetness and odor protection... I will say it kind of worked.  order completely totally 100% was covered for 24 to 48 hours... wetness not so much.  more than once I had found myself re-applying mid afternoon for more wetness protection. aight did try clear as it claims but I also felt that I used the whole stick of deodorant much quicker than a stick of invisible solid.    all this being said I am still a big fan of Secrets products. I will continue to buy seacret products but I will be sticking with the invisible solid.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product smells and it does what it&#x27;s supossed to do!  My only problem with the product is the wetness you feel after putting it on.  I have to let it dry adn it takes a little bit of time.  Other then that it works great!</li>
            <li> I have always been a secret girl. I used to use the invisible solid but now I&#x27;m hooked on Outlast. I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to try it if it wasn&#x27;t for BzzAgent and getting it free. I was scared of a gel and feeling gooey but I really love this product. No more white marks on my clothes or white build up under my arms. I truly love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product has its pros and cons. Does it keep you dry? Abso-freakin-lutely! I often comment on how pregnancy gave me the hormones and stink of a teenage boy, even after giving birth!!! Well this deodorant definitely combats that! Does it go on clear and stay clear? Yes. Does it leave marks on my clothing? Nope! All of these qualities - love, love, love! At the gym, this product stands up. After a day of work... wow, this product stands up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is a downside to this product - the health aspects. There are a lot of chemicals in this deodorant/antiperspirant, a lot of chemicals that have been linked to breast cancer. It is a controversial topic, I get that, there is a lot of conflicting evidence, I get that. But the whole thing doesn&#x27;t jazz me up so much. The scent is lavendar - I would say it is lavendar/chemical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So where does that leave me, will I keep using it...? Well, because I am the type of person that has to often reapply her deodorant, I think I would on certain occasions. Maybe before an xmas party, or before the gym. For regular, everyday use, I don&#x27;t know that I will buy this product for myself. The chemicals and potential health risks are higher on my priority list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did get this product as apart of a bzzagent campaign</li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant.  It last all day and keep you smelling good.  I am a fan of Secret Outlast and its everlasting smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again it protects you while making you smell fresh. It leaves no residue on your shirts.</li>
            <li> my wife says she loves secret smells great works great</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I have used it for years. I like the fact that it is a clear gel and dries with NO white marks. Dries quickly...no sticky underarms for long lengths of time. It works very well for me. No stains on clothing.I hope it stays around for awhile.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive secret outlast protecting clear gel deodrant from Bzz agent for free. I am always looking for a clear deodrant for work becuase we have to wear all black and I hate when I wear deodrant and it shows. This is an awesome deodrant! It dries very fast, smells great and I don&#x27;t have to reapply for 24 hours. Thank you Secret for making a deodrant that works and stays on all day! Very pleased will be purchasing after I&#x27;m done with the sample...</li>
            <li> This deodorant will last through the longest and sweatiest day here in Hawaii and I still smell fabulous. I just wish that it didn&#x27;t go so fast.</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much&lt;br /&gt;Smell nice&lt;br /&gt;And dont leaves&lt;br /&gt;Stains on clothing&lt;br /&gt;Gives protection for a long time</li>
            <li> I like this because it goes on dry and doesn&#x27;t make white marks on my clothes.  I ordered it through subscribe and save because I needed a couple more items and I used this anyway.</li>
            <li> I used to think that solids would provide more odor protection, but they really don&#x27;t. This stuff does the job, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a clumpy mess on your underarm or your clothes. Solids previously stained some of my workout clothes, but this has not done so. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> I tend to buy Secret&#x27;s Gel deodorant because I have a slightly darker skin tone and its kind of risky that solids may show up really white. This bulk deal from amazon was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- warm, clean scent (vs pear which is cool, clean)&lt;br /&gt;- gel - dries clear and absorbs in well&lt;br /&gt;- long-lasting (I live in Florida, so this is CRUCIAL)&lt;br /&gt;- great deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- not good to leave in a hot car, thins out and goes everywhere</li>
            <li> I got this free through BzzAgent, and was pretty excited to try it.  I&#x27;m always looking for a new deodorant that lasts.  However, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed that it only works when I&#x27;m inside and away from heat and a lot of physical activity.  It wears off fast if I&#x27;m just walking around outside.  It&#x27;s not a bad product if you&#x27;re cleaning around your house and don&#x27;t want to build up sweat.  It doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes and it smells nice, but it&#x27;s not one that I&#x27;d rely on if you&#x27;re an active person outside like I am.  It&#x27;s actually very disappointing.  I&#x27;m a Secret Clinical wearer, and although it stains my clothes, I&#x27;ll stick to what I know works when I have to get sweaty</li>
            <li> Since Secret moved to this Outlast formula, it doesn&#x27;t work at preventing moisture at all.  Since I can no longer find the old formula, I am going to have to find a different brand.</li>
            <li> Usually I stay away from clear gel deodorants, because I don&#x27;t like the cool, wet feeling when applying them.  Being a BzzAgent, I received a sample of Secret Outlast clear gel, and have been pretty impressed.  Bottom line, we all wear deodorant to mask that lovely body odor in hopes of smelling good all day long.  I was out mowing my lawn in heat and humidity, working up a nice sweat and I was surprised at how well this deodorant worked.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it really worked.  I&#x27;m not crazy with how perfume like it smells, but that smell doesn&#x27;t really linger.  Like I mentioned, I&#x27;m usually not a fan of gels, but that cool, wet feeling, also went away quickly.  There are no deodorant marks on my clothes or any clumping in my arm pits, which is a definate plus.  Overall, I&#x27;ve been very happy, and will likely go and buy this.</li>
            <li> I tried the clear gel and surprisingly I liked it. I had posted an earlier review about the unscented version and hated it!!!! It did absolutely nothing for me. However, I tried the clean scent and had a much better turnout. Not only did the gel dry quickly but it did last all day and night and some of the next day. I always apply deodorant every day so it was hard to try to see who would last longer; me or the deodorant. I tried this as a sample from Secret and BzzAgent so I wanted to make sure this product did actually last for 48 hours. I couldn&#x27;t stick it out a full 48 hours because I had to bathe and wash my hair, the sample lasted longer than I did, haha! Why this is more surprising to me than to others maybe is that I have really bad night sweats. I am constantly reapplying deodorant. I have been using Dove for a few years now and am used to a soft solid. Yet, I really like the gel. While it is cold in the winter, it dries fast. I would rather have cold pits than stinky pits!!!!</li>
            <li> Best buy everrrrrrrrrr!  Cant live with out it, well that&#x27;s what my daughter says. Well worth buying, wish you could buy it in the UK.</li>
            <li> **I received this product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the past I have tried clear gel deodorants that haven&#x27;t worked. This has always led me to using a solid deodorant that left white residue on my under arms. I also don&#x27;t like the smell of most deodorants. The smell of this isn&#x27;t overpowering and it goes on smooth. It dries extremely fast and you wont even notice you have it on.  And the best part is...it leaves no residue whatsoever! No more white residue on your underarms and no more white marks on your clothes. Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear gel will be the only antiperspirant I use from here on out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for well over a year...and I love the scent, really smells good and works great for gym, office, anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only vice is the packaging or maybe it&#x27;s the formula...either way, this deodorant runs out pretty quickly with every day use. If you loose the cap and then the top get a little dried out then you have to keep twisting it up which i think \\&quot;squishes\\&quot; the gel and cuts down on how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i keep buying it because it&#x27;s my favorite...just remember not to lose the cap and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I talked to four friends. I let them know I was testing this deodorant for BzzAgent and Secret. They wanted to know if I was dry all day and if it lasted. I let them know it did but I did have an issue with it getting sticky at times. It was a really strange feeling. However, I did let them know that inspite of that I did like everything else about it. I liked the smell, the fact that it increased in fresh smell when my body warmed up and that others could smell it, but didn&#x27;t know it was deodorant. They assumed I had a new perfume. They said they would give it a try and thanked me for telling them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile and I LOVE it. It dries fast, its not sticky (which has been a problem with other products in the past), it smells fresh and it really lasts 48+ hours. I am currently rotating this with the only aluminum free deodorant that actually works (SoftnDri). I use this at night, and then &amp;#34;spot treat&amp;#34; in the days between with my backup if I need to. Honestly I am protected at least 2-3 days with one application. I really love this stuff. I like the packaging, the color, the scent and the applicator; the click system is nice (these minor details affect my buying, I&#x27;m OCD like that). Overall this product is a winner! I got this product Free through Bzzagent to try and review.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Has been the only deodorant that has lasted all day. ::) keeps me dry and smelling fresh even after a 14hr shift! Could not be happier!</li>
            <li> I got a sample from BzzAgent. I like it and so does my daughter. It&#x27;s a clear gel so it doesn&#x27;t make any white marks/streaks. The scent was refreshing. It gave a lasting wetness protection. The only thing that my daughter doesn&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s really cold when u first apply it, other than that we just love this product.</li>
            <li> I am usually not a fan of gel deodorants. I tried this one because I got it for free through buzzagent to try and review. Thankfully I was very surprised with it. One of the reasons I don&#x27;t normally like gel deodorants is because of the wet feeling that seems to take forever to go away, this was not like that though. Within seconds it was dry and I was out for my daily run. Usually after a run it smells like I never put deodorant on. Secret Outlast was not like that. I love that it outlasted my run and the rest of my day. I will be buying this product for now on.</li>
            <li> I received this product to try for free courtesy of BzzAgent and Secret. Regardless, opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Secret Outlast for 10 days, hoping it will get better as I go. I love the scent and the non-whitening gel. That&#x27;s where it ends, though. It is sticky for the first 20 minutes after application and I never really feel dry throughout the day. In addition, by 4 pm, I have to use it again. I have recently taken up running, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t make it through a good run. I am so disappointed. I have returned to my tried and true Degree solid.</li>
            <li> I got one for free from bzz agent and just love it. Great protection, no more tshirt spots, great price</li>
            <li> I received this Secret Outlast Clear Gel product free to try from Bzzagent.  I was pleasantly surprised by how fast Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel dried on my skin.  It lasted all day, even when I walked up 5 flights of stairs because the elevator was taking too long.  The package design makes it simple to hold and apply deodorant.  I liked feeling confident all day and there were no marks that ruined my clothes.  I think this deodorant is better in warmer months because it is cooling.  Just be prepared for a quick AHHH moment but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> After trying many different products over the years, Secret Outlast Clear Gel is by far the most effective and now my favorite. Just one crank of the knurled pump at the bottom expresses enough of the gel through the small holes at the top to swipe the entire underarm area. The gel goes on smoothly, covers thoroughly with no sticky residue and dries very fast due to the slight amount of alcohol. I can get dressed soon after putting it on and never have to worry about smudging my clothing - even black silk t-shirts go on without a trace. The scent is pleasant and fresh, vaguely like baby powder, and not at all overpowering. I don&#x27;t smell a waft of perfumy scent from my armpits throughout the day as I do with other products.</li>
            <li> Secret outlast clear gel  I Could to believe that this lasted so long I could skip a day  I tried this  so I could let everyone if Iiked it, and I do goes on super easy and did not leave any white behind and I didn&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry  all in all I will buy it.  #GotItFreefromSecret</li>
            <li> I love this clear gel.  It does not leave stains on my delicate clothes while keeping me fresh all day long.  I don&#x27;t usually wear clear gel, but once I tried this I was in love.  It didn&#x27;t make me feel sticky like the others and the fresh scent lasted all day long.  I am in love with this and will continue to use!!  I received this as a special trial and now I have switched!</li>
            <li> Pros: Very fast-drying which is important to me. I hate that goopy, wet underarm feeling from typical clear gel antiperspirants/deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Little to no odor protection. This product wore off very quickly and didn&#x27;t last 1 hour much less the 48 hours as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Poor wetness protection. It dries quickly, but within 30 minutes to 1 hour of working, I had sweaty underarms&lt;br /&gt;3.) White marks on skin. This is bothersome when wearing sleeveless shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product, but I do appreciate the opportunity to test it out courtesy of BzzAgent. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of a Bzzzcampaign and I was not really sure of it before I tried it. Just the thought of using a gel antiperspirant just didn&#x27;t make sense to me. How can you put on something wet to sty dry. I have to admit I love it!!!! It seems to dry almost immediately and the odor control has so far lasted me all day. I wish that I had tried it out this summer while I was sitting outside at the ball field for my daughter&#x27;s practice so I could attest to the strength of the antiperspirant. I can tell you that it does not feel gooey, it has great odor control and keeps me dry all day. It is a wonderful product that I am sold on.</li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean sample through Bzz Agent. I honest thought it would be like every other deodorant on the market until I went hiking.  I did not sweat underneath my arms at all! From then on I wore it every day until I used every bit of it. I even let my roommate use the deodorant to see how great it is. She sweats heavily under her arms and was looking for a deodorant that could combat that. She loved the results. I have told my mom, friends, and co-workers about this amazing deodorant. It is simply magic.</li>
            <li> I had use other Secret deorants, The basic Secret deorant, that doesnt work for me and the Secret Clinical Strength (Which I love) but was too expensive. I was looking for an alternative that will be with the similar effectiveness that the Clinial Strength but not as expensive. To give you a background, I am a woman who works at a office but is constantly running from one side to the other, and I want to guarantee that whenever I am I am smell good. So researching a little I found out about the Secret Outlast I was more than willing to give it a chance, when bzzagent gave me the opportunity to test it I was excited  (Thanks to Secret for allowing me to try it). I tested it for over a month, it keep me clean and smelling well, no white marks after it dry. I love it, and I will continue buy it. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great antiperspirant and keeps me dry and smelling good for most of the day in the crazy heat of South Florida.  I do find that it isn&#x27;t as good as clinical strength, but I don&#x27;t think most people need protection on the clinical strength level.</li>
            <li> Dry and smelling great all day long!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and very effective.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast gel really works! Great scent and long lasting antiperspirant! No white deodorant antiperspirant residue either! Got it free</li>
            <li> ***I received this product for free courteousy of the Buzzagent and Secret campaign***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this product a 4/5 for a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this deodorant before attending work, and it dried within around 7 seconds clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very active at work. Always walking around and moving. I found that as I was sweating, the deodorant&#x27;s smell became more noticeable and it also became wet and sticky. Keep in mind I wasn&#x27;t perspiring much, and I didn&#x27;t apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would personally purchase this product, I am more of a Secret Invisible solid kinda girl!</li>
            <li> Got to try this though bzzagent was awesome loved the smell and works Excellent!!</li>
            <li> Awesome - works just like the solid but no smear...</li>
            <li> First day I was nervous trying this out.....being that I am this lovely sweating chick.....so I was asked to try it out for free by bzzagent......I now have a deodorant it should save on shirts.....the most awesome thing is it leaves no whit marks goes on clear stays clears.....to come it up I love it thank bzzz agent for giving me the opportunity....I now have a new deodorant!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t always outlast 8 hours so I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts 48 but it does work by keeping u dry and smells great- scent just goes away sooner than I would like</li>
            <li> I was given this as a sample to try out and review. I&#x27;m slightly picky when it comes to deodorants , I thought the scent was a little overwhelming. As far as effectiveness of the product, it worked pretty well. I didn&#x27;t notice any &#x27;body odor&#x27; come through which is pretty awesome considering it has been over 90 degrees outside for the past few days. I would consider trying a different scent, so next time I got to the store I&#x27;m going to check out the selection of Secret&#x27;s completely clean clear gel.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Protecting Power Gel Deodorant as part of a BzzKit from Bzz Agent.  I was able to try this deodorant at no cost to me.  The only reason that I did give this deodorant 4/5 stars is that I can&#x27;t stand the wet feeling of the gel before it dries and it burns when applying after freshly shaving.  I will say that the gel does dry incredibly quick and I adore that.  The stinging, also only last momentarily.  This deodorant is amazing for busy people.  As a mom to three young children, sometimes, I find myself awakened to chaos leaving my shower to later in the day than I wanted.  This deodorant does last more than 24 hours, which is incredibly nice.  Though I may feel grimy, I know that my shirts are not ruined and I&#x27;m not that stinky to others that I am around.  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very sweaty person by nature, but i do live in hotlanta, ga, where the afternoons can really bring the heat! First i noticed clean, fresh scent. Keeps me dry and odor free all day. I&#x27;m glad I tried this product because it has now become one of my favorites. Will continue to buy and recommend to all my friends. Btw,i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I had used secret some years ago but stopped and switched to another brand because I didn&#x27;t feel like it kept me fresh and dry during most of the day. In South Florida, during the summer months your sweat glands are be overactive, to say the least and you really need something to keep you dry.  When bzzagent sent me a free one to try I was almost sure I wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied and would resort to using my other deodorant.  To my complete surprise, after putting this Secret Outlast on after my nightly shower I was still feeling very fresh and dry the next morning and throughout the ENTIRE day. I have five children so I am very active and no stranger to daily outside activities and lots of activity. Needless to say the entire day I was dry. I was really surprised because normally by 3 PM I need to re-up and freshen up. I switched things up the next day and put it on in the morning and it was about 87 degrees this particular day and I was still dry, no sweat stains on my shirt or anything.  I&#x27;m not sure what Secret has done with this formula, but I haven&#x27;t used my other deodorant since using this a month ago.  I&#x27;ve even purchased 2 more bottles. It will now be my regular choice for deodorant again. Thanks bzzagent for the free sample and finding something that works for me in this SoFLo heat AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I normally wear degree solid, but received Secret Outlast in the mail free from Bzz Agent . I am always willing to try a new product and love it when it works👍. I tried Secret Outlast and it was wet and cold when applied , within 45 seconds it was dry . It provided me with the protection I am looking for in a deodorant. I love the fact that it does not get my black clothes white 😄...</li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Completely Clean Deodorant as part of the BzzAgent product campaign. I have been using it for 4 days and I&#x27;m very impressed with the results. I have tried many deodorants on the market (including men deodorant products) and have not been completely satisfied with their results, especially when it comes to odor control on days that I have been exercising, out all day etc. I applied this product yesterday (was a little reluctant, not a big fan of deodorant gel products), it dried within seconds, no residue on my shirt, I woke up this morning, went out to work on my garden before taking a shower and it still did the job. It&#x27;s late afternoon now and it&#x27;s still working. I realize all our bodies are different and require different levels of protection but so far this product gets an A+</li>
            <li> Got a it free to try as part of a promotion.  I don&#x27;t usually like gel deodorant but so far I like this one. I did not get the powder scent the one I did get smells really good. Dried quick And lasted all day today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest ... I didn&#x27;t have high hopes. In fact, I waited for a day that I would be working around the house, so just in case this product was a let down, I could wash up and put on my favorite invisible solid. As soon as I opened the product, I was pleased - it smelt amazing! And I LOVE to smell fresh! I had expected for it to feel sticky and have trouble drying like all other clear gels I had tried. Nope! It dried almost immediately and felt no different than my invisible solid. I was dry and smelt fresh all day! I absolutely love this product and will definitely be recommending it.</li>
            <li> It smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothing, and is a very good price. Definitely recommend</li>
