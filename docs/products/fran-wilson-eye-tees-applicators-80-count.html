            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>The Eye Tees seem to have been improved and are better than ever!</li>
            <li>am sure glad I ordered  2 boxes!</li>
            <li>They are not as soft as QTips (which I still use for just underneath my eye to perfect eyeliner smudges).</li>
            <li>Glad to see them here.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they can be used for that.</li>
            <li>Glad we can purchase them at Amazon because she can no longer find them where she used to purchase them.</li>
            <li>They are much more than an applicator.</li>
            <li>It could be a bit more sturdy.  </li>
            <li>In order to maintain the precision you have to use more of them, which costs you even more.</li>
            <li>I love these Eye Tees.  </li>
            <li>I recommend every girl keeping these in her makeup bag :-)</li>
            <li>Love these cotton swabs.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love these eyeliner applicators.  </li>
            <li>and then I have to get more to place in another area and then use my fingers or a brush to blend it around.  </li>
            <li>The wide, flat end was perfect for what we needed, and the pointy end seems to be perfect for fine applications.</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love using these to clean up the nail polish mistakes while painting my nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok nothing special</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for correcting makeup smudges and smears, just a little dab in eye makeup remover to remove any mistakes while applying all of your makeup.</li>
            <li>Lipstick mistakes, dip in concealer or foundation and lightly apply to edges of lips, blend in.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic for make up application and corrections.  </li>
            <li>It is precise with the pointed tip and the rounded end in cleaning up any mistakes.</li>
            <li>Nothing now but Q-Tips and more Q-Tips, which just aren&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li>The flat end had more promise, but it is &amp;#34;stamped&amp;#34; onto the applicator stick, so that a good 50% of the surface area on both sides is recessed below the applicator surface.  </li>
            <li>I feel better that I can use a clean swab to blend my eye makeup; and the pointy end is great for fixing mascara, eyeliner and other makeup goofs.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the rounded edge as opposed to the pointed tip (which is exactly that - pointy</li>
            <li>I use these successfully to clean up mascara mistakes.</li>
            <li>But these allow me to clean the piercing on the surface and the inside without taking it out.</li>
            <li>use them to clean up mascara that has gone over or under my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Nice and firm, Good for make-up and cleaning my guns.</li>
            <li>There is a special about this product.</li>
            <li>these are so hard to find, excellent, just what we needed</li>
            <li>Best we have purchased so far, and worth the extra price.</li>
            <li>To be fair I have not used them to actually apply makeup.</li>
            <li>But overall a good price for what you get.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed fibers all over the place, hold their shape well, and are all around a good product I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>These are excellent for correcting mascara smudges, great for reducing the width of liquid eye-liner application and effecting a smooth line, and the cotton tips are hard packed and do not easily peel off or stick to eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found they&#x27;re also quite good for applying oralgel type products to your cheeks and gums using the flat side.</li>
            <li>I will use them to clean the tiny spaces on my stove top, but I will NOT be using them for my eye make up, which is why I purchased them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found they&#x27;re really great for other things around the house, such as applying glue, either applying a goodly amount using the flat side, or a more precise application using the pointed end.</li>
            <li>Great if you smudge a little eyeliner or get a mascara fleck on your cheek or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found they&#x27;re incredibly useful for cleaning piercings without removing them.</li>
            <li>It comes right off immediately where I put the applicator</li>
            <li>I thought they&#x27;d be really helpful in my makeup bag and how right I was!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these are great for dry applications, but otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>The Eye Tees are my favorite eye makeup applicators and quite simply, I can&#x27;t do without them.</li>
            <li>I get these for my wife because she finds them much better for eye makeup application than regular Q-Tips.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit concave, so it holds more product than you can using a regular cotton swab.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty steep for what they are.</li>
            <li>Not enough cushion on the ends, but work OK.</li>
            <li>First, the pointy end.  </li>
            <li>Well packaged, fast shipping... Will buy again from this company and would recommend to a friend !</li>
            <li>I DO NOT USE ANY OTHER KIND.</li>
            <li>electrical contact cleaning in conjuntion with certain contact cleaning liquids and sprays.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am ok with this product and would recommend them to a friend with the one caveat about the fibers coming loose.</li>
            <li>I find that these q-tips are helpful when trying to be as accurate as possible with makeup application.</li>
            <li>Even when I used them gently to spread eye shadow on my eyes they hurt.</li>
            <li>The makeup would stay on the applicator, no matter how much I put on it.  </li>
            <li>That means only 50% of the surface area is available to pick up and apply the makeup.  </li>
            <li>Really helps apply eyemakeup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strange how so simple a product can have so many uses!</li>
            <li>Can use small tip to clean up eyeliner mistakes easily.  </li>
            <li>I use these to remove the black smudges on my top eye-lid after applying mascara.  </li>
            <li>Just buy regular old cheap cotton swabs.</li>
            <li>I have an eye problem and need to limit the chance of infection as much as possible, so I thought it would be a good idea to buy disposable eye shadow applicators--use once and throw away, far less risk of infection and bacteria growing on an old applicator.  </li>
            <li>are good but hard to use in delicate zone of eyes because the material is very compact , i like to clean with this product some parts of my face.</li>
            <li>you take them out the less easily</li>
            <li>Regular q tips did not do the job because they weren&#x27;t precise enough.  </li>
            <li>So, since you can find anything on Amazon, I was able to search using general keywords and track these down.  </li>
            <li>Instead of using nail corrector pens, I am now using these to clean up cuticles and other nail polish mistakes.</li>
            <li>Guys - Great for cleaning hard to reach areas, ie, oil filter base, etc; a good garage tool</li>
            <li>/&gt;Center posts somewhat softer than the more&lt;br /&gt;firm posts that I use, but, so far are working well.&lt;br /&gt;Fair</li>
            <li>The tips aren&#x27;t soft which makes that even easier.</li>
            <li>They are soft without being fuzzy and leaving cotton around or in your eyes..</li>
            <li>I can use one for several days before throwing it away and switching to a new one.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean jewelry and it really gets in the small little areas on my engagement ring and wedding band.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for use on delicate eyelids, but it probably has other uses that I will explore now that I have so many of them.</li>
            <li>One end of the q-tip is pointed to help create straight lines on your eyes, while the other is flatter and larger for removing makeup from bigger areas.</li>

            <li> The tips aren&#x27;t soft which makes that even easier.</li>
            <li> They are soft without being fuzzy and leaving cotton around or in your eyes..</li>
            <li> I can use one for several days before throwing it away and switching to a new one.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean jewelry and it really gets in the small little areas on my engagement ring and wedding band.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for use on delicate eyelids, but it probably has other uses that I will explore now that I have so many of them.</li>
            <li> One end of the q-tip is pointed to help create straight lines on your eyes, while the other is flatter and larger for removing makeup from bigger areas.</li>
            <li> The pointed end only holds up for so long before it&#x27;s no longer pointed</li>
            <li> so i wont run out for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is just a long makeup Q-tip</li>
            <li> I have used them for a long time and do not know what I would do without them!</li>
            <li> WILL TELL OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THAT.ENJOY IT IN DAILY LIFE.</li>
            <li> I was previously using normal q-tips, and the cotton was so loose on them that it would come off in little fibers and get in my eyes / all over the place.  </li>
            <li> Overall, not terribly useful.</li>
            <li> I had some previously already slightly different then these</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also useful in a few cleaning applications where it&#x27;s tough to get into the cracks and corners.</li>
            <li> - you have to be careful not to poke yourself).</li>
            <li> The flattened end does not really stay flattened once wet.</li>
            <li> and you lose the precision (again, wet).</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t anything like what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Very hard, very sharp, very pointy.  </li>
            <li> I like these applicators because one end is pointed, the other round and flat like a paddle.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re doing anything with these wet, it&#x27;s not really worth it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> I know the less</li>
            <li> Seriously, I keep some of these in every bag and purse I have and in several places around the house.</li>
            <li> However, these are hard, not soft.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is sometimes a tiny cotton fiber comes loose from the end and gets caught in my eyelash or in my eye, which is irritating if I am in a hurry and irritating to my eye!  </li>
            <li> even so, I felt they were way too harsh.  </li>
            <li> if I ever get round to applying makeup; I&#x27;ll try it for that.</li>
            <li> They are a tool I use everyday.</li>
            <li> These applicators are just basically a &#x27;Q-Tip&#x27; with one flattened oval end and one very tiny skinny (useless) pointy end.</li>
            <li> that they have a pointy side for small adjustments and a flatter side for eye shadow</li>
            <li> I bought these to apply eye shadows but found that they were not suitable for that use.  </li>
            <li> Very scary near the eye.  </li>
            <li> As the description says they are very stiff and hard, you do not want to use these in your ears or you could cause damage.</li>
            <li> However, these applicators are WAY too hard.</li>
            <li> I use the pointed end to help apply the adhesive on my false eyelashes, also.</li>
            <li> and I found the pointed tip unraveled easily, so not ideal for perfecting eye shadow.</li>
            <li> They have little cotton fibers (hairs) that are annoying!</li>
            <li> They are extremely disappointing and I would NOT recommend them!</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> These are awful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use these successfully to clean up mascara mistakes. Hard to find locally. Glad to see them here.</li>
            <li> ULTA has stopped selling Eye Tees. Nothing now but Q-Tips and more Q-Tips, which just aren&#x27;t right for me. The Eye Tees are my favorite eye makeup applicators and quite simply, I can&#x27;t do without them.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t find these specialty cotton swabs locally anymore.  So, since you can find anything on Amazon, I was able to search using general keywords and track these down.  The wide, flat end was perfect for what we needed, and the pointy end seems to be perfect for fine applications.</li>
            <li> I use these to touch up my eyebrows.  I fill in my eyebrows with a shadow, and sometimes I need to touch it up.  Regular q tips did not do the job because they weren&#x27;t precise enough.  I love these!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, good quality, good price, good shipping.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for correcting makeup smudges and smears, just a little dab in eye makeup remover to remove any mistakes while applying all of your makeup. FYI.....the tip end of the swab is great for removing any material that has accumulated in the corners of the eye. Lipstick mistakes, dip in concealer or foundation and lightly apply to edges of lips, blend in. I carry some in my makeup bag in my purse just for that. Great stocking stuffers for the ladies! These makeup applicators, to me, are made for correcting flaws, haven&#x27;t used them to apply makeup but I&#x27;m sure they can be used for that. Couldn&#x27;t do makeup without them.&lt;br /&gt;Have recommended to all my friends.</li>
            <li> They are good for perfecting makeup lines, but I did have to get used to using them. They are not as soft as QTips (which I still use for just underneath my eye to perfect eyeliner smudges). I mostly use the rounded edge as opposed to the pointed tip (which is exactly that - pointy - you have to be careful not to poke yourself). To be fair I have not used them to actually apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the good reviews. I have an eye problem and need to limit the chance of infection as much as possible, so I thought it would be a good idea to buy disposable eye shadow applicators--use once and throw away, far less risk of infection and bacteria growing on an old applicator.  However, these applicators are WAY too hard. Even when I used them gently to spread eye shadow on my eyes they hurt. Part of my problem is scarring on my eyelid, so that may have contributed to it, but even so, I felt they were way too harsh.  Furthermore, they could not for the life of them grab the eyes hadow and then transfer it to my eyes.  The makeup would stay on the applicator, no matter how much I put on it.  I also didn&#x27;t like the scoop, because all of the eye shadow would go into the scoop and then, again, would not make it to my eyelid.  I would not recommend this product for use on delicate eyelids, but it probably has other uses that I will explore now that I have so many of them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have used them for a long time and do not know what I would do without them!</li>
            <li> I get these for my wife because she finds them much better for eye makeup application than regular Q-Tips.  Glad we can purchase them at Amazon because she can no longer find them where she used to purchase them.</li>
            <li> The Eye Tees seem to have been improved and are better than ever! Thanks! They are much more than an applicator. They are great for correcting/perfecting eyeliner. I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without them.</li>
            <li> Almost what I was looking for but not quite.&lt;br /&gt;Center posts somewhat softer than the more&lt;br /&gt;firm posts that I use, but, so far are working well.&lt;br /&gt;Fair bargain price, I think, have not had time to&lt;br /&gt;check &amp; compare prices.</li>
            <li> It could be a bit more sturdy.  But overall a good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> item came as described and timely.</li>
            <li> electrical contact cleaning in conjuntion with certain contact cleaning liquids and sprays. if I ever get round to applying makeup; I&#x27;ll try it for that.</li>
            <li> These are excellent for correcting mascara smudges, great for reducing the width of liquid eye-liner application and effecting a smooth line, and the cotton tips are hard packed and do not easily peel off or stick to eyelashes.  I have tried Q-tips, Swisspers, and others, but could not do without these Eye Tees - they are just the best to use around your eyes..</li>
            <li> I had no idea such a thing existed until I saw them. I thought they&#x27;d be really helpful in my makeup bag and how right I was! They have a hundred uses in makeup application and beyond. They&#x27;re great for blending eyeliner, correcting smudges, etc. I&#x27;ve also found they&#x27;re incredibly useful for cleaning piercings without removing them. I have a nose piercing that I adore. I try not to take it out unless it&#x27;s an emergency, since as a piercer myself I know the less you take them out the less easily they&#x27;ll become infected. But these allow me to clean the piercing on the surface and the inside without taking it out. I recommend them to my customers. I&#x27;ve found they&#x27;re also quite good for applying oralgel type products to your cheeks and gums using the flat side. It&#x27;s a bit concave, so it holds more product than you can using a regular cotton swab. I&#x27;ve also found they&#x27;re really great for other things around the house, such as applying glue, either applying a goodly amount using the flat side, or a more precise application using the pointed end. I use the pointed end to help apply the adhesive on my false eyelashes, also. They&#x27;re perfect to get a nice even bead of glue and great for pressing the lash into place with precision. Seriously, I keep some of these in every bag and purse I have and in several places around the house. It&#x27;s strange how so simple a product can have so many uses!</li>
            <li> great for fixing eyeliner and eyebrow.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to glide on the skin and I found the pointed tip unraveled easily, so not ideal for perfecting eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I did not buy these for makeup application. The price is pretty steep for what they are. If you&#x27;re doing anything with these wet, it&#x27;s not really worth it. The flattened end does not really stay flattened once wet. The pointed end only holds up for so long before it&#x27;s no longer pointed and you lose the precision (again, wet). In order to maintain the precision you have to use more of them, which costs you even more. I&#x27;m sure these are great for dry applications, but otherwise, don&#x27;t waste your money. Just buy regular old cheap cotton swabs.</li>
            <li> I love these Eye Tees.  I don&#x27;t use them to put on my eye makeup, but you definitely could.&lt;br /&gt;I use them to clean up mascara that has gone over or under my lashes.  They are perfect&lt;br /&gt;for this!</li>
            <li> these are so hard to find, excellent, just what we needed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this to apply make-up, but my mother-in-law does and she didn&#x27;t know how she lived without it before.  I use it to clean jewelry and it really gets in the small little areas on my engagement ring and wedding band.  It arrived on time and was packaged well.  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for what I wanted them for, nail clean up! The tips aren&#x27;t soft which makes that even easier.</li>
            <li> I bought these to apply eye shadows but found that they were not suitable for that use.  They don&#x27;t transfer it well.  I use them to neat/clean up excesses around the eyes instead.</li>
            <li> Great product for many uses</li>
            <li> perfect for eye makeup or nail polish correcting.  i tried these once and then bought the sixpack of them so i wont run out for a long time.</li>
            <li> I keep these in my makeup bag and use them as needed. Great if you smudge a little eyeliner or get a mascara fleck on your cheek or something. I recommend every girl keeping these in her makeup bag :-)</li>
            <li> There is a special about this product. It is just a long makeup Q-tip that&#x27;s all. It&#x27;s just ok nothing special</li>
            <li> Perfect for smudging eyeliner, and for correcting any mistakes in your makeup. Love these cotton swabs.</li>
            <li> Not enough cushion on the ends, but work OK.</li>
            <li> These are a staple in my makeup routine. I feel better that I can use a clean swab to blend my eye makeup; and the pointy end is great for fixing mascara, eyeliner and other makeup goofs. I always keep an extra box in reserve, so I always have some.</li>
            <li> These applicators are just basically a &#x27;Q-Tip&#x27; with one flattened oval end and one very tiny skinny (useless) pointy end. They have little cotton fibers (hairs) that are annoying! They aren&#x27;t anything like what I had expected. I will use them to clean the tiny spaces on my stove top, but I will NOT be using them for my eye make up, which is why I purchased them! They are extremely disappointing and I would NOT recommend them!</li>
            <li> are good but hard to use in delicate zone of eyes because the material is very compact , i like to clean with this product some parts of my face.</li>
            <li> Good as a makeup applicator to take for traveling and touch ups without using brushes.  I use it several times before throwing it away.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for makeup application or removal. As the description says they are very stiff and hard, you do not want to use these in your ears or you could cause damage. Work great for cleaning up that stray mascara or eyeliner spot.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL TELL OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THAT.ENJOY IT IN DAILY LIFE. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I use these for Makeup appiclation. I have used them for years, They are one of the best make up&lt;br /&gt;tool for many reason. I haghly recommend them</li>
            <li> I bought this for when I put on make up. I had some previously already slightly different then these but these were still good I like that they have a pointy side for small adjustments and a flatter side for eye shadow</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these, and I will probably use what I&#x27;ve got, but I won&#x27;t be buying them again.  First, the pointy end.  Very hard, very sharp, very pointy.  Very scary near the eye.  The flat end had more promise, but it is &amp;#34;stamped&amp;#34; onto the applicator stick, so that a good 50% of the surface area on both sides is recessed below the applicator surface.  That means only 50% of the surface area is available to pick up and apply the makeup.  Overall, not terribly useful.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic for make up application and corrections.  These help people like me fix all the mistakes I make when initially applying make up!</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. They are soft without being fuzzy and leaving cotton around or in your eyes.. They are a tool I use everyday.</li>
            <li> I use these to remove the black smudges on my top eye-lid after applying mascara.  I was previously using normal q-tips, and the cotton was so loose on them that it would come off in little fibers and get in my eyes / all over the place.  These do the job perfectly and do not unravel as you use them.  I can use one for several days before throwing it away and switching to a new one.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with purchase... Well packaged, fast shipping... Will buy again from this company and would recommend to a friend !</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! What an invention! The pointy end is perfect for removing mistakes. The paddle end is perfect for blending.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure glad I ordered  2 boxes!</li>
            <li> Really helps apply eyemakeup.  Can use small tip to clean up eyeliner mistakes easily.  Also good for fixing nail polish mistakes too.</li>
            <li> Best we have purchased so far, and worth the extra price. Would recommend to friends and family. Nice and firm, Good for make-up and cleaning my guns.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without these when applying eye makeup. They&#x27;re also useful in a few cleaning applications where it&#x27;s tough to get into the cracks and corners.</li>
            <li> These swabs are great for helping with eye makeup application.  It is precise with the pointed tip and the rounded end in cleaning up any mistakes.</li>
            <li> You will find a lot of ways to use these. I use them to correct mistakes in my face painting!</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliner applicators.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years and use them when I travel.  They are great!</li>
            <li> I like these applicators because one end is pointed, the other round and flat like a paddle.  The only thing I do not like is sometimes a tiny cotton fiber comes loose from the end and gets caught in my eyelash or in my eye, which is irritating if I am in a hurry and irritating to my eye!  Otherwise, I am ok with this product and would recommend them to a friend with the one caveat about the fibers coming loose.</li>
            <li> I love using these to clean up the nail polish mistakes while painting my nails. They are awesome!</li>
            <li> Guys - Great for cleaning hard to reach areas, ie, oil filter base, etc; a good garage tool</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT QTIPS. I DO NOT USE ANY OTHER KIND.</li>
            <li> Instead of using nail corrector pens, I am now using these to clean up cuticles and other nail polish mistakes. They don&#x27;t shed fibers all over the place, hold their shape well, and are all around a good product I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Works great for using with makeup and correcting mistakes, or use to apply</li>
            <li> Work great and do not leave fibers as cotton swabs often do.</li>
            <li> These are awful!  I bought these hoping to replace the cushy eye shadow applicators that had fallen apart that came with my eye shadow.  However, these are hard, not soft.  They hurt when rubbing them against my eyelids.  Also, the color does not even distribute with them.  It comes right off immediately where I put the applicator and then I have to get more to place in another area and then use my fingers or a brush to blend it around.  What a disappointment!  And, I have 80 of them!</li>
            <li> I find that these q-tips are helpful when trying to be as accurate as possible with makeup application. One end of the q-tip is pointed to help create straight lines on your eyes, while the other is flatter and larger for removing makeup from bigger areas.</li>
