            <li>so I am happy to find it online at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great price for this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great for healing skin after venous ulcer.</li>
            <li>This lotion works great for curing cracked heel problems.</li>
            <li>This is great for me.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lotions and cremes , and this is the best .</li>
            <li>but otherwise a great value and nice product.</li>
            <li>It works great and this is the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find.  </li>
            <li>While i believe Amlactin is a bit more potent/stronger, this lotion also does a great job at moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is JUST as good (maybe even a bit better) than the name brand stuff.</li>
            <li>It is just as good or better than Amlactin at keeping my KP away.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the money and excellent delivery by Perrigo even though it was ordered the last week before Christmas.</li>
            <li>Lactate Loation is a very good product, for itchy ,dry flakey skin, as good as percription, would buy Perrigo brand again.</li>
            <li>so I purchased 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>Lovely glowy skin is what you can expect.</li>
            <li>The lotion does moisturize well, but doesn&#x27;t soften the skin as many claim.</li>
            <li>This is what I get for being cheap!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was using Lac-Hydrin 12% for almost 8 years and love it, but the RX price kept going up and</li>
            <li>AmLactin would be a better buy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the others are any better</li>
            <li>The Lac-Hydrin 5 from Ranbaxy absorbs much better and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>so I love fragrance.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I have this skin condition called Keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it&#x27;s available without a prescription.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about four months, purchased two bottles first and just ordered three more!  </li>
            <li>5% is more than adequate and does the job.</li>
            <li>I had been paying $18.00 to get it filled at the pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>My face felt smooth after a day or so of use.</li>
            <li>In fact, Ammonium Lactate is the ammonium salt of lactic acid originally known asc Lac-hydrin.</li>
            <li>My KP is severe and covers large portions of my limbs so the amount you get in this bottle allowed me to use more without the fear of running out in a week.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>While I am sure there are better detectives, the medication sold by Perrigo is for Prescription only and does not look like the product listed.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help much and it strong odor.</li>
            <li>This lotion really help smooth my skin.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had a fresh scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly effective to erase unsightly bleamishes, dry patches on the skin, it have been known to sting, but it you use this lotion sparingly, you really should be fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, but when you put it on (I do it right after a shower)</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, it heals chapped dry cracked skin within the first use .</li>
            <li>bottle exactly matches the prescription I have been using for years.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, clear</li>
            <li>Keeps the backs of my arms smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for saving me money and time!</li>
            <li>so far, some bumps have gone away and my skin feels really smooth after using this.</li>
            <li>Lac Hydrin kept my feet smooth and not dry at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for almost 20 years seems to keep the dry skin to a minimum what more can I say.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter however has a mild case of KP with only the bumps and no redness and this has helped her case significantly.</li>
            <li>You really have to read descriptions and pay attention to price per ounce and check if shipping charges apply.</li>
            <li>Ammonium Lactate Lotion 12percent, made that skin smoothe and really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try the real thing nex time.</li>
            <li>Am Lactin works very well as does Lac Hydrin.  </li>
            <li>really helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The formula contains too much glycerin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for the soft skin that goes with it.  </li>
            <li>But yeah, this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>This lotion makes my skin soft but as other reviews have stated, it goes on kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li>It is available only as a prescription where I live.</li>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful, especially for less than half the price of AmLaction.</li>
            <li>comes in such a generic bottle, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would.&lt;br /&gt;Newsflash-</li>
            <li>I got this mainly because i thought it wouldhelp with my KP.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday and you will be so smooth!</li>
            <li>The extra cost is worth it for either one.  </li>
            <li>I put some of this lotion on and it just feels like normal skin.  </li>
            <li>Most lotions I have tried over the years are either too greasy, too waxy or too ineffective, especially during the dry winter season.</li>
            <li>my prescription ran out and I was about to go to the Dr. and get a new one when I decided to just check Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The bottles I received were exactly the same as my prescription.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly the same as what I got at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Actually my dermatologist geve me my first bottle</li>
            <li>Not saying the bumps have disappeared, but they are a lot less &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; and noticeable, and my arms feel better overall.</li>
            <li>I did have some heavy flaking but that was fine with me.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see it offered here.  </li>
            <li>If one wants an exfoliation of the upper skin layer I believe just using lactic acid (at a strength depending on skin type)</li>
            <li>So this is by far the closest I&#x27;ve come to my RX</li>
            <li>and my skin looks young again.  </li>
            <li>if you have this condition like me, id recommend following the directions with using this product twice a day everyday for better results.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for my hands and my upper arms which are really dry and rough.</li>
            <li>It is the only lotion that leaves my hands feeling &#x27;normal&#x27; after application.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion because I have eczema and my calves are always dry, scaly and bumpy.</li>
            <li>Ammonium lactate is the only thing that helps clear the pores on the back of my arms.</li>
            <li>it can sometimes sting when i put it on my face for old acne scars but it has smooth them, making them appear less harsh.</li>
            <li>I like this product--it works well for extremely dry skin (old age and Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome).  </li>
            <li>Ive had KP for decades and have tried rx creams which worked but the little amount that i would get, the referral and pharmacy process was getting too much for my severe KP.</li>

            <li> Ive had KP for decades and have tried rx creams which worked but the little amount that i would get, the referral and pharmacy process was getting too much for my severe KP.</li>
            <li> , it just doesn&#x27;t last as long, but does seem to last longer than Amlactin..</li>
            <li> (me, anyway) from dry skin and such.  </li>
            <li> I went to the dermatologist with chronic dry skin disease caused by diabetes and the lotion simply works for my Ichthyosis Vulgaris.</li>
            <li> , your skin is no longer dry or flaky and it lasts until the next day when you shower again.  </li>
            <li> So I guess the theory is that low levels of acid applied to the skin softens it and eventually breaks down those obnoxious little keratin plugs (the little brown &amp;#34;hair bumbs&amp;#34;) and allows them to be exfoliated (I use Le Edge) to release the hairs, soften the skin, and allow the plugs to be scrubbed off over time.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has terribly dry skin and the dermatologist recommended this lotion.</li>
            <li> so u know I have dry feet and heels.  </li>
            <li> I usually give it a minute to dry before completely getting dressed and that takes away from the stick factor.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this lotion for my rough, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days (avoiding forehead area now).    </li>
            <li> I noticed less hang nails and dry heels after using this product.  </li>
            <li> in some form or other.  </li>
            <li> Have used Lac Hydrin for years but thought I would try this due to the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks once a day every other day.</li>
            <li> It works very well, but does leave the areas feeling tacky for a while after application and there is a faint odor to it</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to be working on my keratosis --- slowly, and I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t been using it as regularly as I should have.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to others especially those who live in cold climates.</li>
            <li> what my insurance will pay kept going down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about all of that, my skin does seem less dry and softer but this stuff is HEAVY and GREASY!</li>
            <li> I typically use AmLactin</li>
            <li> I could dig further but this is enough for me to be wary with my health.    </li>
            <li> I am 73 and was getting the slightly wrinkley skin under my forearms and did not like it at all.  </li>
            <li> That what ill be doing instead of my normal routine from now on.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it or a little over 3 weeks</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks, you&#x27;ll notice your skin will being to feel baby smooth/soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> but dont waste your money it doesnt work.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit like ammonia, but the smell goes away after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find locally</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda thick, but works wonders for acne/bumpy skin.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve got a ton of kids, I DON&#x27;T have a ton of time for lotioning, and of course, the downside to that are those weird, little bumps you get on your arms and legs</li>
            <li> I was told this type of lotion would help KP, but unfortunately it made mine way worse.</li>
            <li> I had terrible skin and this lotion does wonders in clearing up the bumps I get on my back and arms.</li>
            <li> With the winter being just around the corner you can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing this lotion.</li>
            <li> , I thought I just had weird skin.  </li>
            <li> False advertisement!</li>
            <li> It covers my arms and my legs and seriously looks bad.</li>
            <li> It may work, but It&#x27;s grossly heavy and feels disgusting on my skin, your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I had a winter itch on my hips and legs that was driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li> I was scratching until my skin was getting bloody.  </li>
            <li> Maybe in the winter it won&#x27;t feel so awful, but I won&#x27;t be using it ever again on the summer months.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was told this type of lotion would help KP, but unfortunately it made mine way worse. My 3 year old daughter however has a mild case of KP with only the bumps and no redness and this has helped her case significantly.</li>
            <li> The picture shows the name brand, but actually a generic brand was sent. False advertisement! The generic brand doesn&#x27;t work as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Every article I read about skin nowadays seem to recommend Ammonium Lactate lotion, cream, etc. in some form or other.  It works great and this is the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find.  You really have to read descriptions and pay attention to price per ounce and check if shipping charges apply.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over two years.  It is available only as a prescription where I live. I could not get the 12% solution without one.  I was surprised to see it offered here.  I had been paying $18.00 to get it filled at the pharmacy.  Lucky for me my prescription ran out and I was about to go to the Dr. and get a new one when I decided to just check Amazon.  Imagine my surprise to find it!  Plus I save the $35.00 Dr visit copay and $8 per bottle.  The bottles I received were exactly the same as my prescription.  Once again Amazon has saved me money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle exactly matches the prescription I have been using for years.  It is exactly the same as what I got at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I am 75 years old and have skin that is rough and scaley.  Ammonium Lactate Lotion 12percent, made that skin smoothe and really worked for me.  Actually my dermatologist geve me my first bottle and it worked well, so I purchased 2 more bottles.  I have recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> I think omitting the \\&quot;light\\&quot; mineral oil would be a help. I got the product to remove scaley areas and white heads on forehead. The mineral oil tends to sit on the surface of the skin and never soak in.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days (avoiding forehead area now).    If one wants an exfoliation of the upper skin layer I believe just using lactic acid (at a strength depending on skin type) You will definitely get a peeling of the skin removing the rough upper surface, (then apply a water based moisturizer) so far with this product I don&#x27;t see that happening, but I&#x27;ll give it another week or so.</li>
            <li> Ammonium lactate is the only thing that helps clear the pores on the back of my arms. I was pleased to find it&#x27;s available without a prescription.&lt;br /&gt;To prevent repeated acid exposure to my hands, I keep a plastic sandwich bag with the lotion. I put my hand in the bag, then squeeze a bit of lotion on the bag, then spread.</li>
            <li> My daughter has terribly dry skin and the dermatologist recommended this lotion. It works wonders and she loves that it is not greasy</li>
            <li> I had terrible skin and this lotion does wonders in clearing up the bumps I get on my back and arms. I use it with eucerin lotion, it works well together to kick skin moist.</li>
            <li> Most lotions I have tried over the years are either too greasy, too waxy or too ineffective, especially during the dry winter season. Amonium lactate lotion was recommended by a pharmacist years ago because of its Ph balance. It is the only lotion that leaves my hands feeling &#x27;normal&#x27; after application. It is difficult to find locally so I am happy to find it online at Amazon.</li>
            <li> But cheaper. If you&#x27;ve ever used Amlactin, the results you&#x27;ll get from this lotion will seem almost identical. While i believe Amlactin is a bit more potent/stronger, this lotion also does a great job at moisturizing the skin. With the winter being just around the corner you can&#x27;t go wrong with purchasing this lotion. After using this for a few weeks, you&#x27;ll notice your skin will being to feel baby smooth/soft.</li>
            <li> I typically use AmLactin but I wanted to try this because it was cheaper. It is JUST as good (maybe even a bit better) than the name brand stuff. My skin feels amazing! When I received this in the mail, it was actually 14 oz, not 8. This stuff is wonderful, especially for less than half the price of AmLaction.</li>
            <li> Lovely glowy skin is what you can expect. I did have some heavy flaking but that was fine with me. My skin is smooth, clear and I get compliments all the time now. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> While I am sure there are better detectives, the medication sold by Perrigo is for Prescription only and does not look like the product listed.  I am not sure is this being sold illegally or or not what is stated on the label.  Continued good luck for those who like it!    In fact, Ammonium Lactate is the ammonium salt of lactic acid originally known asc Lac-hydrin. I could dig further but this is enough for me to be wary with my health.    [...]    [...]</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. I have KP and this works on my arms. Use it everyday and you will be so smooth!</li>
            <li> Did not see the same results as everyone else. The lotion does moisturize well, but doesn&#x27;t soften the skin as many claim. I mostly use it for my hands and my upper arms which are really dry and rough. Been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t seen results. I read this is the generic version of Amlactin. Maybe I&#x27;ll try the real thing nex time. This is what I get for being cheap! Gave it 3 stars because it does moisturixe, but it doesn&#x27;t soften or exfoliate as AHA should.</li>
            <li> I like this product--it works well for extremely dry skin (old age and Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome).  I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; but one of my dogs LOVES it.  She follows me around trying to lick my arms and legs.  HELP!!!!</li>
            <li> Great price for this stuff.  I love it.  Now that I&#x27;ve got a ton of kids, I DON&#x27;T have a ton of time for lotioning, and of course, the downside to that are those weird, little bumps you get on your arms and legs (me, anyway) from dry skin and such.  I use this stuff daily for two weeks and they disappear and then I just keep up with regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I was using Lac-Hydrin 12% for almost 8 years and love it, but the RX price kept going up and what my insurance will pay kept going down. So this is by far the closest I&#x27;ve come to my RX, it just doesn&#x27;t last as long, but does seem to last longer than Amlactin..</li>
            <li> Great for healing skin after venous ulcer. Good value for the money and excellent delivery by Perrigo even though it was ordered the last week before Christmas.</li>
            <li> AmLactin would be a better buy.  Have used Lac Hydrin for years but thought I would try this due to the price.  Doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  Lac Hydrin kept my feet smooth and not dry at all.  I am a senior citizen so u know I have dry feet and heels.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  Am Lactin works very well as does Lac Hydrin.  The extra cost is worth it for either one.  Plus this bottle came WITHOUT an expiration date.</li>
            <li> Ive had skin issues for quite some time, and this lotion really helped.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in such a generic bottle, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would.&lt;br /&gt;Newsflash- don&#x27;t judge a book or a bottle by its cover or label!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the KP on my upper arms. It works...got rid of all the bumps but its so so so greasy feeling. Yuck. Maybe in the winter it won&#x27;t feel so awful, but I won&#x27;t be using it ever again on the summer months.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion because I have eczema and my calves are always dry, scaly and bumpy. This lotion really help smooth my skin.  it can sometimes sting when i put it on my face for old acne scars but it has smooth them, making them appear less harsh.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat Keritosis Pilaris, which I recently discovered I have...I never knew this was a condition, I thought I just had weird skin.  So I guess the theory is that low levels of acid applied to the skin softens it and eventually breaks down those obnoxious little keratin plugs (the little brown &amp;#34;hair bumbs&amp;#34;) and allows them to be exfoliated (I use Le Edge) to release the hairs, soften the skin, and allow the plugs to be scrubbed off over time.  I don&#x27;t know about all of that, my skin does seem less dry and softer but this stuff is HEAVY and GREASY! I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I will see it through to the end of the bottle, but I&#x27;ll never buy it again.  It may work, but It&#x27;s grossly heavy and feels disgusting on my skin, your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I could not use this for its intended purpose. I don&#x27;t know if the others are any better but this is way too greasy. The formula contains too much glycerin. Even after several hours you still stick to your clothing or bedsheet. I had to throw it away. The Lac-Hydrin 5 from Ranbaxy absorbs much better and is not greasy at all. In addition it does not have the parabens, a suspect carcinogen. 5% is more than adequate and does the job. Ranbaxy also used to make a 12% but it is also greasy and has parabens. Lac-Hydrin 5 is the best!</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin soft but as other reviews have stated, it goes on kind of sticky.  I usually give it a minute to dry before completely getting dressed and that takes away from the stick factor.  It&#x27;s worth it for the soft skin that goes with it.  I wish it had a fresh scent but I&#x27;m a scent junkie so I love fragrance.  I noticed less hang nails and dry heels after using this product.  The directions state to apply twice daily but I never do, once is enough for me.  I should try it twice a day to see if I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about four months, purchased two bottles first and just ordered three more!  It is just as good or better than Amlactin at keeping my KP away.  Keeps the backs of my arms smooth and soft.  I have only used this on my arms but will try it on my feet and hands next.  Thanks to Amazon for saving me money and time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for almost 20 years seems to keep the dry skin to a minimum what more can I say.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I use it on my face at night and after I use an at home salicylic/glycolic face peel. It&#x27;s kinda thick, but works wonders for acne/bumpy skin. My face felt smooth after a day or so of use. I tried buying the CVS brand when I ran out and it&#x27;s not the same. I would definitely try this if you suffer from acne or such and have tried everything.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it heals chapped dry cracked skin within the first use . I would recommend it to others especially those who live in cold climates.</li>
            <li> Lactate Loation is a very good product, for itchy ,dry flakey skin, as good as percription, would buy Perrigo brand again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I went to the dermatologist with chronic dry skin disease caused by diabetes and the lotion simply works for my Ichthyosis Vulgaris.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great for curing cracked heel problems. Just apply to your feet every day and it solves the problem.</li>
            <li> Ive had KP for decades and have tried rx creams which worked but the little amount that i would get, the referral and pharmacy process was getting too much for my severe KP. So based on the reviews i figured id give it a shot. This is great for me. My KP is severe and covers large portions of my limbs so the amount you get in this bottle allowed me to use more without the fear of running out in a week. It works very well, but does leave the areas feeling tacky for a while after application and there is a faint odor to it but otherwise a great value and nice product.</li>
            <li> this lotion sits on the skin and never drys or obsorbs into the skin.  i was sticky for hours.  will not order again</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast on this product however when  i recieved the bottle it seemed like there was lotion missing. Ive been using it or a little over 3 weeks and it works okay. it keeps your skin moisurized for a maybe 4 hours. I got this mainly because i thought it wouldhelp with my KP. but dont waste your money it doesnt work.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this lotion. It&#x27;s highly effective to erase unsightly bleamishes, dry patches on the skin, it have been known to sting, but it you use this lotion sparingly, you really should be fine.</li>
            <li> I had a winter itch on my hips and legs that was driving me crazy.  I was scratching until my skin was getting bloody.  I began using this and almost immediately had relief.  It smells a bit like ammonia, but the smell goes away after a few minutes.  It atually hydrates your skin and makes it feel moist.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but when you put it on (I do it right after a shower), your skin is no longer dry or flaky and it lasts until the next day when you shower again.  I am 73 and was getting the slightly wrinkley skin under my forearms and did not like it at all.  I started using this and my skin looks young again.  My husband gets a flakey head often.  I put some of this lotion on and it just feels like normal skin.  No flakes.  Great stuff.  I bought six bottles so I wouldn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has Keratosis Pilaris and she used for awhile. Didn&#x27;t help much and it strong odor.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to be working on my keratosis --- slowly, and I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t been using it as regularly as I should have.  When I use it regularly, it definitely helps.  Not saying the bumps have disappeared, but they are a lot less &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; and noticeable, and my arms feel better overall.</li>
            <li> This is the generic for Amlactic, with the same ingredient.  I use it every day on all four limbs and especially the feet.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have this skin condition called Keratosis pilaris. It covers my arms and my legs and seriously looks bad. I&#x27;ve always been embarrassed to show my arms &amp; legs because of it. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks once a day every other day. Its been working okay so far, some bumps have gone away and my skin feels really smooth after using this. if you have this condition like me, id recommend following the directions with using this product twice a day everyday for better results. That what ill be doing instead of my normal routine from now on. But yeah, this stuff really does work. Try it!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this lotion for my rough, dry skin. I&#x27;ve tried many lotions and cremes , and this is the best .</li>
