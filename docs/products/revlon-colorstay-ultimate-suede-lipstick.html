            <li>Awesome pic.</li>
            <li>this is a great colr !</li>
            <li>Perfect lipstick for my skin</li>
            <li>Wonderful color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s application alone might make it superior to the Overtime line!  </li>
            <li>Stays on and looks great</li>
            <li>this color is great even on me .</li>
            <li>the color looks great with my skin tone great winter shade.  </li>
            <li>Great name,</li>
            <li>They had some great colors, so I had to grab one (at Walgreens, where they are returnable if you don&#x27;t like them, so no</li>
            <li>:) The Supermodel color is perfect for what I was wanting - kind of an enhanced mauvish nude.</li>
            <li>When Revlon came out with their original ColorStay Overtime line many years ago I had found the best.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this color!  </li>
            <li>This lipstick certainly fills the bill, and the color is wonderful!</li>
            <li>The colors are wonderful and are very pigmented and flattering.</li>
            <li>The color is nice and it stays on for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used it but duo much more reasonable on here and great service!</li>
            <li>Love the product and love the color!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I liked Backstage so much, I thought I&#x27;d try this one, and I&#x27;m just as happy with it.</li>
            <li>hopefully, that will get better results.</li>
            <li>I love this product .....</li>
            <li>Love this stick, one of my favorites</li>
            <li>I love the SUPERMODEL and CATWALL, but you can not tell by the name and sometimes by the look of the shade online just what color it will be.</li>
            <li>I love it it stays on your lips and</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick</li>
            <li>also any glosses on top do sort of ruin the length of wear</li>
            <li>absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>Make sure to let it sit a while after applying before eating, drinking, etc.</li>
            <li>However, this one is okay</li>
            <li>this is the best long wear lip stick ive ever used.  </li>
            <li>It goes on SO EASILY.  </li>
            <li>A beautiful brownish mauve that goes on nicely and lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li>It is a great color for me, not real obvious yet gives color to my lips.  </li>
            <li>Not a fan of the color, but felt smooth during application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light on the lips.  </li>
            <li>I love Revlon Colorstay because it lasts without drying out your lips, and this color in particular is stunning.</li>
            <li>They look great and shiny once they are on, then after some time they start to dry out.</li>
            <li>this still looks great on and if i let it dry for 10 mins from application there</li>
            <li>bright white</li>
            <li>Then I tried the one and love it so much I am going to keep them both.  </li>
            <li>Super model is purpleish with brownish undertone.</li>
            <li>I already had this lipstick in the Backstage color (a gorgeous, go-with-everything deep red) and love it!</li>
            <li>the color lasts pretty well but the texture turns sticky after a smooth and creamy application.</li>
            <li>I wanted a good lipstick that I didn&#x27;t have to reapply all day long - whose got time for that?  </li>
            <li>the stickiness lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new to finding lipsticks that will compliment my features (blonde hair, blue/grey eyes and paleish skin) and this looks great on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any success with &amp;#34;stay all day&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Lovely color, goes on smoothly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I generally add some lip gloss over the top.</li>
            <li>and I simply put it on very lightly.</li>
            <li>I have fair to medium skin tone thats a little yellowish.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something i could throw on and be content and know it would still look good a few hours later without touching up.</li>
            <li>This lipstick feels great and does last much much longer than regular lipstick</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading some positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very white , light skinned .</li>
            <li>what i eat or how much i lick my lips.</li>
            <li>I put it on once in the morning and do not have to reapply unless I eat something really greasy.</li>
            <li>i have a summer tan , tan for my pastey pale bright white , and this color goes well with any shade my skin decides to be .</li>
            <li>So far: I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It glides on just like normal lipstick but sets in just a minute or two.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, yesterday I saw Revlon had launched a new product in this line:</li>
            <li>The color really does last all day.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I got some old product.</li>
            <li>It really is long lasting but it gets pretty dry and sticky pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty but the lipstick is very dry .</li>
            <li>Anyway, it didn&#x27;t last as long as expected, but still a pretty decent lipstick.</li>
            <li>I will be back later to tell you how it takes a day at work, with all the coffee and yapping and sarcastic smiling!  </li>
            <li>It is not really long lasting</li>

            <li> It is not really long lasting</li>
            <li> the regular colorstay actually stayed on too long ....</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as colorstay regular lipstick.....</li>
            <li> but it does stay on long enough.....</li>
            <li> Its definitely matt but not over dry.  </li>
            <li> Stays on a long time, maybe not 12 hours</li>
            <li> Once it sets, it&#x27;s a bit dry, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> s no need for a single touch up no matter</li>
            <li> Lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t feel dry!</li>
            <li> My only thing is after a while it feels dry and a little sticky in a  way all I can say is wear chap stick before you apply this</li>
            <li> It does feel a little dry once it&#x27;s been on for just a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> I continued to try other brands of long wearing lipstick, but none of them compared in quality and duration to ColorStay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive for a drug store brand but 100% worth the price.</li>
            <li> The only negative is I paid just under 8.00 ea</li>
            <li> I dont typically carry around lipgloss</li>
            <li> They always seem to come across as slightly darker than anticipated.</li>
            <li> A little addiction, you might think?  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, it is the same color as my lips and doesn&#x27;t give me any color.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s subtle and yet slightly brightening to the face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that... earthy subtle reddish mauve shade</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought thousands of lipsticks in my life, I&#x27;m not proud to say.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to match up on lipsticks.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m disappointed with the color</li>
            <li> Then it looks terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Revlon Colorstay because it lasts without drying out your lips, and this color in particular is stunning. Awesome pic.</li>
            <li> The color really does last all day.</li>
            <li> Stays on and looks great</li>
            <li> i was really hoping this could be an everyday color for me. keyword being color. unfortunately, it is the same color as my lips and doesn&#x27;t give me any color. i&#x27;m disappointed with the color and i thought it would last longer than it did. then again, since there was no difference of color with my lips, perhaps i just didn&#x27;t notice it was still on. anyway, i will try this out again in a darker color. hopefully, that will get better results.</li>
            <li> I love this product .....it doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as colorstay regular lipstick.....but it does stay on long enough.....I like the feel of it ......the regular colorstay actually stayed on too long ....all night ...next morning</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading some positive reviews.  I wanted a good lipstick that I didn&#x27;t have to reapply all day long - whose got time for that?  Anyway, it didn&#x27;t last as long as expected, but still a pretty decent lipstick.</li>
            <li> Love this stick, one of my favorites</li>
            <li> The colors are terrific, it last all day and beyond, and it&#x27;s made by REVLON.  If I could say that  there was one &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; , it would be the shade names do not denote color.  I love the SUPERMODEL and CATWALL, but you can not tell by the name and sometimes by the look of the shade online just what color it will be.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty but the lipstick is very dry . Hurts to put it on my lips. Perhaps I got some old product.</li>
            <li> It really is long lasting but it gets pretty dry and sticky pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Lovely color, goes on smoothly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love it it stays on your lips and not anything else example the coffee cup! My only thing is after a while it feels dry and a little sticky in a  way all I can say is wear chap stick before you apply this it helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I had accidentally clicked on this twice and ordered 2 by mistake, so I called amazon and they said no problem just send it back and they would refund it.  Then I tried the one and love it so much I am going to keep them both.  It is a great color for me, not real obvious yet gives color to my lips.  Stays on a long time, maybe not 12 hours but in a day I might only apply twice.  Can seem drying but I just put chapstick over it if it does.  The only negative is I paid just under 8.00 ea and they are sold at Walmart for that price.  Now I see they are selling for 2.70, if I didn&#x27;t have 2 already I&#x27;d by another one and I still might. Love the product and love the color!</li>
            <li> this is a great colr ! i&#x27;m very white , light skinned . bright white my husband says . this color is great even on me . in my opinion it will go with any complection ! i have a summer tan , tan for my pastey pale bright white , and this color goes well with any shade my skin decides to be .</li>
            <li> I work all day, and prefer to have a bit of color on my lips.  Keeping them moisturized is also a challenge.  I also wanted to avoid a two-step lip color.  This lipstick certainly fills the bill, and the color is wonderful!</li>
            <li> The colors are wonderful and are very pigmented and flattering. They look great and shiny once they are on, then after some time they start to dry out. Then it looks terrible.I dont typically carry around lipgloss that i can just pop over this, which would probably be the only way i would wear this. I was looking for something i could throw on and be content and know it would still look good a few hours later without touching up. This is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick I&#x27;ve always used it but duo much more reasonable on here and great service! Lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t feel dry!</li>
            <li> It is not really long lasting</li>
            <li> This lipstick feels great and does last much much longer than regular lipstick</li>
            <li> this is the best long wear lip stick ive ever used.  Expensive for a drug store brand but 100% worth the price. Super model is purpleish with brownish undertone. I have fair to medium skin tone thats a little yellowish. the color looks great with my skin tone great winter shade.  Its definitely matt but not over dry.  I have lips like Angelina Jolie in the sence they are always like wrinkly.  this still looks great on and if i let it dry for 10 mins from application theres no need for a single touch up no matter what i eat or how much i lick my lips. also any glosses on top do sort of ruin the length of wear</li>
            <li> absolutely love this color. I&#x27;m still new to finding lipsticks that will compliment my features (blonde hair, blue/grey eyes and paleish skin) and this looks great on me.</li>
            <li> A beautiful brownish mauve that goes on nicely and lasts a few hours. Make sure to let it sit a while after applying before eating, drinking, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to match up on lipsticks. They always seem to come across as slightly darker than anticipated. However, this one is okay and I simply put it on very lightly.</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick.  The color is nice and it stays on for quite a while.  It does feel a little dry once it&#x27;s been on for just a short period of time.  I generally add some lip gloss over the top.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last like advertised</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the color, but felt smooth during application.</li>
            <li> the color lasts pretty well but the texture turns sticky after a smooth and creamy application. the stickiness lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> Perfect lipstick for my skin and it stays longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought thousands of lipsticks in my life, I&#x27;m not proud to say.  A little addiction, you might think?  When Revlon came out with their original ColorStay Overtime line many years ago I had found the best.  I continued to try other brands of long wearing lipstick, but none of them compared in quality and duration to ColorStay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, yesterday I saw Revlon had launched a new product in this line: Ultimate Suede.  Great name, no?  They had some great colors, so I had to grab one (at Walgreens, where they are returnable if you don&#x27;t like them, so no risk).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this color!  It&#x27;s that... earthy subtle reddish mauve shade that&#x27;s subtle and yet slightly brightening to the face.  It goes on SO EASILY.  It&#x27;s application alone might make it superior to the Overtime line!  It goes on like a regular lipstick (something I miss with a wand, why?  who knows!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light on the lips.  I will be back later to tell you how it takes a day at work, with all the coffee and yapping and sarcastic smiling!  So far: I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful color. The picture does not do it justice. I usually need to line my lips first &amp; with this I did not need to.</li>
            <li> I already had this lipstick in the Backstage color (a gorgeous, go-with-everything deep red) and love it! I constantly get compliments on it. I&#x27;ve never had any success with &amp;#34;stay all day&amp;#34; lipsticks, but this one does truly last! I put it on once in the morning and do not have to reapply unless I eat something really greasy. Yay! It glides on just like normal lipstick but sets in just a minute or two. Once it sets, it&#x27;s a bit dry, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I liked Backstage so much, I thought I&#x27;d try this one, and I&#x27;m just as happy with it. :) The Supermodel color is perfect for what I was wanting - kind of an enhanced mauvish nude.</li>
