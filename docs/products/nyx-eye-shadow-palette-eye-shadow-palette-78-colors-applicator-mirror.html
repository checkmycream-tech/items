            <li>The shadows have really good pigmentation (even better with primer).</li>
            <li>The palette does come with it&#x27;s own applicators</li>
            <li>but I do use my own brushes.</li>
            <li>there are so many colors to create a variety of looks, nice sized mirror for application, and nice pigmentation of colors (always use a primer/base to wake up eyeshadows).</li>

            <li>NYX products are cheap and quite good.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this!</li>
            <li>Let me just first thank Misspinkcat and Amazon for their exceptional product, packaging, and customer service!</li>
            <li>The blues and purples are beautiful and very pigmented and I am pleased with both.    </li>
            <li>NYX is my favorite make-up.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>The palette is mostly shimmer and frosty shadows (which I prefer) there are some matte and glitter (fewer matte than glitter).    </li>
            <li>Its an ok palette</li>
            <li>I discovered Nyx makeup from a friend who uses more drug store makeup than department store makeup.</li>
            <li>I love it)</li>
            <li>but I am sure you can use them as eyeshadows</li>
            <li>(There are so many colors in this</li>
            <li>The quality of the colors and the variety is amazing for how cheap this thing is.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors....</li>
            <li>Now when people refer to these products as \\&quot;crack\\&quot; or \\&quot;magic dust,\\&quot; they&#x27;re not kidding.  </li>
            <li>Glides on perfect, with a variety of colors, and last all day!</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I&#x27;m hooked now, saving a fortune and continue to be impressed with the quality and versatility of these products, the kits are as big as they look don&#x27;t be fooled!</li>
            <li>Love this product,  I lost mine in aruba and trying to get another one.  </li>
            <li>but i was ok</li>
            <li>It has more colors than you would need, but it&#x27;s fun if you like to play with make-up!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase that I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look fabulous.</li>
            <li>yet when I mixed with a darker brown I get a beautiful color which I am really pleased with.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not a problem because it is a lot of eyeshadows and offers great variety.</li>
            <li>I received this palette the other day and it was in perfect condition!</li>
            <li>she is a happy camper and we will most likely purchase again</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase it out does any other eye shadow product I have bought!</li>
            <li>It was very easy to load my brush, which obviously says the quality was good.</li>
            <li>There are several shinny colors and a few mattes ones, but the colors are really nice (I was especially pleased by how bright the fucsia one was...</li>
            <li>They have wonderful pigment and I change my eye makeup to what I&#x27;m wearing everyday.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a complete make-up kit with the works (bright colors, product quality, price, &amp; versatility).</li>
            <li>, always make my lips feel smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Plus, great colors and will last forever!</li>
            <li>Added Bonus: Free Lipgloss</li>
            <li>The colors are amazing and even with the size (about a dime each) they work very well.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money :)  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!!!  </li>
            <li>I was excited, but nervous because of the reviews I had read about shattered</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of new in makeup (no makeup artist..</li>
            <li>These shadows that I have tried (yellows, golds, bronzes, greens, browns, and blacks) go on very smooth and blend very well.</li>
            <li>I did swatches of many of the colors and they are very pigmented</li>
            <li>(Full size versions of colors in the palette)</li>
            <li>I bought this palette around July or August of this year and for the most part I really like it.</li>
            <li>She really loves this makeup kit as she has so many choices...</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a GREAT value for the price</li>
            <li>once I stepped outside the golds were quite pigmented and I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
            <li>Still worth it though</li>
            <li>Good selection of colors and not much shine.  </li>
            <li>Will have fun trying out all the colors.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely recommend this product, well worth the money!</li>
            <li>If you are new to makeup or just want quality at a fair price definitely go with this!</li>
            <li>The Eyeshadow palette arrived within the expected days, and I was very pleased with the state it arrived.</li>
            <li>This Product was ok, i was looking for Colors to pop a little more.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced though so</li>
            <li>the colors are vibrant with a true pigment aspect.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this palette and also suggest purchasing real eyeshadow brushes instead of the cheap applicators that come with the palette.</li>
            <li>A little bit of variety, fun colors, not too much investment, and good quality.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was satisfied with the colors but one of the colors cracked so some of the powder spilled into the color next to it.</li>
            <li>and I knew exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Love glitter, just can&#x27;t get enough of it?</li>
            <li>, i could have found better in stors locally</li>
            <li>I also found that most of the eye shadows are flat...</li>
            <li>If you use a lot of bright eye shadow colors I would stick to MAC or Urban Decay because they just aren&#x27;t vibrant enough, but if you are into neutrals or a light-medium wash of color than they are worth buying.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of NYX products but this is definitely not dark skinned girl friendly.  </li>
            <li>Make-up brush (too big for bottles, but is great for applying concealer or other shadows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some of the shadows are nice, but they aren&#x27;t that pigmented on dark skin</li>
            <li>I barely have to touch my brushes shadow and a good amount comes off so even though these are dime size amounts so due to the pigmentation</li>
            <li>The reds come off more bright pink-like (they are fairly pigmented) and there is no burgundy or dark red (even though they look dark they do not apply dark)</li>
            <li>I consider myself a pro when it comes to applying make-up, so no false advertisement here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I really did get a lot for that price.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to buy anymore eyeshadow with this product and its conveniently portable as well as sturdy.</li>
            <li>I especially like that these lipglosses are fragrance free because they never feel sticky</li>
            <li>and everyone wants to know where i get them.</li>
            <li>I will try with other primers to see if that helps, but they are great eyeshadows and definitely hold up well enough to be worth the price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried layering them more than 2-3 layers because I don&#x27;t like to look cakey, but other reviews say they layer</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m gonna use so many colors, but I appreciate the fact that black, white, gray, and the golds are big pots.</li>
            <li>All the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li>i have used other cheap eye shadows</li>
            <li>This is my new crack.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The eyeshadows themselves are comparable to MAC in terms of blending, they are pretty pigmented but even with the NYX white eyeshadow primer</li>
            <li>The majority of the colors are small(size of a dime)with 6 large neutral shades in the middle</li>
            <li>After reading the different revoews for this product I decided to buy it, and I have to say that I&#x27;m very please with what I received for the price that I paid.    </li>
            <li>(Now, I have used NYX products before, they have always been fav, but I never invested in complete kits like these.)  </li>
            <li>My 21 year old daughter loves make up...</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 17 year old daughter who has just developed an interest in make-up</li>
            <li>the six face colors are quite vibrant, even the white and gray.  </li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews I figured this palette was right up my alley.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to give me my money back or send me a new one.</li>
            <li>I also likes that colors that are more commonly used come larger quantities which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I like that they offer the most commonly used colors in bigger sizes</li>
            <li>just an education major)</li>
            <li>I am a major NYX fan</li>
            <li>Especially when I had to pick it up from the apartment office even though it is so small and probably fit into the mailbox.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using MAC, NARS, Lancome, Clinique, Bare Minerals for years.</li>
            <li>One eyeshadow was broken up due to the packaging, but the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>Shipping was faster than expected by 2 days and nothing was damaged because it was packed very professionally.</li>
            <li>The brown and black are the only two I really use.  </li>

            <li> These shadows that I have tried (yellows, golds, bronzes, greens, browns, and blacks) go on very smooth and blend very well.</li>
            <li> I did swatches of many of the colors and they are very pigmented</li>
            <li> (Full size versions of colors in the palette)</li>
            <li> I bought this palette around July or August of this year and for the most part I really like it.</li>
            <li> She really loves this makeup kit as she has so many choices...</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a GREAT value for the price</li>
            <li> once I stepped outside the golds were quite pigmented and I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
            <li> Still worth it though</li>
            <li> Good selection of colors and not much shine.  </li>
            <li> Will have fun trying out all the colors.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely recommend this product, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> If you are new to makeup or just want quality at a fair price definitely go with this!</li>
            <li> The Eyeshadow palette arrived within the expected days, and I was very pleased with the state it arrived.</li>
            <li> This Product was ok, i was looking for Colors to pop a little more.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced though so</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant with a true pigment aspect.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this palette and also suggest purchasing real eyeshadow brushes instead of the cheap applicators that come with the palette.</li>
            <li> A little bit of variety, fun colors, not too much investment, and good quality.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was satisfied with the colors but one of the colors cracked so some of the powder spilled into the color next to it.</li>
            <li> and I knew exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Love glitter, just can&#x27;t get enough of it?</li>
            <li> , i could have found better in stors locally</li>
            <li> I also found that most of the eye shadows are flat...</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of bright eye shadow colors I would stick to MAC or Urban Decay because they just aren&#x27;t vibrant enough, but if you are into neutrals or a light-medium wash of color than they are worth buying.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of NYX products but this is definitely not dark skinned girl friendly.  </li>
            <li> Make-up brush (too big for bottles, but is great for applying concealer or other shadows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the shadows are nice, but they aren&#x27;t that pigmented on dark skin</li>
            <li> I barely have to touch my brushes shadow and a good amount comes off so even though these are dime size amounts so due to the pigmentation</li>
            <li> The reds come off more bright pink-like (they are fairly pigmented) and there is no burgundy or dark red (even though they look dark they do not apply dark)</li>
            <li> I consider myself a pro when it comes to applying make-up, so no false advertisement here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I really did get a lot for that price.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to buy anymore eyeshadow with this product and its conveniently portable as well as sturdy.</li>
            <li> I especially like that these lipglosses are fragrance free because they never feel sticky</li>
            <li> and everyone wants to know where i get them.</li>
            <li> I will try with other primers to see if that helps, but they are great eyeshadows and definitely hold up well enough to be worth the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried layering them more than 2-3 layers because I don&#x27;t like to look cakey, but other reviews say they layer</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m gonna use so many colors, but I appreciate the fact that black, white, gray, and the golds are big pots.</li>
            <li> All the colors are vibrant.</li>
            <li> i have used other cheap eye shadows</li>
            <li> This is my new crack.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The eyeshadows themselves are comparable to MAC in terms of blending, they are pretty pigmented but even with the NYX white eyeshadow primer</li>
            <li> The majority of the colors are small(size of a dime)with 6 large neutral shades in the middle</li>
            <li> After reading the different revoews for this product I decided to buy it, and I have to say that I&#x27;m very please with what I received for the price that I paid.    </li>
            <li> (Now, I have used NYX products before, they have always been fav, but I never invested in complete kits like these.)  </li>
            <li> My 21 year old daughter loves make up...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 17 year old daughter who has just developed an interest in make-up</li>
            <li> the six face colors are quite vibrant, even the white and gray.  </li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I figured this palette was right up my alley.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to give me my money back or send me a new one.</li>
            <li> I also likes that colors that are more commonly used come larger quantities which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I like that they offer the most commonly used colors in bigger sizes</li>
            <li> just an education major)</li>
            <li> I am a major NYX fan</li>
            <li> Especially when I had to pick it up from the apartment office even though it is so small and probably fit into the mailbox.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using MAC, NARS, Lancome, Clinique, Bare Minerals for years.</li>
            <li> One eyeshadow was broken up due to the packaging, but the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected by 2 days and nothing was damaged because it was packed very professionally.</li>
            <li> The brown and black are the only two I really use.  </li>
            <li> As I carefully opened the box, I said to myself \\&quot;here we go; I really hope I don&#x27;t have to make a return due to a lemon product.\\</li>
            <li> I was looking for a palette that had a lot of colors but not expensive because I hardly wear make-up.</li>
            <li> I can see them lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my 14 yr old little sister who has just gotten to start wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li> It is smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> but I would purchase other NYX shadows again in the future.</li>
            <li> It was a little smaller than I expected, about the size of a dime per color, but the eyeshadow is so pigmented you don&#x27;t really have to go overboard.</li>
            <li> The silvers are a little disappointing and you really need a good base or they don&#x27;t really show up.</li>
            <li> so I can save money (black, white, gold, beige,</li>
            <li> I like this little palette, it looks much bigger online than you think it would be</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t pop as much as I expected them based on the reviews here.</li>
            <li> I was also expecting this after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Lots to choose from only downfall is the samples are small.</li>
            <li> but the majority are frosty, shimmery or even glittery so not many actually usable ones for those who prefer matte colours.</li>
            <li> This palette is small - not tiny -</li>
            <li> Because this is just not right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a late bloomer to makeup and just recently started building my makeup collection.</li>

            <li> Over the past five years, I have spent over $10,000 on beauty products, $7,000 on make-up alone.</li>
            <li> the only disappointment was the yellow which wasn&#x27;t as pigmented as some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> I looked at coastal scents, bh cosmetics, and even MAC, but these products were either too expensive or fairly new to me.</li>
            <li> Not only that the sliding thing was broken.</li>
            <li> its missing some brighter colours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it almost everyday</li>
            <li> When looking at this from the NYX website it claims some are face colors though not all are eyeshadows like pinks and reds and a few browns</li>
            <li> The only think I would recommend is that you also buy the primer, because without a base color underneath the colors don&#x27;t pop as much as they could.</li>
            <li> The colour pay-off was never great but has only gotten worse with time.</li>
            <li> The light colors are horrible... made a mistake buying it... will go for expensive eye shadows next time..</li>
            <li> Its hard to use the blush brushes to take them up.</li>

            <li> NYX is my favorite make-up. When I got the palette it was broken and the eye shadows fell out.</li>
            <li> NYX products are cheap and quite good. This set is great you have a lot of options and the colors stay all day. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is great beginner palette. It has a nice mix of both matte and shimmer shades. The colors are a good combination of neutrals,darks,and brights. The shadows have really good pigmentation (even better with primer). The majority of the colors are small(size of a dime)with 6 large neutral shades in the middle but c&#x27;mon you&#x27;ve got 72 great colors to play with! Over all this is a good palette and for the price it&#x27;s worth trying out.</li>
            <li> okay. first of, I am not satisfied with this at all. Because I am supposed to get this on Wednesday, not Sunday. Especially when I had to pick it up from the apartment office even though it is so small and probably fit into the mailbox. And when I opened this product, the bottom part was all broken and eyeshadow powder was everywhere. Not only that the sliding thing was broken. I&#x27;d like to give me my money back or send me a new one. Because this is just not right.</li>
            <li> I received this palette the other day and it was in perfect condition! It is smaller than expected. The eye shadows are dime size but then I remembered it&#x27;s only $25 and I really did get a lot for that price. I did swatches of many of the colors and they are very pigmented the only disappointment was the yellow which wasn&#x27;t as pigmented as some of the other colors. I thought the same with golds when I applied them yet once I stepped outside the golds were quite pigmented and I am very pleased with them. I barely have to touch my brushes shadow and a good amount comes off so even though these are dime size amounts so due to the pigmentation I can see them lasting a long time. The palette does come with it&#x27;s own applicators but I do use my own brushes. I also likes that colors that are more commonly used come larger quantities which is a plus. These shadows that I have tried (yellows, golds, bronzes, greens, browns, and blacks) go on very smooth and blend very well. I was afraid the shadows were going to be chalky but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all. The palette is mostly shimmer and frosty shadows (which I prefer) there are some matte and glitter (fewer matte than glitter).    **update**    The silvers are a little disappointing and you really need a good base or they don&#x27;t really show up. The reds come off more bright pink-like (they are fairly pigmented) and there is no burgundy or dark red (even though they look dark they do not apply dark) yet when I mixed with a darker brown I get a beautiful color which I am really pleased with. The blues and purples are beautiful and very pigmented and I am pleased with both.    The only cons I have found with this palette are the silvers, yellows, and some reds</li>
            <li> The inner palettes on both sides are for face however I thought they should have been the bigger ones on the inside. Its hard to use the blush brushes to take them up. I also found that most of the eye shadows are flat...its missing some brighter colours. Its an ok palette</li>
            <li> I was looking for a palette that had a lot of colors but not expensive because I hardly wear make-up. After reading the other reviews I figured this palette was right up my alley. When it arrived I was satisfied with the colors but one of the colors cracked so some of the powder spilled into the color next to it. I was also expecting this after reading the other reviews.I would recommend the colors but if you can purchase it in store I would say do that, only because of the issue with the care during the shipping process.</li>
            <li> I discovered Nyx makeup from a friend who uses more drug store makeup than department store makeup. I&#x27;ve been using MAC, NARS, Lancome, Clinique, Bare Minerals for years. I was really impressed at how pigmented the colors were and how cheap Nyx makeup is. I ordered this palette to try out all the colors of the rainbow, and then some. Its totally affordable. I received this in the mail, perfectly intact. I opened it immediately and started using it. This palette does not disappoint! All the colors are vibrant. You really don&#x27;t need to buy anymore eyeshadow with this product and its conveniently portable as well as sturdy. This is my new crack.</li>
            <li> I dont know if it was them that gave me the cracked eye shadow, or the shipping company was just careless. But it came cracked and I wasn&#x27;t happy</li>
            <li> After reading the different revoews for this product I decided to buy it, and I have to say that I&#x27;m very please with what I received for the price that I paid.    Let me start with the review:    1. Package: The Eyeshadow palette arrived within the expected days, and I was very pleased with the state it arrived. It was all wrapped in this bubbles plastic bag, and protecred inside the box. All the shadows were in perfect state.    2. Quality: Once I used the shadows I was very happy about my purshasing. The color are bright, and they&#x27;re not shalky as you would expect a shadow would be for the price charged. There are several shinny colors and a few mattes ones, but the colors are really nice (I was especially pleased by how bright the fucsia one was... I love it) and there&#x27;s a lot of bronze colors for everyone&#x27;s taste and style.     I think is a very good product for what&#x27;s worth!!! I&#x27;m using it almost everyday and I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a late bloomer to makeup and just recently started building my makeup collection. This palette is inexpensive and has great shades that you can mix and match for all occasions. I use with the NYX eyeshadow primer and these eyeshadows stay on all day until I remove it at night with makeup remover wipes. Highly recommend this palette and also suggest purchasing real eyeshadow brushes instead of the cheap applicators that come with the palette.</li>
            <li> I love the NYX eyeshadow I recieved, the pigmentation is wonderful and the consistency is very good. One eyeshadow was broken up due to the packaging, but the product itself is amazing. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this! The only think I would recommend is that you also buy the primer, because without a base color underneath the colors don&#x27;t pop as much as they could. Other than that it&#x27;s a GREAT value for the price</li>
            <li> I like this little palette, it looks much bigger online than you think it would be but that&#x27;s not a problem because it is a lot of eyeshadows and offers great variety. When looking at this from the NYX website it claims some are face colors though not all are eyeshadows like pinks and reds and a few browns but I am sure you can use them as eyeshadows (There are so many colors in this I haven&#x27;t used them all yet!) I like that they offer the most commonly used colors in bigger sizes so I can save money (black, white, gold, beige, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadows themselves are comparable to MAC in terms of blending, they are pretty pigmented but even with the NYX white eyeshadow primer they didn&#x27;t pop as much as I expected them based on the reviews here. I will try with other primers to see if that helps, but they are great eyeshadows and definitely hold up well enough to be worth the price. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase the entire palette again but I would purchase other NYX shadows again in the future. (Full size versions of colors in the palette) If you use a lot of bright eye shadow colors I would stick to MAC or Urban Decay because they just aren&#x27;t vibrant enough, but if you are into neutrals or a light-medium wash of color than they are worth buying. I haven&#x27;t tried layering them more than 2-3 layers because I don&#x27;t like to look cakey, but other reviews say they layer well I haven&#x27;t found this to be true, but they blend well and make a great smokey eye!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of NYX products but this is definitely not dark skinned girl friendly.  Some of the shadows are nice, but they aren&#x27;t that pigmented on dark skin and there&#x27;s alot of fallout when you try to pack it on.  The brown and black are the only two I really use.  The colors are gorgeous...but I would recommend this for lighter complexions.</li>
            <li> This palette is perfect.  The quality of the colors and the variety is amazing for how cheap this thing is.  It&#x27;s by no means a big palette.  It&#x27;s actually about the size of a paperback book.  But I am very happy and this is just what I needed.  A little bit of variety, fun colors, not too much investment, and good quality.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye shadow palette I had it has every color and they stay on. All day</li>
            <li> Love everything, color pay off is great. Lots to choose from only downfall is the samples are small. Still worth it though</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this product. NYX wasn&#x27;t well known to me until about a month ago and I&#x27;m quite selective with my make up. It was a little smaller than I expected, about the size of a dime per color, but the eyeshadow is so pigmented you don&#x27;t really have to go overboard. It was very easy to load my brush, which obviously says the quality was good. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m gonna use so many colors, but I appreciate the fact that black, white, gray, and the golds are big pots. Anyway everything mixes well. If you&#x27;re on the fence I&#x27;d say go for it. 20 something dollars is not that big an investment and i found it to be up to snuff.</li>
            <li> I love the colors. They have wonderful pigment and I change my eye makeup to what I&#x27;m wearing everyday. I&#x27;ve had them for quite a while. And the best part is they don&#x27;t melt into my oily skin even when I don&#x27;t use a primer.</li>
            <li> Good selection of colors and not much shine.  the six face colors are quite vibrant, even the white and gray.  Will have fun trying out all the colors.</li>
            <li> no pigment at all. color doesn&#x27;t stick to my eyelids. i have used other cheap eye shadows but they had  good pigment</li>
            <li> I absolutely very pleased with this. I am very happy with my purchase it out does any other eye shadow product I have bought!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors....</li>
            <li> Lots of variety but the majority are frosty, shimmery or even glittery so not many actually usable ones for those who prefer matte colours. The colour pay-off was never great but has only gotten worse with time. Very reasonably priced though so, in the end, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Let me just first thank Misspinkcat and Amazon for their exceptional product, packaging, and customer service! Over the past five years, I have spent over $10,000 on beauty products, $7,000 on make-up alone. I have purchased beauty products from almost every retailer out there and tried a versatile selection of brand name products. I guess you can say that I am a beauty queen who takes her make-up very seriously. I consider myself a pro when it comes to applying make-up, so no false advertisement here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, my husband wanted to purchase a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for me and I knew exactly what I needed. I was looking for a complete make-up kit with the works (bright colors, product quality, price, &amp; versatility). I had researched for hours, coming across pricey and monotonous kits, until I discovered the NYX eyeshadow, lipstick, and glitter shade kits. (Now, I have used NYX products before, they have always been fav, but I never invested in complete kits like these.)  So after reading the reviews and deciding to make a $150.00 investment with standard shipping (35 eyeshadow kit, 36 lipgloss kit, 78 eyeshadow kit, &amp; 40 eyeshadow glitter) I was excited, but nervous because of the reviews I had read about shattered eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting only four days, I received my shipment. As I carefully opened the box, I said to myself \\&quot;here we go; I really hope I don&#x27;t have to make a return due to a lemon product.\\&quot; Once the box was open, I noticed that everything was neatly placed and wrapped in bubble wrap; I was relieved and grateful all at the same time.  Now when people refer to these products as \\&quot;crack\\&quot; or \\&quot;magic dust,\\&quot; they&#x27;re not kidding.  Once I tried every color, lipgloss, bronzer, powder, and glitter dust I knew I had made a life-time investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;35 pc. Eyeshadow Kit: Amazing! Glides on perfect, with a variety of colors, and last all day! Good Beginner kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;78 pc. Eyeshadow Kit: Dress-up or dress down, this kitwill offer you everything you need for eyes and cheeks. Can be used for work or play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;40 pc. Glitter Eyeshadow:  Perfect for the glam girl! Love glitter, just can&#x27;t get enough of it? Then this is a must, believe me it will be one of the best purchases you will ever make! Added Bonus: Make-up brush (too big for bottles, but is great for applying concealer or other shadows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;36 pc. Lipgloss Kit: I especially like that these lipglosses are fragrance free because they never feel sticky, always make my lips feel smooth and shiny. Plus, great colors and will last forever! Perfect for gifts as well. Added Bonus: Free Lipgloss Bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m hooked now, saving a fortune and continue to be impressed with the quality and versatility of these products, the kits are as big as they look don&#x27;t be fooled! I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase that I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  I lost mine in aruba and trying to get another one.  Colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my Secret Santa for Christmas 2012 and she absolutely loves it!!!  I would refer them to friends, co-workers, and family to NYX Cosmetics!!!</li>
            <li> I like this item,served the purpose!</li>
            <li> My 21 year old daughter loves make up...this was one of her xmas gifts.  The case is awesome, and colors are fantastic. She LOVES this set.  I will absolutely recommend this product, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a palette to get some good colors without breaking my bank, this is it! The colors are amazing and even with the size (about a dime each) they work very well. Shipping was faster than expected by 2 days and nothing was damaged because it was packed very professionally. If you are new to makeup or just want quality at a fair price definitely go with this!</li>
            <li> This Product was ok, i was looking for Colors to pop a little more. I was not over happy about the shadows but i was ok, i could have found better in stors locally</li>
            <li> I bought this palette around July or August of this year and for the most part I really like it. I&#x27;m kind of new in makeup (no makeup artist..just an education major) but I wanted to buy a palette without spending an arm or leg. I looked at coastal scents, bh cosmetics, and even MAC, but these products were either too expensive or fairly new to me. I didn&#x27;t want to spend my money on a product I have never used, no matter how many reviews claimed it to be the best. So, one product came to mind that I used in my freshman year...NYX! I have always loved nyx products because they were so pigmented,easy to apply and affordable. Thus, I bought their palette....there are so many colors to create a variety of looks, nice sized mirror for application, and nice pigmentation of colors (always use a primer/base to wake up eyeshadows).</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my 14 yr old little sister who has just gotten to start wearing makeup.  I am beginning to think it may be too awesome for her...I may have to keep it!</li>
            <li> Só não dei nota máxima porque ainda não udei, então não seia qualidade, mas a paleta é linda, um charme. Amei, o produto chegou lacrado e perfeito.</li>
            <li> Love NYX products!  This palette is small - not tiny - but I was expecting that from all of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The pigment of the colors are AMAZING! It was worth the money :)  I am a major NYX fan</li>
            <li> The light colors are horrible... made a mistake buying it... will go for expensive eye shadows next time.. nyx is a no no</li>
            <li> She really loves this makeup kit as she has so many choices...she is a happy camper and we will most likely purchase again</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised! the colors are vibrant with a true pigment aspect. I receive compliments every time I use these and everyone wants to know where i get them. Of course I say amazon</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly and it has the best selections of colors. It has more colors than you would need, but it&#x27;s fun if you like to play with make-up!! Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> Good as Nyx :) came in the right time, i realy liked, the product is realy good and have quality.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 17 year old daughter who has just developed an interest in make-up and she loves it!</li>
