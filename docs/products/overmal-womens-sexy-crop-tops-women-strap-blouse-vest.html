            <li>Get it here for free: http://www.points2shop.com?ref&#x3D;uin1389792843&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>Delivered as expected, right on time and perfect packaging!</li>
            <li>its pretty supportive too</li>
            <li>It came in a week early, which was fantastic and its pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s super cute, and reasonable comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 32D and this bra is doing its job, very cute in the back and so comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very cute and comfortable but not very big!</li>
            <li>It fits very well(im a 34B) and is quite comfortable!</li>
            <li>I really like this crop top.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The front isn&#x27;t very appealing but the back is.</li>
            <li>From the front is looks like a sports bra kinda, but the back is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>The back straps were kind of folded or wilted when i took it off.</li>
            <li>It was a great buy for the price especially considering I only wear it with one or two shirts.</li>
            <li>And fast delivery too!</li>
            <li>Wish I went a size up but still love the look of this crop under an open back top</li>
            <li>Indeed it is better for smaller chest sizes.</li>
            <li>If you are a large breasted woman this will not work for you.</li>
            <li>For the price I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Adding sizes would be very beneficial to the producer and the consumer</li>
            <li>I really like this despite the sizing problem.</li>
            <li>Better Quality than Expected.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have support</li>
            <li>It is so tiny it looks like it could fit my 5 year old neice.</li>
            <li>Came in 2 weeks, worth the low price.</li>
            <li>This crop top does NOT fit curvy women, as I should have known.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than expected but cute</li>
            <li>Not supportive at all, but it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li>It does have padding but offers zero support.</li>
            <li>(Im a 34C) its cery comfy and soft.</li>
            <li>Comically small and cheap.</li>
            <li>Tiny one size if you are bigger than a size 10 or large C or D cup don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>i have it laying flat now hoping they return to normal form.</li>
            <li>I wear a 34c and it barely fits me.</li>
            <li>It fits comfortably but the back straps stretch unevenly in the back.</li>
            <li>Fits as expected.. I really like it and it makes my boobs looks bigger !</li>
            <li>Just best for a small breasted, small framed, thin person.</li>
            <li>It is so cute but a little small on me.</li>
            <li>I wear 32D or 32DD at Victorias Secret a day this still fits me fine.</li>

            <li> Comically small and cheap.</li>

            <li> I wear a 34c and it barely fits me.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably but the back straps stretch unevenly in the back.</li>
            <li> Fits as expected.. I really like it and it makes my boobs looks bigger !</li>
            <li> Just best for a small breasted, small framed, thin person.</li>
            <li> It is so cute but a little small on me.</li>
            <li> I wear 32D or 32DD at Victorias Secret a day this still fits me fine.</li>
            <li> It is NOT super high quality</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t come down as far as in the picture, just fyi</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;padding&amp;#34; in the front was lumpy and the entire band was about 3 - 4 inches wide.</li>
            <li> Material becomes see through when stretched out.</li>
            <li> Her boobs are smaller and there&#x27;s less tensions on the straps because she&#x27;s a tiny woman.</li>
            <li> My band measurement is 32 inches and the bra is kinda loose, but still works.</li>
            <li> This is tight and the shoulder straps are short.</li>
            <li> but they are a little big for me and itchy.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that this was flimsy, or not strong enough, but I decided to try it</li>
            <li> Im a upper body small</li>
            <li> cheap fabric, bad stitching</li>
            <li> Not worth the $</li>
            <li> Arrived within a week and half of order date.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too tight.</li>
            <li> it fits kinda tight but i like it.</li>
            <li> A bit tight though.</li>
            <li> Run small but other</li>
            <li> but it does have little inserts in the cups like a swim suit to keep everything smoothed out.</li>
            <li> the padding is like the padding of a bathing suit so it is not very supportive</li>
            <li> One size does NOT fit all.</li>
            <li> So tight that the straps in the back are twisted to compensate.</li>
            <li> its a little hard to breath in.</li>
            <li> If I had a chest at all this would not fit!</li>
            <li> For a one size , it run small</li>
            <li> , i ordered a small, I&#x27;m a 32b and size</li>
            <li> but the small looked like a child&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting the excessive padding.</li>
            <li> and it seems like it would be uncomfortable for anyone much bigger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small, and narrow &#x3D; child size.</li>
            <li> Its not cheaply made, it is thick and stretchy, I wear a 34 D and it holds in everything it needs to!</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> It came in and it didn&#x27;t have any weird chemical smell that usually some products like these have.</li>
            <li> Not great support, but i wasn&#x27;t looking for support.</li>
            <li> As a result it is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Fits weird.</li>
            <li> Padding is a bit bumpy, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Hate it looks nothing like picture.</li>

            <li> It came in a week early, which was fantastic and its pretty good quality. It looks very similar to all the pictures, and the material is comfy and stretchy! From the front is looks like a sports bra kinda, but the back is fantastic!! For the price I&#x27;d highly recommend it! I am very pleased :)</li>
            <li> Run small but other then that good</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that this was flimsy, or not strong enough, but I decided to try it and I am pleased with it. It is made of durable, strong spandex material, and it looks well sewn. Also has removable pads. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the shape! but they are a little big for me and itchy.</li>
            <li> I love love love this top! It fits very well(im a 34B) and is quite comfortable! And fast delivery too! Will definitely buy again. ❤️</li>
            <li> Comically small and cheap. The &amp;#34;padding&amp;#34; in the front was lumpy and the entire band was about 3 - 4 inches wide. Material becomes see through when stretched out. I actually laughed when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and stylish!! I&#x27;ve stopped wearing my underwire push up bras!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best! For its price I defiantly recommend it!</li>
            <li> One size does NOT fit all. I am a size 2-4 waist and it&#x27;s too tight. So tight that the straps in the back are twisted to compensate. Adding sizes would be very beneficial to the producer and the consumer</li>
            <li> The description was very accurate and it looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32D and this bra is doing its job, very cute in the back and so comfortable.</li>
            <li> Super cute, love that it&#x27;s padded. I don&#x27;t like that it only comes in one size. I wear a 34c and it barely fits me. But it&#x27;s super cute, and reasonable comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small, and narrow &#x3D; child size.</li>
            <li> It is so cute but a little small on me. It fits comfortably but the back straps stretch unevenly in the back. I am a 34 B. I really like this despite the sizing problem. Now all I need to do it find a shirt to go with it!</li>
            <li> Its not cheaply made, it is thick and stretchy, I wear a 34 D and it holds in everything it needs to! I wish they would make some more colors! I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Im a upper body small and i wore this for about 3 hours, it fit great! Super comfy too! The back straps were kind of folded or wilted when i took it off. i have it laying flat now hoping they return to normal form.</li>
            <li> I am 5ft 5inches 36c. This is tight and the shoulder straps are short. As a result it is uncomfortable. It does have padding but offers zero support. I do think the style is cute and do NOT think it is very cheaply made. Just best for a small breasted, small framed, thin person.</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected, right on time and perfect packaging! It came in and it didn&#x27;t have any weird chemical smell that usually some products like these have. Size it&#x27;s perfect for my size! Also bought one for my client and she also loves it! Definitely recommend this seller and the product. It is NOT super high quality but it surely does an awesome job!</li>
            <li> i loved it and ordered more! super comfy and great price but it doesn&#x27;t come down as far as in the picture, just fyi</li>
            <li> Wish I went a size up but still love the look of this crop under an open back top</li>
            <li> Very cute and comfortable but not very big! If I had a chest at all this would not fit!</li>
            <li> this is so cute!! it fits kinda tight but i like it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this !! It fit perfect and i am a 32 D.</li>
            <li> I wish the straps are adjustable.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find one of these that fit and this one does. Kind of compresses you but your ladies are not moving anywhere. I am a 34 DDD and this fit perfect.</li>
            <li> Fits as expected.. I really like it and it makes my boobs looks bigger !</li>
            <li> This is soooo comfortable. And super cute. I&#x27;d buy every color if they offered them. Im a 34 DD (augmented) and this fits great. Arrived within a week and half of order date.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> A lot tighter than what it looks like shown here.</li>
            <li> I really like this crop top.  Is perfect to wear under a strapless top as is sexy.  Padding is a bit bumpy, but not too bad.  Overall happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Good quality! Fit well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, fits great. I definitely love it!</li>
            <li> Hate it looks nothing like picture. Fits weird.</li>
            <li> If you are a large breasted woman this will not work for you. I&#x27;m a 36DD and my boobs where falling out of the front of it. It was cheaply made so the straps roll in because of lines sone to connect the elastic straps to eachother. I gave it to my mom though and she loves it. Her boobs are smaller and there&#x27;s less tensions on the straps because she&#x27;s a tiny woman.</li>
            <li> For a one size , it run small</li>
            <li> Great for the price ! I wear it all the time</li>
            <li> Ripping at all seems, must hand wash or it will rip</li>
            <li> Came in 2 weeks, worth the low price. Indeed it is better for smaller chest sizes. My band measurement is 32 inches and the bra is kinda loose, but still works. The fabric is not the best, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be.</li>
            <li> Better Quality than Expected. Cheap Price and I will probably order another one in White. I&#x27;m a 36 D and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Falling apart before I even tried it on. cheap fabric, bad stitching, i ordered a small, I&#x27;m a 32b and size xs-s but the small looked like a child&#x27;s small. Not worth the $</li>
            <li> This crop top does NOT fit curvy women, as I should have known. It is so tiny it looks like it could fit my 5 year old neice. If you&#x27;re not an A cup or smaller..don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> this is adorable!!!! love it would recommend!</li>
            <li> Super cute, looks like the pictures.  Not for bigger breast women.</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY for the price, this top is awesome. It&#x27;s good quality, and fits well. I&#x27;m a 32D and have no issues fitting into it.</li>
            <li> Not supportive at all, but it&#x27;s cute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best! Super comfy, great support. I have already ordered three of these, and this is my default bra now..</li>
            <li> Tiny one size if you are bigger than a size 10 or large C or D cup don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than expected but cute</li>
            <li> The padding moves around a lot but it&#x27;s manageable. I&#x27;m a 32/34B and ordered a medium, it fits perfectly. Very comfortable and cute! And it was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> It came a month early and fits perfectly! (Im a 34C) its cery comfy and soft. the padding is like the padding of a bathing suit so it is not very supportive but i dont mind. Love it, soo cute</li>
            <li> Arrived early and great price! I absolutely love it and the seller is easy to contact. Great purchase overall. Recommend</li>
            <li> These are gorgeous ! And they look so much better under those shirts (yknow the ones that look like the maker doesn&#x27;t even realize that bras exist) than a swim top or a bra does! They fit perfectly although the pads included do like to move around but they&#x27;re easily situated. So if you like the look of these go ahead and buy them !</li>
            <li> Love it, perfect deup for the brandy Melville one. Not great support, but i wasn&#x27;t looking for support. Love it, and the price is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I ordered the 6 horizontal lined back, but received a triangle back side...</li>
            <li> This bra thing was good for its purpose of looking cute under this backless shirt I have. It doesn&#x27;t really have support but it does have little inserts in the cups like a swim suit to keep everything smoothed out. It was a great buy for the price especially considering I only wear it with one or two shirts.</li>
            <li> this is more of and a-cup top. Im a 38B and its a little hard to breath in. The front isn&#x27;t very appealing but the back is.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting the excessive padding. Quality is good though.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for a small/med</li>
            <li> Surprisingly quick shipping. Quality was good as well. I wear 32D or 32DD at Victorias Secret a day this still fits me fine.</li>
            <li> Love it! However im a 34 and it seems like it would be uncomfortable for anyone much bigger. Dont know aout the free size claim. its pretty supportive too</li>
            <li> I am a 34B it fits perfectly. Def not a push up or anything but enough padding to hide the nips. Super cute</li>
            <li> Get it here for free: http://www.points2shop.com?ref&#x3D;uin1389792843&lt;br /&gt;No seriously. But the product is good! A bit tight though.</li>
