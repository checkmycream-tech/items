            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and</li>
            <li>I noticed that it is not tested on animals (great)</li>
            <li>The EB5 cream is thicker, and great for application during the night.</li>
            <li>Its great under make up.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy I tried this cream</li>
            <li>I have used EB5 for many years and I have been very happy with the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes you face feel really good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping I will continue to have good results the longer</li>
            <li>I also have fair skin and some aging spots are showing up.  </li>
            <li>Must be good.</li>
            <li>---I LOVED THAT STUFF</li>
            <li>This is the kind of moisturizer you might want to start before wrinkles are an issue, just to keep you skin in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this cream and interested to see how my skin looks after a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product!</li>
            <li>Great Product,  My skin  looks smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>You should use it very sparingly for best results given that it has mineral oil in it.</li>
            <li>Instead I think the benefit is that it is a really nice</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it is a cream for day or night, I use it mostly at night because during the day I use a face lotion with spf as I am fair skinned and prone to freckles and sunburn in the Florida sun.  </li>
            <li>To be honest I had my doubts about this product, but I read about the use of this product combination with a Vitamin C serum, and now I&#x27;m seeing legitimate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would also have liked to have the ability to use it in my under eye</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very nice smooth cream.  </li>
            <li>The Acure Day Cream smells great and has actually significantly improved my skin quality and reduced wrinkling.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s suitable for day use as well if you don&#x27;t need a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>So far in very happy and glad to recommend.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C serum is very light on your face, so it&#x27;s appropriate for use with make-up or sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t choose to take this but since there didn&#x27;t seem to be too many ingredients with too many chemicals I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I do love this as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for many years and am completely satisfied with this cream.  </li>
            <li>As many reviewers have noted, the &amp;#34;five combined items&amp;#34; pitch is a bit misleading.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>I found this cream thicker than most face creams.</li>
            <li>skin is very senstive and I have never had a reaction to the cream.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had a better texture.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cream on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty good looking skin</li>
            <li>Very good facial cream.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s gluten free and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for great moisturizers for sensitive skin and was excited to get this to review through the Amazon Vine program.  </li>
            <li>My skin did feel softer, though I don&#x27;t think it improved my wrinkles or fine</li>
            <li>a quick comparison of ingredients is most revealing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly into the skin and my skin felt nice and smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li>I have huge pores and combination skin.  </li>
            <li>It was really a great moisturizer to use under my makeup; having it on made my makeup go on smoother and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream is a great price and actually works when you pair it with a Vitamin C like this.</li>
            <li>eb5 has the consistency of [[ASIN:B00430CRX6 NOXEMA clean cream]]</li>
            <li>I love this cream would buy it again thanks so much !!!</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need more.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good cream, but seems a tad pricey.</li>
            <li>My skin drinks it up and feels nice and soft after application.</li>
            <li>hopefully the anti-aging holds true as it claims.</li>
            <li>It goes on the skin smoothly and get absorbed fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Facial Cream does fill in fine lines and wrinkles, as does any reasonably effective skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>In addition to using a deep skin cleanser and brightening this facial cream is excellent.  </li>
            <li>but I still tend to get some mild acne around the edges of my face.</li>
            <li>I think it would be good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fully absorbed within 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fully absorbed within 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems like a nice facial cream.</li>
            <li>DIDNT SEEM AS GOOD AS IT WAS IN PINK JAR</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it is unscented, blends in quickly, and my skin did not react to the lotion.</li>
            <li>claims of \\&quot;Allergy Tested, Non GMO (not genetically engineered), Vegan, Gluten Free and Never Tested on Animals\\&quot; are all well and good, however there&#x27;s enough in the way of chemicals in eb5 to make necessary a safety warning of \\&quot;Discontinue use if irritation occurs.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>claims of \\&quot;Allergy Tested, Non GMO (not genetically engineered), Vegan, Gluten Free and Never Tested on Animals\\&quot; are all well and good, however there&#x27;s enough in the way of chemicals in eb5 to make necessary a safety warning of \\&quot;Discontinue use if irritation occurs.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the good stuff, for when it&#x27;s absorbed in the skin there&#x27;s evidence that it helps build a body&#x27;s Vitamin E content.&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl alcohol is fatty and is used as a thickener in cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Many of my moisturizers and lotions that I use constantly seem to absorb right into the skin and dissipate.  </li>
            <li>The summer has been so hot and</li>
            <li>The label recommends preparing your skin first with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>My normal routine for facial moisturizers is to apply a Vitamin C serum then a moisturizer of some kind.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but I am enjoying it and can actually see some results.</li>
            <li>Have used this for several years now and still love it along with the cleanser and toner.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream!</li>
            <li>This cream is light, has no gross smell, blends in quickly and keeps my face from drying out without making it break-out.  </li>
            <li>Using both leaves my skin super soft all day!</li>
            <li>I will for sure continue to use to cream for the long term.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not the petrochemicals that concern me so much as the Vitamin A. Amazon does not permit the posting of outside links, but if you do a search on \\&quot;the problem with Vitamin A\\&quot;, you&#x27;ll find that there is real concern about the addition of that vitamin to many sunscreens as this antioxidant - used to fight skin aging -</li>
            <li>I have had no bad reactions to using this cream and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive nose either as it doesn&#x27;t have added fragrance.  </li>
            <li>From my wife Sarah: Very simply, this does a decent job of moisturizing and is made of some cleaner ingredients than most products, but it&#x27;s got some issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so this product may be better for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick, light beige cream with a very mild oatmeal scent, which fades away quickly.</li>
            <li>More dry</li>
            <li>When ingested in large quantities it may accelerate the development of cancer (see WIKIPEDIA article), but it&#x27;s a trace ingredient</li>
            <li>And my large pores and blackheads are shrinking.  </li>
            <li>I have very dehydrated skin.  </li>
            <li>is an unusual one.</li>
            <li>My sister disagrees, saying she really dislikes the smell.</li>
            <li>eb5&#x27;s facial cream goes on smooth, not greasy, and softens and moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this a lot (it has a reasonable price) but it is not for me.</li>
            <li>I only use it at night as I use a light moisturizer plus SPF in the morning.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizing product that&#x27;s free of all the things I listed above, this will work.</li>
            <li>For those with oily skin this may be too much.</li>
            <li>And too much \\&quot;A\\&quot; can lead to toxicity issues which range--scarily -- from liver damage to osteoporosis.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different skin care items ranging from drug store varieties, to the more expensive products offered by Sephora &amp; Khiel&#x27;s, so I consider this product a relatively low-cost option for skin care which yields good results.  </li>
            <li>and also this is a good, not spectacular, product.</li>
            <li>So far, I can tell a noticeable difference in how smooth and soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li>With what I&#x27;d deem &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; use (sparing), I think this could last a year and is actually a very economical addition to a moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li>With what I&#x27;d deem &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; use (sparing), I think this could last a year and is actually a very economical addition to a moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li>I found zero scent at all which is a refreshing change from other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fantastic, uncommon and very difficult to find.</li>
            <li>But it absorbed in quickly and left my face feeling soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>nothing special - I had liked the eb 5 Facial Cream which I liked a lot under the subscribe and save program ( now it&#x27;s double expensive here).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>But I recently tried one that had natural ingredients and was fine</li>
            <li>eems less exotic, somehow....safer.</li>
            <li>This left my skin smooth and soft, but not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This left my skin smooth and soft, but not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s truly anti-aging or not remains to be seen, but a big plus is that it contains natural ingredients, is allergy tested, is fragrance free, and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li>am guessing the main culprit is the mineral oil, whose main purpose is to sit on your skin and prevent moisture from leaving your skin.  </li>
            <li>Still, after I rub it into the rest of my face it seems to do a decent job of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is labeled an anti-aging cream, but it doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients like retinol that are normally associated with wrinkle removal.</li>
            <li>My skin is thin and fair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of oily and thick, and I feel like I have to wash my hands to get it off my fingers after.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality lotion/cream that works well into your skin and leaves it feeling new again.</li>
            <li>While it does a nice job of moisturizing, I don&#x27;t like the heavy feel of it, especially on my nose and hands.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a nice thick cream</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and to smells and this bothers neither, thank goodness.  </li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m very conscious of preventative measures and do whatever I can to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive and it does not cause me any allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not especially sensitive to any particular chemical or products, but there have been rare occasions where my skin is left dry or itchy with certain treatments (though this is rare).</li>
            <li>But because Sun is a big part of aging, be aware there is no SPF</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many anti-aging creams in the past and they never seemed to do anything.</li>
            <li>My main issues are a lot of fine lines around my eyes, deep wrinkles running from my nose to my mouth, and various lesser wrinkles running across my forehead.</li>
            <li>one is nothing special - You can buy any other of the shelve cream</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t really an all-natural product, although there are natural ingredients such as oat flour and comfrey root.</li>
            <li>My face feels so so soft.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s odorless, hypo-allergenic, and works reasonably well even without the companion products, I rate EB5 Facial Cream it at 4 stars (\\&quot;I like it\\&quot; on the official Amazon scale).</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old.</li>
            <li>I used it for nearly a week based on what stuck to the insert in the lid.</li>
            <li>While I do have wrinkles, I have sensitive skin and am still prone to zits.</li>
            <li>This facial cream is certainly very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to comment on the anti-aging property of this cream.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and combination (oily T zone).  </li>
            <li>This makes its very inappropriate for use during the day, especially if you need to (or want to) wear make-up.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and lines</li>
            <li>It just seems natural and doesn&#x27;t affect sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Though it has some natural ingredients, it also has some of the chemical-sounding ingredients you&#x27;ll find in non-natural brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With Eb5, my skin just feels soft and hydrated - no trace of irritation.  </li>
            <li>so far - knock</li>
            <li>Also, because it is in a jar, you can be sure you get every last bit out of it, unlike some of the pump bottles I currently use (and open up to get the last third of the lotion out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a particularly pleasant odor, but not terribly offensive.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would do with such a thick cream, but no breakouts have occurred while using the cream, so it seems to be doing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, for the purpose of assessing a new product, I stop using all products except the tested one (so I only used this one during my assessment phase - no vitamin C, no other moisturizer).</li>
            <li>I have a lot of experience from which to gauge the effectiveness of this product relative to others, but only with my particular skin</li>
            <li>This EB5 FACIAL CREAM is fragrance-free, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>However those with sensitive skin (especially sensitivity to mineral oil) should look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>and I have barely put a dent in it.  </li>
            <li>What goes on heavy feeling is absorbed within minutes here - no residual shininess/stickiness.  </li>
            <li>I knocked off one star  because I really think the description should include the other ingredients in the lotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days, and haven&#x27;t noticed any real changes other than the fact that my skin feels moisturized.</li>
            <li>But it has been tough to deal with because most anti-wrinkle creams are too greasy and make me break-out, especially during the summer.  </li>
            <li>Every now and then, I have tried a new cream on the market, but I never stay with it very long before I return to eb5.  </li>
            <li>and so far, no major zits, though an area on my chin looks like it could break out soon</li>
            <li>(See WIKIPEDIA for manufacturers&#x27; claims of its benefits.)&lt;br /&gt;Ethylhexylglycerin is frequently used to treat eczema and as a deodorizer.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd to last ingredient, Panthenol is a B5 acid that aids in moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out or make it too oily.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to slather it on--it&#x27;s quickly absorbed, and a small amount gives you a lot of coverage.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I would also have liked to have the ability to use it in my under eye</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very nice smooth cream.  </li>
            <li> The Acure Day Cream smells great and has actually significantly improved my skin quality and reduced wrinkling.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s suitable for day use as well if you don&#x27;t need a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> So far in very happy and glad to recommend.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C serum is very light on your face, so it&#x27;s appropriate for use with make-up or sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t choose to take this but since there didn&#x27;t seem to be too many ingredients with too many chemicals I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I do love this as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for many years and am completely satisfied with this cream.  </li>
            <li> As many reviewers have noted, the &amp;#34;five combined items&amp;#34; pitch is a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> I found this cream thicker than most face creams.</li>
            <li> skin is very senstive and I have never had a reaction to the cream.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a better texture.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cream on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty good looking skin</li>
            <li> Very good facial cream.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s gluten free and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for great moisturizers for sensitive skin and was excited to get this to review through the Amazon Vine program.  </li>
            <li> My skin did feel softer, though I don&#x27;t think it improved my wrinkles or fine</li>
            <li> a quick comparison of ingredients is most revealing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly into the skin and my skin felt nice and smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li> I have huge pores and combination skin.  </li>
            <li> It was really a great moisturizer to use under my makeup; having it on made my makeup go on smoother and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream is a great price and actually works when you pair it with a Vitamin C like this.</li>
            <li> eb5 has the consistency of [[ASIN:B00430CRX6 NOXEMA clean cream]]</li>
            <li> I love this cream would buy it again thanks so much !!!</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need more.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good cream, but seems a tad pricey.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks it up and feels nice and soft after application.</li>
            <li> hopefully the anti-aging holds true as it claims.</li>
            <li> It goes on the skin smoothly and get absorbed fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Facial Cream does fill in fine lines and wrinkles, as does any reasonably effective skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Super product.</li>
            <li> In addition to using a deep skin cleanser and brightening this facial cream is excellent.  </li>
            <li> but I still tend to get some mild acne around the edges of my face.</li>
            <li> I think it would be good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fully absorbed within 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fully absorbed within 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems like a nice facial cream.</li>
            <li> DIDNT SEEM AS GOOD AS IT WAS IN PINK JAR</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it is unscented, blends in quickly, and my skin did not react to the lotion.</li>
            <li> claims of \\&quot;Allergy Tested, Non GMO (not genetically engineered), Vegan, Gluten Free and Never Tested on Animals\\&quot; are all well and good, however there&#x27;s enough in the way of chemicals in eb5 to make necessary a safety warning of \\&quot;Discontinue use if irritation occurs.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> claims of \\&quot;Allergy Tested, Non GMO (not genetically engineered), Vegan, Gluten Free and Never Tested on Animals\\&quot; are all well and good, however there&#x27;s enough in the way of chemicals in eb5 to make necessary a safety warning of \\&quot;Discontinue use if irritation occurs.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff, for when it&#x27;s absorbed in the skin there&#x27;s evidence that it helps build a body&#x27;s Vitamin E content.&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl alcohol is fatty and is used as a thickener in cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Many of my moisturizers and lotions that I use constantly seem to absorb right into the skin and dissipate.  </li>
            <li> The summer has been so hot and</li>
            <li> The label recommends preparing your skin first with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My normal routine for facial moisturizers is to apply a Vitamin C serum then a moisturizer of some kind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but I am enjoying it and can actually see some results.</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years now and still love it along with the cleanser and toner.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream!</li>
            <li> This cream is light, has no gross smell, blends in quickly and keeps my face from drying out without making it break-out.  </li>
            <li> Using both leaves my skin super soft all day!</li>
            <li> I will for sure continue to use to cream for the long term.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not the petrochemicals that concern me so much as the Vitamin A. Amazon does not permit the posting of outside links, but if you do a search on \\&quot;the problem with Vitamin A\\&quot;, you&#x27;ll find that there is real concern about the addition of that vitamin to many sunscreens as this antioxidant - used to fight skin aging -</li>
            <li> I have had no bad reactions to using this cream and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive nose either as it doesn&#x27;t have added fragrance.  </li>
            <li> From my wife Sarah: Very simply, this does a decent job of moisturizing and is made of some cleaner ingredients than most products, but it&#x27;s got some issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , so this product may be better for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick, light beige cream with a very mild oatmeal scent, which fades away quickly.</li>
            <li> More dry</li>
            <li> When ingested in large quantities it may accelerate the development of cancer (see WIKIPEDIA article), but it&#x27;s a trace ingredient</li>
            <li> And my large pores and blackheads are shrinking.  </li>
            <li> I have very dehydrated skin.  </li>
            <li> is an unusual one.</li>
            <li> My sister disagrees, saying she really dislikes the smell.</li>
            <li> eb5&#x27;s facial cream goes on smooth, not greasy, and softens and moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this a lot (it has a reasonable price) but it is not for me.</li>
            <li> I only use it at night as I use a light moisturizer plus SPF in the morning.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizing product that&#x27;s free of all the things I listed above, this will work.</li>
            <li> For those with oily skin this may be too much.</li>
            <li> And too much \\&quot;A\\&quot; can lead to toxicity issues which range--scarily -- from liver damage to osteoporosis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different skin care items ranging from drug store varieties, to the more expensive products offered by Sephora &amp; Khiel&#x27;s, so I consider this product a relatively low-cost option for skin care which yields good results.  </li>
            <li> and also this is a good, not spectacular, product.</li>
            <li> So far, I can tell a noticeable difference in how smooth and soft my skin feels.</li>
            <li> With what I&#x27;d deem &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; use (sparing), I think this could last a year and is actually a very economical addition to a moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> With what I&#x27;d deem &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; use (sparing), I think this could last a year and is actually a very economical addition to a moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> I found zero scent at all which is a refreshing change from other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fantastic, uncommon and very difficult to find.</li>
            <li> But it absorbed in quickly and left my face feeling soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> nothing special - I had liked the eb 5 Facial Cream which I liked a lot under the subscribe and save program ( now it&#x27;s double expensive here).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But I recently tried one that had natural ingredients and was fine</li>
            <li> eems less exotic, somehow....safer.</li>
            <li> This left my skin smooth and soft, but not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This left my skin smooth and soft, but not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s truly anti-aging or not remains to be seen, but a big plus is that it contains natural ingredients, is allergy tested, is fragrance free, and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li> am guessing the main culprit is the mineral oil, whose main purpose is to sit on your skin and prevent moisture from leaving your skin.  </li>
            <li> Still, after I rub it into the rest of my face it seems to do a decent job of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is labeled an anti-aging cream, but it doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients like retinol that are normally associated with wrinkle removal.</li>
            <li> My skin is thin and fair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of oily and thick, and I feel like I have to wash my hands to get it off my fingers after.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality lotion/cream that works well into your skin and leaves it feeling new again.</li>
            <li> While it does a nice job of moisturizing, I don&#x27;t like the heavy feel of it, especially on my nose and hands.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a nice thick cream</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and to smells and this bothers neither, thank goodness.  </li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m very conscious of preventative measures and do whatever I can to take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive and it does not cause me any allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not especially sensitive to any particular chemical or products, but there have been rare occasions where my skin is left dry or itchy with certain treatments (though this is rare).</li>
            <li> But because Sun is a big part of aging, be aware there is no SPF</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many anti-aging creams in the past and they never seemed to do anything.</li>
            <li> My main issues are a lot of fine lines around my eyes, deep wrinkles running from my nose to my mouth, and various lesser wrinkles running across my forehead.</li>
            <li> one is nothing special - You can buy any other of the shelve cream</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t really an all-natural product, although there are natural ingredients such as oat flour and comfrey root.</li>
            <li> My face feels so so soft.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s odorless, hypo-allergenic, and works reasonably well even without the companion products, I rate EB5 Facial Cream it at 4 stars (\\&quot;I like it\\&quot; on the official Amazon scale).</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old.</li>
            <li> I used it for nearly a week based on what stuck to the insert in the lid.</li>
            <li> While I do have wrinkles, I have sensitive skin and am still prone to zits.</li>
            <li> This facial cream is certainly very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to comment on the anti-aging property of this cream.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and combination (oily T zone).  </li>
            <li> This makes its very inappropriate for use during the day, especially if you need to (or want to) wear make-up.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and lines</li>
            <li> It just seems natural and doesn&#x27;t affect sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Though it has some natural ingredients, it also has some of the chemical-sounding ingredients you&#x27;ll find in non-natural brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With Eb5, my skin just feels soft and hydrated - no trace of irritation.  </li>
            <li> so far - knock</li>
            <li> Also, because it is in a jar, you can be sure you get every last bit out of it, unlike some of the pump bottles I currently use (and open up to get the last third of the lotion out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a particularly pleasant odor, but not terribly offensive.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would do with such a thick cream, but no breakouts have occurred while using the cream, so it seems to be doing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, for the purpose of assessing a new product, I stop using all products except the tested one (so I only used this one during my assessment phase - no vitamin C, no other moisturizer).</li>
            <li> I have a lot of experience from which to gauge the effectiveness of this product relative to others, but only with my particular skin</li>
            <li> This EB5 FACIAL CREAM is fragrance-free, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However those with sensitive skin (especially sensitivity to mineral oil) should look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> and I have barely put a dent in it.  </li>
            <li> What goes on heavy feeling is absorbed within minutes here - no residual shininess/stickiness.  </li>
            <li> I knocked off one star  because I really think the description should include the other ingredients in the lotion</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days, and haven&#x27;t noticed any real changes other than the fact that my skin feels moisturized.</li>
            <li> But it has been tough to deal with because most anti-wrinkle creams are too greasy and make me break-out, especially during the summer.  </li>
            <li> Every now and then, I have tried a new cream on the market, but I never stay with it very long before I return to eb5.  </li>
            <li> and so far, no major zits, though an area on my chin looks like it could break out soon</li>
            <li> (See WIKIPEDIA for manufacturers&#x27; claims of its benefits.)&lt;br /&gt;Ethylhexylglycerin is frequently used to treat eczema and as a deodorizer.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd to last ingredient, Panthenol is a B5 acid that aids in moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out or make it too oily.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to slather it on--it&#x27;s quickly absorbed, and a small amount gives you a lot of coverage.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (Just as a data point, Norway limited the concentration of retinol palmitate in cosmetics to 0.55% prior to standardization of such product regulation under the EU.)ration of retinol palmitate in cosmetics to 0.55% prior to standardization of such product regulation under the EU.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with mineral oil based products before and wish I would have seen that that was one of the main ingredients in this before trying it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this product is very different from other applications because it is super thick and concentrated.</li>
            <li> and I initially worried that it would be greasy on my face for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because I loved how it went on under my makeup without looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the product will last a very long time that way</li>
            <li> With this, my skin is smoother with less wrinkles, while it is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Acts as healing cream on minor cuts and sunburn too.</li>
            <li> and I hope it will be around for a long time to come</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a lot of cosmetics and lotions, especially on the face, due to allergies.  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive and hasn&#x27;t broken out thus far.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face with regular Ivory soap which tends to leave it dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Lines were definitely less visible, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me a tight Botox-like line-free face nor did it make me look 25 again, but it definitely diminished lines and plumped skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted that one is for dry skin and the other&#x27;s often used as make-up remover,&lt;br /&gt;yet</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s also used to oil nuts and bolts!)&lt;br /&gt;Avena sativa is wild oats, commonly used to support hormone levels in men.&lt;br /&gt;Carbomer is made from acrylic acid.</li>
            <li> So I tend to be careful as to what I put on</li>
            <li> Naturally anything going on my face is going to make its way to my eyes, even in very small amounts, so that concerns me.</li>
            <li> think this would have been too heavy a product for me even five years ago, but my combination skin, which used to be dry only in winter, has year round dryness issues these days.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use other retinol products, which should help mitigate</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice that when applying the EB5 cream, it is actually quite thick and leaves a residue on your face.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it as a day cream but maybe the sensation would be less annoying as a night cream.</li>
            <li> Maybe if i wore make-up every day, i would be accustomed to this odd sensation of having my face covered.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricy which is why I gave it 4/5 stars but compared to department stores, this is average in price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a month</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to finding out about this trick, I would just waste all my money.</li>
            <li> The difference between this and my usual moisturizers was immediate in terms of appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the anti-wrinkle claims.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This goes on feeling very heavy</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a 4oz jar, which I thought might be small, but it&#x27;s not as the cream is so thick you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried things like coconut oil to moisturize in the past, but non-allergenic (for me) doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean non-comedogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately two and a half weeks at this point.</li>
            <li> but there is so hard for me to tell whether it is working for that.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I have been afraid to try any facial cream.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s thick, it hasn&#x27;t been too oily for my skin.</li>
            <li> cream feels thick and luscious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d not buy this due to the mineral oil and the unpleasant sensation on my face.</li>
            <li> A little knowledge is a heck of an inconvenient thing.)  </li>
            <li> the a/c stays on all the time and that has made it worse.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a thin film, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like sun screen/moisturizer products.  </li>
            <li> (And I don&#x27;t want wrinkly, skin damaged skin, or worse, skin cancer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Phenoxyethanol is an insect repellent also a topical antiseptic.&lt;br /&gt;Aminomethyl propanol is an acid neutralizer.&lt;br /&gt;Potassium</li>
            <li> The product is unscented, meaning it smells faintly of oats.</li>
            <li> It ended up causing horrible breakouts on my face after only a couple days of use</li>
            <li> Unfortunately as a side effect it can cause bacteria to build up on the surface of your skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is marketed as an anti-aging cream (impossible to test).  </li>
            <li> I told my friends about this combo and they were as shocked as I was when they saw the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Super product. Acts as healing cream on minor cuts and sunburn too.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t choose to take this but since there didn&#x27;t seem to be too many ingredients with too many chemicals I decided to give it a try.  I have very dehydrated skin.  The summer has been so hot and the a/c stays on all the time and that has made it worse.  Many of my moisturizers and lotions that I use constantly seem to absorb right into the skin and dissipate.  This cream doesn&#x27;t seem to do that.  It actually feels like it seals in the moisture and stays there without feeling greasy. My face feels so so soft.  I know this is an anti-aging cream but there is so hard for me to tell whether it is working for that.  I do love this as a moisturizer.  I have very sensitive skin and to smells and this bothers neither, thank goodness.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This EB5 FACIAL CREAM is fragrance-free, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. You don&#x27;t need to slather it on--it&#x27;s quickly absorbed, and a small amount gives you a lot of coverage.  It leaves a thin film, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like sun screen/moisturizer products.  The label recommends preparing your skin first with [[ASIN:B00LHZC4PG EB5 Cleanser]] and [[ASIN:B00P8F3MRK EB5 Toner]] (a step that I skipped).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EB5 Facial Cream does fill in fine lines and wrinkles, as does any reasonably effective skin moisturizer.  This product is marketed as an anti-aging cream (impossible to test).  Because it&#x27;s odorless, hypo-allergenic, and works reasonably well even without the companion products, I rate EB5 Facial Cream it at 4 stars (\\&quot;I like it\\&quot; on the official Amazon scale).</li>
            <li> Before I talk about my experience with this product, I&#x27;d like to describe my skin because I believe that each person&#x27;s individual body chemistry impacts how well a product works for them. I am 50 years old. My skin is thin and fair. It is not especially sensitive to any particular chemical or products, but there have been rare occasions where my skin is left dry or itchy with certain treatments (though this is rare). My main issues are a lot of fine lines around my eyes, deep wrinkles running from my nose to my mouth, and various lesser wrinkles running across my forehead. My normal routine for facial moisturizers is to apply a Vitamin C serum then a moisturizer of some kind. I rotate products to give my skin a different experience. However, for the purpose of assessing a new product, I stop using all products except the tested one (so I only used this one during my assessment phase - no vitamin C, no other moisturizer). I wash my face with regular Ivory soap which tends to leave it dry and tight. I have a lot of experience from which to gauge the effectiveness of this product relative to others, but only with my particular skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this as directed twice a day - at night after a shower and again in the morning. The difference between this and my usual moisturizers was immediate in terms of appearance. Lines were definitely less visible, especially around my eyes. It didn&#x27;t give me a tight Botox-like line-free face nor did it make me look 25 again, but it definitely diminished lines and plumped skin. I was impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product is very different from other applications because it is super thick and concentrated. I used it for nearly a week based on what stuck to the insert in the lid. You should use it very sparingly for best results given that it has mineral oil in it. Also, the product will last a very long time that way and you really don&#x27;t need more. I dotted it on my skin in a regularly spaced fashion then rubbed it in. This left my skin smooth and soft, but not oily or greasy at all. It&#x27;s fully absorbed within 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time of this review, the price for a 4-oz. jar is around $28. With what I&#x27;d deem &amp;#34;proper&amp;#34; use (sparing), I think this could last a year and is actually a very economical addition to a moisturizing routine. I&#x27;ve used a lot of very good products for skin care. This is definitely one that I&#x27;d add to that list.hen rubbed it in. This left my skin smooth and soft, but not oily or greasy at all.

            <li> I have used EB5 since it came on the market.  I am over 80 and am relatively unwrinkled!</li>
            <li> eb5 is the only facial cream I will ever use.  I have used it for many years and am completely satisfied with this cream.  Every now and then, I have tried a new cream on the market, but I never stay with it very long before I return to eb5.  Great product, great results on my skin and I don&#x27;t plan on using anything else.</li>
            <li> eb5 has the consistency of [[ASIN:B00430CRX6 NOXEMA clean cream]] but without the mediciney aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted that one is for dry skin and the other&#x27;s often used as make-up remover,&lt;br /&gt;yet a quick comparison of ingredients is most revealing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOXEMA&lt;br /&gt;Water (aqua), stearic acid, linum usitatissimum (linseed) seed oil, glycine soja (soybean) oil, fragrance (parfum), propylene glycol, gelatin, camphor, ammonium hydroxide, menthol, sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eb5&lt;br /&gt;water (aqua), propylene glycol, tocopheryl acetate, mineral oil (paraffinum liquidum), stearic acid, cetyl alcohol, avena sativa (oat) kernel flour, phenoxyethanol, silica, aminomethyl propanol, carbomer, potassium sorbate, allantoin, ethylhexylglycerin, panthenol, retinyl palmitate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOXEMA eems less exotic, somehow....safer.

This is the good stuff, for when it&#x27;s absorbed in the skin there&#x27;s evidence that it helps build a body&#x27;s Vitamin E content.&lt;br /&gt;Cetyl alcohol is fatty and is used as a thickener in cosmetics.

(See WIKIPEDIA for manufacturers&#x27; claims of its benefits.)&lt;br /&gt;Ethylhexylglycerin is frequently used to treat eczema and as a deodorizer.&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd to last ingredient, Panthenol is a B5 acid that aids in moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Retinyl palmitate is a synthetic Vitamin A.

            <li> While I do have wrinkles, I have sensitive skin and am still prone to zits. So I tend to be careful as to what I put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that I was initially leery about putting this cream on my face - it&#x27;s a thicker white cream that reminds me of some of your cheaper hand creams. On the positive side, it is unscented, blends in quickly, and my skin did not react to the lotion. My skin did feel softer, though I don&#x27;t think it improved my wrinkles or fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week and so far, no major zits, though an area on my chin looks like it could break out soon, so this product may be better for those with dry skin. Overall, it&#x27;s a good cream, but seems a tad pricey.</li>
            <li> This facial cream is certainly very moisturizing. My skin drinks it up and feels nice and soft after application. I&#x27;m not sure about the anti-wrinkle claims. The product is unscented, meaning it smells faintly of oats. Not a particularly pleasant odor, but not terribly offensive. My sister disagrees, saying she really dislikes the smell.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have noted, the &amp;#34;five combined items&amp;#34; pitch is a bit misleading. However, this product definitely works for me.  Although it&#x27;s thick, it hasn&#x27;t been too oily for my skin. I feel like my skin can use the additional heft.  My skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive and hasn&#x27;t broken out thus far.  I&#x27;ve tried many different skin care items ranging from drug store varieties, to the more expensive products offered by Sephora &amp; Khiel&#x27;s, so I consider this product a relatively low-cost option for skin care which yields good results.  I knocked off one star  because I really think the description should include the other ingredients in the lotion and also this is a good, not spectacular, product. So, a solid performer in the skin care line.</li>
            <li> This makes you face feel really good.</li>
            <li> This is labeled an anti-aging cream, but it doesn&#x27;t have the ingredients like retinol that are normally associated with wrinkle removal. Instead I think the benefit is that it is a really nice moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on feeling very heavy and I initially worried that it would be greasy on my face for a long time. But it absorbed in quickly and left my face feeling soft but not greasy. I think it would be good for dry skin. This is the kind of moisturizer you might want to start before wrinkles are an issue, just to keep you skin in good condition.  But because Sun is a big part of aging, be aware there is no SPF so you&#x27;ll need some Sun protection.</li>
            <li> I have convo skin and I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve had pretty good looking skin but now I&#x27;m very conscious of preventative measures and do whatever I can to take care of my skin.  In addition to using a deep skin cleanser and brightening this facial cream is excellent.  There is no obnoxious fragrance or greasy residue, which are big pluses for me.  So far in very happy and glad to recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good facial cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately two and a half weeks at this point. So far, I can tell a noticeable difference in how smooth and soft my skin feels. It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but I am enjoying it and can actually see some results. It is very creamy and smells wonderful. I&#x27;m hoping I will continue to have good results the longer I use it.</li>
            <li> Maybe if i wore make-up every day, i would be accustomed to this odd sensation of having my face covered.</li>
            <li> My wife is a fan. eb5&#x27;s facial cream goes on smooth, not greasy, and softens and moisturizes your skin. Whether it&#x27;s truly anti-aging or not remains to be seen, but a big plus is that it contains natural ingredients, is allergy tested, is fragrance free, and isn&#x27;t tested on animals. This is a high quality lotion/cream that works well into your skin and leaves it feeling new again.</li>
            <li> A great product for your face! Have used this for several years now and still love it along with the cleanser and toner. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This seems like a nice facial cream. It&#x27;s a thick, light beige cream with a very mild oatmeal scent, which fades away quickly. It goes on the skin smoothly and get absorbed fairly quickly. I have dry, sensitive skin and it&#x27;s moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction, nor does it leave a greasy or oily feel.  I have been using this cream for over 2 weeks now. It&#x27;s too early to comment on the anti-aging property of this cream. As a moisturizer, it works great. It makes my skin feel noticeably softer and smoother. I&#x27;ll probably use it as a night cream since it doesn&#x27;t have any sunscreen in it. Though it&#x27;s suitable for day use as well if you don&#x27;t need a sunscreen. All in all, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and hopefully the anti-aging holds true as it claims.</li>
            <li> About four years ago, I tried an anti-wrinkle cream and broke out in hives on my face that lasted for two days. Since then, I have been afraid to try any facial cream. But I recently tried one that had natural ingredients and was fine so I tried this one today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, hives, no redness, no irritation and my face feels hydrated.  One of the best things about EB5 is that there is no fragrance. This cream was delivered to my mail box yesterday and it was 104 degrees outside. I picked up this morning and it didn&#x27;t separate or melt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels thick and luscious. I noticed that it is not tested on animals (great) and it is (vegan). I am allergic to eggs so don&#x27;t want any part of eggs in my face cream! A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for great moisturizers for sensitive skin and was excited to get this to review through the Amazon Vine program.  It ended up causing horrible breakouts on my face after only a couple days of use and I had to discontinue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice smooth cream.  It absorbed quickly into the skin and my skin felt nice and smooth after using it.  I used it both before bed and under my makeup in the morning.  It was really a great moisturizer to use under my makeup; having it on made my makeup go on smoother and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I started to get red bumps all over my forehead and cheeks a couple days after using it.  It was awful and it&#x27;s taken a couple weeks to recover from.  I was really disappointed because I loved how it went on under my makeup without looking greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am guessing the main culprit is the mineral oil, whose main purpose is to sit on your skin and prevent moisture from leaving your skin.  Unfortunately as a side effect it can cause bacteria to build up on the surface of your skin.  I&#x27;ve had trouble with mineral oil based products before and wish I would have seen that that was one of the main ingredients in this before trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product will work well for some people.  However those with sensitive skin (especially sensitivity to mineral oil) should look elsewhere.  I am going to continue to use my Acure Day Cream.  The Acure Day Cream smells great and has actually significantly improved my skin quality and reduced wrinkling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for over 15 years. People can&#x27;t believe my age.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a nice thick cream and I&#x27;m really enjoying it.  My skin is sensitive and combination (oily T zone).  I have had no bad reactions to using this cream and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive nose either as it doesn&#x27;t have added fragrance.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how my skin would do with such a thick cream, but no breakouts have occurred while using the cream, so it seems to be doing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is a cream for day or night, I use it mostly at night because during the day I use a face lotion with spf as I am fair skinned and prone to freckles and sunburn in the Florida sun.  (And I don&#x27;t want wrinkly, skin damaged skin, or worse, skin cancer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 4oz jar, which I thought might be small, but it&#x27;s not as the cream is so thick you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your face.  Also, because it is in a jar, you can be sure you get every last bit out of it, unlike some of the pump bottles I currently use (and open up to get the last third of the lotion out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this cream and interested to see how my skin looks after a month.</li>
            <li> nothing special - I had liked the eb 5 Facial Cream which I liked a lot under the subscribe and save program ( now it&#x27;s double expensive here).&lt;br /&gt;This one is nothing special - You can buy any other of the shelve cream</li>
            <li> I chose this based upon the advertised ingredients not knowing a prime ingredient was mineral oil. I dislike petroleum products in my face care regime. I found this cream thicker than most face creams. I found zero scent at all which is a refreshing change from other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with this cream was that it felt chalky on my face and that feeling never went away. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it as a day cream but maybe the sensation would be less annoying as a night cream. I&#x27;d not buy this due to the mineral oil and the unpleasant sensation on my face. I wanted to like this a lot (it has a reasonable price) but it is not for me.</li>
            <li> I have used EB5 for many years and I have been very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very senstive and I have never had a reaction to the cream.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and I hope it will be around for a long time to come</li>
            <li> I really like this cream! I use it just as told and it has been working wonders. I&#x27;ve used many anti-aging creams in the past and they never seemed to do anything. To be honest I had my doubts about this product, but I read about the use of this product combination with a Vitamin C serum, and now I&#x27;m seeing legitimate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to finding out about this trick, I would just waste all my money. This cream is a great price and actually works when you pair it with a Vitamin C like this. The trick is actually quite simple. You&#x27;ll notice that when applying the EB5 cream, it is actually quite thick and leaves a residue on your face. This makes its very inappropriate for use during the day, especially if you need to (or want to) wear make-up. However, if you only use this at night, and then use the Vitamin C during the day, you&#x27;ll get the benefits of both with no issues. The Vitamin C serum is very light on your face, so it&#x27;s appropriate for use with make-up or sunscreen. The EB5 cream is thicker, and great for application during the night. Using both leaves my skin super soft all day! I would recommend it to anyone. I told my friends about this combo and they were as shocked as I was when they saw the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a little over a month and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Being a mother of toddlers, I have a lot on my plate and it definitely showed my skin. With this, my skin is smoother with less wrinkles, while it is extremely soft. It seems like it even has a glow. It does not dry my skin out or make it too oily. Its great under make up. I will for sure continue to use to cream for the long term. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 12 days and have seen very good results.  I am in my early 40&#x27;s and lines are starting to creep in around eyes, mouth and forehead.  I also have fair skin and some aging spots are showing up.  But it has been tough to deal with because most anti-wrinkle creams are too greasy and make me break-out, especially during the summer.  I feel like I have a film over my face!  I have huge pores and combination skin.  More dry but I still tend to get some mild acne around the edges of my face. Nothing seems to work ALL of my issues - until now.  This cream is light, has no gross smell, blends in quickly and keeps my face from drying out without making it break-out.  And my large pores and blackheads are shrinking.  I am extremely happy I tried this cream and I have barely put a dent in it.  I only use it at night as I use a light moisturizer plus SPF in the morning.  It just seems natural and doesn&#x27;t affect sensitive skin.  Very impressed.  It is a little pricy which is why I gave it 4/5 stars but compared to department stores, this is average in price.  I do recommend.  One jar will last about 2 months is my guess.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for many years.  Must be good.</li>
            <li> From my wife Sarah: Very simply, this does a decent job of moisturizing and is made of some cleaner ingredients than most products, but it&#x27;s got some issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I love that it&#x27;s gluten free and fragrance-free. It&#x27;s also paraben-free, vegan, and non-GMO. That&#x27;s fantastic, uncommon and very difficult to find. I&#x27;m very sensitive and it does not cause me any allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t care for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I wish it had a better texture. While it does a nice job of moisturizing, I don&#x27;t like the heavy feel of it, especially on my nose and hands. It&#x27;s kind of oily and thick, and I feel like I have to wash my hands to get it off my fingers after. Still, after I rub it into the rest of my face it seems to do a decent job of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t care for the fact that you can&#x27;t use it around your eyes. In fact it says that you must avoid your eyes, lids and lashes. Naturally anything going on my face is going to make its way to my eyes, even in very small amounts, so that concerns me. I would also have liked to have the ability to use it in my under eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Though it has some natural ingredients, it also has some of the chemical-sounding ingredients you&#x27;ll find in non-natural brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days, and haven&#x27;t noticed any real changes other than the fact that my skin feels moisturized. If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizing product that&#x27;s free of all the things I listed above, this will work. For those with oily skin this may be too much.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this product. I can&#x27;t use a lot of cosmetics and lotions, especially on the face, due to allergies.  With Eb5, my skin just feels soft and hydrated - no trace of irritation.  And no clogged pores! I&#x27;ve tried things like coconut oil to moisturize in the past, but non-allergenic (for me) doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean non-comedogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would have been too heavy a product for me even five years ago, but my combination skin, which used to be dry only in winter, has year round dryness issues these days.  What goes on heavy feeling is absorbed within minutes here - no residual shininess/stickiness.  I&#x27;ve had no blemish reactions so far - knock wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t really an all-natural product, although there are natural ingredients such as oat flour and comfrey root. But it&#x27;s not the petrochemicals that concern me so much as the Vitamin A. Amazon does not permit the posting of outside links, but if you do a search on \\&quot;the problem with Vitamin A\\&quot;, you&#x27;ll find that there is real concern about the addition of that vitamin to many sunscreens as this antioxidant - used to fight skin aging - can potentially speed the growth of cancerous tumors where skin is exposed to sunlight.  And too much \\&quot;A\\&quot; can lead to toxicity issues which range--scarily -- from liver damage to osteoporosis.  But we are talking some big doses, here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of an abundance of caution, I&#x27;m using this as a night cream only, and will be researching my daytime products, some of which contain sunscreen, to see if any of these contain Vitamin A.  (Yeah.  A little knowledge is a heck of an inconvenient thing.)  I don&#x27;t use other retinol products, which should help mitigate any Vitamin A toxicity concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Eb5 would do well to disclose the concentration of added vitamins in their products on the label and where it is sold and advertised, in a manner similar to disclosures on nutritional supplements.  (Just as a data point, Norway limited the concentration of retinol palmitate in cosmetics to 0.55% prior to standardization of such product regulation under the EU.)ration of retinol palmitate in cosmetics to 0.55% prior to standardization of such product regulation under the EU.)</li>
            <li> I love this cream would buy it again thanks so much !!!</li>
            <li> DIDNT SEEM AS GOOD AS IT WAS IN PINK JAR---I LOVED THAT STUFF AND IT DEFINITLY WORKED. HAS FORMULA CHANGED?</li>
            <li> Still the best  value around.  5 creams in one.  Been using for over 30 years.  No wrinkles yet!</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cream on the market. I have used it for years. It is excellent anti aging cream.</li>
            <li> Great Product,  My skin  looks smooth and hydrated. Great Stuff!</li>
