            <li>Works great, I can fit all my fingers in at once.</li>
            <li>Great light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for over two years.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, does its job perfectly &amp; I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li>Timer buttons on the top.  </li>
            <li>I love it and</li>
            <li>Cured Gel perfectly, I even used 3 different brands (gelish, orlyfx, envy) with no problems.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Going to have to buy a better brand.</li>
            <li>wash, cleanse, ph bond, foundation, two coats of color, top it off and cleanse using light coats of each application.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and take anywhere with you.  </li>
            <li>Works for me, one hand fits fine in it.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because the light is compact and easy to use with the four preset timers at the front.</li>
            <li>Plus you don&#x27;t have to replace the bulbs, unlike the UV light which got weaker as time went on.</li>
            <li>This light did not work for my nails at all.</li>
            <li>Dries gel coats so fast!!!</li>
            <li>great lamp, light comfortable and dry all gels.</li>
            <li>Also, there are so many little LEDs that you get good coverage over nails, regardless of your position.  </li>
            <li>This is my first LED light</li>
            <li>Easy to control adjustments and fast results.</li>
            <li>I was able to cure my whole hand at one time instead fingers first then thumbs.</li>
            <li>it is the best &amp; only takes 30&#x27;&#x27; to dry gel.</li>
            <li>I got this and have used it a few times with great results.  </li>
            <li>Works great and dried LED polish gels in seconds.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this light.</li>
            <li>It is extremely fast drying which is great, but the portal into which one places your hand isn&#x27;t wide enough to include your thumb nail effectively.  </li>
            <li>Much faster than the UV light I had that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>I love that it is deep and wide enough to fit my hand in it without touching the top or backside.  </li>
            <li>My first review ever.</li>
            <li>My last LED did not have as many lights, and sometimes the sides took longer to set</li>
            <li>I used all the same products and tried twice; my nails do not look or feel as nice as with my old dryer.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used only 3 brands of polish; harmony gelish, LeChat, and DIY hard nails, and it works perfect.</li>
            <li>Wife absolutely loves this product.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this item and the seller.</li>
            <li>Sets my gels so much faster than UV.  </li>
            <li>whole hand including thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I ended up having to cure my nails as long as it takes with a uv light.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast, even darker polishes dry fast.</li>
            <li>I had to return the first one I bought which was a different brand name as it was so low in watts - this one is 18W and dries quickly - if you do your nails correctly!  </li>
            <li>I sent it back because I was looking for faster cure times than what a uv light offers.</li>
            <li>So, when my uv dryer&#x27;s bulbs burned out I decided it was cheaper to buy this dryer than new bulbs.</li>
            <li>love this little machine!</li>
            <li>professional use</li>
            <li>my small hand fits fine.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes but I will be sending this back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also done it with the 60 sec timer, but I think 30 sec cures just fine.</li>
            <li>I bought for my daughter who is not a professional and the results are the same to those you get ia a professional salon.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works for me, one hand fits fine in it. I like how it is curved so all angles of your nails get reached. I haven&#x27;t used it on my toenails and don&#x27;t intend to, although it looks roomy enough for me to stick my toes in if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Much faster than the UV light I had that cost twice as much. Plus you don&#x27;t have to replace the bulbs, unlike the UV light which got weaker as time went on. Dries super fast, even darker polishes dry fast.</li>
            <li> Works great, I can fit all my fingers in at once.</li>
            <li> Great size and works well.  Timer buttons on the top.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loves this product.  It is easy to use and take anywhere with you.  She uses this all the time.  Easy to control adjustments and fast results.</li>
            <li> I got this and have used it a few times with great results.  I&#x27;ve used it with China Glaze GELAZE polish and with Gelish on the 30 sec timer. I&#x27;ve also done it with the 60 sec timer, but I think 30 sec cures just fine. Works perfectly. I love that it is deep and wide enough to fit my hand in it without touching the top or backside.  I even did my toes with it! I&#x27;ve had my mani&#x27;s last for 10+ days! Very glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> This item is awesome.  I bought for my daughter who is not a professional and the results are the same to those you get ia a professional salon.  I love it and my daughter too!&lt;br /&gt;The seller is great and responded immmediately to my questions.  I really recommend this item and the seller.</li>
            <li> My first review ever. This has been the worst experience with an LED light. total waste of money. What should have been a less than five-minute gel manicure using a 60-second, one-step gel polish took over 30 minutes. I have to redo all nails as they still smudged.</li>
            <li> Sets my gels so much faster than UV.  Also, there are so many little LEDs that you get good coverage over nails, regardless of your position.  My last LED did not have as many lights, and sometimes the sides took longer to set or I had to reposition my hands</li>
            <li> The lamp works well with Gelish products and with Fingerpaints gel polishes too.</li>
            <li> I love this item!  It works great and is a good size for easy storage.</li>
            <li> This is my first LED light I can&#x27;t believe what a time saver this is compared to my UV! Great product along with a great price. Cured Gel perfectly, I even used 3 different brands (gelish, orlyfx, envy) with no problems.</li>
            <li> Works great, much better than my UV lamp.</li>
            <li> This item is only a 1 star because there is not a choice of 0 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would not work upon arrival, just would not light up at all.&lt;br /&gt;The opening was fairly small.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT buy again.</li>
            <li> This lamp does not work. Blew a fuse the second I plugged it in.</li>
            <li> It is extremely fast drying which is great, but the portal into which one places your hand isn&#x27;t wide enough to include your thumb nail effectively.  My manicurist has used it on several other customers and has found the same thing.  She has to do 4 fingers on both hands, then does the thumbs together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3 stars are given for speed in &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; the gel.  That&#x27;s terrific!</li>
            <li> This is my first led lamp and It works great! So far I&#x27;ve used only 3 brands of polish; harmony gelish, LeChat, and DIY hard nails, and it works perfect. No problems with drying. I&#x27;m very glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> love this little machine!</li>
            <li> Great light. I bought two. One for my daughter. Can get all four  fingers and thumb in also.</li>
            <li> Great service and price</li>
            <li> I love this! work well  my small hand fits fine. has a timer!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Doesn&#x27;t burn your nails.</li>
            <li> Good gel nail dryer.  I had to return the first one I bought which was a different brand name as it was so low in watts - this one is 18W and dries quickly - if you do your nails correctly!  I&#x27;m still just getting the hang of it.  The dryers is a good dryer.  Patience is required in learning to do gel nails! :D</li>
            <li> Works great and dried LED polish gels in seconds.</li>
            <li> it works ! Just as advertised</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  You may as well put your nails next to the bulb in your table lamp!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, does its job perfectly &amp; I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Fits whole hand including thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;For professional use it is the best &amp; only takes 30&#x27;&#x27; to dry gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for over two years. So, when my uv dryer&#x27;s bulbs burned out I decided it was cheaper to buy this dryer than new bulbs. Unfortunately, my nails did not dry as hard as with the uv dryer and started breaking after a week. This never happened with the uv dryer. I used all the same products and tried twice; my nails do not look or feel as nice as with my old dryer. I had high hopes but I will be sending this back.</li>
            <li> I love this machine!  I did my nails in no time. I was able to cure my whole hand at one time instead fingers first then thumbs. Love it!</li>
            <li> They do not cure to perfection. The purpose Of buying these was to save time and to provide excellent quality work. Several customers have come back with smudges and sticky polished nails.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Dries gel coats so fast!!!</li>
            <li> This light did not work for my nails at all. I use gelish soak offs. I followed the directions for that specific machine and they didn&#x27;t cure. Then I followed the directions from gelish for the soak offs and they still didn&#x27;t cure. I do all the steps: wash, cleanse, ph bond, foundation, two coats of color, top it off and cleanse using light coats of each application. I ended up having to cure my nails as long as it takes with a uv light. I sent it back because I was looking for faster cure times than what a uv light offers. I really wanted to like this light. I gave it two stars because the light is compact and easy to use with the four preset timers at the front.</li>
            <li> great lamp, light comfortable and dry all gels. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it, although it takes like 5min to cure. I used gelish and red carpert and it works out.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. No side bulbs to cure thumbs. Going to have to buy a better brand.</li>
            <li> good price for quality of lamp.!</li>
