            <li>Nice and soft.</li>

            <li>Great purchase and doesn&#x27;t break the bank like other makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>You, Beautifully is a wonderful family-owned business, and I&#x27;d definitely purchase again from them in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in more brushes from this line as this is the first one I&#x27;ve used by them.  </li>
            <li>When cleaning use mild or baby shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Now, on to this specific brush... There are so many things I love about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>My new favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>The brush has a long handle which makes it nice to use and it comes with a mesh brush guard to to protect the bristles.</li>
            <li>--that&#x27;s very important for me, as I like to have my brushes preserve their shape while still getting enough air drying</li>
            <li>The shipping was prompt and on time, the instructions included with the brush were very clear and helpful, and I have received a few emails from Be You, Beautiful asking me how everything is going.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, my first thought was it looks highend.</li>
            <li>It is made of hypoallergenic synthetic duo fiber bristles but is still soft yet firm and leaves my face looking and feeling so beautiful.</li>
            <li>The brush does not shed even after the first wash.</li>
            <li>Its the first brush I reach  for when applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>bristles are feathery soft and smooth to touch yet</li>
            <li>Made from super high quality Taklon duo fibers.</li>
            <li>Beautifully brushes and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed at all and their soft bristles and high quality seem to be a great trend that they bide by.</li>
            <li>It is a very pretty brush, too, and looks very professional and high-end.  </li>
            <li>It definitely helps keep the shape of the brush and protect the fine bristles (I highly recommend you use this to store/transport your brush - I&#x27;m sure it will last MUCH longer if you use it.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>they are very dense and thick and give full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The design and packaging of these brushes are really nice too.</li>
            <li>I have done this at least 20 + times and there is still a very good amount of white powdery looking dust coming off of my brush.</li>
            <li>The handle is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>There was absolutely 0 odor when I opened it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and this appears to be a quality product.</li>
            <li>I still washed it, as per the instructions, before the first use, as I always wash new brushes.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>irritation&amp;#34;- however, I did notice a significant amount of white powder in the brush that I received.</li>
            <li>They are great quality and are just like super expensive professional ones.</li>
            <li>The materials are high quality and the feel is very soft.</li>
            <li>It has a nice wooded handle and the bristles have like a ombre look from snow white to black beauty.</li>
            <li>Formatted in white and golden stick it looks very classy.</li>
            <li>Over all overage with an airbrushed finish due to the precise density of our duo</li>
            <li>Your new Stippling Brush comes complete with a BRUSH GUARD which help to keep your brush shape between uses and after cleaning!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am going to believe the professional makeup artists who have said that!</li>
            <li>This stippling brush applies my makeup amazingly and does indeed leave behind an airbrush affect.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are so soft.  </li>
            <li>I washed it with brush cleaner and by the next day it was ready to use.</li>
            <li>The brush held on to my makeup without getting completely soaked into the bristles.</li>
            <li>I love the handle, this is seriously a need to have for ANYONE who even thinks about makeup once a day...  </li>
            <li>This is different than any stippling brush i have had, but this is by far my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I recommend using a tinted moisturizer, BB cream, or other sheer-coverage product, as stippling brushes will apply more product than your ordinary foundation brush and/or your fingers.</li>
            <li>although this stipple brush is not dense,yet soft and fluffy it really does blend my cream concealer and gives it an airbrush effect.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, especially when compared to other similar brushes found at Sephora, Ulta, etc.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>

            <li> This stippling brush applies my makeup amazingly and does indeed leave behind an airbrush affect.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are so soft.  </li>
            <li> I washed it with brush cleaner and by the next day it was ready to use.</li>
            <li> The brush held on to my makeup without getting completely soaked into the bristles.</li>
            <li> I love the handle, this is seriously a need to have for ANYONE who even thinks about makeup once a day...  </li>
            <li> This is different than any stippling brush i have had, but this is by far my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I recommend using a tinted moisturizer, BB cream, or other sheer-coverage product, as stippling brushes will apply more product than your ordinary foundation brush and/or your fingers.</li>
            <li> although this stipple brush is not dense,yet soft and fluffy it really does blend my cream concealer and gives it an airbrush effect.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, especially when compared to other similar brushes found at Sephora, Ulta, etc.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised it did not have the factory smell like some other brushes .</li>
            <li> I personally used it for stippling blush onto my cheeks because I have very heavy handed and always apply way too much.</li>
            <li> THIS one I am going to use ONLY for my liquid foundations as I do believe that this brush will be the missing piece to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I would rank it in the same class of my very high end brushes as far as look, feel and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical in buying this stippling brush at first because I have never heard of this company before.</li>
            <li> It is not visible just looking at the brush, but if you run your fingers over the dry bristles (sort of like fanning the little hairs) you will notice small little dust clouds appear.</li>
            <li> I use this brush everyday.</li>
            <li> I usually use it for my blush and bronzer, I have a comfort there.</li>
            <li> I guess you can say I am somewhat addicted to brushes.</li>
            <li> Weird comparison</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t have thst terrible synthetic feel.</li>

            <li> I LOVE a good stippling brush! If you weren&#x27;t sure, stippling means *dabbing*. It&#x27;s perfect for liquid foundations, blushes, or bronzers. I usually use it for my blush and bronzer, I have a comfort there. THIS one I am going to use ONLY for my liquid foundations as I do believe that this brush will be the missing piece to my daily routine. It is SUCH a great brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is REALLY nice, has a great quality to it! I love the handle, this is seriously a need to have for ANYONE who even thinks about makeup once a day...  It isn&#x27;t dense so it is PERFECT for liquids and the bristles aren&#x27;t rough. Nice and soft like a baby feather. I know... Weird comparison but I can&#x27;t think of anything softer.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;I have read that the brush doesn&#x27;t shed and I am going to believe the professional makeup artists who have said that!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical in buying this stippling brush at first because I have never heard of this company before. They don&#x27;t have their own website aside from their facebook page, and I&#x27;ve yet to see any YouTube beauty gurus review their brushes. However, based on the reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and bought this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came packaged in a beautiful box, and the brush itself looks really sleek and pretty. The materials are high quality and the feel is very soft. I also like how it came with a brush guard that was a mesh instead of plastic--that&#x27;s very important for me, as I like to have my brushes preserve their shape while still getting enough air drying time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the fraction of the price of high end brands, you can&#x27;t beat the exceptional care and craftsmanship put into this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be You, Beautifully is a wonderful family-owned business, and I&#x27;d definitely purchase again from them in the future.</li>
            <li> My new favorite brushes. They are great quality and are just like super expensive professional ones. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This stippling brush by Be You Beautifully is fabulous! I use this brush to apply my BB Cream. Thus brush blends so well! It doesn&#x27;t leave streaky marks and applies my makeup flawlessly. You also won&#x27;t look cakey like you put 10 pounds of makeup on either. Make up application is all about the tools you use! This brush is a must have in your brush collection. *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> I love this stippling brush...love it!  It is by far the best stippling brush I&#x27;ve used.  It has a nice wooden handle that is easy to grip.  The bristles on the brush are so soft.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding or fall out from this at all...and I&#x27;ve washed it twice already.  It is a very pretty brush, too, and looks very professional and high-end.  It does a great job and I&#x27;m impressed.  I&#x27;m interested in more brushes from this line as this is the first one I&#x27;ve used by them.  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for different makeup brushes. I guess you can say I am somewhat addicted to brushes. I have brushes from low to highend. I couldn&#x27;t wait to add this stippling brush to my collection.  I use this brush to blend in my foundation and bronzer. I use it with liquid and powder formulas. It doesn&#x27;t make your makeup clump, it glides across your face smoothly and soft, and if done properly it will leave your face looking flawless.  It has a nice wooded handle and the bristles have like a ombre look from snow white to black beauty. The Be You, Beautifully Deluxe Pro Stippling Brush will provide you with amazing results. This versatile brush can assist with many aspects of makeup application - from start to airbrushed finish!  Each brush is hand-crafted with the highest quality synthetic hair which lasts longer and is non-porous so they will not trap bacteria or product. Your new Stippling Brush comes complete with a BRUSH GUARD which help to keep your brush shape between uses and after cleaning! When cleaning use mild or baby shampoo.  When I received it, it had no smell or defects when I did an inspection. When I first opened it, my first thought was it looks highend. The synthetic hairs don&#x27;t shead.  I highly recommend this stippling brush, it is perfect for beginners to professionals. This brush is also made to last.</li>
            <li> I recieved this stipple brush for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Wow although this stipple brush is not dense,yet soft and fluffy it really does blend my cream concealer and gives it an airbrush effect. The Stipple Me is also great for applying powder products like bronzer and blush. The brush has a long handle which makes it nice to use and it comes with a mesh brush guard to to protect the bristles. I was also surprised it did not have the factory smell like some other brushes . I washed it with brush cleaner and by the next day it was ready to use. Here&#x27;s a collage pic of this fantastic Stipple me brush!</li>
            <li> I just received my bush today and I could not wait to use it. I love how it feels, I love that it does not lose its hairs and It is perfect to apply my foundation. I love that they are never tested on animals. It is made of hypoallergenic synthetic duo fiber bristles but is still soft yet firm and leaves my face looking and feeling so beautiful. Made from super high quality Taklon duo fibers. Over all overage with an airbrushed finish due to the precise density of our duo fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for testing and review purposes, however my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This Pro Stippling Brush by Be You, Beautifully is the first stippling brush I&#x27;ve ever heard of let alone used and I love it! The bristles are very soft and feel amazing on your face. The handle is very sturdy. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of Be You, Beautifully brushes and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed at all and their soft bristles and high quality seem to be a great trend that they bide by. This stippling brush applies my makeup amazingly and does indeed leave behind an airbrush affect. I love it! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Great stippling brush.  Haven&#x27;t had the hairs fall out on my yet.  Product goes onto my face nice and evenly.  Great purchase and doesn&#x27;t break the bank like other makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!  I bought the stippling and fan brush.  Great product</li>
            <li> This is a must have brush in your collection! The handle feels very nice and solid. After it&#x27;s washing it is still just as sturdy as when I pulled it out of the box and had no shedding. I would rank it in the same class of my very high end brushes as far as look, feel and effectiveness. Unlike most brushes I have come across on Amazon, this brush did not have that funny chemical smell that is overpowering and lingers even after washing.&lt;br /&gt;This perfectly made stippling brush is the perfect density to work your foundation or blush onto your face. I personally used it for stippling blush onto my cheeks because I have very heavy handed and always apply way too much. The two levels of bristles made this perfect for applying a light even coat of blush that was very easily blended out. I am overall very happy with this brush and think that everyone should add this to their collection.&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> To begin, This brush is so well made! The white and gold is a perfect combination. The brush does not shed even after the first wash. The bristles are dense and so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works beautifully with creme products which is what I use any stippling brush for. It grabs the right amount of product and it goes amazingly on the face. This is different than any stippling brush i have had, but this is by far my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am by no means a makeup artist, but I can definitely see this used by one. The quality is amazing. It&#x27;s the perfect size and has made it to my everyday use brushes. I am so grateful to have received this brush for my unbiased review. The whole line is beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to own every one!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT brush for so many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH!!!! Stippling brushes are a great tool for anyone to have in their makeup bag. I use this brush everyday. I recommend using a tinted moisturizer, BB cream, or other sheer-coverage product, as stippling brushes will apply more product than your ordinary foundation brush and/or your fingers. Now, on to this specific brush... There are so many things I love about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Price. Very inexpensive, especially when compared to other similar brushes found at Sephora, Ulta, etc.&lt;br /&gt;2. NO SMELL. We all have gotten those brushes that just reek of chemicals , and no amounts of time or washing can get rid of it. Not this brush! There was absolutely 0 odor when I opened it. I still washed it, as per the instructions, before the first use, as I always wash new brushes.&lt;br /&gt;3. No shedding or loosening of the glue. Granted, I have only had this brush for a couple of weeks, but I use it every day and have washed it twice now. There has been no shedding whatsoever and the glue is still holding strong.&lt;br /&gt;4. Comes with a brush guard. This is great!! It definitely helps keep the shape of the brush and protect the fine bristles (I highly recommend you use this to store/transport your brush - I&#x27;m sure it will last MUCH longer if you use it.&lt;br /&gt;5. Customer Service. The shipping was prompt and on time, the instructions included with the brush were very clear and helpful, and I have received a few emails from Be You, Beautiful asking me how everything is going. Their promise that they stand by their products truly feels genuine.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. It has a nice and sturdy handle. Has good weight to it. The bristles don&#x27;t have thst terrible synthetic feel. They feel of very good quality. Nice and soft. I used this brush to apply my foundation. The brush held on to my makeup without getting completely soaked into the bristles. I was able to apply my makeup evenly. I also like that the brush came with a brush guard.  Comes in handy after washing the brush. You can use the brush guard to keep the brushes shape while driving. This brush is great for people of all skill levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I just received this product this afternoon so I can not comment on &amp;#34;Easy to apply&amp;#34; or  &amp;#34;Does this product cause irritation&amp;#34;- however, I did notice a significant amount of white powder in the brush that I received. It is not visible just looking at the brush, but if you run your fingers over the dry bristles (sort of like fanning the little hairs) you will notice small little dust clouds appear. I have done this at least 20 + times and there is still a very good amount of white powdery looking dust coming off of my brush. I purchased this brush as a dup for the MAC 187 brush and so far it looks good. I have a girlfriend who uses the MAC 187 so I will use both and compare. Shipping was fast and this appears to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> This brush  is TERRIFIC &amp; PERFECT  in every way! I love the way the seller  stayed giving me  updates  &amp; even gave instructions on how to clean the brush.Its the first brush I reach  for when applying my makeup. I WILL b using this seller  again.</li>
            <li> Came perfectly as described! Love it! Thanks so much for a great product!</li>
            <li> Brushes from Be you are truely of great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Their stippling brush have duo fiber design which allow it to be used with any medium of make up. They brush is in two layers which gives depth and finish to the make up you apply.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are feathery soft and smooth to touch yet they are very dense and thick and give full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The design and packaging of these brushes are really nice too. Formatted in white and golden stick it looks very classy. One of the best brushes i have used. I was lucky to receive this product under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
