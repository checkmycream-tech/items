            <li>and i liked</li>
            <li>The quality is not that great, rather, adequate, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>this power adapter plug I purchased from Amazon works great certain countries in Europe</li>
            <li>So I guess it was ok.</li>
            <li>This was the cheapest I was able to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is compact &amp; easy to carry when travelling.</li>
            <li>The plug works fine with my Braun Epilator.</li>
            <li>The fit is nice and tight and itw works great.</li>
            <li>It was really cheap so for the cost of this adapter I made it work rather go thru the time an hassle of a return.</li>
            <li>; it was cheap and it works.</li>

            <li>Works exactly as described and nothing can beat its price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This adapter does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>in short check the specs on your EURO adapter to make sure it can work with US</li>
            <li>First week in US, I could not charge my phone, my laptop and tablet.</li>
            <li>It guess I expected to get some cheap dump, considering the price.</li>
            <li>The adapter itself seems to be of adequate quality and probably works fine with the CEE 7/17 style commonly used in France and Germany.  </li>
            <li>The plug was cheap, but the shipping rates high, however when adding the shipping to the price of the 4 plug&#x27;s, it was still cheaper than buying some other plug.</li>
            <li>As the other reviewers have pointed out - the seller makes a killing on high S&amp;H rate - so beware, low item cost is an illusion - you will end up spending much more.  </li>
            <li>current first</li>
            <li>Since we move to America, we need to plug many of our artifacts, the problem now is the power, but this small thing is doing his job</li>
            <li>were exactly the two different style plugs are used.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit tight.</li>
            <li>It is clearly a cheaper quality material adaptor.  </li>
            <li>It arrived shipped directly from China after about a month.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the shipping rates are too high.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it will hold up, but it was cheap</li>
            <li>and this is only an adapter and not a transformer...in which case it was just simpler to buy a new transformer, which I did made for the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> price was right, no shipping, perfect!!</li>
            <li> It guess I expected to get some cheap dump, considering the price. But I was still surprices by how bad the quality was. I have never bought an adaptor before, where the adaptor fell apart when I tried to plugin the European plug!!</li>
            <li> Item mailed from Fremont,CA.  to my address of 100 miles away and the charge was $4.76 for 1oz. Also when I pluged the European 2-pin plug into the adaptor, it was too tight and caused the European plug to break loose. It still works for the shaver, however I will need to obtain another cord entirely. The pits. As they say, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is intended to do. It came through the mail quickly considering I am in Afghanistan at this time, so very happy with my purchase and the speed of which it came</li>
            <li> The plug adapter is exactly what it says it is. It simply changes the plug type from European to US standard. This adapter will will work perfectly as long as the attached device can handle the voltage switch from 240 to 110. (This will not change the voltage only the plug type.)</li>
            <li> Goods received on time and all as described.The quality of the product is OK but less than similar plug adapters bought elsewhere over the past few years.</li>
            <li> My previous review was very negative.  To clarify:  I had no problems with the seller and the product was as advertised,  I am unhappy with the product as I feel it is misleading.  You can&#x27;t take a European product that uses 230v and use this adapter to plug it into us 120v.  Which I fear people might do.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a lamp I purchased in Spain, and it works perfectly. I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all, and have been using it for about 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I bought this plug as I had recently moved to the USA and needed to charge my mobile phone. The plug was cheap, but the shipping rates high, however when adding the shipping to the price of the 4 plug&#x27;s, it was still cheaper than buying some other plug. So I guess it was ok. The quality is not that great, rather, adequate, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described and nothing can beat its price.&lt;br /&gt;It is compact &amp; easy to carry when travelling. nice product</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers have pointed out - the seller makes a killing on high S&amp;H rate - so beware, low item cost is an illusion - you will end up spending much more.  Apart from that, the plug does the job.</li>
            <li> Its really a nice product and I like it.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the shipping rates are too high.  Its almost twice the price of the product itself.  I bought it as I needed it badly otherwise I would have waited to find another seller with lesser shipping rates.</li>
            <li> I was worry about the quality when i bought it, i bought adaptor set from stapples and i paid 23 dollars &#x3D;/ then i lost it,,,i was not going to paid this money again,,,i looked at amazon and i found this and decided to try and i liked</li>
            <li> Just moved from Germany back to the US of A, and needed several of these badly.  Arrived promptly and in good shape.  It does the job I needed it for.  it looks to be of good quality materials.  Would buy again ...</li>
            <li> This was the cheapest I was able to find on Amazon. It does the job. Sits well in the outlet.</li>
            <li> I use this for several tech devices I brought with when after a move to the US from an EU country. It is a bit loose in the wall outlet but works correctly. It arrived shipped directly from China after about a month.</li>
            <li> It is clearly a cheaper quality material adaptor.  Not sure if it will hold up, but it was cheap so will give it a try.  Get what you pay for sometimes.</li>
            <li> This did not solve the problem I was having with some paper shredders I purchased. The amperage of the shredders was inadequate to work properly, even using the proper adaptors.</li>
            <li> We bought this to adapt a digital camera charger we had to buy in Europe while on a vacation.  It works perfect. No complaints. Prongs hold stiff and don&#x27;t flop around.</li>
            <li> This adapter does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The fit is nice and tight and itw works great. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought a cheesy little effects light off Amazon and for some reason it came with Euro type plug. It was really cheap so for the cost of this adapter I made it work rather go thru the time an hassle of a return. Yes, very generic- no packaging whatsoever- just the adapter in a little envelope. Bottom line; it was cheap and it works.</li>
            <li> We ordered two European to USA adaptors for a pair of lamps.  Instead, they sent two USA to European Adaptors!  Won&#x27;t by from them again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit tight. They slip off often. Had to use tape to keep them on.</li>
            <li> I may be that my adapter was not the correct voltage/amperage and this is only an adapter and not a transformer...in which case it was just simpler to buy a new transformer, which I did made for the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short check the specs on your EURO adapter to make sure it can work with US current first or this is useless.</li>
            <li> took forever to come.  but it does the job.  It is a little loose in typical US electrical sockets.</li>
            <li> Good  price and it does what it says on the tin.</li>
            <li> This adapter worked well with the machine that I purchased. but the machine went bad and quit before its time.</li>
            <li> I got this item for free shipping, received it in 3 days using the Amazon prime 30 days free trial. The plug works fine with my Braun Epilator. I should mention  thing, the plug is not exactly as advertised, it hasn&#x27;t got the two  little holes in the metal piece but that doesn&#x27;t affect its job .. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Since we move to America, we need to plug many of our artifacts, the problem now is the power, but this small thing is doing his job</li>
            <li> Its an adaptor that works, what else can I say about it?  It does what it needs to . .</li>
            <li> First week in US, I could not charge my phone, my laptop and tablet. With this, they work perfect as they should.</li>
            <li> Does the job as it was designed to do. No problems.</li>
            <li> The plug works well in North American outlets.  It is well made &amp; should last at least as long as the appliance that it powers.</li>
            <li> this power adapter plug I purchased from Amazon works great certain countries in Europe my wife and son went to rush out to stay at their mothers and this came in very handy for my son to plug and his mother&#x27;s Kindle good company to do business with we are very happy again</li>
            <li> I bought this plug unaware of the different types of plugs used in Europe.  This plug appears to be an adapter for a CEE 7/17 (German/French) plug, which is different than the CEE 7/16 &amp;#34;Europlug&amp;#34; (Type C) which I was trying to adapt.  The Euoplug does not fit properly in this adapter, it is loose and the spring tension just tends to pop it out.  The adapter itself seems to be of adequate quality and probably works fine with the CEE 7/17 style commonly used in France and Germany.  Perhaps someone from Europe could comment on were exactly the two different style plugs are used.</li>
            <li> kind of cheap. but worked.</li>
            <li> been looking for this item for some time..............lost mine years ago...................now I can use my 1960 Philips electric razor again.</li>
