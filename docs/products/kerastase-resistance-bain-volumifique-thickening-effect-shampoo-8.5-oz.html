    <ol>

            <li>This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the value.  </li>
            <li>all keratase products are very good</li>
            <li>Works great and smells good too!</li>
            <li>This shampoo gives great fullness and body to my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a girl who has used drug store brands happily all my life</li>
            <li>Great brand, products and results.</li>
            <li>arrived timely and in great condition.</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>I bought it because my hair stylist said this was a great brand.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I had good results and told my sister she had to buy a bottle too.</li>
            <li>good price to.</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;m just used to it and have come to expect whatever good it does for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, gives a great lather, and provides nice volume on my medium length, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Amazing what fantasy worlds good marketing can create.</li>
            <li>It is a nice shampoo and my hair feels great after using it, but as far as adding volume, I was not all that impressed.  </li>
            <li>I love the product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice shampoo</li>
            <li>Go have a nice lunch and take a friend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo which absolutely keeps my hair in great condition and does add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>Although it lathers up quite nicely while in the shower, it didn&#x27;t perform better than a well-known popular brand of volumizing shampoo which can be purchased for $5-10 (depending on size).  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I remembered being happy with it for volumizing.  </li>
            <li>Also, using the mousse to bring more volume to my very very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Well, I used this shampoo, along with the conditioner for 2 days and my hair feels better than when it started.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Kerastase products.  </li>
            <li>love this shampoo and all of the line,</li>
            <li>I have a feeling this distributor is from China which does not make me feel confident on the quality as most of their products are knock-offs.</li>
            <li>The shampoo leaves my hair fuller and with more body.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo really puts volume in your hair</li>
            <li>Better way to spend your hard-earned dollars.  </li>
            <li>If anything, I may use a bit more than I need since the bottle is so huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There might be something better than this kerastase</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>So okay, instead of being 20x the price</li>
            <li>I tried changing to a different shampoo but this one is the best for fine hair without volume.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it leaves your hair kind of \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; and sort of \\&quot;fly-</li>
            <li>Fine and wavy</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is between chin and shoulder length, thinning, and baby fine.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s fine for me</li>
            <li>having fine limp hair I researched best shampoos for my hair type (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them)</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo hoping for the extra boost, and I got sme great results.</li>
            <li>Now that I am almost  60, I think I would not mind getting old at all if my hair  would not get any thinner and look as good as Paul M&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>As soon as I started using the shampoo, I started to feel a difference in the volume of my hair, as it is very fine, after the first use.</li>
            <li>So worth the money!</li>
            <li>This shampoo provides rich moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>My hair was GUMMY - it felt like it could never be rinsed clean and it felt sticky all the time.</li>
            <li>, I plan on still using product I have, it hasn&#x27;t stripped color and hair is clean,</li>
            <li>and they said that it is true.</li>
            <li>Kerastase is the best shampoo I have found for my weak fine hair.  </li>
            <li>and I believe it helps keep the color from fading as quickly.</li>
            <li>I would gladly pay the high price tag for these types of results.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews and a desire to try something really nice for myself, I splurged and purchased the large, $70 bottle to start using after my child was born, and I was able to start using it the next day.  </li>
            <li>I am always trying new shampoos when I hear about them, looking for something better than the Biolage.  </li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair that has no body whatsoever.</li>
            <li>They are really worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for thin hair.</li>
            <li>This particular shampoo really does make it look like you have more hair.  </li>
            <li>I dont think it is the right choice for me.</li>
            <li>Now, it is full and vibrant and pretty again - yay!  </li>
            <li>It gives my baby fine 62 year old hair so much more body - what else can I possibly say?</li>
            <li>I had a Rock Band back in the 70&#x27;s in high school and college, and always liked the longer hair look of the Beatles, Stones, Zeppelin era.</li>
            <li>Kerastase has stopped making the volumactive, which is my favorite shampoo of all time and the only one ever to leave my hair exactly the way  like it.</li>
            <li>will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Also after only a  week of use, my hair and my scalp were dryer, and dandruff more noticable.  </li>
            <li>:)  leave a comment if you have a similar experience.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth that much.</li>
            <li>Makes my fine limp hair feel so smooth and gives it so much volume!  </li>
            <li>While I think this shampoo is overpriced, the reason it&#x27;s better than the cheapest volumising shampoos is because it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out as much.</li>
            <li>I will spend the extra money and purchase at my salon, I want to see if there is much difference, since I really want volumizing shampoo for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Turns out it really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>My hair had so much chemistry</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews very often</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>It felt like my hair was covered in film, no matter how much I rinsed it.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to have had much effect on my tennis elbow, but I discovered it  leaves my scalp tingling after about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This makes sense to me because the products using Minoxidil really just dilate the blood vessels.  </li>
            <li>and I am really reaching here, is that it lathers up really well</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use as much per wash.</li>
            <li>Everything else I used for fine hair made my hair greasy and flat.</li>
            <li>I found if I shampooed, used a tiny bit of their conditioner, and rinsed with cool water, then blow dry, my hair looked thicker for most of a day or evening.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and scalp dry, with some dandruff, and started thinning when I was in my early 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>- I have fine long hair.</li>
            <li>I was kind of hoping that this shampoo and conditioner wouldn&#x27;t be that great, because it is a little expensive.  </li>
            <li>but my hair is finally starting to get healthy again and growing back.</li>
            <li>THAT is why I ordered the Kerastase, after hearing some older ladies at the place where I get my hair cut rave about it.  </li>
            <li>I picked up a Magic Wand massager several months back, on a lark, to try for my tennis elbow.  </li>
            <li>Based upon its performance and high cost, I would not recommend this product to obtain fuller looking hair.  </li>
            <li>high ratings -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had baby fine hair and not much of it.  </li>
            <li>I have normal hair strands, but they lack volume, so after trying this shampoo for 2 times, I could already see results: the hairs are fuller, and they seem healthier.</li>
            <li>I thought it would work better than my other one of similar type.  </li>
            <li>I actually thought that it weighed my hair down MORE than the other lines of Kerastase, and so would recommend that you stick with the orange and white bottles instead for fine hair.</li>
            <li>There are other products that are nice for half the price.</li>
            <li>all have the same basic chemicals, they just change the color and perfume, rename it and then launch a huge Ad campaign and sell millions till people realize its the same ol SH</li>
            <li>I am 44, and my hair was turning into \\&quot;old lady hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Response was, either old product or a knock off.  </li>
            <li>Save yourself from damaging your hair and go with the natural Biotin.</li>
            <li>this helps another old rock-star out there.  </li>
            <li>child will be 2 1/2 years old at the end of this month.  </li>
            <li>I use the deep conditioners and other shampoos from Kerastase, and so decided to try this volumizing shampoo for fine hair (like mine).</li>
            <li>If I just rinsed with water the next day, it would not blow dry out as full.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo for my fine, straight hair but it is way too expensive or it would have gotten five stars</li>
            <li>In reading the positive reviews, I can only say that either I got an entirely different mix in my bottle, or people who have been supremely ripped off (and seriously, we all know that no shampoo in the world is worth that money), the only way to deal with the shame of having been sucked into the hype, is to pretend it was somehow worth it.  </li>
            <li>I now use a product to spray or massage onto the ends of my long hair to help protect it from sun damage and split ends during the day,(I am outside playing a lot of golf) and help to gently comb out the tangled split ends without pulling hairs out with my brush after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>they only sell directly to salons.  </li>
            <li>I probably have at least two months or more left in the current bottle.  </li>
            <li>Haved fine mature hair with a little buit in curl causing my hair to be limp and frizzy- not anymore.</li>
            <li>Based upon the previous positive reviews of this product, I purchased the Kersastase Volumactive shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for the past year and feel it&#x27;s worth the $$.</li>

            <li> I use the deep conditioners and other shampoos from Kerastase, and so decided to try this volumizing shampoo for fine hair (like mine).</li>
            <li> If I just rinsed with water the next day, it would not blow dry out as full.  </li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo for my fine, straight hair but it is way too expensive or it would have gotten five stars</li>
            <li> In reading the positive reviews, I can only say that either I got an entirely different mix in my bottle, or people who have been supremely ripped off (and seriously, we all know that no shampoo in the world is worth that money), the only way to deal with the shame of having been sucked into the hype, is to pretend it was somehow worth it.  </li>
            <li> I now use a product to spray or massage onto the ends of my long hair to help protect it from sun damage and split ends during the day,(I am outside playing a lot of golf) and help to gently comb out the tangled split ends without pulling hairs out with my brush after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> they only sell directly to salons.  </li>
            <li> I probably have at least two months or more left in the current bottle.  </li>

            <li> Based upon the previous positive reviews of this product, I purchased the Kersastase Volumactive shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for the past year and feel it&#x27;s worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d caution again using too much shampoo as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When the salon I go to told me Kerastase only sells to salons and can only be purchased directly by them, I said the price is half on Amazon.</li>
            <li> - it looked thin and frizzy and kind of dull.  </li>
            <li> It is more expensive than any other product I have tried, but it works.</li>
            <li> It has been so long since I ordered this product</li>
            <li> The exact same thing happened to my sister&#x27;s hair and she&#x27;s not happy with me as you can imagine.</li>
            <li> Half way through the bottle I started to have MAJOR breakage.</li>
            <li> I dont even blow dry my hair after..</li>
            <li> i air dry and jus using this product</li>
            <li> The product made my hair so dry.</li>
            <li> Also, I find I have to alternate with other shampoos or it weighs down my hair after several consecutive uses.</li>
            <li> No more old lady hair for me</li>
            <li> I have thin blond hair and when I first started using this</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your very dry.</li>
            <li> bottle in salon did not say L&#x27;oreal,Canada, and the bottle was a lighter green color and plastic container a different texture,</li>
            <li> I do not use conditioner and wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other shampoo, drugstore and salon products that claim to create volume.  </li>
            <li> seems thicker the last few months because I am pulling less of it out when I brush the  split ends with the tonic applied, and also less falling out because of the scalp massaging with the wand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as my only shampoo since then, and I wash my hair at the least every other day.  </li>
            <li> That must help with the blood circulation a little, because my head itches less, and seems less dry.  </li>
            <li> It is certainly not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Now, a few weeks later, I might have to go up to a medium size hair clip instead of small.</li>
            <li> If there was any slight difference, it was that it was less shiny, due to the alcohol in the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my hair seemed less volumized, in comparison to the $5-10 shampoo, after using this shampoo.   </li>
            <li> After washing and blow drying both with and without conditioner, my hair was NO FULLER than with the Biolage, which is HALF the price.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because I&#x27;m just comparing it to what I&#x27;ve used in the past - e.g. nioxin, pantene and other thickening shampoos, etc.  </li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not only is it less expensive</li>
            <li> I tried a million expensive deep conditioners but it turned out my hair lacked protein and strength.</li>
            <li> Pantene, my usual brand which performs just as well: $0.26 per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your hair is dull and weakened, there is no better brand.</li>
            <li> I like two products for this so far, the Biolage leave-in-tonic, and another called Biosilk when my split ends are bad.</li>
            <li> could mean Kerastase has updated their product</li>
            <li> None of them have ever done anything but make my hair look dirty and flat.  </li>
            <li> I had to have my dark asian hair highlight/balayaged 3 times in a month because of some BAD hairdressing decisions and my hair was the worst it&#x27;s ever been even though I had had color before.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, after this shampoo runs out, I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I guess this was just wrong for my hair</li>
            <li> but I am not impressed that it makes my hair any fuller in appearance</li>
            <li> he was very broken.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> but I find it very expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 5 years and cannot say a bad thing about it.</li>
            <li> This was the worst shampoo I have ever used - do NOT recommend anyone using this awful shampoo - waste of money.</li>
            <li> so yes disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great and smells good too!</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives great fullness and body to my hair. I will always use it!</li>
            <li> I was kind of hoping that this shampoo and conditioner wouldn&#x27;t be that great, because it is a little expensive.  Turns out it really does make a difference.  I am 44, and my hair was turning into \\&quot;old lady hair\\&quot;.  Fine and wavy - it looked thin and frizzy and kind of dull.  Now, it is full and vibrant and pretty again - yay!  No more old lady hair for me, I&#x27;ll continue to cough up the cash.</li>
            <li> Based upon the previous positive reviews of this product, I purchased the Kersastase Volumactive shampoo.  Although it lathers up quite nicely while in the shower, it didn&#x27;t perform better than a well-known popular brand of volumizing shampoo which can be purchased for $5-10 (depending on size).  In fact, my hair seemed less volumized, in comparison to the $5-10 shampoo, after using this shampoo.   Based upon its performance and high cost, I would not recommend this product to obtain fuller looking hair.  Needless to say, after this shampoo runs out, I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> While I think this shampoo is overpriced, the reason it&#x27;s better than the cheapest volumising shampoos is because it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out as much. My hairdresser recommended this for my color treated hair and I believe it helps keep the color from fading as quickly. I recommend searching for the best price you can find and giving Kerastase Volumactive a try. I&#x27;ve used it for the past year and feel it&#x27;s worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I had to have my dark asian hair highlight/balayaged 3 times in a month because of some BAD hairdressing decisions and my hair was the worst it&#x27;s ever been even though I had had color before. My hair was GUMMY - it felt like it could never be rinsed clean and it felt sticky all the time. I tried a million expensive deep conditioners but it turned out my hair lacked protein and strength. Well, I used this shampoo, along with the conditioner for 2 days and my hair feels better than when it started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a girl who has used drug store brands happily all my life but I never knew what damaged hair was like until this experience. If your hair is dull and weakened, there is no better brand. I would gladly pay the high price tag for these types of results.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! My hair has improved a lot after I started using this product. My hair had so much chemistry he was very broken. Now my hair is with another appearance. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I dont even blow dry my hair after.. i air dry and jus using this product it adds volume! will buy over and over</li>
            <li> This product is a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot;. When the salon I go to told me Kerastase only sells to salons and can only be purchased directly by them, I said the price is half on Amazon. Response was, either old product or a knock off.  I contacted Kerastase Customer Service and they said that it is true. they only sell directly to salons.  So I asked, the shampoo I got through Amazon on the back says \\&quot;made in Spain\\&quot;  and L&#x27;oreal, Canada, they said no, that would not be them!  Two stars because the shampoo cleaned my hair, seems O.K.,. I will spend the extra money and purchase at my salon, I want to see if there is much difference, since I really want volumizing shampoo for fine hair. UPDATE: Went to my salon compared my bottle to back of theirs, both said made in Spain, bottle in salon did not say L&#x27;oreal,Canada, and the bottle was a lighter green color and plastic container a different texture, could mean Kerastase has updated their product, I plan on still using product I have, it hasn&#x27;t stripped color and hair is clean, no difference in volume.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo for my fine, straight hair but it is way too expensive or it would have gotten five stars</li>
            <li> If I could give this 0 stars I would. I have thin blond hair and when I first started using this I had good results and told my sister she had to buy a bottle too. Half way through the bottle I started to have MAJOR breakage. My hair became so brittle I had flyaways all over the place from the breaking. The exact same thing happened to my sister&#x27;s hair and she&#x27;s not happy with me as you can imagine. If you want to risk your hair go for it but I wish someone had let me know about the damage this shampoo causes before I bought it. I started using Avalon Biotin thickening shampoo after I tossed this product out. Not only is it less expensive but my hair is finally starting to get healthy again and growing back. Save yourself from damaging your hair and go with the natural Biotin.</li>
            <li> I love Kerastase products.  They are really worth the money.  This particular shampoo really does make it look like you have more hair.  The only drawback is that it leaves your hair kind of \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; and sort of \\&quot;fly-away,\\&quot; so you have to do some styling with hairspray, etc.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo but I find it very expensive for the amount you get. Plus, I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in how my hair feels. I will finish the bottle then probably look around for something else.</li>
            <li> Kerastase has stopped making the volumactive, which is my favorite shampoo of all time and the only one ever to leave my hair exactly the way  like it. Their replacement does not work well and isn&#x27;t even similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair but a lot of it. This shampoo is perfect for me. It gives me shine and body. I do not use conditioner and wash my hair every other day. This seems to work for me. Everything else I used for fine hair made my hair greasy and flat. So worth the money!</li>
            <li> It is definitely not a volumizing shampoo! It is certainly not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the Kerastase Volumactive Volumizing shampoo hoping to see the advertised results. I have normal hair strands, but they lack volume, so after trying this shampoo for 2 times, I could already see results: the hairs are fuller, and they seem healthier. I used to wash my hair every 3 days because it became oily, and now it lasts 1 week without seeing the greasy hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in conjunction with its conditioner, so that may be a reason for such a big improvement in the way my hair looks and feels. It is recommended to change the shampoo every once in a while so the scalp/hair doesn&#x27;t get used to the same environment/chemicals, but I intend to buy Kerastase products from now on. Great brand, products and results.</li>
            <li> arrived timely and in great condition. love this shampoo and all of the line, good price to. will be back for more.</li>
            <li> It is a nice shampoo and my hair feels great after using it, but as far as adding volume, I was not all that impressed.  I would not buy it again because of the price.  There are other products that are nice for half the price.</li>
            <li> It has been so long since I ordered this product I cannot remember the date and I still haven&#x27;t received it.  Although my account was charged immediately.  I have a feeling this distributor is from China which does not make me feel confident on the quality as most of their products are knock-offs.</li>
            <li> I love the product! Haved fine mature hair with a little buit in curl causing my hair to be limp and frizzy- not anymore. I used the shampoo hoping for the extra boost, and I got sme great results. Just ordered Elixir Ultima for extra shine.</li>
            <li> Kerastase is the best shampoo I have found for my weak fine hair.  The shampoo leaves my hair fuller and with more body.  It is more expensive than any other product I have tried, but it works.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  I only use it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo really puts volume in your hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often but I have to for this product.  I&#x27;ve always had baby fine hair and not much of it.  Now that I&#x27;m older, there&#x27;s even less of it.&lt;br /&gt;I debated about buying this for months because of the price.  If you have hair like mine, stop debating and get it immediately!  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other shampoo, drugstore and salon products that claim to create volume.  None of them have ever done anything but make my hair look dirty and flat.  This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> So disappointing. I guess this was just wrong for my hair - I have fine long hair. It felt like my hair was covered in film, no matter how much I rinsed it.</li>
            <li> The product made my hair so dry. Not for me</li>
            <li> I had a Rock Band back in the 70&#x27;s in high school and college, and always liked the longer hair look of the Beatles, Stones, Zeppelin era. Now that I am almost  60, I think I would not mind getting old at all if my hair  would not get any thinner and look as good as Paul M&#x27;s. lol  I have been using Biolage Hydrating shampoo for 20+ years.  My hair is very fine, and scalp dry, with some dandruff, and started thinning when I was in my early 40&#x27;s.  I found if I shampooed, used a tiny bit of their conditioner, and rinsed with cool water, then blow dry, my hair looked thicker for most of a day or evening. If I just rinsed with water the next day, it would not blow dry out as full.  Also by washing my hair everyother day it controlled the dandruff.  I am always trying new shampoos when I hear about them, looking for something better than the Biolage.  THAT is why I ordered the Kerastase, after hearing some older ladies at the place where I get my hair cut rave about it.  RESULTS:  I used it for 2 weeks, and gave it to a girlfriend.  After washing and blow drying both with and without conditioner, my hair was NO FULLER than with the Biolage, which is HALF the price.  Also after only a  week of use, my hair and my scalp were dryer, and dandruff more noticable.  IMHO, all the shampoos marketed by these big companies like Loreal, Garnier, Pantene etc. all have the same basic chemicals, they just change the color and perfume, rename it and then launch a huge Ad campaign and sell millions till people realize its the same ol SH**.  I went back to my hydrating shampoo, but with two changes that seem to have helped my volume and thinning.  1. I now use a product to spray or massage onto the ends of my long hair to help protect it from sun damage and split ends during the day,(I am outside playing a lot of golf) and help to gently comb out the tangled split ends without pulling hairs out with my brush after I get out of the shower. I like two products for this so far, the Biolage leave-in-tonic, and another called Biosilk when my split ends are bad. 2. I picked up a Magic Wand massager several months back, on a lark, to try for my tennis elbow.  It does not seem to have had much effect on my tennis elbow, but I discovered it  leaves my scalp tingling after about 5 minutes.  That must help with the blood circulation a little, because my head itches less, and seems less dry.  I also am noticing my hair seems thicker the last few months because I am pulling less of it out when I brush the  split ends with the tonic applied, and also less falling out because of the scalp massaging with the wand.  This makes sense to me because the products using Minoxidil really just dilate the blood vessels.  Hope this helps another old rock-star out there.  :)  leave a comment if you have a similar experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice shampoo but it&#x27;s very expensive. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth that much.</li>
            <li> I use the deep conditioners and other shampoos from Kerastase, and so decided to try this volumizing shampoo for fine hair (like mine). I actually thought that it weighed my hair down MORE than the other lines of Kerastase, and so would recommend that you stick with the orange and white bottles instead for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I dont think it is the right choice for me. It makes my hair very dry and tangled. I may try another product of this brand.</li>
            <li> Way over priced and it leaves your very dry. Don&#x27;t know what all the raves are about. Won&#x27;t buy it again for listed price.</li>
            <li> all keratase products are very good</li>
            <li> Makes my fine limp hair feel so smooth and gives it so much volume!  I will never purchase drugstore again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and customer service!</li>
            <li> In reading the positive reviews, I can only say that either I got an entirely different mix in my bottle, or people who have been supremely ripped off (and seriously, we all know that no shampoo in the world is worth that money), the only way to deal with the shame of having been sucked into the hype, is to pretend it was somehow worth it.  I saw NO DIFFERENCE in my hair, zero.  If there was any slight difference, it was that it was less shiny, due to the alcohol in the shampoo.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  Go have a nice lunch and take a friend.  Better way to spend your hard-earned dollars.  Amazing what fantasy worlds good marketing can create.</li>
            <li> I thought it would work better than my other one of similar type.  It didn&#x27;t.  It is just more expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried changing to a different shampoo but this one is the best for fine hair without volume. I have been using it for over 5 years and cannot say a bad thing about it. Also, using the mousse to bring more volume to my very very fine hair. I do give myself a break from it but it only ever lasts a month or so before I go back.</li>
            <li> Smells great, gives a great lather, and provides nice volume on my medium length, baby fine hair.  Thank you! Recommended</li>
            <li> I bought it because my hair stylist said this was a great brand. I have fine hair so I bought the volumactive instead of the orange regular kerastase shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Not impress. It smells good but I don&#x27;t feel any changes on my hair.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying anymore of volumizing shampoo.  Im yet to try the regular kerastase.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started using the shampoo, I started to feel a difference in the volume of my hair, as it is very fine, after the first use. Now, a few weeks later, I might have to go up to a medium size hair clip instead of small. I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews and a desire to try something really nice for myself, I splurged and purchased the large, $70 bottle to start using after my child was born, and I was able to start using it the next day.  I&#x27;ve been using it as my only shampoo since then, and I wash my hair at the least every other day.  My hair is between chin and shoulder length, thinning, and baby fine.  When I first got it, I remembered being happy with it for volumizing.  Since then, I&#x27;m just used to it and have come to expect whatever good it does for my hair.  I have no complaints about dryness, oiliness, or anything like that.  I am just back today thinking about buying the next bottle because mine is getting low.  I probably have at least two months or more left in the current bottle.  If anything, I may use a bit more than I need since the bottle is so huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My child will be 2 1/2 years old at the end of this month.  I&#x27;m very happy with the value.  I give it 4 stars because I&#x27;m just comparing it to what I&#x27;ve used in the past - e.g. nioxin, pantene and other thickening shampoos, etc.  There might be something better than this kerastase and I haven&#x27;t by any means tried an extensive number of shampoos.  But it&#x27;s fine for me and I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo which absolutely keeps my hair in great condition and does add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> having fine limp hair I researched best shampoos for my hair type (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them) I ordered this one since it got&lt;br /&gt;such high ratings - its cleans well but I am not impressed that it makes my hair any fuller in appearance so yes disappointed</li>
            <li> This was the worst shampoo I have ever used - do NOT recommend anyone using this awful shampoo - waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  It gives my baby fine 62 year old hair so much more body - what else can I possibly say?</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair that has no body whatsoever. I was hoping this shampoo would give my hair some volume. I can&#x27;t see any difference except in the volume of my wallet. Seriously--this product is $45 for 8 ounces, about $5.50 per ounce. Pantene, my usual brand which performs just as well: $0.26 per ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;pro\\&quot; about this product, and I am really reaching here, is that it lathers up really well so you don&#x27;t have to use as much per wash. So okay, instead of being 20x the price it&#x27;s maybe 15x the price. Still, no comparison.</li>
            <li> This shampoo provides rich moisturizing.  Your hair feels silky after use.  I&#x27;d caution again using too much shampoo as a little goes a long way.  Also, I find I have to alternate with other shampoos or it weighs down my hair after several consecutive uses.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for thin hair.</li>
    </ol>
