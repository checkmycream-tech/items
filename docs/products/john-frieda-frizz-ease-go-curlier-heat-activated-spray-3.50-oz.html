            <li>It is light weight and does a Great job with my curly  hair..</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the application.</li>
            <li>However, I did find a better product for curly hair that already helped my hair.</li>
            <li>It works great, and makes you hair really curly and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>love this product  </li>
            <li>Works great for my very frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, bouncy hair with great texture and shine.</li>
            <li>This product did not make my hair significantly curlier.</li>
            <li>It worked great in the beginning,  but now my hair is really dry and damaged.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair but not curly enough to look good.  </li>

            <li>directions say &amp;#34;blow-dry with a diffuser&amp;#34; but for truly awesome results, instead, I carefully stand with my head over a pot of boiling water and let the STEAM activate the curls in my usually wavy hair.</li>
            <li>The spray is made very well and it disperse the product evenly</li>
            <li>but I wish they would have put as much thought to the product itself.</li>

            <li>I would recommend for very curly hair,</li>
            <li>stars, because even though it seems to be a great product after less than one week of use, it doesn&#x27;t last for 48 hours--after I slept on my hair, it was back to fuzz for me.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, but if I don&#x27;t use any product, the curls turn into fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li> Awesome for my curly hair!</li>
            <li> Very good product.I have curly hair and I love it.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work so bad. I love the application. The fact that I could just spray this on my wet hair and not rub it into the palms of my hand was a big plus to me. The spray is made very well and it disperse the product evenly but I wish they would have put as much thought to the product itself. I have long, bouncy hair with great texture and shine. It makes my hair extremely dull and dry. Its awful. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I thought this product could be used on dry hair. I was wrong. Tried it anyway. Hair felt dirty after being dried.  I have given it two stars becaused I may have used too much.</li>
            <li> This product did not make my hair significantly curlier. It stayed frizzy despite following directions and using the cream to follow up. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I have natual curly hair and used this product for 2 months. It worked great in the beginning,  but now my hair is really dry and damaged. I DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! However, I did find a better product for curly hair that already helped my hair. It is by  one &#x27;n only Aran oil (hair restorative mask, once a week for 10 min) Then I found the curl cream, the same brand. It works great, and makes you hair really curly and shiny.  This is the ONLY product I will put on my hair now, the price for both are $9.99 I found these products at Sally&#x27;s Beauty.  Bye bye to John Freida.</li>
            <li> I really loved how they handled their shipping issues. I got a damaged property and they shipped another quickly.  The solution seemed to really help curl her thick curly hair.  I would recommend for very curly hair, especially is you have a curl adapted ac motor blow dryer.  Happy Nrlew Year everyone!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. My hair dries in perfect curls with no frizz.</li>
            <li> Good product good shipping</li>
            <li> I love this. It is light weight and does a Great job with my curly  hair..</li>
            <li> ALWAYS SPRAY MY HAIR WITH THIS AFTER WASHING. CHEMICAL TREATMENTS SUCH AS PERMS AND COLOR MAKE MY NATURALLY FRIZZY HAIR EVEN WORSE. THIS PRODUCT DOES MAKE IT SOFTER, LESS FRIZZY, AND SHINY. A MUST AFTER WASHING.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bad residue on hair.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves what this product does for her curls, well worth it she claims!</li>
            <li> Frizz Ease Go Curlier Spray does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say &amp;#34;blow-dry with a diffuser&amp;#34; but for truly awesome results, instead, I carefully stand with my head over a pot of boiling water and let the STEAM activate the curls in my usually wavy hair. The product enhances curls and helps hold them place for 2-3 days. Just re-steam to rejuvenate.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair but not curly enough to look good.  This product is terrific it brings my curl up to a prettier curl.&lt;br /&gt;the best recommendation is i buy it over and over again</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but if I don&#x27;t use any product, the curls turn into fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;This product holds the curls together without any crunchiness. It didn&#x27;t make my hair any curlier, but it added volume.&lt;br /&gt;Four stars, because even though it seems to be a great product after less than one week of use, it doesn&#x27;t last for 48 hours--after I slept on my hair, it was back to fuzz for me.</li>
            <li> love this product  i use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Works great for my very frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair curls now!</li>
