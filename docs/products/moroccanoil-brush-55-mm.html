            <li>sure to look up some tutorials to get the details on how to use a brush like this to get the best</li>
            <li>The bristles are a good length and are metal so they won&#x27;t melt like some of the plastic ones out there.</li>
            <li>so I may not be giving it a fair shake.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived within the allotted time and the packaging was good.</li>

            <li>Good for curly hair.</li>
            <li>They are fair.</li>
            <li>A 3 inch brush or greater would have been ideal for me.  </li>
            <li>I found my hair to be more fly away than normal....but to be frank</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love having the removable pick in the brush handle!</li>
            <li>Great brush for smooth blowouts.</li>

            <li>Good product my wife love it</li>
            <li>I love it , its good</li>
            <li>Time will tell it&#x27;s durability, but for right now seems like a great quality brush, easy to use, and gave great results.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and manipulate, and a dream to use with a good quality hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>Nice, handy, easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use, detangles easily,  more flexibility volume and shine to the hair!</li>
            <li>Very light weight.</li>
            <li>Because of the ceramic Ionic factors I really thought it would also control the fly away aspects.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two of them and love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Absoutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE using this brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>easier and looking better.</li>
            <li>Love this brush</li>
            <li>and I get a lot of static.</li>
            <li>love the mococcan oil when i want to wear my hair curly as well.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brush for blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>It was much better than most.</li>
            <li>The hairbrush feels great against my scalp--it&#x27;s very soft--but yet managed to get through the thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for smooth, shine and volume!</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice handle that fits in your hand comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and the orange pick that comes out the bottom helps separate and section hair like hairdressers do.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair, so the width of this barrel is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Plus the coloring is nice and makes it more fun.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait, love the way my hair feels and shapes with it!</li>
            <li>Great brush to straighten out naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush, it makes my hair so smooth</li>
            <li>I decided it was really time to move on and ordered this brush because of the good reviews</li>
            <li>Light weight and  very easy to keep clean</li>
            <li>I have bought many at a variety of stores, but this brush is definitely durable and works great for longer hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Gives my fine, lifeless hair some volume.</li>
            <li>I have realy fine hair</li>
            <li>Really smooths my hair during a blow out - love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will last many more years!</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>The bristles are also longer, which grips the hair in place better, making it easier to keep curling up and unraveling with the hair staying in place, which is essential for a good at-home blowout.</li>
            <li>never thought I would be able to duplicate the volume that I get when my pro hairdresser does my hair right at home.  </li>
            <li>The ceramic heats up quickly which makes styling easy.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as expected, great brush, easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>Best Round Brush Ever!</li>
            <li>I have very straight, fine hair, but I have lots of it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this brush for the size as a hairstylist I need several different size brushes for blow drying and this one is great also!</li>
            <li>i had one before and was glad I could find a new one on Amazon.</li>
            <li>As far as drying more quickly....</li>
            <li>, It makes my hair smooth and is gentle.</li>
            <li>I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how much I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>For me it was worth the buy, and makes blow-drying my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it is necessarily worth</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and really would appreciate a brush that would gently work my hair.  </li>
            <li>However, I have gone through probably 4 brushes in a couple years because the hair gets snagged between the rubber and metal part and the brittles will melt if your dryer is too hot.</li>
            <li>When I first felt the bristles in stores</li>
            <li>Great round brush, protects hair, allows me to quickly dry, smooth out and style my hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for the looks, and have beed told from many people that it actually works very well.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush but not worth $30.  </li>
            <li>Overall, my hair looked better with this brush than with my old one and it seems much better quality than the one I purchased at the salon, but it&#x27;s the same price.</li>
            <li>so much-</li>
            <li>Had been using the WEN natural bristle brush, as natural bristle is easier on the hair, but it didn&#x27;t smooth my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Prefer this brush because my wavy hair gets straight with my blow dryer as if I went to the salon for a blow out.</li>
            <li>I expected more from a Moroccan Oil product.</li>
            <li>The brush manages to hold onto my fine hair and really allows me to blow dry for lots of volume.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, helps my hair dry faster and smooths out the waves.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The high price is in the name of the brush I presume.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For those who say it doesn&#x27;t keep a curl, you must know how to use this kind of round brush properly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looks exactly the same, but trust me, it does not grab your hair!</li>
            <li>I also like the ceramic barrel over my old brush which was either metal or plastic.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have thick medium coarse, curly hair that is about shoulder length, i blow dry it straight most days.</li>
            <li>The ceramic core means my hair dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair, about 2 inches below my shoulders, and have been blowing out my hair at home for many years using a similar round brush.</li>
            <li>I had an old Revlon barrel brush that I&#x27;d had for years, and had tried to replace it several times and never found anything that measured up.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had spent my money on a really substantial boars hair brush.</li>
            <li>My old brush was one i purchased at the salon, the same one my stylist used.</li>
            <li>Apparently-</li>
            <li>Worked great, my only complaint for this large round is it could use a larger round handle.</li>
            <li>I noticed from my first use it was different from my other brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have a large round burn from when I used the brush this morning.  </li>
            <li>but I have a lot of it) and was looking for a round large brush that would allow me to straighten it as well as give me some volume.  </li>
            <li>hairdresser used the large round Morrocan Oil hairbrush when I got my hair cut last time, so I thought I would order one and give it a go.  </li>

            <li> hairdresser used the large round Morrocan Oil hairbrush when I got my hair cut last time, so I thought I would order one and give it a go.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse and this brush leaves it straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> As a long time fan of MoroccanOil hair products, it was about time for me to switch to their tools as well.  </li>
            <li> The brush is expensive (I&#x27;ve never spent anything close to this amount on a hairbrush before), but it&#x27;s definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li> There are only half the bristles as the prior model and the grab no hair.</li>
            <li> the shipper has you sign for this item (Not left like other Amazon items).  </li>
            <li> it is winter and dry...</li>
            <li> disappointing for the price I paid, I expected much better quality.  </li>
            <li> It has actually cut down the time I spend blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> not really.  </li>
            <li> My stylist uses the Moroccanoil brushes and this brush was exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> I use it a lot, didn&#x27;t want to spend so much,,, but its worse it.</li>
            <li> The brush gets VERY hot and is dangerous.</li>
            <li> I went through two of them, and both broke after a while; the top part came out of the brush base.</li>
            <li> But I like it so far, no complaints, it hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this brush, It even has a removable pin at the end to clean the brush ( its that orange tip, it comes out).</li>
            <li> Less frizz.  </li>
            <li> cut my drying time in half, and i have long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I was looking for a higher quality brush that would not have the same problem, preferably one that was screwed in to the base.</li>
            <li> but hair gets caught a little where the brush head meets the handle.</li>
            <li> But otherwise, little compliant on this product.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair that takes forever to round brush dry, and this has cut at least some minutes off of that time!  </li>
            <li> I just got this a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one is not screwed into the base, but it seems much higher quality than my old one.</li>
            <li> This brush is flimsey, the barrel is small and I am returning it.  </li>
            <li> bristles bent in about a week in my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This Morrocanoil brush gets the job done, no more tears!!</li>
            <li> What a waste and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I started growing out my hair (which is thin</li>
            <li> it works so well with people with very thick hair!</li>
            <li> It is expensive but appears to be well made.</li>
            <li> and you just can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this brush.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best brush I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Nice, handy, easy to use</li>
            <li> Great! Light weight. I just find it easier to style my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!!  Worth the wait, love the way my hair feels and shapes with it!</li>
            <li> Great brush for smooth blowouts. Good price too!</li>
            <li> I had an old Revlon barrel brush that I&#x27;d had for years, and had tried to replace it several times and never found anything that measured up.  I decided it was really time to move on and ordered this brush because of the good reviews and I liked the color.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how much I love this brush.  I have long, thick, curly hair that takes forever to round brush dry, and this has cut at least some minutes off of that time!  The bristles are a good length and are metal so they won&#x27;t melt like some of the plastic ones out there.</li>
            <li> I read wonderful things about this hairbrush so I bought it.  I have fine hair and really would appreciate a brush that would gently work my hair.  Because of the ceramic Ionic factors I really thought it would also control the fly away aspects.  I found my hair to be more fly away than normal....but to be frank it is winter and dry...so I may not be giving it a fair shake.  As far as drying more quickly....not really.  I wish I had spent my money on a really substantial boars hair brush.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, about 2 inches below my shoulders, and have been blowing out my hair at home for many years using a similar round brush. My old brush was one i purchased at the salon, the same one my stylist used. I went through two of them, and both broke after a while; the top part came out of the brush base. I was looking for a higher quality brush that would not have the same problem, preferably one that was screwed in to the base. Unfortunately this one is not screwed into the base, but it seems much higher quality than my old one. I also like the ceramic barrel over my old brush which was either metal or plastic. The bristles are also longer, which grips the hair in place better, making it easier to keep curling up and unraveling with the hair staying in place, which is essential for a good at-home blowout. Overall, my hair looked better with this brush than with my old one and it seems much better quality than the one I purchased at the salon, but it&#x27;s the same price. Plus the coloring is nice and makes it more fun. Great brush, recommended, but I took off a star because I would prefer the barrel was screwed in to the base. Time will tell it&#x27;s durability, but for right now seems like a great quality brush, easy to use, and gave great results.</li>
            <li> This is an awful brush. Save your money. There are only half the bristles as the prior model and the grab no hair. What a waste and a disappointment. It&#x27;s looks exactly the same, but trust me, it does not grab your hair!</li>
            <li> This brush provides a great blow out.  However, it also will burn your skin.  I have a large round burn from when I used the brush this morning.  It is on my neck.  The brush gets VERY hot and is dangerous.</li>
            <li> Best Round Brush Ever!</li>
            <li> Item arrived within the allotted time and the packaging was good. As for the item itself, it&#x27;s just as pictured. The ceramic heats up quickly which makes styling easy. It is expensive but appears to be well made. Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as expected, great brush, easy to hold and use.  Light weight and  very easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> Easy to use, detangles easily,  more flexibility volume and shine to the hair! Good buy</li>
            <li> Great brush. Gives my fine, lifeless hair some volume. Yippee!</li>
            <li> horrible will be returning</li>
            <li> Good for curly hair. My hair does not frizz and looks so shiny. However, I have gone through probably 4 brushes in a couple years because the hair gets snagged between the rubber and metal part and the brittles will melt if your dryer is too hot. But I just keep buying them!!</li>
            <li> I am quite challenged when it comes to the art of personal hair styling.&lt;br /&gt;This tool has assisted me beyond expectations!</li>
            <li> Light weight, helps my hair dry faster and smooths out the waves.  Less frizz.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great  but hair gets caught a little where the brush head meets the handle. Tip: Leave the hair in it so it doesn&#x27;t keep getting catch.</li>
            <li> The brush I had been using was pulling out my hair and causing split ends.  The gal who cut my hair was using this brush and told me I could get it from Amazon.  I ordered two of them and love it.  Received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I purchase 2 Moroccanoil brushes.  They are fair. I purchase a smaller barrel one at BedBath&amp;Beyond for 1/3 of price and I love it.  The brush is one thing.  Apparently- the shipper has you sign for this item (Not left like other Amazon items).  Well- I never got a notice on my door or anything.  I contacted seller and no response!  I finally asked my postman since it said it was delivered 3 weeks prior, he sent me to the post office to wait for an hour, and there was my CRAPPY brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for the size as a hairstylist I need several different size brushes for blow drying and this one is great also!</li>
            <li> I have realy fine hair so it gets entangled and hurts when brushed. This Morrocanoil brush gets the job done, no more tears!!</li>
            <li> It is the smoothest brush I ever tried.  It&#x27;s very kind ti hair and it does not tear it out. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome!  Really smooths my hair during a blow out - love it!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, so the width of this barrel is perfect for me.  Easy to hold and manipulate, and a dream to use with a good quality hairdryer.  As a long time fan of MoroccanOil hair products, it was about time for me to switch to their tools as well.  Use this and their hydrating styling cream and you just can&#x27;t go wrong.  Beautiful brush!</li>
            <li> Absoutely love this brush. Very light weight. Smooths out my hair with ease. No frizz. Will definately recommend this brush to others.</li>
            <li> I have a short bob hairstyle and I LOVE using this brush. It has actually cut down the time I spend blow drying my hair. My hair is thick and coarse and this brush leaves it straight and shiny. Did I mention that I LOVE this brush?!</li>
            <li> I bought it for the looks, and have beed told from many people that it actually works very well.  When I first felt the bristles in stores I thought it would tear my hair, it does the opposite, It makes my hair smooth and is gentle. The handle has the best grip.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush! I have bought many at a variety of stores, but this brush is definitely durable and works great for longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and I&#x27;m sure it will last many more years!</li>
            <li> Great brush to straighten out naturally curly hair.  I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this brush, It even has a removable pin at the end to clean the brush ( its that orange tip, it comes out). For me it was worth the buy, and makes blow-drying my hair easier and looking better.</li>
            <li> Love this brush so much- it works so well with people with very thick hair! Doesn&#x27;t make it frizzy! BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> Good product my wife love it</li>
            <li> As a Moroccan Oil product user, decided to purchase this brush and I am very happy with it.  Had been using the WEN natural bristle brush, as natural bristle is easier on the hair, but it didn&#x27;t smooth my hair very well.  Prefer this brush because my wavy hair gets straight with my blow dryer as if I went to the salon for a blow out.</li>
            <li> Worked great, my only complaint for this large round is it could use a larger round handle. But i still love it and it did a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this brush.  My hair gets cough inside the plastic handle and I get a lot of static. Kept it but  not my fave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it is necessarily worth it&#x27;s over price. But I like it so far, no complaints, it hasn&#x27;t broken. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fancy or great though. I have thick medium coarse, curly hair that is about shoulder length, i blow dry it straight most days.</li>
            <li> Nice brush but not worth $30.  You can get the same quality brush at Ulta for under $15.  The high price is in the name of the brush I presume.</li>
            <li> cut my drying time in half, and i have long, thick hair. definitely worth the price. love the mococcan oil when i want to wear my hair curly as well.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it makes my hair so smooth and it is lightweight and easy to use. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great round brush, protects hair, allows me to quickly dry, smooth out and style my hair.  The price was great, and this product is the best!</li>
            <li> This is a great boar&#x27;s hair brush!  This is my second 55mm Moroccanoil brush that I&#x27;ve purchased.  I have very long, thick hair and it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair when blow drying.  It&#x27;s the brand that my salon uses as well.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome seller and amazing product</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush for blow drying my hair. It was much better than most. i had one before and was glad I could find a new one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This brush is flimsey, the barrel is small and I am returning it.  I expected more from a Moroccan Oil product.</li>
            <li> I have very straight, fine hair, but I have lots of it.  I&#x27;m always struggling to find something that will give me all-day volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser used the large round Morrocan Oil hairbrush when I got my hair cut last time, so I thought I would order one and give it a go.  Wow.  The brush manages to hold onto my fine hair and really allows me to blow dry for lots of volume.  The ceramic core means my hair dried quickly.  The hairbrush feels great against my scalp--it&#x27;s very soft--but yet managed to get through the thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought I would be able to duplicate the volume that I get when my pro hairdresser does my hair right at home.  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  The brush is expensive (I&#x27;ve never spent anything close to this amount on a hairbrush before), but it&#x27;s definitely worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted!! For those who say it doesn&#x27;t keep a curl, you must know how to use this kind of round brush properly! It&#x27;s for smooth, shine and volume!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair, it leaves it sleek and shiny.  It has a nice handle that fits in your hand comfortably.  I just got this a few weeks ago.  I noticed from my first use it was different from my other brushes.  It&#x27;s more ergonomic.  I would buy this brush in another size for my bangs!</li>
            <li> My stylist uses the Moroccanoil brushes and this brush was exactly as expected.  I love having the removable pick in the brush handle!</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> This brush makes for a great salon-style blow out! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to look up some tutorials to get the details on how to use a brush like this to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great styling tool.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I started growing out my hair (which is thin but I have a lot of it) and was looking for a round large brush that would allow me to straighten it as well as give me some volume.  This did not disappoint.  I love the color and the orange pick that comes out the bottom helps separate and section hair like hairdressers do.  The only reason I will give it 4 stars is that I wish there was a larger version of it.  A 3 inch brush or greater would have been ideal for me.  But otherwise, little compliant on this product.  It heats up quickly and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> disappointing for the price I paid, I expected much better quality.  bristles bent in about a week in my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love it , its good I use it a lot, didn&#x27;t want to spend so much,,, but its worse it.</li>
