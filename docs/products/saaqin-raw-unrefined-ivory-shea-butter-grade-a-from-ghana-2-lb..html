            <li>If you&#x27;re paying for a product to make things from scratch, why would you purchase from someone who doesn&#x27;t make sure their stock isn&#x27;t putrid?</li>

            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>theres sooo much shea butter!!!!</li>
            <li>This product is perfect as it is, I melted mine down and added coconut oil, vitamin e oil and olive oil and whipped it up to a smooth consistency, glides on the skin beautifully and is by far the best I have come across, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly, was packaged professionally, and worked great for my homemade lip balms!</li>
            <li>Good shea butter, great for dry skin</li>
            <li>Very clean.</li>
            <li>I received this product in a plastic bag and very clean.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin beautifully leaving it dewy soft.</li>
            <li>I use this shea butter as a skin moisturizer and it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Heals my itchy dry skin and keeps me perfectly moisturized throughout winter.</li>
            <li>and I love how it makes my skin feel smooth and healthy without feeling greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and fresh.</li>
            <li>leaved skin silky smooth and is more moisturizing than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps enjoy :)</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft and nourished my cuticles look great.  </li>
            <li>What I really like about this product is that is is fair trade and soaks into the skin</li>
            <li>and they are very rich and smooth.</li>
            <li>The shea butter is good quality and worked great when whipping with other skin/hair friendly oils.     </li>
            <li>Easy as pie.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.</li>
            <li>absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is bearable if you dont mind an earthy organic smell, but as others have mentioned can be easily doctored up to smell</li>
            <li>You can store it in a zip lock bag or plastic container easily.</li>
            <li>but I just easily picked it out and moved on.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>So easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>Off-white, nutty scent, semi-soft and melts into hands and skin easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit too strong to my liking</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li>smell is a bit strong, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Plan on buying another brand to see if I can get one without a strong smell.</li>
            <li>just ok nothing special</li>
            <li>It is very clean and wonderfully rich.  </li>
            <li>Great on hair, feet, body in general.</li>
            <li>But I also added cocoa butter in with my mix (which smells really good) and vanilla extract and  some other good smelling things and the smell of this still overwhelms everything</li>
            <li>but it smelled very strong and the color was BRIGHT yellow</li>
            <li>It has to be warmed up in the hands to get it to a point where you can smooth it in easily</li>
            <li>It arrives wrapped in two plastic bags which is not the best packaging, but once you get past the presentation, I believe you&#x27;re going to love this</li>
            <li>so the smell after airing it out was fine.</li>
            <li>I thought it was fine.  </li>
            <li>and it was packaged well with quick delivery!</li>
            <li>It is a great head to toe product that leaves you with super soft conditioned hair and skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices</li>
            <li>and you have your own, pure face cream.  </li>
            <li>It is a huge amount of Shaa butter, and it did arrive speedily.</li>
            <li>Use it for soap making and it makes my soap so smooth.</li>
            <li>Was not wrapped very well,could have been in some kind of container.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC price</li>
            <li>However, when the ivory shea was received, it was wrapped securely but had 5 bugs stuck inside.</li>
            <li>Smooth, creamy and smells like Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>This Shea Butter has a silky smooth creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, creamy, no odor.</li>
            <li>Im coming back for my reorder, this product is great and it lasts forever</li>
            <li>I buy on line primarily for convenience.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very cost effective.  </li>
            <li>The feel of the product on my skin leaves it oiled but light so that I am well moisturized.</li>
            <li>Ordered this to make lotion bars which turned out fantastic.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth and moist esp during winter months.</li>
            <li>I made a combo butter with this as part of the mix and it mixed great</li>
            <li>I have used shea butter for a number of years and really enjoy its&#x27; benfits for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li>shea butter is a wonderful, natural &amp; healthy moisturizing product that I use to make numerous homemade bath &amp; body products with.</li>
            <li>Great quality shea butter, use it in a shea butter essential oil mixture for my Hair.</li>
            <li>Great smell and texture, will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li>Smooth creamy n blends</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m already seeing great results on my skin, mixed this with my jergen sea butter lotion.</li>
            <li>What would you expect with such a great deal on the butter?</li>
            <li>I purchased this to make sunscreen and wanted a good product b/c of the fact my 3yr old has severe eczema.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to work well on wet skin, but seems to work best with freshly towel-dried skin from the shower.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!!!  </li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing this, and it&#x27;s been very nice both times.</li>
            <li>Also whips into body butter very nicely when mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Raw unrefined shea butter is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Does not have a strong fragrance and melts quickly.</li>
            <li>but the odor wears off quickly and can easily be covered with perfume.  </li>
            <li>It quickly melts on your skin from your body temperature, easily allowing you to rub it in.</li>
            <li>This original African Shea butter is very creamy, quite smooth, great to use all over the body to improve and prevent dryness, causes immediate hydration to all skin types, economical and an amazing health tool.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, used for homemade lotion for my kids with eczema  works great especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Oh and the color is actually Ivory which is a good sign that this is good quality with its natural elements still intact.</li>
            <li>boy is it worth it!  </li>
            <li>an had that familiar nuttey smell.  </li>
            <li>(I had originally thought she had ring worm).</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my order</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it out and use it.</li>
            <li>It feels rich and the smell is almost non-existent.</li>
            <li>Was excited to find and couldn&#x27;t wait to get.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure I just got used to it.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying shea butter, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell was coming from the plastic</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and my body shows significant signs of improvement and pampering.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept it in it&#x27;s original packaging and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome if you want green slime!  </li>
            <li>It was clean and in a plastic bag as advertised.</li>
            <li>It is a light vanilla color that has a mild smell.</li>
            <li>So far, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is not the best quality and the packaging is less than stellar.  </li>
            <li>A very cheap way to make a huge quantity of a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>The quantity was huge and the appearance good, but I found the product to be very grainy and I had to spend more time rubbing it in to ensure it did not leave white particles on my skin.</li>
            <li>It was not hard it was very easy to mix using my mixer and adding oils.</li>
            <li>enjoy this product inside and out and highly recommend it to adventurous people.</li>
            <li>The texture is great and it was fresh not old.</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as yellow shea butter</li>
            <li>It works very well, and I was able to give some to a friend who was having skin problems as a result of chemo.  </li>
            <li>may vary by region or supplier, but if you do a price comparison, you should be able to find quality butter, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>When buying Shea look for the kind of grade like this one says clearly.</li>
            <li>It was double bagged, which was good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving this three stars because they had good customer service.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon about this and they gave me a full refund.  </li>
            <li>Nice natural butter..</li>
            <li>purity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I melted it down in warm water and mixed with jojoba oil to form a nice smooth body butter that I am very pleased with.</li>
            <li>Excellent as usual!</li>
            <li>It blends well with other oils and feels great on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent buy, and this turned out to be a true Shea butter instead of something similar, with different properties all together.</li>
            <li>We will also combine it with other oils and whip it for a great body and hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not only is a great quantity for an unbeatable price, it&#x27;s very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I luckily ordered during March in Chicago, so it wasn&#x27;t too stuck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly, via Prime.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and will likely order it again :)</li>
            <li>I quickly turned on the ac</li>
            <li>and i have seen tremendous improvement.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes a much more appealing lotion than the yellow shea butters.</li>
            <li>Got the product on time and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I do like the quick delivery I receive.</li>
            <li>I plan on looking for some type of essential oil to put in it to make it more appealing.</li>
            <li>I used this for my granddaughter, who had a mild case of eczema on her elbows and that is gone also.</li>
            <li>No issues with this and shipping came extreamly quick.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more after I run out months from now :)</li>
            <li>Even though this is two pounds, I seem to be going through this quickly.  </li>
            <li>This was shipped quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>it smells really strong If you can get past that though it is amazing and the weight is true!!</li>
            <li>Very creamy and the large block makes it very easy to cut into usable portions for whatever I need.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and when it is time I will definitely order it again!!!</li>
            <li>very glad I bought this and will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>There was no straining required, no mold, no unpleasant odors...</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, it came exactly as described and seemed very fresh.</li>
            <li>I thought I had previously reviewed this product but will happily review it again.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and it is not greasy or makes any mark on fabric or any cloth if you touch it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is always soft and it has some beautiful glow, especially my hands, legs and feet.  </li>
            <li>Its also good for pimples, dry patches, rashed and cuts.</li>
            <li>, it is easy to work with and very creamy</li>
            <li>turns out my daughter has nummular eczema and this clears it up SO fast!!</li>
            <li>Love all natural unrefined shea butter!  </li>
            <li>The butter is more grayish than white but that is fine with me as I melt it to use for an array products.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped in a heavy plastic sealed bag which is great and was delivered to me in timely manner.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I added it into a pre-made mixture of oatmeal lotion with essential oils and coconut oil that I had made which smelled AMAZING before I added the Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>and I use it on my body as well as on my face, but I dont know why crushed shea nut shell would be good for my skin</li>
            <li>Great quality, creamy and silky, no harsh smell, and the 2 lb bag is enough.    </li>
            <li>It smelled like chemicals mixed with spoiled butter of some kind.</li>
            <li>ok i dont want to lose any of its natural benefits.</li>
            <li>While whipping for my own formulas, adding almost 1/2 of a bottle of Vanilla essential oil did almost nothing.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh, and a bit like cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>I used it in a homemade natural skin cream that I am really enjoying.</li>
            <li>We made lotion with it, and it was a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li>So far love</li>
            <li>I love the explanation of uses on the lid label and the quality was extremely fresh as well as soft.  </li>
            <li>As expected lots of good uses.</li>
            <li>I recently learned to make my own body butter.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Shea butter so far.</li>
            <li>Worth price will purchase again..</li>
            <li>Applying once in the morning after my shower and once in the evening keeps my skin from becoming dry and provides a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this Shea butter back in february 2013 to make home made (cloth diaper safe) diaper cream.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, well packaged, and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My other suppliers&#x27; was very smooth and when applied to my skin it felt so light and clean.</li>
            <li>The Shea is pure and can be used easily alone or mixed with essential oils to make a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this product lived up to what it&#x27;s supposed to be, but it was a really good deal compared with the other ones I looked at.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and rich</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a real bummer, because I was so excited, and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich creamy and works very well on my hair and skin</li>
            <li>He immediately apologized and said he would make it right by sending the ivory shea.</li>
            <li>I got the butter, looked the right color, had the right texture</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>Body butter came out just right..</li>
            <li>My favorite so far for skin and kinky-curly hair is 2/3 cups of shea butter to 1/3 cup of unrefined coconut oil whipped together by melting them first, allowing it to solidify then whipping with a whisk hand-mixer.</li>
            <li>I make a body butter with coconut oil and jojoba oil and the butter used to smell VERY strongly of the shea butter and be VERY yellow.  </li>
            <li>So happy to be making the household switch to more natural products, and this is a great base for those lotions, creams and chapsticks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>it has a specific &#x27;nutty&#x27; smell that some people may not like but for me the most important thing is to get a pure unrefined product.</li>
            <li>Products was as described, shipped quickly, only issue is the packaging, came in 2 plastic type bags in which the shea is somewhat hard to get out the bags, but product was as described, seems to be a good grade of shea butter, good value for the price</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not sure what product to choose from, go with this one; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I melted it on the stove and added all the leftover old hand cream I had on hand and added a good splash of essential lemon oil.  </li>
            <li>The butter itself is super silky after whipping, but the smell is a bit much for me.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated his quick response.</li>
            <li>This was reasonably priced and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I did let it air out for about 2 weeks since the smell of shea butter can be strong, but that fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this product and would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>Very natural with a light earthy scent.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the Ivory Shea Butter, the price was cheaper then at some of the other sites I visited.</li>
            <li>It may not look very elegant but this stuff is the real deal for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>so it was very fast delivery,</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Feels good on your rough hands and face too!!!  </li>
            <li>First off out comes in a sealed plastic bag, so expect to scrape the butter out.</li>
            <li>Lotions and creams with shea butter cost more and don&#x27;t have enough of the butter in them to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using Shea Butter</li>
            <li>Much better than the 4 different brands that I&#x27;ve used of which</li>
            <li>So shea butter most likely will not work on that hair type.</li>
            <li>This purchase was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been such a relief after struggling with her eczema for so many months</li>
            <li>Remember to only buy unrefined butters and oils as they retain more nutrients than their refined counter</li>
            <li>What I love more is that it is perfectly natural (absolutely no additives</li>
            <li>NOTHING moisturises like this, and all of the friends I have given this to have said the same and always asked for more.  </li>
            <li>My legs and arms looked so smooth and soft in my summer dress.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>The box was actually bigger than it needed to be, but this rode safely on clouds of air to our doorstep.</li>
            <li>Most shea butters I&#x27;ve seen on the market have an added oil that makes me break out and gives me red bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li>First time ever buying Shea Butter</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>I purchased some of that hot spot stuff and the scratching continued.</li>
            <li>After a trip to the vet to make sure there was no underlying health issues, I decided to use the same thing on her skin that I use on mine .</li>
            <li>It seems to be much more than two pounds as I had to use several plastic containers to preserve the Shea butter.</li>
            <li>BIG DIFFERENCE! :)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This was my first encounter with shea butter</li>
            <li>will defininly order this again as soon as I use up the rest of my first order.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It smelled authentic and there was enough for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured</li>
            <li>For some reason I wasn&#x27;t expecting so much!</li>
            <li>My experience with shea butter is that this is my first time trying it.</li>
            <li>It works much better than all of the lotions I used to buy and the 2 lbs will last forever.</li>
            <li>Thanks south!</li>
            <li>I bought this to make a cream for my hair and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap.</li>
            <li>It stores pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Love this product would definitely recommend anyone to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>It is very different from most people are used for moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and I found it to be exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This was the first time buying this.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering Shea Butter from anywhere.</li>
            <li>Only used in lotion bars so far, need more recipes!</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this to make soaps and other products for her beauty shop and the finished products are amazing.</li>
            <li>Ivory in colour, soft and rich.</li>
            <li>I rather make my own body butters than buy them with all kinds of other chemicals in them.</li>
            <li>I used to buy my raw shea in 8oz containers for $8, but this price was too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li>It has a much milder aroma and it absorbs much better on the skin than the yellow shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter was soft and creamy at room temperature not hard like some I&#x27;ve experienced from other vendors.</li>
            <li>It shipped very fast, the price is reasonable for the amount of shea butter you receive</li>
            <li>I tried to be positive.</li>
            <li>is a high quality product, i will be back for more.</li>
            <li>The color is a natural off-white color and the smell is extremely mild.  </li>
            <li>I noticed African women have few wrinkles and beautiful skin-</li>
            <li>I heard that ivory shea butter did not have such a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>The nutty smell was not as strong as the yellow shea butter which was a plus with me.</li>
            <li>So I like to get pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>and I certainly will be ordering this product as well as others from this seller again</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t a moisturizer whatever it is.</li>
            <li>This is definitely pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Ive bought 100% unrefined shea butter before and it was a large brick as well</li>
            <li>and I have wasted a lot of money on many others!  </li>
            <li>It looked fine from outside.</li>
            <li>Started using this in a face cream for moisturizing mixed with some avocado and vitamin E oils - and some essential oils - love it!  </li>
            <li>The yellow is fine</li>
            <li>its really unrefined and pure</li>
            <li>It came in a large bag and looked promising until I opened the bag and got a whiff of what was inside.</li>
            <li>and when it arrived it was a little warm but that made it easier for me to manipulate it.</li>
            <li>but it dissipates quickly after you smooth it into your skin or mix it with other products.</li>
            <li>Its just as good as any other high quality raw shea, but at a better price.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing an authentic as I have had fake Shea butter before.</li>
            <li>but it functions like the real thing</li>
            <li>I begin to really like it.</li>
            <li>In fact, my whole refrigerator smells like shea butter even though it is placed in two sealed plastik bags.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>His skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li>I knew where it came from , the grade , and all at a reasonable price .</li>
            <li>Though I was able to return it with minimal fuss, it was a hassle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this for my skin and 4c hair, it really is a versatile product.</li>
            <li>It came within a week and was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>i use it for everything from hair to skin (WHOLE FAMILY).</li>
            <li>im ready to mix another batch.</li>
            <li>Shame on you halaeverday for trying to pull a fast one on me.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Since I needed this to make body butters, I really wanted the ivory colored shea.</li>
            <li>but of course can&#x27;t get too much or it&#x27;ll spoil on me</li>
            <li>and I really like the smell of this one and the color</li>
            <li>I got this much sooner than I thought I would.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so I have no basis for comparison, but I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I used this shea butter to make homemade lotion and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>It is also very grainy even after being whipped.  </li>
            <li>Shipping and handling was about twice as much as the price of item</li>
            <li>It arrived in two days and appears to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>I then used the shea for what I&#x27;d really bought it for: making shortening for biscuits and pie crusts.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve never used shea before get ready to transform your skin, your beauty routine, your whole self from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Yes, earthy, but really just stinky.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really folks, we&#x27;re not paying for packaging anyway.  </li>
            <li>Will keep trying as it does work very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually very picky about things that are sent through the mail and that I put on my body.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and not gritty at all.</li>
            <li>Buy with confidences this product comes well packaged and is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Recieved shea butter fast.</li>
            <li>Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li>It has given me some much needed relief</li>
            <li>Really wanted to try the Ivory.</li>
            <li>I have made 3 to 4 batches of shea butter as gifts and they absolutely luv it.</li>
            <li>I really like this ivory shea butter</li>
            <li>I know from research that Shea Butter is supposed to have a light nutty smell to it that blends with essential oils well.</li>
            <li>and it felt very unclean when I applied it to my skin</li>
            <li>was so much dirt in my Shea butter</li>
            <li>Very creamy, not crumbly.</li>
            <li>This product packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I melted it with some coconut oil and dropped a few drops of teatree oil in it and made a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>I mixed with my essential oils for a nice whipped product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this shea butter several times to make my own body butter (I melt it and add essential oils).</li>
            <li>I honestly could not get over the smell, even mixed with a bit of coconut oil and essential oils, the Shea smell was overpowering.</li>
            <li>This product definitely met my expectations especially after doing research on my own.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a nice glow to the skin without being greasy or messy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly raw and unrefined, i love it!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t exactly tell you how quickly they ship with standard rates.</li>
            <li>I have used it in a hard lotion bar with other ingredients and it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>I keep it in a dry, cool place, and it is still fresh and as luscious as ever.</li>
            <li>May be better for some to use in colder climates or extremely parched skin.</li>
            <li>My sister in law was incredibly excited to open this gift on Christmas Eve.</li>
            <li>OK, I know that I am supposed to blend this with other oils to modify the odor, change the consistency, or be a shea butter connoisseur.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re paying for pure product which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have used yellow shea butter in the past and I found it to be a great moisturizer</li>
            <li>I use now has a much more mellow smell, very creamy to the touch, soaks in very fast and leaves skin feeling very soft, and the stuff I use now is completely raw, unrefined, unfiltered so that really says something about its quality, and it&#x27;s much cheaper then this shea butter.</li>
            <li>I use it to make my own bath and lotion products, and I use it by itself when my skin is extra dry and chapped.  </li>
            <li>I only marked it as a 4 star because of the packaging (2 sealed bags) but I easily just put it in a ziploc bag after opening.</li>
            <li>I am an avid user of natural body and hair products.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly soft, melts fast, fast, fast -  in the microwave.  </li>
            <li>So nice of them to go to the trouble of melting it and tasting it!</li>
            <li>It has a nutty earthy smell but its not bad, I actually like it.</li>
            <li>I love the color and consistency of this shea butter, you can really tell its pure and raw.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to live up to my expectations, but it did.  </li>
            <li>The homemade cream really makes a huge difference to my rough hands.</li>
            <li>The packaging was odd in that it was wrapped in many layers of cellophane and then placed in the bag, but it did not seem to detract from the product.</li>
            <li>2 LBS for what most charge for 1Lb or less.</li>
            <li>I did however find myself really enjoying the smell after a while, especially when mixing in my lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>I put it on in place of body lotion after getting out of the shower, and after only a couple weeks, my skin seems to be in better condition, especially the looser areas that have been affected by pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I use some of this for cosmetics, but I bought this quantity from this particular supplier because I wanted to cook with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, silky, and it doesn&#x27;t stink like the cheap stuff you can buy locally.  </li>
            <li>The price is good, shipping is fast, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but I had no problem transferring it to a container with a tight fitting lid.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am highly dissatisfied &amp; wish I had never bought it because all I can do now is throw it away.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for all naturals that don&#x27;t want to pay the high prices for a 16 oz  of Shea Butter at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li>Have used it on it&#x27;s own, as well as, mixed with other oils for massaging and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have shared it with many other naturally curly friends.</li>
            <li>So far, pleased with the value compared to other sites.</li>
            <li>It has a soft texture and was pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>I had raw Shea Butter before and wanted to make sure that this was the real stuff.....</li>
            <li>and my hands are soft!!</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more.</li>
            <li>melts in your hand, I love and use it as an everyday lotion.</li>
            <li>I was not happy with the packaging of the product as it leaked but its still is good product &amp; I will use them again.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s an easy enough fix, try adding some fragrant essential oils to it.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more with the dry winters in wyoming</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as strong as some of the other brands I have purchased and I can&#x27;t wait to try it!  </li>
            <li>The shea butter comes wrapped in plastic, not a container, so I can see it melting and becoming a mess in warmer climates.    </li>
            <li>The other uses for me with this product are fantastic also.  </li>
            <li>I live in Las Vegas, and my family</li>
            <li>The vacuum packs were fine for me, I just put the extra into a ziploc bag and stored it at room temperature.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use for my hair as a sealant in place of coconut oil, but it&#x27;s so ridiculously hard to use as it is very grainy and by no means SMOOTH in texture!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky with the scent of my products and this is lightly scented and the smell goes away after a few minutes on the skin.</li>
            <li>Hand are soft and smooth even during rough winter temperatures.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is well worth the $12 you will spend if you are looking for a natural approach to beauty care.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t detect taste or smell of shea after the seitan was cooked; I didn&#x27;t really detect much aroma while frying, actually.</li>
            <li>When trying to get the product out expect a mess (it melts easy) and expect to have to leave some stuck to the bag.</li>
            <li>I went straight to buying 2lbs thinking that it was good based on previous reviews, but I strongly do not recommend buying this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it, and would highly recommend this for people looking for that natural product to soften skin, and for the various other uses it has.  </li>
            <li>main reason I use the pure shea butter is to reduce ingredients such as parabens and laurel sulfates that could cause Xeno hormones.  </li>
            <li>I agree with a lot of the other reviewers who did not like the packaging that it came in, a plastic bag, that once I picked it up and handled it (I was just reading the sticker on it) and the top of it began to rip open.</li>
            <li>Better overall price than other places I&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li>and it makes the skin so soft!  </li>
            <li>By morning my face was so soft!</li>
            <li>Natural clean slightly nutty smell, and very hydrating for my daughters&#x27; skin as well as mine.</li>
            <li>Duly noted, Ill pick a more reputable shipper/company next time.</li>
            <li>I used some of it on my elbows and it made them really soft!</li>
            <li>Completely met my expectations!</li>
            <li>I give it one star only because it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Little did I realize this would have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>but I was very hesitant to purchase it, reading reviews for days before I finally committed to this particular item.</li>
            <li>Fresh out of the package, the shea butter has its characteristic smokey/nutty aroma that it quite distinctive and pronounced.</li>
            <li>It was solid when it arrived, but still soft enough for me to cut it into chunks and store it in an airtight container; however, it was very cool outside.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to Shea butter (or not) it is definitely worth springing for the slightly more expensive ivory version.  </li>
            <li>It is a big hunk of pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>It was wrapped in clear plastic wrap, but then put into a sealed bag to help with temp control, I believe.  </li>
            <li>morning application is enough to keep skin moisturized the whole day.</li>
            <li>I transferred my stuff to plastic food containers for convenience using a double boiler, then straight to the freezer to avoid the grittiness.</li>
            <li>I would completely recommend this to anyone but you must have patience with the packaging.</li>
            <li>Real shea butter should be some form of ivory, beige or creamy color also not WHITE.</li>
            <li>started researching natural remedies, 20 years ago i never heard of eczema now everyone seems to have it</li>
            <li>Like using this product for natural body products.</li>
            <li>Its all natural.</li>
            <li>I decided to make a hair butter for me, my hubby and my daughters, who are all natural.</li>
            <li>(at least when I purchased) and really lovely to use.</li>
            <li>The shea butter gives Plenty of moisture, softens the toughest skin,&amp; it also rid some old scars &amp;marks.</li>
            <li>This is some soft and pliable shea butter.  </li>
            <li>but I get 2x as much from Halaleveryday for the same price.</li>
            <li>It blends very well with coconut oil, castor oil, essential oils, or what ever your preference is.</li>
            <li>have used it so far to fry homemade seitan, just as a test of its qualities.</li>
            <li>, it is all natural, so no fragrances in it.</li>
            <li>I used my Shea butter mix for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>A natural product will have natural variations.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin and hair soft.</li>
            <li>I would say the only difference is that it is nearly scentless while yellow shea butter has a distinct smell.</li>
            <li>I am now hooked on this natural moisturizer, have recommended &amp; given samples to friends &amp; will no longer be using commercialized processed lotions.  </li>
            <li>it comes as a solid brick which you can use as a lotion or heat the Shea butter to make a very moisturizing oil....</li>
            <li>you could always buy an essential oil like lavender and mix it in if it bothers you that much.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and seems leave my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely stopped using lotions since I purchased this shea butter.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft, moist and radiant.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I used it in a mixture of castor, jojoba and coconut oil for my natural hair for a two stranded twist.</li>
            <li>I did not own a scale, but I&#x27;m glad that I do now so that  </li>
            <li>I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap.</li>
            <li>Hands have never been so soft.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of the non professional looking packaging but</li>
            <li>goes on well really natural.</li>
            <li>Granted, it was in a delivery truck in the heat all day, so it was completely melted to the consistency of snot-</li>
            <li>I purchased the yellow shea butter from HalalEveryday a few months ago and really enjoyed it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a drag to get it from plastic to a jar, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I ordered my shea butter a few weeks ago I was overall was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I should have known better - there wasn&#x27;t any other shea butter being offered at anywhere near such a low price.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the fact that this shea butter is left raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li>(doesn&#x27;t go off), a little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t block my pores - not even when I use it on my face, and it is dirt cheap!  </li>
            <li>I am married to a African and had the chance to compare to some shea butter hand carried from Ghana to us personally.  </li>
            <li>Extremely high quality, I have used it in several homemade skincare recipes.</li>
            <li>(just occurred to me that maybe it can be heated slightly in the microwave first, will give it a try tomorrow)!  </li>
            <li>It is long lasting and very very moisturizing</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on a Friday with standard shipping and it arrived the very next Wednesday, very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>your time and spend a little more on any other shea butter on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Plain white shea butter wrapped in plastic, light odor and mixes well to make a whipped shea skin cream.</li>
            <li>White one has a slight smell, not nearly as bad.</li>
            <li>haha, I see a lot of people complaining they got bad batches, I guess I was lucky because mine is creamy, ivory, and smooth.</li>
            <li>She said it really helped her dry skin - it was a hit!</li>
            <li>I cannot give the product anything lower than 5 stars even if the packaging sucks because the shea butter itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Then, in addition, it weighed only 1 pound, 2 ounces, which is a far cry from 2 pounds.  </li>
            <li>I mixed it with a hand wisk and poured it into seven old hand cream jars.</li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend this product to every natural person i know.</li>
            <li>So far I have only made biscuits with my shea-infused shortening.</li>
            <li>However, the benefits still far outweigh the smell that I&#x27;m getting used to, so I will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends that are seeking a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My hair felt completely moisturized the entire time.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be surprised when you open this.</li>
            <li>So a lot of people were saying this has a &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell or barely noticeable smell</li>
            <li>I melt a piece and use with coconut oil and essential oils for a soft cream; you can use it in your face and hair.</li>
            <li>I was surprised this product was very yellow not ivory at all.</li>
            <li>And once you open the bag you will most likely find the shea is not solid our or even a few big chunks.</li>
            <li>Have separated it into smaller to store in no light, plus cool place.  </li>
            <li>texture is about right to use undiluted as shortening, but I was a little too timid to try it that way.</li>
            <li>Right now i have some in my hair that i melted with a little bit of some olive oil</li>
            <li>I was not sure about this butter at first because I am new to this product, bus as I was using it in soap making and creams</li>
            <li>Highly recommended - I will never waste money on other over priced products which just don&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem at all like other pure shea butter</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing for my naturally dry African hair!</li>
            <li>First off, what I received was brown and black and looked nothing like the advertised pictures.  </li>
            <li>It works quite well, absorbs quickly, and has that good old (or bad depending on your opinion) raw shea smell.</li>
            <li>Compared to other places selling unrefined shea butter, this is a great price (although the shipping is a bit high, but even with the shipping price, it is less expensive than others).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the same color as in the picture, an ivory color, and it mixes very well with the other oils that I used to make my hair butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i apply my &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; as I wind down and get ready for bed.</li>
            <li>I personally did not discount this from the products overall rating because its raw and unrefined and doesn&#x27;t have as long of a shelf life as a product that has been tweaked from its original state.</li>
            <li>Healing my dry skin to soft skin with in 3 days.</li>
            <li>I cut it up and press it into a small jar to use it &amp; put the balance in a Rubbermaid-type container to keep it fresh, refilling the smaller job as needed.  </li>
            <li>I have used coconut oil on my face for the past few years and have added some shea butter.and the effect is better.  </li>
            <li>This is the first raw shea butter that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great for soothing dry skin And lotion-makers can even use it as a base for natural Hairmilk recipes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s only a slight scent to it, nothing I can really smell, definitely not anything offensive.</li>
            <li>Raw shea is so much more beneficial to the skin than the processed stuff, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I first put it in my hands to melt a little and use it on my face, hands, everywhere!</li>
            <li>Came in a sealed plastic bag, medium to light shea butter smell, and with all sheas, it is a little on the heavy side, but luxurious on the skin.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little bit compared to lotion, if you use to much it will make your skin greasy.</li>
            <li>Very unnerving and unsettling, especially because I&#x27;m going through a bad patch of eczema with very dry skin and was looking for the best natural shea butter</li>
            <li>I really have nothing bad to say :)</li>
            <li>This is good stuff the smell took a day to get used to or mine went bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and this is the kind of Shea people take about.</li>

            <li> Smells OK (the lemon oil helped) and rubs into my skin with ease.  </li>
            <li> This rating is not based on the seller or the product itself but more about my experience.&lt;br</li>

            <li> If I wanted to go out, find an appropriate sized box, go to the post office to weigh and ship, and pay for postage, then wait for a return product, all for a nine dollar item....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been ordering from a company that charged way more than this</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re paying for a product to make things from scratch, why would you purchase from someone who doesn&#x27;t make sure their stock isn&#x27;t putrid?</li>

            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> theres sooo much shea butter!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect as it is, I melted mine down and added coconut oil, vitamin e oil and olive oil and whipped it up to a smooth consistency, glides on the skin beautifully and is by far the best I have come across, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly, was packaged professionally, and worked great for my homemade lip balms!</li>
            <li> Good shea butter, great for dry skin</li>
            <li> Very clean.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a plastic bag and very clean.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin beautifully leaving it dewy soft.</li>
            <li> I use this shea butter as a skin moisturizer and it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Heals my itchy dry skin and keeps me perfectly moisturized throughout winter.</li>
            <li> and I love how it makes my skin feel smooth and healthy without feeling greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and fresh.</li>
            <li> leaved skin silky smooth and is more moisturizing than cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps enjoy :)</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft and nourished my cuticles look great.  </li>
            <li> What I really like about this product is that is is fair trade and soaks into the skin</li>
            <li> and they are very rich and smooth.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is good quality and worked great when whipping with other skin/hair friendly oils.     </li>
            <li> Easy as pie.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.</li>
            <li> absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is bearable if you dont mind an earthy organic smell, but as others have mentioned can be easily doctored up to smell</li>
            <li> You can store it in a zip lock bag or plastic container easily.</li>
            <li> but I just easily picked it out and moved on.  </li>
            <li> Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> So easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> Off-white, nutty scent, semi-soft and melts into hands and skin easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit too strong to my liking</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong.</li>
            <li> smell is a bit strong, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Plan on buying another brand to see if I can get one without a strong smell.</li>
            <li> just ok nothing special</li>
            <li> It is very clean and wonderfully rich.  </li>
            <li> Great on hair, feet, body in general.</li>
            <li> But I also added cocoa butter in with my mix (which smells really good) and vanilla extract and  some other good smelling things and the smell of this still overwhelms everything</li>
            <li> but it smelled very strong and the color was BRIGHT yellow</li>
            <li> It has to be warmed up in the hands to get it to a point where you can smooth it in easily</li>
            <li> It arrives wrapped in two plastic bags which is not the best packaging, but once you get past the presentation, I believe you&#x27;re going to love this</li>
            <li> so the smell after airing it out was fine.</li>
            <li> I thought it was fine.  </li>
            <li> and it was packaged well with quick delivery!</li>
            <li> It is a great head to toe product that leaves you with super soft conditioned hair and skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices</li>
            <li> and you have your own, pure face cream.  </li>
            <li> It is a huge amount of Shaa butter, and it did arrive speedily.</li>
            <li> Use it for soap making and it makes my soap so smooth.</li>
            <li> Was not wrapped very well,could have been in some kind of container.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC price</li>
            <li> However, when the ivory shea was received, it was wrapped securely but had 5 bugs stuck inside.</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy and smells like Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> This Shea Butter has a silky smooth creamy texture.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy, no odor.</li>
            <li> Im coming back for my reorder, this product is great and it lasts forever</li>
            <li> I buy on line primarily for convenience.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very cost effective.  </li>
            <li> The feel of the product on my skin leaves it oiled but light so that I am well moisturized.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to make lotion bars which turned out fantastic.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and moist esp during winter months.</li>
            <li> I made a combo butter with this as part of the mix and it mixed great</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter for a number of years and really enjoy its&#x27; benfits for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> shea butter is a wonderful, natural &amp; healthy moisturizing product that I use to make numerous homemade bath &amp; body products with.</li>
            <li> Great quality shea butter, use it in a shea butter essential oil mixture for my Hair.</li>
            <li> Great smell and texture, will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Smooth creamy n blends</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m already seeing great results on my skin, mixed this with my jergen sea butter lotion.</li>
            <li> What would you expect with such a great deal on the butter?</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make sunscreen and wanted a good product b/c of the fact my 3yr old has severe eczema.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to work well on wet skin, but seems to work best with freshly towel-dried skin from the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!!!  </li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this, and it&#x27;s been very nice both times.</li>
            <li> Also whips into body butter very nicely when mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Raw unrefined shea butter is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Does not have a strong fragrance and melts quickly.</li>
            <li> but the odor wears off quickly and can easily be covered with perfume.  </li>
            <li> It quickly melts on your skin from your body temperature, easily allowing you to rub it in.</li>
            <li> This original African Shea butter is very creamy, quite smooth, great to use all over the body to improve and prevent dryness, causes immediate hydration to all skin types, economical and an amazing health tool.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping, used for homemade lotion for my kids with eczema  works great especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Oh and the color is actually Ivory which is a good sign that this is good quality with its natural elements still intact.</li>
            <li> boy is it worth it!  </li>
            <li> an had that familiar nuttey smell.  </li>
            <li> (I had originally thought she had ring worm).</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my order</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it out and use it.</li>
            <li> It feels rich and the smell is almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> Was excited to find and couldn&#x27;t wait to get.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure I just got used to it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying shea butter, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell was coming from the plastic</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and my body shows significant signs of improvement and pampering.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept it in it&#x27;s original packaging and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome if you want green slime!  </li>
            <li> It was clean and in a plastic bag as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is a light vanilla color that has a mild smell.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is not the best quality and the packaging is less than stellar.  </li>
            <li> A very cheap way to make a huge quantity of a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> The quantity was huge and the appearance good, but I found the product to be very grainy and I had to spend more time rubbing it in to ensure it did not leave white particles on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was not hard it was very easy to mix using my mixer and adding oils.</li>
            <li> enjoy this product inside and out and highly recommend it to adventurous people.</li>
            <li> The texture is great and it was fresh not old.</li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as yellow shea butter</li>
            <li> It works very well, and I was able to give some to a friend who was having skin problems as a result of chemo.  </li>
            <li> may vary by region or supplier, but if you do a price comparison, you should be able to find quality butter, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> When buying Shea look for the kind of grade like this one says clearly.</li>
            <li> It was double bagged, which was good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this three stars because they had good customer service.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon about this and they gave me a full refund.  </li>
            <li> Nice natural butter..</li>
            <li> purity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I melted it down in warm water and mixed with jojoba oil to form a nice smooth body butter that I am very pleased with.</li>
            <li> Excellent as usual!</li>
            <li> It blends well with other oils and feels great on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy, and this turned out to be a true Shea butter instead of something similar, with different properties all together.</li>
            <li> We will also combine it with other oils and whip it for a great body and hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not only is a great quantity for an unbeatable price, it&#x27;s very high quality.  </li>
            <li> I luckily ordered during March in Chicago, so it wasn&#x27;t too stuck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived quickly, via Prime.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and will likely order it again :)</li>
            <li> I quickly turned on the ac</li>
            <li> and i have seen tremendous improvement.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
            <li> It makes a much more appealing lotion than the yellow shea butters.</li>
            <li> Got the product on time and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I do like the quick delivery I receive.</li>
            <li> I plan on looking for some type of essential oil to put in it to make it more appealing.</li>
            <li> I used this for my granddaughter, who had a mild case of eczema on her elbows and that is gone also.</li>
            <li> No issues with this and shipping came extreamly quick.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more after I run out months from now :)</li>
            <li> Even though this is two pounds, I seem to be going through this quickly.  </li>
            <li> This was shipped quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> it smells really strong If you can get past that though it is amazing and the weight is true!!</li>
            <li> Very creamy and the large block makes it very easy to cut into usable portions for whatever I need.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and when it is time I will definitely order it again!!!</li>
            <li> very glad I bought this and will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> There was no straining required, no mold, no unpleasant odors...</li>
            <li> As for the product itself, it came exactly as described and seemed very fresh.</li>
            <li> I thought I had previously reviewed this product but will happily review it again.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and it is not greasy or makes any mark on fabric or any cloth if you touch it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is always soft and it has some beautiful glow, especially my hands, legs and feet.  </li>
            <li> Its also good for pimples, dry patches, rashed and cuts.</li>
            <li> , it is easy to work with and very creamy</li>
            <li> turns out my daughter has nummular eczema and this clears it up SO fast!!</li>
            <li> Love all natural unrefined shea butter!  </li>
            <li> The butter is more grayish than white but that is fine with me as I melt it to use for an array products.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped in a heavy plastic sealed bag which is great and was delivered to me in timely manner.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I added it into a pre-made mixture of oatmeal lotion with essential oils and coconut oil that I had made which smelled AMAZING before I added the Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> and I use it on my body as well as on my face, but I dont know why crushed shea nut shell would be good for my skin</li>
            <li> Great quality, creamy and silky, no harsh smell, and the 2 lb bag is enough.    </li>
            <li> It smelled like chemicals mixed with spoiled butter of some kind.</li>
            <li> ok i dont want to lose any of its natural benefits.</li>
            <li> While whipping for my own formulas, adding almost 1/2 of a bottle of Vanilla essential oil did almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> It smells fresh, and a bit like cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> I used it in a homemade natural skin cream that I am really enjoying.</li>
            <li> We made lotion with it, and it was a lot of fun.  </li>
            <li> So far love</li>
            <li> I love the explanation of uses on the lid label and the quality was extremely fresh as well as soft.  </li>
            <li> As expected lots of good uses.</li>
            <li> I recently learned to make my own body butter.  </li>
            <li> My favorite Shea butter so far.</li>
            <li> Worth price will purchase again..</li>
            <li> Applying once in the morning after my shower and once in the evening keeps my skin from becoming dry and provides a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this Shea butter back in february 2013 to make home made (cloth diaper safe) diaper cream.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, well packaged, and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My other suppliers&#x27; was very smooth and when applied to my skin it felt so light and clean.</li>
            <li> The Shea is pure and can be used easily alone or mixed with essential oils to make a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product lived up to what it&#x27;s supposed to be, but it was a really good deal compared with the other ones I looked at.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and rich</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a real bummer, because I was so excited, and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich creamy and works very well on my hair and skin</li>
            <li> He immediately apologized and said he would make it right by sending the ivory shea.</li>
            <li> I got the butter, looked the right color, had the right texture</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li> Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Body butter came out just right..</li>
            <li> My favorite so far for skin and kinky-curly hair is 2/3 cups of shea butter to 1/3 cup of unrefined coconut oil whipped together by melting them first, allowing it to solidify then whipping with a whisk hand-mixer.</li>
            <li> I make a body butter with coconut oil and jojoba oil and the butter used to smell VERY strongly of the shea butter and be VERY yellow.  </li>
            <li> So happy to be making the household switch to more natural products, and this is a great base for those lotions, creams and chapsticks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> it has a specific &#x27;nutty&#x27; smell that some people may not like but for me the most important thing is to get a pure unrefined product.</li>
            <li> Products was as described, shipped quickly, only issue is the packaging, came in 2 plastic type bags in which the shea is somewhat hard to get out the bags, but product was as described, seems to be a good grade of shea butter, good value for the price</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure what product to choose from, go with this one; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I melted it on the stove and added all the leftover old hand cream I had on hand and added a good splash of essential lemon oil.  </li>
            <li> The butter itself is super silky after whipping, but the smell is a bit much for me.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated his quick response.</li>
            <li> This was reasonably priced and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I did let it air out for about 2 weeks since the smell of shea butter can be strong, but that fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this product and would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Very natural with a light earthy scent.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the Ivory Shea Butter, the price was cheaper then at some of the other sites I visited.</li>
            <li> It may not look very elegant but this stuff is the real deal for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> so it was very fast delivery,</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Feels good on your rough hands and face too!!!  </li>
            <li> First off out comes in a sealed plastic bag, so expect to scrape the butter out.</li>
            <li> Lotions and creams with shea butter cost more and don&#x27;t have enough of the butter in them to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using Shea Butter</li>
            <li> Much better than the 4 different brands that I&#x27;ve used of which</li>
            <li> So shea butter most likely will not work on that hair type.</li>
            <li> This purchase was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been such a relief after struggling with her eczema for so many months</li>
            <li> Remember to only buy unrefined butters and oils as they retain more nutrients than their refined counter</li>
            <li> What I love more is that it is perfectly natural (absolutely no additives</li>
            <li> NOTHING moisturises like this, and all of the friends I have given this to have said the same and always asked for more.  </li>
            <li> My legs and arms looked so smooth and soft in my summer dress.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> The box was actually bigger than it needed to be, but this rode safely on clouds of air to our doorstep.</li>
            <li> Most shea butters I&#x27;ve seen on the market have an added oil that makes me break out and gives me red bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li> First time ever buying Shea Butter</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and my skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> I purchased some of that hot spot stuff and the scratching continued.</li>
            <li> After a trip to the vet to make sure there was no underlying health issues, I decided to use the same thing on her skin that I use on mine .</li>
            <li> It seems to be much more than two pounds as I had to use several plastic containers to preserve the Shea butter.</li>
            <li> BIG DIFFERENCE! :)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This was my first encounter with shea butter</li>
            <li> will defininly order this again as soon as I use up the rest of my first order.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It smelled authentic and there was enough for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> For some reason I wasn&#x27;t expecting so much!</li>
            <li> My experience with shea butter is that this is my first time trying it.</li>
            <li> It works much better than all of the lotions I used to buy and the 2 lbs will last forever.</li>
            <li> Thanks south!</li>
            <li> I bought this to make a cream for my hair and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap.</li>
            <li> It stores pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Love this product would definitely recommend anyone to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> It is very different from most people are used for moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and I found it to be exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This was the first time buying this.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering Shea Butter from anywhere.</li>
            <li> Only used in lotion bars so far, need more recipes!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this to make soaps and other products for her beauty shop and the finished products are amazing.</li>
            <li> Ivory in colour, soft and rich.</li>
            <li> I rather make my own body butters than buy them with all kinds of other chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> I used to buy my raw shea in 8oz containers for $8, but this price was too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li> It has a much milder aroma and it absorbs much better on the skin than the yellow shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter was soft and creamy at room temperature not hard like some I&#x27;ve experienced from other vendors.</li>
            <li> It shipped very fast, the price is reasonable for the amount of shea butter you receive</li>
            <li> I tried to be positive.</li>
            <li> is a high quality product, i will be back for more.</li>
            <li> The color is a natural off-white color and the smell is extremely mild.  </li>
            <li> I noticed African women have few wrinkles and beautiful skin-</li>
            <li> I heard that ivory shea butter did not have such a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> The nutty smell was not as strong as the yellow shea butter which was a plus with me.</li>
            <li> So I like to get pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> and I certainly will be ordering this product as well as others from this seller again</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t a moisturizer whatever it is.</li>
            <li> This is definitely pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Ive bought 100% unrefined shea butter before and it was a large brick as well</li>
            <li> and I have wasted a lot of money on many others!  </li>
            <li> It looked fine from outside.</li>
            <li> Started using this in a face cream for moisturizing mixed with some avocado and vitamin E oils - and some essential oils - love it!  </li>
            <li> The yellow is fine</li>
            <li> its really unrefined and pure</li>
            <li> It came in a large bag and looked promising until I opened the bag and got a whiff of what was inside.</li>
            <li> and when it arrived it was a little warm but that made it easier for me to manipulate it.</li>
            <li> but it dissipates quickly after you smooth it into your skin or mix it with other products.</li>
            <li> Its just as good as any other high quality raw shea, but at a better price.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing an authentic as I have had fake Shea butter before.</li>
            <li> but it functions like the real thing</li>
            <li> I begin to really like it.</li>
            <li> In fact, my whole refrigerator smells like shea butter even though it is placed in two sealed plastik bags.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> His skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li> I knew where it came from , the grade , and all at a reasonable price .</li>
            <li> Though I was able to return it with minimal fuss, it was a hassle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this for my skin and 4c hair, it really is a versatile product.</li>
            <li> It came within a week and was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> i use it for everything from hair to skin (WHOLE FAMILY).</li>
            <li> im ready to mix another batch.</li>
            <li> Shame on you halaeverday for trying to pull a fast one on me.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Since I needed this to make body butters, I really wanted the ivory colored shea.</li>
            <li> but of course can&#x27;t get too much or it&#x27;ll spoil on me</li>
            <li> and I really like the smell of this one and the color</li>
            <li> I got this much sooner than I thought I would.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> so I have no basis for comparison, but I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I used this shea butter to make homemade lotion and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> It is also very grainy even after being whipped.  </li>
            <li> Shipping and handling was about twice as much as the price of item</li>
            <li> It arrived in two days and appears to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> I then used the shea for what I&#x27;d really bought it for: making shortening for biscuits and pie crusts.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve never used shea before get ready to transform your skin, your beauty routine, your whole self from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Yes, earthy, but really just stinky.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Really folks, we&#x27;re not paying for packaging anyway.  </li>
            <li> Will keep trying as it does work very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very picky about things that are sent through the mail and that I put on my body.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth and not gritty at all.</li>
            <li> Buy with confidences this product comes well packaged and is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Recieved shea butter fast.</li>
            <li> Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li> It has given me some much needed relief</li>
            <li> Really wanted to try the Ivory.</li>
            <li> I have made 3 to 4 batches of shea butter as gifts and they absolutely luv it.</li>
            <li> I really like this ivory shea butter</li>
            <li> I know from research that Shea Butter is supposed to have a light nutty smell to it that blends with essential oils well.</li>
            <li> and it felt very unclean when I applied it to my skin</li>
            <li> was so much dirt in my Shea butter</li>
            <li> Very creamy, not crumbly.</li>
            <li> This product packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I melted it with some coconut oil and dropped a few drops of teatree oil in it and made a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> I mixed with my essential oils for a nice whipped product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this shea butter several times to make my own body butter (I melt it and add essential oils).</li>
            <li> I honestly could not get over the smell, even mixed with a bit of coconut oil and essential oils, the Shea smell was overpowering.</li>
            <li> This product definitely met my expectations especially after doing research on my own.</li>
            <li> It also leaves a nice glow to the skin without being greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly raw and unrefined, i love it!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t exactly tell you how quickly they ship with standard rates.</li>
            <li> I have used it in a hard lotion bar with other ingredients and it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> I keep it in a dry, cool place, and it is still fresh and as luscious as ever.</li>
            <li> May be better for some to use in colder climates or extremely parched skin.</li>
            <li> My sister in law was incredibly excited to open this gift on Christmas Eve.</li>
            <li> OK, I know that I am supposed to blend this with other oils to modify the odor, change the consistency, or be a shea butter connoisseur.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re paying for pure product which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used yellow shea butter in the past and I found it to be a great moisturizer</li>
            <li> I use now has a much more mellow smell, very creamy to the touch, soaks in very fast and leaves skin feeling very soft, and the stuff I use now is completely raw, unrefined, unfiltered so that really says something about its quality, and it&#x27;s much cheaper then this shea butter.</li>
            <li> I use it to make my own bath and lotion products, and I use it by itself when my skin is extra dry and chapped.  </li>
            <li> I only marked it as a 4 star because of the packaging (2 sealed bags) but I easily just put it in a ziploc bag after opening.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of natural body and hair products.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly soft, melts fast, fast, fast -  in the microwave.  </li>
            <li> So nice of them to go to the trouble of melting it and tasting it!</li>
            <li> It has a nutty earthy smell but its not bad, I actually like it.</li>
            <li> I love the color and consistency of this shea butter, you can really tell its pure and raw.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to live up to my expectations, but it did.  </li>
            <li> The homemade cream really makes a huge difference to my rough hands.</li>
            <li> The packaging was odd in that it was wrapped in many layers of cellophane and then placed in the bag, but it did not seem to detract from the product.</li>
            <li> 2 LBS for what most charge for 1Lb or less.</li>
            <li> I did however find myself really enjoying the smell after a while, especially when mixing in my lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> I put it on in place of body lotion after getting out of the shower, and after only a couple weeks, my skin seems to be in better condition, especially the looser areas that have been affected by pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I use some of this for cosmetics, but I bought this quantity from this particular supplier because I wanted to cook with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, silky, and it doesn&#x27;t stink like the cheap stuff you can buy locally.  </li>
            <li> The price is good, shipping is fast, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I had no problem transferring it to a container with a tight fitting lid.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am highly dissatisfied &amp; wish I had never bought it because all I can do now is throw it away.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for all naturals that don&#x27;t want to pay the high prices for a 16 oz  of Shea Butter at the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is high quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> Have used it on it&#x27;s own, as well as, mixed with other oils for massaging and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have shared it with many other naturally curly friends.</li>
            <li> So far, pleased with the value compared to other sites.</li>
            <li> It has a soft texture and was pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> I had raw Shea Butter before and wanted to make sure that this was the real stuff.....</li>
            <li> and my hands are soft!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more.</li>
            <li> melts in your hand, I love and use it as an everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the packaging of the product as it leaked but its still is good product &amp; I will use them again.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s an easy enough fix, try adding some fragrant essential oils to it.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more with the dry winters in wyoming</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as strong as some of the other brands I have purchased and I can&#x27;t wait to try it!  </li>
            <li> The shea butter comes wrapped in plastic, not a container, so I can see it melting and becoming a mess in warmer climates.    </li>
            <li> The other uses for me with this product are fantastic also.  </li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas, and my family</li>
            <li> The vacuum packs were fine for me, I just put the extra into a ziploc bag and stored it at room temperature.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my hair as a sealant in place of coconut oil, but it&#x27;s so ridiculously hard to use as it is very grainy and by no means SMOOTH in texture!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with the scent of my products and this is lightly scented and the smell goes away after a few minutes on the skin.</li>
            <li> Hand are soft and smooth even during rough winter temperatures.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is well worth the $12 you will spend if you are looking for a natural approach to beauty care.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t detect taste or smell of shea after the seitan was cooked; I didn&#x27;t really detect much aroma while frying, actually.</li>
            <li> When trying to get the product out expect a mess (it melts easy) and expect to have to leave some stuck to the bag.</li>
            <li> I went straight to buying 2lbs thinking that it was good based on previous reviews, but I strongly do not recommend buying this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it, and would highly recommend this for people looking for that natural product to soften skin, and for the various other uses it has.  </li>
            <li> main reason I use the pure shea butter is to reduce ingredients such as parabens and laurel sulfates that could cause Xeno hormones.  </li>
            <li> I agree with a lot of the other reviewers who did not like the packaging that it came in, a plastic bag, that once I picked it up and handled it (I was just reading the sticker on it) and the top of it began to rip open.</li>
            <li> Better overall price than other places I&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li> and it makes the skin so soft!  </li>
            <li> By morning my face was so soft!</li>
            <li> Natural clean slightly nutty smell, and very hydrating for my daughters&#x27; skin as well as mine.</li>
            <li> Duly noted, Ill pick a more reputable shipper/company next time.</li>
            <li> I used some of it on my elbows and it made them really soft!</li>
            <li> Completely met my expectations!</li>
            <li> I give it one star only because it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Little did I realize this would have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> but I was very hesitant to purchase it, reading reviews for days before I finally committed to this particular item.</li>
            <li> Fresh out of the package, the shea butter has its characteristic smokey/nutty aroma that it quite distinctive and pronounced.</li>
            <li> It was solid when it arrived, but still soft enough for me to cut it into chunks and store it in an airtight container; however, it was very cool outside.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to Shea butter (or not) it is definitely worth springing for the slightly more expensive ivory version.  </li>
            <li> It is a big hunk of pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped in clear plastic wrap, but then put into a sealed bag to help with temp control, I believe.  </li>
            <li> morning application is enough to keep skin moisturized the whole day.</li>
            <li> I transferred my stuff to plastic food containers for convenience using a double boiler, then straight to the freezer to avoid the grittiness.</li>
            <li> I would completely recommend this to anyone but you must have patience with the packaging.</li>
            <li> Real shea butter should be some form of ivory, beige or creamy color also not WHITE.</li>
            <li> started researching natural remedies, 20 years ago i never heard of eczema now everyone seems to have it</li>
            <li> Like using this product for natural body products.</li>
            <li> Its all natural.</li>
            <li> I decided to make a hair butter for me, my hubby and my daughters, who are all natural.</li>
            <li> (at least when I purchased) and really lovely to use.</li>
            <li> The shea butter gives Plenty of moisture, softens the toughest skin,&amp; it also rid some old scars &amp;marks.</li>
            <li> This is some soft and pliable shea butter.  </li>
            <li> but I get 2x as much from Halaleveryday for the same price.</li>
            <li> It blends very well with coconut oil, castor oil, essential oils, or what ever your preference is.</li>
            <li> have used it so far to fry homemade seitan, just as a test of its qualities.</li>
            <li> , it is all natural, so no fragrances in it.</li>
            <li> I used my Shea butter mix for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> A natural product will have natural variations.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin and hair soft.</li>
            <li> I would say the only difference is that it is nearly scentless while yellow shea butter has a distinct smell.</li>
            <li> I am now hooked on this natural moisturizer, have recommended &amp; given samples to friends &amp; will no longer be using commercialized processed lotions.  </li>
            <li> it comes as a solid brick which you can use as a lotion or heat the Shea butter to make a very moisturizing oil....</li>
            <li> you could always buy an essential oil like lavender and mix it in if it bothers you that much.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and seems leave my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely stopped using lotions since I purchased this shea butter.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft, moist and radiant.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I used it in a mixture of castor, jojoba and coconut oil for my natural hair for a two stranded twist.</li>
            <li> I did not own a scale, but I&#x27;m glad that I do now so that  </li>
            <li> I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap.</li>
            <li> Hands have never been so soft.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the non professional looking packaging but</li>
            <li> goes on well really natural.</li>
            <li> Granted, it was in a delivery truck in the heat all day, so it was completely melted to the consistency of snot-</li>
            <li> I purchased the yellow shea butter from HalalEveryday a few months ago and really enjoyed it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a drag to get it from plastic to a jar, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered my shea butter a few weeks ago I was overall was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I should have known better - there wasn&#x27;t any other shea butter being offered at anywhere near such a low price.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the fact that this shea butter is left raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t go off), a little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t block my pores - not even when I use it on my face, and it is dirt cheap!  </li>
            <li> I am married to a African and had the chance to compare to some shea butter hand carried from Ghana to us personally.  </li>
            <li> Extremely high quality, I have used it in several homemade skincare recipes.</li>
            <li> (just occurred to me that maybe it can be heated slightly in the microwave first, will give it a try tomorrow)!  </li>
            <li> It is long lasting and very very moisturizing</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on a Friday with standard shipping and it arrived the very next Wednesday, very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> your time and spend a little more on any other shea butter on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Plain white shea butter wrapped in plastic, light odor and mixes well to make a whipped shea skin cream.</li>
            <li> White one has a slight smell, not nearly as bad.</li>
            <li> haha, I see a lot of people complaining they got bad batches, I guess I was lucky because mine is creamy, ivory, and smooth.</li>
            <li> She said it really helped her dry skin - it was a hit!</li>
            <li> I cannot give the product anything lower than 5 stars even if the packaging sucks because the shea butter itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Then, in addition, it weighed only 1 pound, 2 ounces, which is a far cry from 2 pounds.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with a hand wisk and poured it into seven old hand cream jars.</li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend this product to every natural person i know.</li>
            <li> So far I have only made biscuits with my shea-infused shortening.</li>
            <li> However, the benefits still far outweigh the smell that I&#x27;m getting used to, so I will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends that are seeking a natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My hair felt completely moisturized the entire time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be surprised when you open this.</li>
            <li> So a lot of people were saying this has a &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell or barely noticeable smell</li>
            <li> I melt a piece and use with coconut oil and essential oils for a soft cream; you can use it in your face and hair.</li>
            <li> I was surprised this product was very yellow not ivory at all.</li>
            <li> And once you open the bag you will most likely find the shea is not solid our or even a few big chunks.</li>
            <li> Have separated it into smaller to store in no light, plus cool place.  </li>
            <li> texture is about right to use undiluted as shortening, but I was a little too timid to try it that way.</li>
            <li> Right now i have some in my hair that i melted with a little bit of some olive oil</li>
            <li> I was not sure about this butter at first because I am new to this product, bus as I was using it in soap making and creams</li>
            <li> Highly recommended - I will never waste money on other over priced products which just don&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem at all like other pure shea butter</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for my naturally dry African hair!</li>
            <li> First off, what I received was brown and black and looked nothing like the advertised pictures.  </li>
            <li> It works quite well, absorbs quickly, and has that good old (or bad depending on your opinion) raw shea smell.</li>
            <li> Compared to other places selling unrefined shea butter, this is a great price (although the shipping is a bit high, but even with the shipping price, it is less expensive than others).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same color as in the picture, an ivory color, and it mixes very well with the other oils that I used to make my hair butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i apply my &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; as I wind down and get ready for bed.</li>
            <li> I personally did not discount this from the products overall rating because its raw and unrefined and doesn&#x27;t have as long of a shelf life as a product that has been tweaked from its original state.</li>
            <li> Healing my dry skin to soft skin with in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I cut it up and press it into a small jar to use it &amp; put the balance in a Rubbermaid-type container to keep it fresh, refilling the smaller job as needed.  </li>
            <li> I have used coconut oil on my face for the past few years and have added some shea butter.and the effect is better.  </li>
            <li> This is the first raw shea butter that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s great for soothing dry skin And lotion-makers can even use it as a base for natural Hairmilk recipes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s only a slight scent to it, nothing I can really smell, definitely not anything offensive.</li>
            <li> Raw shea is so much more beneficial to the skin than the processed stuff, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I first put it in my hands to melt a little and use it on my face, hands, everywhere!</li>
            <li> Came in a sealed plastic bag, medium to light shea butter smell, and with all sheas, it is a little on the heavy side, but luxurious on the skin.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit compared to lotion, if you use to much it will make your skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Very unnerving and unsettling, especially because I&#x27;m going through a bad patch of eczema with very dry skin and was looking for the best natural shea butter</li>
            <li> I really have nothing bad to say :)</li>
            <li> This is good stuff the smell took a day to get used to or mine went bad</li>
            <li> and it is not as pure and raw as yellow is, but</li>
            <li> The packaging was flimsy just a vacuum sealed bag</li>
            <li> (I only need about 8oz for a batch of lotion) but it cut very easily even (if not especially) when cold.</li>
            <li> It is a light grey color not ivory and very hard to the point I had to heat it some to whip it up.  </li>
            <li> I have made 2 batches so far and noticed severe amounts of black dirt particles and little strands of little frizzy hair filled in all of them (i have long hair).</li>
            <li> This butter had a strong smell - not spoiled but not a good smell to me - and had a couple of dark specks in the butter.  </li>
            <li> It is grey in color &amp; I tried to make lotion with it but no amount of essential oils can cover it.</li>
            <li> No need for any commercial hand lotion, lasts long throughout hand washes.</li>
            <li> Came in alot will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> is the normal consistency of shea butter - firm yet malleable.</li>
            <li> I searched many sites for raw unrefined shea butter and got no good results until I found this seller.</li>
            <li> Her dander is down and the scratching has completely stopped.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous Shea Butter I ordered, this batch had an &#x27;old oil&#x27; smell to it.</li>
            <li> Be careful when it arrives, it&#x27;s double packed to avoid drying/leaking so don&#x27;t open it unless you have somewhere to store it.</li>
            <li> After I added the Shea Butter that I ordered from this company, it smelled like something that has been festering in a toilet bowl.</li>
            <li> fermented toilet bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few months back I accidentally ordered shea butter from a different seller and I received yellow grainy mush that felt really gross and made me break out.</li>
            <li> I used this for my extra dry skin!</li>
            <li> then the ivory should be your choice, the Yellow does not mix well with other butters such as Cocoa Butter or Mango butter.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mixed it with other oils i purchased from the same seller.will</li>
            <li> I just dip my fingers into the bag, place some in the palm of my hand and rub my hands together to apply it to my body, especially on the very dry areas like my feet, elbows and knees.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And so far, I&#x27;ve used just a little bit to make body butter.  </li>
            <li> read all reviews prior to purchasing this product paying particular attention to the negative ones and</li>
            <li> I usually melt it down in a double boiler or you can put in a pot with water and place the shea butter in a large bowl or glass jar.  </li>
            <li> After I melt it, I found a dead insect and the worst thing is that IT HAS MANY MANY SANDS</li>
            <li> If it was warmer, I would be worried that the shea butter would be too soft and therefore really messy.  </li>
            <li> When I ran out I was curious about white shea butter.</li>
            <li> their reply:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The yellow color basically comes from added Crushed Shea nut shell that is being added to the Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way.and can be used to make quite a bit of products.</li>
            <li> If I could have given a minus star, I would give it ten.</li>
            <li> However, during my last use I did notice the shea butter turned from its ivory/pale grey color to having tinges of pastel pink with a somewhat rancid odor.</li>
            <li> I use to buy it at a African shop and they wanted ten dollars for half the quantity.</li>
            <li> No better protectant barrier for new bums.</li>
            <li> I can melt it down and add it to my other natural oils I use on my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I believe it is due to my shea butter recipe and because I am using this shea butter instead of the yellow.</li>
            <li> melt (even after 20 minutes in the double boiler) and doesn&#x27;t mix with any of the other oils and butters I tried to mix it with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was SOO much more expensive!</li>
            <li> due to quality and speediness of delivery i&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> This is the all natural raw shea butter from Africa.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair when the ends feel dry, it moisturizes without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on cracked heals and dry skin anywhere.</li>
            <li> and I have a problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> So, I set out to make a moisturizing soap for us that wouldn&#x27;t dry out our skin.</li>
            <li> even for those with dry hair</li>
            <li> It was mixed with some other unknown substances[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Mine was not gritty or greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so you will find some, very few at that, natural debris from the shelling process</li>
            <li> Its too cold to take cold showers and my skin typically dries out quickly after a hot shower this glides on easy is thick initially</li>
            <li> I previously thought that white shea butter is somehow refined</li>
            <li> /&gt;i apply a small dab on my face daily and my skin has such a glow.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and I did not have any of the problems with it being the wrong texture/smell etc as others have said.</li>
            <li> I put it on in the late evening and woke up with very soft, supple skin well nourished and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It also had grey spots like the other reviews</li>
            <li> but I like that - a little extra work out in the morning,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time because a little goes a long way and with a shelf life of 18-24 months</li>
            <li> We spent years in Cameroon Africa</li>
            <li> My legs, feet, and arms become ashy within the next few hours after application.</li>
            <li> Not quite what was expected</li>
            <li> Smell and texture was as I expected and works well.</li>
            <li> Received as expected, however it took longer to be delivered  than I expected.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that since the shea butter is so thick, you really have to rub it between your palms to soften/melt it and</li>
            <li> Besides the black and green spots, it smelt much mustier and earthy than shea butter usually does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I saw white shea butter described also as &#x27;raw unrefined&#x27;</li>
            <li> With just one use I saw a change in my red, sore and raw hands.</li>
            <li> There is no fancying packaging, it is just a big raw hunk of butter wrapped in plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> The bag was labeled properly with \\&quot;raw, unrefined organic shea\\&quot; eliminating any doubt in my mind of the products quality and</li>
            <li> It comes in 2 bags a big one &amp; then a very tight one that makes the shea butter stick to it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical at first to get this shea butter (after reading some of the reviews on here)</li>
            <li> I also thought it was well priced as compared to other vendors/web sites.</li>
            <li> The other layer was grayish and didn&#x27;t smell at all like shea butter.</li>
            <li> A total waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Use to make body butter adding other ingredients, use to make hair conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> so other container is needed after opening.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain why, other than that it is unfamiliar to me</li>
            <li> I have tried other Shea Butter Grade A before.  </li>
            <li> Looking at other reviews i decide to go ahead and try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from this seller before, as well as other items.  </li>
            <li> This lasted me about 6 months and that is including doing other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> but i  do question quality control due to packaging.</li>
            <li> used the product as a trial run for experimenting with textures, whipping and adding other things.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it with other creams.  </li>
            <li> So people who love to read reviews like me this in an AWSOME product you will not be disappointed..</li>
            <li> I used it along with other oils for a mixture for my hair.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not allergic to shea butter because i have used other brands with soothing success.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item was received in a large unlabeled dirty open plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Add a few drops of Lavender essential oil and whip it in the mixer for a little while</li>
            <li> For one, the package was hard to open and once I opened it, the huge block of shea butter was so hard and breaking it apart was so messy and unnecessary.</li>
            <li> For those of you who inexplicably cannot remove a product from a plastic bag, a night in the refrigerator will harden it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to some of the feedback left here, raw shea butter varies considerably in color and odor, from pale ivory to greenish-yellow, and does not mean the product is not &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> However, the stuff is slightly smelly and it has rough blobs in it.</li>
            <li> It was ok, smelled really bad and had a sticky texture, felt really heavy on the skin, never really absorbed, just stayed oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling greasy but dry and stiff.</li>
            <li> Hard to rid of but hoping to keep it around and use in the future for skin lotion if I can figure a way to lessen the overpowering smell</li>
            <li> It is a big block that comes in a bag and it is really hard.</li>
            <li> I have been using pure shea butter instead of lotions, especially during the cold, harsh winter we&#x27;ve had so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the packaging; wrapped in plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> I paid for ivory shea butter grade A, but instead got a mass of inert dark brown something that looks like crumpled dirt, and does&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I complained to the company and they said they&#x27;d replace it, just to send it back.</li>
            <li> the only negative I agree with is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Has evened out my complexion, clears dark spots quicker than a fade cream would and keeps skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am storing this in the basement up against a cold concrete wall to keep it solid.</li>
            <li> Like I said good product but  terrible packaging</li>
            <li> I will say with using this shea butter, black soap, and loofah</li>
            <li> Will find another organic product with less odor.</li>
            <li> Unrefined, so it has that slightly nutty scent.  </li>
            <li> Slight odor (no biggie) and slight discoloration to product but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying my shea butter and black soap from this company from now on.</li>
            <li> mix it with other oils and plain lotions just so it&#x27;s easier to work</li>
            <li> My hair type is 4b/4c with a tight, coily, ringlet pattern.</li>
            <li> For curiosity I weighed it and it was a little over 2lbs.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I do find that after I use it on my hands, for a little while after I do make smudge marks on glass or any non-porous surface.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes just take a little, massage it in my hands and rub it on my feet.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like I lost a little because of this.</li>
            <li> Sometime I will mix it with a little argon oil.  </li>
            <li> and i melt a little and use it all over my body, face and the rest.</li>
            <li> I melt it down and add coconut oil for a moisturizing lather, and for 12 bucks u can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 lbs and it came in a firm block.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this before and will never order from this company again as the entire 2 lbs had to be trashed!</li>
            <li> I used it to make Creamy and Fluffy Shea Butter Creams variations of Naptural85&#x27;s recipes found on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> The block of shea butter came wrapped in a few layers of plastic wrap, and then sealed in a light-proof zip-top bag.  </li>
            <li> but when I opened the plastic I was hit by the most sickening smell of anesthesia masks chemicals.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with anything else.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and received it in a few days.</li>
            <li> This shea butter was GREEN.  </li>
            <li> smell itself is not strong and gradually goes away after applying.</li>
            <li> Called me on phone very angry, yelling because I left low seller review.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight odor, my daughter says it smells like crayons..</li>
            <li> My husband also uses it on his hands (he is a shipping manager and works outside in the cold) and it&#x27;s done wonders for his dry, cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> this shea butter is unrefined (raw) just like it is said in the description.</li>
            <li> but I like the idea of using raw shea butter</li>
            <li> Raw Unrefined IVORY Shea Butter Grade A From Ghana 2 Lbs].</li>
            <li> Raw (unrefined)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a totally raw product)and</li>
            <li> And this is non-processed and raw.</li>
            <li> I used my raw unrefined shea butter to make whipped shea butter.</li>
            <li> I believe It&#x27;s supposed to have that sort of earthy scent because it&#x27;s raw and unrefined.</li>
            <li> I put raw shea butter on every morning, after i brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I use it raw for my face or lips.</li>
            <li> This raw unrefined grade</li>
            <li> I used it raw as a moisturizer and added it in my soaps.</li>
            <li> From what I have researched about raw unrefined IVORY shea butter, it can vary in color but should be somewhat close to ivory.  </li>
            <li> This product did not come in any container and was hard to use as it was so firm.</li>
            <li> The packing was bad however doesnt really look like 2lbs to me</li>
            <li> Came in a clear bag and it looked dirty in some parts</li>
            <li> It was not sealed and had a small opening in it.  </li>
            <li> I cut a small piece and noticed it was two toned in color.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying shea butter for years, and the supplier i usually buy from was out of stock</li>
            <li> I read a few negative reviews but decided to take a chance on this product anyway.</li>
            <li> It smells old &amp; dirty, musty.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time but was in a plastic bag that was opened (not sure if happened in transit or not).</li>
            <li> and I look forward to buying from halal everyday again!</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of hair growth/retention these past 4 months (2 inches)</li>
            <li> I have used in past.</li>
            <li> I have not used it for cake frosting yet; I&#x27;m not sure that the shea aroma would be compatible with vanilla buttercream, but it would work with chocolate buttercream.</li>
            <li> I keep a small container of it in my bathroom to use on my elbows, heels and hands and just replenish it monthly.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> I combine some of the products and use them everyday!</li>
            <li> users like to cold whip their Shea to make a very light whipped sticky butter that can be used as a base for other formularies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very firm.</li>
            <li> Now not sure if I got a bad batch of body butter or if the smell is normal.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product itself but the packaging is TERRIBLE AND ANNOYING.</li>
            <li> it was wrapped in plastic and with these summer mths ahead im a little wary on how it will be delivered in extreme heat.&lt;br /&gt;thats</li>
            <li> In any case, this is still raw, unrefined ivory shea butter and it works wonders!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter in all of my homemade beauty products lately.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be needing to buy anymore for at least another year</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick</li>
            <li> Sadly i cant smell it right now because i have a bad stuffy nose</li>
            <li> I hate writing bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is very important for the all over cream I make.</li>
            <li> This is real raw unrefined shea butter.</li>
            <li> It comes bundled up in a lucid plastic covering instead of in a container or jar, which sucks :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it on my hair and skin for several months, I realized it doesn&#x27;t give my hair any moisturization.</li>
            <li> This stuff always turns up, in small percentages, in expensive products (eg, L&#x27;Occitane) which tells a story in itself.  </li>
            <li> No more wasting money on expensive skin product that doesnt work.</li>
            <li> This makes it very messy and difficult to get out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> so my skin is often dry and thin, sometimes painful.  </li>
            <li> hope this is the secret.  </li>
            <li> Seriously you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months and it hasn&#x27;t gone bad.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I was not happy with smell.</li>
            <li> Even though it smelled awful, I wanted to get used to the texture of the butter and see what I could do as far as altering it.</li>
            <li> orignally ordered it for my teenage son&#x27;s eczema, his is very bad.</li>
            <li> It has a green tint to it and smells terrible - between a play doh and black licorice smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was just really bad shea butter</li>
            <li> but honestly it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I was going to make lotion bars with it, but the essential oils couldn&#x27;t mask the horrible smell.</li>
            <li> There was a faint smell of shea butter but the dominant smell was something I can&#x27;t describe.</li>
            <li> Although, now that it is room temp, it still isn&#x27;t difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I blind taste-tested it on my boyfriend, who tends to be quite picky about tastes, and he didn&#x27;t know that I hadn&#x27;t fried in anything</li>
            <li> It has a faint smoky smell to me, that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t gotten around to it yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making body care for 13 years and this stuff is weird.  </li>
            <li> but I could careless about that.</li>
            <li> I gave my ill sis</li>
            <li> Seller was crazy, too.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li> and they are so WRONG!</li>
            <li> Even worse I am stuck with this terrible prouct because I, for some absurd reason, cannot return this product...</li>
            <li> Also the scent was NOT as some have stated bad in any way.</li>
            <li> Like, really bad.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how bad this shea butter was.  </li>
            <li> Bad decision.</li>
            <li> Is it a bad thing to smell like butter?</li>
            <li> This Shea butter are sooo bad, I am very disappointing.</li>
            <li> you wont b disappointed</li>
            <li> No particles of dirt/other crap to pick through at all.</li>
            <li> Its time consuming and annoying.</li>
            <li> I found this to be really annoying</li>
            <li> and my skin reacted really badly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smelly, but doesn&#x27;t smell very bad as some users said.</li>
            <li> My son has a terrible case of eczema and</li>
            <li> It smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> It smells awful</li>
            <li> THE PACKAGING IS AWFUL</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible in my lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Nasty stuff.  </li>
            <li> People say the smell is terrible</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED...</li>
            <li> Also, IT SMELLS DISGUSTING!</li>
            <li> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SMELLING!</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Use it for soap making and it makes my soap so smooth.</li>
            <li> I use Shea butter in my soaps and lotions. This came in a brown bag package that can be resealed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own whipped body butter, and the quality was exceptional. When it is time to make more body butter I will order this again, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this ptoduct on seversl orders and have been very pleased each time. I am not fussy so the plastic that it is shipped in didn&#x27;t bother me one bit. The product was my focus because I use the Shea as part of my daily routine. It never clogs my pores and leaves my skin wonderfuly moisturzed.</li>
            <li> Came in a clear bag and it looked dirty in some parts but it functions like the real thing and that is what counts. Read up on the harvesting process.</li>
            <li> We spent years in Cameroon Africa but I never had the chance to become acquainted with this product there.  I use it as a hand cream, it&#x27;s delightful.  Excellent, try it</li>
            <li> I just received this and I love it.  The product is very smooth.  It was solid when it arrived, but still soft enough for me to cut it into chunks and store it in an airtight container; however, it was very cool outside.  If it was warmer, I would be worried that the shea butter would be too soft and therefore really messy.  The shea butter comes wrapped in plastic, not a container, so I can see it melting and becoming a mess in warmer climates.    In any case, this is still raw, unrefined ivory shea butter and it works wonders!  I use it for my hair (mixing it with coconut, jojoba, castor, and EVOO oil; aloe vera (totally organic, not aloe vera gel), and essential oils (which help with hair growth, circulation, and mask the smell of shea butter).  I can also use this mix on my skin.  I love it.  I will order from this seller again and again!</li>
            <li> I had raw Shea Butter before and wanted to make sure that this was the real stuff.....it is and creamier than I had gotten locally. I ordered 2 lbs and it came in a firm block. For curiosity I weighed it and it was a little over 2lbs.  I cut it up and press it into a small jar to use it &amp; put the balance in a Rubbermaid-type container to keep it fresh, refilling the smaller job as needed.  A little goes along way. I first put it in my hands to melt a little and use it on my face, hands, everywhere! It is absorbed quickly and it is not greasy or makes any mark on fabric or any cloth if you touch it.  I do find that after I use it on my hands, for a little while after I do make smudge marks on glass or any non-porous surface.  It&#x27;s no big deal, whips away and my hands are soft!! Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Really nice quality shea butter- I use it almost every day, and it&#x27;s really excellent. Raw shea is so much more beneficial to the skin than the processed stuff, and a little goes a long way. This is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great product speedy delivery. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about this butter at first because I am new to this product, bus as I was using it in soap making and creams I begin to really like it. It smells amazing and fresh. In fact, my whole refrigerator smells like shea butter even though it is placed in two sealed plastik bags.  I also purchased another shea butter that was twice the price and compared the two. This Shea butter, in my opinion, is much better.</li>
            <li> Stronger smell than I anticipated.  Hard to rid of but hoping to keep it around and use in the future for skin lotion if I can figure a way to lessen the overpowering smell</li>
            <li> I am quite thrilled with the shea butter.  It is excellent quality, low price and they have great customer service.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Product is soothing to the skin. A little goes a long way. May be better for some to use in colder climates or extremely parched skin.</li>
            <li> Good service &amp; verry good&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
            <li> I used previously yellow shea butter and I liked it. When I ran out I was curious about white shea butter. I previously thought that white shea butter is somehow refined and it is not as pure and raw as yellow is, but I saw white shea butter described also as &#x27;raw unrefined&#x27; so I sent a letter to Halaleveryday company asking about the difference. Here is their reply:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The yellow color basically comes from added Crushed Shea nut shell that is being added to the Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;If your intent is to make body butter with the Shea Butter then the ivory should be your choice, the Yellow does not mix well with other butters such as Cocoa Butter or Mango butter.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont mix my shea butter with anything and I use it on my body as well as on my face, but I dont know why crushed shea nut shell would be good for my skin so I picked white one.&lt;br /&gt;The only difference that I can say between yellow and white is that white one is not as smelly as yellow. A lot of ppl dont like the smell of yellow shea butter. White one has a slight smell, not nearly as bad. Overall good product. I think Im gonna continue with white butter</li>
            <li> this shea butter is unrefined (raw) just like it is said in the description. it has a specific &#x27;nutty&#x27; smell that some people may not like but for me the most important thing is to get a pure unrefined product. smell itself is not strong and gradually goes away after applying. leaved skin silky smooth and is more moisturizing than cocoa butter. morning application is enough to keep skin moisturized the whole day. as soon as it&#x27;s over i&#x27;ll order it again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with Amazon prime so it was very fast delivery, can&#x27;t exactly tell you how quickly they ship with standard rates. But anyway this is GREAT shea butter very rich and creamy. Mine was not gritty or greasy and a little goes a long way. Also the scent was NOT as some have stated bad in any way. I&#x27;m very picky with the scent of my products and this is lightly scented and the smell goes away after a few minutes on the skin. I am very happy with the product itself but the packaging is TERRIBLE AND ANNOYING. It comes in 2 bags a big one &amp; then a very tight one that makes the shea butter stick to it. When trying to get the product out expect a mess (it melts easy) and expect to have to leave some stuck to the bag. I cannot give the product anything lower than 5 stars even if the packaging sucks because the shea butter itself is fantastic. I transferred my stuff to plastic food containers for convenience using a double boiler, then straight to the freezer to avoid the grittiness. Oh and the color is actually Ivory which is a good sign that this is good quality with its natural elements still intact. I would completely recommend this to anyone but you must have patience with the packaging. Great quality, creamy and silky, no harsh smell, and the 2 lb bag is enough.    NOTE: one last thing yellow \\&quot;shea\\&quot; butter is not shea butter. If it is yellow it is from a completely different tree/part of Africa. It is still great quality butter but it is NOT SHEA butter. Real shea butter should be some form of ivory, beige or creamy color also not WHITE. if it is white that means all the benefits have been bleached and boiled away.    Hope this helps enjoy :)</li>
            <li> I melt it down and add coconut oil for a moisturizing lather, and for 12 bucks u can&#x27;t beat it! It&#x27;s truly raw and unrefined, i love it!</li>
            <li> My son has a terrible case of eczema and my husband and I put this on him daily.  His skin has improved so much.</li>
            <li> I searched many sites for raw unrefined shea butter and got no good results until I found this seller. I knew where it came from , the grade , and all at a reasonable price . I Wii shop here again,.</li>
            <li> I should have known better - there wasn&#x27;t any other shea butter being offered at anywhere near such a low price. You get what you pay for, I guess. I&#x27;m not sure if it was just really bad shea butter or if it was not even shea butter at all, but it was all un-useable. It smelled terrible. Like, really bad. I was going to make lotion bars with it, but the essential oils couldn&#x27;t mask the horrible smell. It smelled like chemicals mixed with spoiled butter of some kind. It was not what shea butter is supposed to smell like. I would not recommend purchasing from this seller, especially if the price is unexpectedly low for the item.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. It&#x27;s very smooth and moisturizing. My only problem with this is the packaging.  First off out comes in a sealed plastic bag, so expect to scrape the butter out. Hopefully you&#x27;re got patience. I luckily ordered during March in Chicago, so it wasn&#x27;t too stuck. And once you open the bag you will most likely find the shea is not solid our or even a few big chunks. Oh no, it&#x27;s a bunch of tiny chunks and crumbly pieces. Like I said good product but  terrible packaging</li>
            <li> I purchased the yellow shea butter from HalalEveryday a few months ago and really enjoyed it but it smelled very strong and the color was BRIGHT yellow so I decided to pay a bit more for the ivory shea butter... boy is it worth it!  The color is a natural off-white color and the smell is extremely mild.  I make a body butter with coconut oil and jojoba oil and the butter used to smell VERY strongly of the shea butter and be VERY yellow.  Now the butter smells deliciously of coconut with a hint of nutty shea butter and the color is much more natural.  If you are new to Shea butter (or not) it is definitely worth springing for the slightly more expensive ivory version.  Either way, NOTHING makes my skin feel softer than unrefined shea butter!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plenty! ordered this about 9 months ago...still have more than 1/2 the block.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how bad this shea butter was.  First off, what I received was brown and black and looked nothing like the advertised pictures.  Then, in addition, it weighed only 1 pound, 2 ounces, which is a far cry from 2 pounds.  Lesson learned... I won&#x27;t order this again.  I&#x27;ve asked for a refund and I better get it!</li>
            <li> Compared to other places selling unrefined shea butter, this is a great price (although the shipping is a bit high, but even with the shipping price, it is less expensive than others). The shea butter is good quality and worked great when whipping with other skin/hair friendly oils.     The vacuum packs were fine for me, I just put the extra into a ziploc bag and stored it at room temperature.</li>
            <li> I use this unrefined shea butter as an ingredient in making my own lotion and hair care products.  The smell is a bit too strong to my liking but I like the idea of using raw shea butter so I will tolerate the smell.  I like using the mango fragrances to camouflage the smell of the shea butter because it seems ti hide the SB smell the best..</li>
            <li> It is very clean and wonderfully rich.  I made a batch of hand cream with this shea butter. Easy as pie. I melted it on the stove and added all the leftover old hand cream I had on hand and added a good splash of essential lemon oil.  I mixed it with a hand wisk and poured it into seven old hand cream jars. It is perfect.  Smells OK (the lemon oil helped) and rubs into my skin with ease.  A very cheap way to make a huge quantity of a high quality product.  Lotions and creams with shea butter cost more and don&#x27;t have enough of the butter in them to make a difference.  The homemade cream really makes a huge difference to my rough hands.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality &amp; value. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I thought I would take a chance on this, despite the reviews that it arrived moldy. Bad decision. Though I was able to return it with minimal fuss, it was a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly, via Prime. It looked fine from outside. However, when I opened it, it was splotchy, with a severe lack of any ivory color. Besides the black and green spots, it smelt much mustier and earthy than shea butter usually does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your time and spend a little more on any other shea butter on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Shea Butter and I made whipped body butter for a class I taught. I was very happy with the texture and results of my body butter. The packaging was odd in that it was wrapped in many layers of cellophane and then placed in the bag, but it did not seem to detract from the product. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent kind! Much better than the 4 different brands that I&#x27;ve used of which one of them was even Cetified.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was promt! I hope supplier will keep up with the excellent quality of their Shea.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product. I use this for my skin and 4c hair, it really is a versatile product. I weighed it and actually received OVER two pounds!</li>
            <li> [updated] This rating is not based on the seller or the product itself but more about my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical at first to get this shea butter (after reading some of the reviews on here) but I am glad I tried it out. It&#x27;s just as good as yellow shea butter (the yellow one has a stronger odor). It comes bundled up in a lucid plastic covering instead of in a container or jar, which sucks :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it on my hair and skin for several months, I realized it doesn&#x27;t give my hair any moisturization. It leaves my hair feeling greasy but dry and stiff. My hair type is 4b/4c with a tight, coily, ringlet pattern. So shea butter most likely will not work on that hair type. As per my skin, it keeps it moisturized for some hours. My legs, feet, and arms become ashy within the next few hours after application.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my shea butter.  It came within a week and was packaged very well.  I did have to transfer the shea into a sealable container but I am very satisfied with the quality of the shea butter!  Will order from here again!</li>
            <li> Was not wrapped very well,could have been in some kind of container. But it will be useable for my homemade soap.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it to make diaper cream and in baby wipes. It has a good consistency and the smell is not too strong.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really enjoying this product and what a great value. i would definitely recommend this product to every natural person i know.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly, was packaged professionally, and worked great for my homemade lip balms! Read a lot of reviews before finally purchasing the Shea Butter from this seller and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Came neatly package . Love using the ivory shea butter in my hair and body products.</li>
            <li> I make a shea/cocoa butter mix for hair and skin, and this stuff works perfectly.  I also thought it was well priced as compared to other vendors/web sites.</li>
            <li> I use this to make a Shea butter cream for my hair and it works perfect- Also the price is great!! :-) I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, and got it to make others soaps, but can&#x27;t keep my hands off it and haven&#x27;t gotten to the soap making stage yet! Be careful when it arrives, it&#x27;s double packed to avoid drying/leaking so don&#x27;t open it unless you have somewhere to store it. Great product!</li>
            <li> this is my second order from this seller and i have become hooked on shea butter. i use it for everything from hair to skin (WHOLE FAMILY). orignally ordered it for my teenage son&#x27;s eczema, his is very bad. started researching natural remedies, 20 years ago i never heard of eczema now everyone seems to have it (something in the environment and foods i think)  i also add coconut, Jamaican castor, emu, and jojoba oils to my butter to reap all the benefits. the only issue i have like others is the packaging. i think it could be better. it was wrapped in plastic and with these summer mths ahead im a little wary on how it will be delivered in extreme heat.&lt;br /&gt;thats the reason i gave 4 instead of 5 stars otherwise great product, quick ship, great price. will definitely be ordering in the future, definitely recommend to others to use. rite now i store my unmixed portion in my fridge til im ready to mix another batch. i hope thats ok i dont want to lose any of its natural benefits.</li>
            <li> I liked it. I made some lotion with it. I melted it with some coconut oil and dropped a few drops of teatree oil in it and made a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> This product surpassed my expectations.  I will definitely make additional purchases in the future. My only complaint is the packaging; wrapped in plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality mixes easily with natural oils and lasts months. Heals my itchy dry skin and keeps me perfectly moisturized throughout winter.</li>
            <li> When I received my package, it arrived in a triple wrapped plastic bag.  It was not sealed and had a small opening in it.  I love the nutty smell of shea butter, however this did not have that nutty smell.  There was a faint smell of shea butter but the dominant smell was something I can&#x27;t describe. I cut a small piece and noticed it was two toned in color.  The other layer was grayish and didn&#x27;t smell at all like shea butter. The inner layer was a lighter gray an had that familiar nuttey smell.  I used the product anyway and immediately it started itching.  What I received was not 2 pounds of 100% shea butter. It was mixed with some other unknown substances[[ASIN:B003B9DWMA Raw Unrefined IVORY Shea Butter Grade A From Ghana 2 Lbs]. Either way it&#x27;s going back.  Shame on you halaeverday for trying to pull a fast one on me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. And as we all know, When the Queen is happy, everybody is happy!</li>
            <li> I use it to make body butter. I like it.</li>
            <li> Used it to make some cuticle butter for gifts.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Like using this product for natural body products. Does not have a strong fragrance and melts quickly. Great price. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great quality shea butter! It has an earthy aroma that may take some getting used to. I did however find myself really enjoying the smell after a while, especially when mixing in my lavender essential oil. I&#x27;ve gotten great use out of this two pound bag and have had a chance to try varying recipes. My favorite so far for skin and kinky-curly hair is 2/3 cups of shea butter to 1/3 cup of unrefined coconut oil whipped together by melting them first, allowing it to solidify then whipping with a whisk hand-mixer. I&#x27;ve had the same batch for over a year now and I&#x27;m finally running out of it! However, during my last use I did notice the shea butter turned from its ivory/pale grey color to having tinges of pastel pink with a somewhat rancid odor. I personally did not discount this from the products overall rating because its raw and unrefined and doesn&#x27;t have as long of a shelf life as a product that has been tweaked from its original state. Love this stuff and will likely order it again :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in a homemade body moisturizing formula that I found on the internet.  It works very well, and I was able to give some to a friend who was having skin problems as a result of chemo.  She said it really helped her dry skin - it was a hit!</li>
            <li> Came in a sealed plastic bag, medium to light shea butter smell, and with all sheas, it is a little on the heavy side, but luxurious on the skin.  I put it on in place of body lotion after getting out of the shower, and after only a couple weeks, my skin seems to be in better condition, especially the looser areas that have been affected by pregnancy.  Sometimes I even put on my face at bedtime - no break-outs.  I saw somewhere where someone wrote that if applied to the underarm area shea butter can help with body odor, and amazingly enough it seems to help.  Just slather this stuff on everywhere!</li>
            <li> I have been buying shea butter for years, and the supplier i usually buy from was out of stock so i bought this. When I opened the sealed bag, it smelled like spoiled olive oil - not how shea butter should smell at all! I tried it anyways and my skin reacted really badly! DO NOT buy this product.  It also had grey spots like the other reviews mention - I think this might be mold???  Just gross.  Waste of money - this product is going straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it has no addititve. Its all natural. This shea butter is only but your skin will absorb it well. This is especially great for the colder seasons. I am now doing research to see if I can buy it in a purer form than this. I will say with using this shea butter, black soap, and loofah my skin is looking great. I notice my skin has a healthy glow. I do not have as many blemishes as before. I will email the seller to see if this is the purest that she can get for me.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I was not happy with smell. I use Shea butter a lot and but it by pounds. So, I know about smell and color. Both were not up to my standards.I hate writing bad reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is very important for the all over cream I make. &gt; /</li>
            <li> Little did I realize this would have a strong odor.  While whipping for my own formulas, adding almost 1/2 of a bottle of Vanilla essential oil did almost nothing.  Adding another 15 drops of Lavender helped.  The butter itself is super silky after whipping, but the smell is a bit much for me.  Will find another organic product with less odor.</li>
            <li> The product is great. I love the texture. I am likely to order it again and tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> I use the shea butter when I make my own lotions and deodorants.  I sometimes just take a little, massage it in my hands and rub it on my feet.  It&#x27;s a great and oraganic product to use.</li>
            <li> This purchase was exactly what I was looking for. It is a big hunk of pure shea butter. That&#x27;s it. Nothing fancy just a great price.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this Shea butter back in february 2013 to make home made (cloth diaper safe) diaper cream. I am so glad I did....turns out my daughter has nummular eczema and this clears it up SO fast!! It&#x27;s been such a relief after struggling with her eczema for so many months (I had originally thought she had ring worm). Of course it works good as lotion period, and also as an ingredient to the home made diaper cream.</li>
            <li> I love it, I love it, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether used as hand cream, foot cream, body butter, lock-butter, scalpdress, you name it,...Raw (unrefined) Shea Butter It is a great head to toe product that leaves you with super soft conditioned hair and skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices may vary by region or supplier, but if you do a price comparison, you should be able to find quality butter, at a reasonable price. Remember to only buy unrefined butters and oils as they retain more nutrients than their refined counter parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many users like to cold whip their Shea to make a very light whipped sticky butter that can be used as a base for other formularies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for soothing dry skin And lotion-makers can even use it as a base for natural Hairmilk recipes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is an awesome natural product. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our grade: B ; or 4-Stars!</li>
            <li> Why use lotion on your skin when this is much better.  Plus, it&#x27;s melting point is just below your own body temperature.  Goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I decided to make a hair butter for me, my hubby and my daughters, who are all natural. I knew I wanted some shea butter but I was very hesitant to purchase it, reading reviews for days before I finally committed to this particular item. I read a few negative reviews but decided to take a chance on this product anyway. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I agree with a lot of the other reviewers who did not like the packaging that it came in, a plastic bag, that once I picked it up and handled it (I was just reading the sticker on it) and the top of it began to rip open. I used a portion of it to make my hair butter and ended up just putting the remainder (still in the bag it came in) in a plastic ziploc baggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s July and almost 100 degrees on some days and when it arrived it was a little warm but that made it easier for me to manipulate it. Although, now that it is room temp, it still isn&#x27;t difficult to use. I just dip my fingers into the bag, place some in the palm of my hand and rub my hands together to apply it to my body, especially on the very dry areas like my feet, elbows and knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s only a slight scent to it, nothing I can really smell, definitely not anything offensive. It&#x27;s about the same color as in the picture, an ivory color, and it mixes very well with the other oils that I used to make my hair butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on a Friday with standard shipping and it arrived the very next Wednesday, very prompt delivery. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and when it is time I will definitely order it again!!!</li>
            <li> It may not look very elegant but this stuff is the real deal for dry skin.  It has to be warmed up in the hands to get it to a point where you can smooth it in easily but I like that - a little extra work out in the morning, haha (just occurred to me that maybe it can be heated slightly in the microwave first, will give it a try tomorrow)!  What I love more is that it is perfectly natural (absolutely no additives, it&#x27;s a totally raw product)and THE best body moisturiser I have ever used and I have wasted a lot of money on many others!  There are no frills to this, it doesn&#x27;t smell good and it doesn&#x27;t look good BUT it lasts forever (doesn&#x27;t go off), a little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t block my pores - not even when I use it on my face, and it is dirt cheap!  This stuff always turns up, in small percentages, in expensive products (eg, L&#x27;Occitane) which tells a story in itself.  NOTHING moisturises like this, and all of the friends I have given this to have said the same and always asked for more.  Highly recommended - I will never waste money on other over priced products which just don&#x27;t do the job for me.</li>
            <li> The item was received in a large unlabeled dirty open plastic bag. Not quite what was expected but it still worked for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> I use this daily.  Wonderful.  In the summer my husband said I smelled like butter because I was baking in the sun while in the car.  I quickly turned on the ac so I would not melt.  My legs and arms looked so smooth and soft in my summer dress. Is it a bad thing to smell like butter?</li>
            <li> This product is the best.Have been using it for just 3days on my skin and face and i have seen tremendous improvement.My skin feels softer and smoother.No more wasting money on expensive skin product that doesnt work.Am sticking to shea butter</li>
            <li> Very good product. The delivery was quick. I was not happy with the packaging of the product as it leaked but its still is good product &amp; I will use them again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my order then I smelled it. It smells awful I tried adding essential oil noe of them worked the smell of this stuff is so overpowering.  I wanted to use to make own hair products but emded up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make sunscreen and wanted a good product b/c of the fact my 3yr old has severe eczema. This paired with red raspberry seed oil works wonders.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. FANTASTIC price (at least when I purchased) and really lovely to use. No particles of dirt/other crap to pick through at all. This is the only Shea butter I&#x27;ll buy from now on! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the Ivory Shea Butter, the price was cheaper then at some of the other sites I visited.</li>
            <li> I received the yellow shea butter instead of what was ordered which was the ivory. Since I needed this to make body butters, I really wanted the ivory colored shea. I called the number listed on the order and spoke with a man who requested that I text him a picture of the yellow shea that I received in error. He immediately apologized and said he would make it right by sending the ivory shea. I appreciated his quick response. However, when the ivory shea was received, it was wrapped securely but had 5 bugs stuck inside. I have never experienced this before and will never order from this company again as the entire 2 lbs had to be trashed! A total waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I got this product expecting it to be good quality since most reviews were good. When I received it &amp; opened up the package it smelled rancid. It is grey in color &amp; I tried to make lotion with it but no amount of essential oils can cover it. It smells old &amp; dirty, musty. I am highly dissatisfied &amp; wish I had never bought it because all I can do now is throw it away. I recommend no one purchase this just in my experience I don&#x27;t want any one else wasting their money.</li>
            <li> absorbs easily. No need for any commercial hand lotion, lasts long throughout hand washes. Hand are soft and smooth even during rough winter temperatures.</li>
            <li> but makes my skin feel soooo nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i stock up on this, but of course can&#x27;t get too much or it&#x27;ll spoil on me</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy and smells like Shea butter.  Absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t too greasy. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> There is no way this stuff is ivory shea butter. It&#x27;s the colour of mud. The smell is indescribable. You&#x27;d be better off burning your money.</li>
            <li> Have separated it into smaller to store in no light, plus cool place.  Have used it on it&#x27;s own, as well as, mixed with other oils for massaging and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer. I use it for all of my family and have done so since my children were babies. No better protectant barrier for new bums. Great on hair, feet, body in general. Use to make body butter adding other ingredients, use to make hair conditioner as well. This is not the best packaging. Not for keeping that is. I prefer resalable containers rather than plastic and tape.</li>
            <li> I have made everything from lip balm to lotions with this product and it has all turned out great!  I will order from again!</li>
            <li> I received the product within 4 days of ordering, which to me is very fair in my opinion. As for the product itself, it came exactly as described and seemed very fresh. The smell is bearable if you dont mind an earthy organic smell, but as others have mentioned can be easily doctored up to smell however you like with fragrance oils. Overall the product is well worth the $12 you will spend if you are looking for a natural approach to beauty care.</li>
            <li> Love Shea butter ... I make a lot of home made lotions and I really like the smell of this one and the color it is truly ivory.</li>
            <li> My sister in law was incredibly excited to open this gift on Christmas Eve. It was exactly what she wanted. It came very securely packaged. The box was actually bigger than it needed to be, but this rode safely on clouds of air to our doorstep.</li>
            <li> I got this much sooner than I thought I would.  The shea butter is just what I wanted.  Very creamy and the large block makes it very easy to cut into usable portions for whatever I need.  Five stars without a doubt.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great I use it to make lotions &amp; butters...it arrived pretty quickly!!!! Good stuff!!! I really have nothing bad to say :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix with coconut oil as a diaper cream.  I&#x27;ve started using it to soften my callouses--great results!  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter and this one is good quality. It blends well with other oils and feels great on my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of natural body and hair products. So when I found this specific shea butter online I was excited to try it out and use it. Most shea butters I&#x27;ve seen on the market have an added oil that makes me break out and gives me red bumps on my skin. So I like to get pure shea butter. I received the package in a timely manner, the packaging was awesome, came packed in plastic, sealed up in another bag for sanitary purposes so that made me happy. Using it was even more awesome! I was very happy with the results of the product.</li>
            <li> Good shea butter, great for dry skin, I make my own lotion with shea butter. They need to replace the packaging that is used because I received my order dripping, which was a loss for me since I do sell the lotion I make. I received it in a plastic bag, and It was summer in Texas, so you can imagine. Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter has a silky smooth creamy texture.  It is the second type I have tried and I prefer this one. It came in a plastic bag.  I used it to make Creamy and Fluffy Shea Butter Creams variations of Naptural85&#x27;s recipes found on YouTube.  My sister&#x27;s hair looks incredible and conditioned and frizz free.  She prefers the Creamy version.  Her hair is 3C.  My hair is combination 4a,4b,4c.  My hair does not respond quite as well to the recipes, but I still love this Shea and also use it to moisturize hands and body.</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter to make some lotion bars and really liked it. The bars came out beautifully and are great for the skin! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Raw unrefined shea butter is wonderful. I rate this product by Halaleveryday a 5 star. The shea butter gives Plenty of moisture, softens the toughest skin,&amp; it also rid some old scars &amp;marks. Look forward to purchasing more. Thanks</li>
            <li> Smells  great feels soft and blends beautifully. Will and have reordered.</li>
            <li> First time ever buying Shea Butter so I have no basis for comparison, but I really like this product.  The block of shea butter came wrapped in a few layers of plastic wrap, and then sealed in a light-proof zip-top bag.  It smells fresh, and a bit like cocoa butter.  I used it in a homemade natural skin cream that I am really enjoying.</li>
            <li> Only used in lotion bars so far, need more recipes!</li>
            <li> very nice not too much fragrance good for my lotions</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade lotion recipe. It shipped quickly and I did not have any of the problems with it being the wrong texture/smell etc as others have said. I keep the unused portion in the fridge until I need it though as shea alone will spoil if left out. I was worried about breaking off what I needed from a block like this (I only need about 8oz for a batch of lotion) but it cut very easily even (if not especially) when cold.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time but was in a plastic bag that was opened (not sure if happened in transit or not). It was a pain to get off the wrapping and I feel like I lost a little because of this. The shea butter itself was good. Smell and texture was as I expected and works well.</li>
            <li> some of the best shea butter I have come to try and use! its really unrefined and pure so you will find some, very few at that, natural debris from the shelling process but that&#x27;s is okay. superb value and I look forward to buying from halal everyday again!</li>
            <li> We got this for a ladies&#x27; retreat at our church.  We made lotion with it, and it was a lot of fun.  I don&#x27;t know if this product lived up to what it&#x27;s supposed to be, but it was a really good deal compared with the other ones I looked at.</li>
            <li> I used this shea butter to make homemade lotion and it worked really well. I appreciate the off-white color. It makes a much more appealing lotion than the yellow shea butters. The packaging is resealable, which is nice, because I didn&#x27;t need to use it all at once. The smell is quite strong. I used essential tea tree oilin the lotion, and even though I used quite a bit, the smell of the shea butter overpowered it.</li>
            <li> Smooth, creamy, no odor. Very firm. Very clean. I will buy this again!!</li>
            <li> after a while, the smell and color changed.</li>
            <li> Worked great for homemade lotion.  Better overall price than other places I&#x27;ve found it.  It came in a resealable package for storage.</li>
            <li> Love it, the texture was nice and smooth my customers love it and I will buy from you again that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Just arrived. WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t stink, great!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> This is some soft and pliable shea butter.  Unrefined, so it has that slightly nutty scent.  If you want it without the scent get the refined.</li>
            <li> Got the product on time and quickly.  Made home made sun block lotion with it and it works great</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my skin. It is a huge amount of Shaa butter, and it did arrive speedily. However, the stuff is slightly smelly and it has rough blobs in it. Not too nice to use, but I would use it for my feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> Started using this in a face cream for moisturizing mixed with some avocado and vitamin E oils - and some essential oils - love it!  Very creamy and rich and it makes the skin so soft!  Also made some body butters with it - totally love it!  I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I use it as moisturizer for my face, hair, and as chap stick. The amount will last me forever! I keep it in the fridge. Gave some away to friends as well! It&#x27;s a bit thick so you want to pat it on rather than rub it in. I use it on my hair when the ends feel dry, it moisturizes without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> got on time. smelled earthy and nutty like shea butter. is the normal consistency of shea butter - firm yet malleable. will buy again</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Shea butter.  It is incredibly soft, melts fast, fast, fast -  in the microwave.  I can see buying this just to melt it and use it on your skin.  It feels rich and the smell is almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> I use this for whipped butter to sell in my store. it is perfect</li>
            <li> This is not the best quality and the packaging is less than stellar.  It is a light grey color not ivory and very hard to the point I had to heat it some to whip it up.  It is also very grainy even after being whipped.  Wrapped in plastic wrap, taped then stuck in a brown resealable bag this is the bottom barrel packaging so other container is needed after opening.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  Was excited to find and couldn&#x27;t wait to get. Shipping and handling was about twice as much as the price of item but it&#x27;ll last awhile.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this to make soaps and other products for her beauty shop and the finished products are amazing.</li>
            <li> Will purchase product again</li>
            <li> Im coming back for my reorder, this product is great and it lasts forever</li>
            <li> melts in your hand, I love and use it as an everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Healing my dry skin to soft skin with in 3 days. Very natural with a light earthy scent. I do like the quick delivery I receive.</li>
            <li> Perfect and got it at a great price...I am  thesoapmaker.net  With that being said, a good product at a good price helps you make more soap and body products!</li>
            <li> I bought this shea butter and it arrived today. I love it, I am happy with the purchase will buy again this is cheaper where I currently buy my shea butter and I will buy more. I love the scent and the feel on my skin. Its the same quality as the the one I currently buy but I get 2x as much from Halaleveryday for the same price. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shea butter to use for bath and body products and so far I am very happy with it. The butter is more grayish than white but that is fine with me as I melt it to use for an array products. The product was shipped in a heavy plastic sealed bag which is great and was delivered to me in timely manner. Very happy with my purchase and I certainly will be ordering this product as well as others from this seller again</li>
            <li> perfect for making my own homade lotion!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff the smell took a day to get used to or mine went bad quick lol but I&#x27;m pretty sure I just got used to it. Its not greasy feeling after I put it on and this is the kind of Shea people take about. With the healing and moisture cuz I&#x27;ve had Shea before and it did nothing for me except make me feel greasy. When buying Shea look for the kind of grade like this one says clearly. I&#x27;ve only had it for a little over a week so we&#x27;ll see how it goes. So far love I&#x27;ll try to keep an updated review</li>
            <li> This is real raw unrefined shea butter. I use it in my shea butter recipe for my 4c hair and it mixes very easy with my mixer. It blends very well with coconut oil, castor oil, essential oils, or what ever your preference is. You can store it in a zip lock bag or plastic container easily. It shipped very fast, the price is reasonable for the amount of shea butter you receive and I will purchase again when I run out for I have had a lot of hair growth/retention these past 4 months (2 inches) and I believe it is due to my shea butter recipe and because I am using this shea butter instead of the yellow.</li>
            <li> This shea  butter is a quality product. I make a lot of lotions and this product works great.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Use this for making soap. Seems like a great product.</li>
            <li> Some of the very best shea butter we have tried! We love the consistency, the price and it was packaged well with quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago and was dissappointed in quality. Didn&#x27;t seem at all like other pure shea butter I have used in past. I used part of it for a batch of body bar mosturizers and had to throw batch out. Lost money. Seller was crazy, too. Called me on phone very angry, yelling because I left low seller review.</li>
            <li> It arrived in two days and appears to be the real deal. I noticed African women have few wrinkles and beautiful skin- hope this is the secret.  And this is non-processed and raw. Just heat a bit in a double boiler  on low heat until it melts and pour into a container.  5 minutes and you have your own, pure face cream.  And it smells very nice.</li>
            <li> Received as expected, however it took longer to be delivered  than I expected.</li>
            <li> I use some of this for cosmetics, but I bought this quantity from this particular supplier because I wanted to cook with it. Some kind people who had purchased it answered my inquiries about the taste and aroma. So nice of them to go to the trouble of melting it and tasting it! Amazon customers rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it so far to fry homemade seitan, just as a test of its qualities. The seitan was delicious. Fresh out of the package, the shea butter has its characteristic smokey/nutty aroma that it quite distinctive and pronounced. But I didn&#x27;t detect taste or smell of shea after the seitan was cooked; I didn&#x27;t really detect much aroma while frying, actually. (I have a powerfully good sense of smell, by the way.) I blind taste-tested it on my boyfriend, who tends to be quite picky about tastes, and he didn&#x27;t know that I hadn&#x27;t fried in anything unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, having passed the taste and smell test (and the didn&#x27;t-make-us-sick test ;) I then used the shea for what I&#x27;d really bought it for: making shortening for biscuits and pie crusts. I mix cocoa butter, sunflower oil, and shea to get the consistency of shortening that I want. So far I have only made biscuits with my shea-infused shortening. The shortening was very easy to work with at room temperature, and the biscuits were AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is about right to use undiluted as shortening, but I was a little too timid to try it that way. I can&#x27;t explain why, other than that it is unfamiliar to me and I didn&#x27;t grow up eating this stuff. However, I do know that Grade A (food grade) shea butter is routinely added to chocolate to increase its creaminess, so I&#x27;m not just making this up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a smaller quantity of this shea butter about a year ago, solely for cosmetic purposes, before I knew it was edible. It has kept well at room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy this product inside and out and highly recommend it to adventurous people. Try it in some very simple fried dish firstto see if you like it. I have not used it for cake frosting yet; I&#x27;m not sure that the shea aroma would be compatible with vanilla buttercream, but it would work with chocolate buttercream.</li>
            <li> I paid for ivory shea butter grade A, but instead got a mass of inert dark brown something that looks like crumpled dirt, and does&#x27;t melt (even after 20 minutes in the double boiler) and doesn&#x27;t mix with any of the other oils and butters I tried to mix it with.&lt;br /&gt;It is a real bummer, because I was so excited, and couldn&#x27;t wait for it to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to return it, but couldn&#x27;t. Total waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going in the garbage, but I am pissed. Please don&#x27;t buy. It certainly isn&#x27;t a moisturizer whatever it is. Buy from a health store insead.</li>
            <li> Great Shea butter. Works well in lotions and lip balms. Goes on smooth and dries fast. Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it in a crock pot with beeswax and coconut oil to make my own body creams and lip balms. Creamy and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I used my raw unrefined shea butter to make whipped shea butter. The texture is great and it was fresh not old.</li>
            <li> This shea butter rocked my world!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used shea before get ready to transform your skin, your beauty routine, your whole self from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;This is a high quality product, i will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter!  Not only is a great quantity for an unbeatable price, it&#x27;s very high quality.  I use it to make my own bath and lotion products, and I use it by itself when my skin is extra dry and chapped.  My husband also uses it on his hands (he is a shipping manager and works outside in the cold) and it&#x27;s done wonders for his dry, cracked hands.  This will always be my go-to seller for shea butter.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this stuff! This is my first time trying shea butter, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. With just one use I saw a change in my red, sore and raw hands. I whipped it up with coconut oil and used the mixture to take off my makeup and wash my face. By morning my face was so soft! Wonderful stuff! I will be using it a lot more!&lt;br /&gt;However, it is all natural, so no fragrances in it. And I read that it has an &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell, well I think it&#x27;s kinda stinky. Yes, earthy, but really just stinky. But it doesn&#x27;t make me stink when I use it. Just don&#x27;t sniff the jar. I plan on looking for some type of essential oil to put in it to make it more appealing.</li>
            <li> it smells really strong If you can get past that though it is amazing and the weight is true!! very glad I bought this and will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Still have some left.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this, and it&#x27;s been very nice both times. Natural clean slightly nutty smell, and very hydrating for my daughters&#x27; skin as well as mine. Also whips into body butter very nicely when mixed with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  2 pounds of Organic shea butter.  No discoloration.</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy love it!</li>
            <li> Great for using in making my homemade soaps and skin lotions and butters.</li>
            <li> I Love this Shea butter.  It goes on smooth and my skin feels so soft.  Will recommend this to anyone looking for good Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shea butter in all of my homemade beauty products lately. So happy to be making the household switch to more natural products, and this is a great base for those lotions, creams and chapsticks.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit strong, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. However, the benefits still far outweigh the smell that I&#x27;m getting used to, so I will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this shea butter.  Only reason I can&#x27;t rate this a 5 is because of the packaging.  It comes packaged in a sealed plastic bag.  This makes it very messy and difficult to get out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I recieved my shea butter. It was double bagged, which was good. However both bags were punctured all the way through to the product. It was as if someone purposely dug a hole in the bags to reach the product. UNSANITARY! I complained to the company and they said they&#x27;d replace it, just to send it back. I buy on line primarily for convenience. If I wanted to go out, find an appropriate sized box, go to the post office to weigh and ship, and pay for postage, then wait for a return product, all for a nine dollar item....I would have just gone to the store and bought shea butter to begin with. This isnt convenient. Its time consuming and annoying. No thanks. Duly noted, Ill pick a more reputable shipper/company next time.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!!!  I&#x27;d been ordering from a company that charged way more than this and I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to live up to my expectations, but it did.  It&#x27;s soft, silky, and it doesn&#x27;t stink like the cheap stuff you can buy locally.  I use it for my skin, my hair, and my nails - I even use it for my kids.  I will be buying this Shea Butter again!!!</li>
            <li> Just as expected. I use it for everything. My dog  was scratching all the time . I purchased some of that hot spot stuff and the scratching continued. After a trip to the vet to make sure there was no underlying health issues, I decided to use the same thing on her skin that I use on mine . I melt it them massage it into her skin which she loves . Her dander is down and the scratching has completely stopped.I used this for my granddaughter, who had a mild case of eczema on her elbows and that is gone also. I have used it for a while now and will continue to use it .</li>
            <li> I have order from this company the twice and have been satisfied each time.  I currently add a variety of oils to the shea butter to mix into a whipped delight.  I think only once I noticed debris (nut shell) but I just easily picked it out and moved on.  It wasn&#x27;t a big deal.  I will continue to purchase shea butter from them since I am satisfied with the quality and love the speedy delivery. I only marked it as a 4 star because of the packaging (2 sealed bags) but I easily just put it in a ziploc bag after opening.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was buying shea butter at my local co-op and it was SOO much more expensive! This is a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice, keep your unused shea butter in the fridge it is possible for shea butter to go rancid.</li>
            <li> Products was as described, shipped quickly, only issue is the packaging, came in 2 plastic type bags in which the shea is somewhat hard to get out the bags, but product was as described, seems to be a good grade of shea butter, good value for the price</li>
            <li> So I have had this product for a number of months now and Im not even a third of the way through it. What I really like about this product is that is is fair trade and soaks into the skin like I soak up a good book. I personally like to mixed my shea butter with peppermint oil. The sea butter by itself has a bit of a waxy smell to it in my opinion but it dissipates quickly after you smooth it into your skin or mix it with other products. I don&#x27;t think I will be needing to buy anymore for at least another year but when I do i will definatley reorder from here!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect and was exactly as described . Made amazing lotion bars with this product. No issues with this and shipping came extreamly quick. Made perefct Xmas gifts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this three stars because they had good customer service. I got the butter, looked the right color, had the right texture but when I opened the plastic I was hit by the most sickening smell of anesthesia masks chemicals. It was so strong that I had an incredible headache for hours after I had put it away. I&#x27;m pretty sure the smell was coming from the plastic but it had seeped all the way through the butter.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. I have tried other Shea Butter Grade A before.  But, this sample from this vendor was different. It was very smooth and not to grainy like others and the consistences was great!! I will buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Yes I purchased this product and it arrive it perfect packaging. It was not hard it was very easy to mix using my mixer and adding oils. It seems to be much more than two pounds as I had to use several plastic containers to preserve the Shea butter. It&#x27;s rich creamy and works very well on my hair and skin I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! I will continue to purchas from this seller.  Thanks it&#x27;s amazing an authentic as I have had fake Shea butter before. BIG DIFFERENCE! :)</li>
            <li> love love my shea butter !! my hair my skin my everything!!!! will be getting more when im done..... you wont b disappointed</li>
            <li> I used my Shea butter mix for my natural hair. It worked great. I mixed with my essential oils for a nice whipped product. I have shared it with many other naturally curly friends. Of course its part of my pruducts I use to layer to seal in moisture its a great addition.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the fact that this shea butter is left raw and unrefined. I immediately transferred mine to glass jars with lids and I make my own skin creme, body butters and hair moisturizer.  I also use it as is.  It arrives wrapped in two plastic bags which is not the best packaging, but once you get past the presentation, I believe you&#x27;re going to love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and my body shows significant signs of improvement and pampering.  My skin is always soft and it has some beautiful glow, especially my hands, legs and feet.  And my hair is 100% softer with a nice sheen and I&#x27;ve seen improved hair growth.  I love this stuff and will keep some on hand.  It lasts a long time because a little goes a long way and with a shelf life of 18-24 months it&#x27;s very cost effective.  However, you need to transfer it to a container with a lid rather than trying to use it from the bag. As for the scent, personally it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I believe It&#x27;s supposed to have that sort of earthy scent because it&#x27;s raw and unrefined. But it&#x27;s an easy enough fix, try adding some fragrant essential oils to it.  I&#x27;ve mixed it with all sorts of essential oils like jojoba, olive, argan, coconut and almond oils (different containers for each oil/shea mixture). You can do alot of experimenting with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all reviews prior to purchasing this product paying particular attention to the negative ones and the only negative I agree with is the packaging.  THE PACKAGING IS AWFUL BUT IMHO ITS SUFFICIENT ENOUGH FOR DELIVERY. Really folks, we&#x27;re not paying for packaging anyway.  We&#x27;re paying for pure product which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got introduced to Shea Butter some years ago.  I love it, and would highly recommend this for people looking for that natural product to soften skin, and for the various other uses it has.  What a wonder!</li>
            <li> Works great in my body scrub I make.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Rhis came in a heavy mailer, sarah wrapped chunk of irory shea straight out of the coyntry of origin.  Excellent in products I have used in.  No problems!</li>
            <li> Slight odor (no biggie) and slight discoloration to product but none of this bothers me at all. Great for my homemade lotions et al.</li>
            <li> OK, I know that I am supposed to blend this with other oils to modify the odor, change the consistency, or be a shea butter connoisseur.  I didn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t.  It has a faint smoky smell to me, that&#x27;s it.  I like it.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter are sooo bad, I am very disappointing. After I melt it, I found a dead insect and the worst thing is that IT HAS MANY MANY SANDS OR MAYBE IT WAS A DUST, I do not know. But I think, that this is unacceptable anyway!!!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, well packaged, and exactly as described. It was clean and in a plastic bag as advertised. For those of you who inexplicably cannot remove a product from a plastic bag, a night in the refrigerator will harden it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to some of the feedback left here, raw shea butter varies considerably in color and odor, from pale ivory to greenish-yellow, and does not mean the product is not &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;. A natural product will have natural variations. Only at McDonald&#x27;s can you expect every fry to look identical every time. ;)</li>
            <li> This was my first encounter with shea butter and it is a very nice product to work with I will defininly order this again as soon as I use up the rest of my first order.This product goes a long way.and can be used to make quite a bit of products.I would definitely recommend this Ivory shea Butter to everyone that would use it..It is definitly A grade a product.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy, and this turned out to be a true Shea butter instead of something similar, with different properties all together. It also works differently on my hair, and the results are noticeably different as well.</li>
            <li> I am so very happy with this product. Extremely high quality, I have used it in several homemade skincare recipes.</li>
            <li> Mix it with some coconut oil and olive oil. Add a few drops of Lavender essential oil and whip it in the mixer for a little while and you have just created an awesome lotion. You can also make your own Styling cream and conditioner with it. It has a nutty earthy smell but its not bad, I actually like it. I just add the lavender oil for relaxation at the end of the day. i apply my &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; as I wind down and get ready for bed. It works every time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a drag to get it from plastic to a jar, but it&#x27;s worth it. Great for skin and leather.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It smelled authentic and there was enough for the price I paid. I will return purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin is flawless and fabulous. I put raw shea butter on every morning, after i brush my teeth. I can even apply make up on top. LOVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this shea butter several times to make my own body butter (I melt it and add essential oils). Absolutely love the texture and it moisturizes well without leaving greasy residue. A few months back I accidentally ordered shea butter from a different seller and I received yellow grainy mush that felt really gross and made me break out. If you&#x27;re not sure what product to choose from, go with this one; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I use the product for skin and hair. This product is great for the skin and hair. It makes the skin and hair soft.</li>
            <li> I honestly could not get over the smell, even mixed with a bit of coconut oil and essential oils, the Shea smell was overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best shea we have received!!! I use it raw for my face or lips. We will also combine it with other oils and whip it for a great body and hair moisturizer. We even combined it with some products for sun screen and it worked like a charm! SHUKRAN to Halaleveryday for this AWESOME product. Truly grade A and will be purchasing from them AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I have used coconut oil on my face for the past few years and have added some shea butter.and the effect is better.  It makes&lt;br /&gt;my skin softer. I&#x27;m trying to make it into an after shower skin lotion but haven&#x27;t succeeded as yet.  Will keep trying as it does work very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually very picky about things that are sent through the mail and that I put on my body. This product definitely met my expectations especially after doing research on my own. Will be back for more after I run out months from now :)</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  Though I didn&#x27;t like that it came in a bag instead of a container, Ivory shea butter is just the same as yellow.  I would say the only difference is that it is nearly scentless while yellow shea butter has a distinct smell. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought I had previously reviewed this product but will happily review it again. Order received in good condition.  I absolutely LOVE this product!  It moisturizes my skin beautifully leaving it dewy soft. It has a very slight odor, my daughter says it smells like crayons..lol...but the odor wears off quickly and can easily be covered with perfume.  The only negative is that since the shea butter is so thick, you really have to rub it between your palms to soften/melt it and of course applying it to your skin does require a bit of rubbing.  It does not seem to work well on wet skin, but seems to work best with freshly towel-dried skin from the shower. I am now hooked on this natural moisturizer, have recommended &amp; given samples to friends &amp; will no longer be using commercialized processed lotions.  I will definetly re-order from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It has the creamy texture that is great for my skin and, a mild scent that is pleasant to my liking.  The feel of the product on my skin leaves it oiled but light so that I am well moisturized. The other uses for me with this product are fantastic also.  I can melt it down and add it to my other natural oils I use on my hair.  I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends that are seeking a natural moisturizer. The price and delivery of the product was great and I will use them again.</li>
            <li> What I was looking for.  Plain white shea butter wrapped in plastic, light odor and mixes well to make a whipped shea skin cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on using this in making my own lotion.  Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t gotten around to it yet.  Will tell you all the results later.  In the meantime I love this seller!  And I love the delicious way this shea butter smells.  Fast ship and good seller!</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t right.  I&#x27;ve been making body care for 13 years and this stuff is weird.  It has a green tint to it and smells terrible - between a play doh and black licorice smell.  Tastes terrible in my lip balm.  Nasty stuff.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to make lotion bars which turned out fantastic. Then discovered that I like using this as is and not even in a lotion bar. Works on my skin better than coconut oil. Keeps my skin smooth and moist esp during winter months. Has replaced jojoba oil as my fav skin oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has an earthy, smoky smell which I don&#x27;t mind -- didn&#x27;t affect the lotion bars&#x27; smell adversely, when I added ess. oils for fragrance. Is a bit grainy if you just grab a gob to rub on your skin. Have to work it into the palm of my hand for a bit before rubbing it on my face. The tiny granules will soften and rub in eventually. Melted and re-hardened, it didn&#x27;t present this issue.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, used for homemade lotion for my kids with eczema  works great especially in the winter. Very healing to the skin and great price!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with anything else. This stuff is awesome. Exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> This was such a bargain!  2 LBS for what most charge for 1Lb or less. Love this product for making homemade Body Butter.</li>
            <li> This is the most luxurious Shea butter I have ever purchased. I will definitely purchase from this source again. Excellent quality</li>
            <li> Yes the packaging is annoying but the product is great. I made a body butter that is wonderful for my skin and hair. I recommend this product for all naturals that don&#x27;t want to pay the high prices for a 16 oz  of Shea Butter at the beauty supply store. The price is good, shipping is fast, and a little goes a long way. I will be ordering more for my family and I.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I don&#x27;t use lotion anymore because this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my Massage practice. I love the quality and price. it comes as a solid brick which you can use as a lotion or heat the Shea butter to make a very moisturizing oil....great to use after body scrub treatments. you will need to have a sealed container to put this in as it comes wrapped in plastic wrap/plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Sadly i cant smell it right now because i have a bad stuffy nose but my mom said that it smells good. I put it on in the late evening and woke up with very soft, supple skin well nourished and moisturized. I have not been able to stop using it on my lips, hair, face, and body. Right now i have some in my hair that i melted with a little bit of some olive oil, I cant wait to see the results!(:</li>
            <li> For some reason I wasn&#x27;t expecting so much! haha, I see a lot of people complaining they got bad batches, I guess I was lucky because mine is creamy, ivory, and smooth. People say the smell is terrible but honestly it&#x27;s not that bad. you could always buy an essential oil like lavender and mix it in if it bothers you that much. I use the Shea butter in my hair and all over my skin. due to quality and speediness of delivery i&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat customer. Only gripe I have is with the packaging, but it till gets 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Easy to work with. Best i&#x27;ve used~!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED...EVER! For one, the package was hard to open and once I opened it, the huge block of shea butter was so hard and breaking it apart was so messy and unnecessary. Second, it left a white residue all over my hands and when I went to rinse it off my hands became slimy. I bought this to use for my hair as a sealant in place of coconut oil, but it&#x27;s so ridiculously hard to use as it is very grainy and by no means SMOOTH in texture! Also, IT SMELLS DISGUSTING! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SMELLING! It doesn&#x27;t even work as a sealant. Even worse I am stuck with this terrible prouct because I, for some absurd reason, cannot return this product...even though I have only had it for 4 days. TERRIBLE PRODUCT DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> Smells good and nice to look at, I look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> Love this seller. I only buy they&#x27;re Shea butter which I use to make my homemade Shea butter mix for my hair and body.</li>
            <li> Best shea butter Ive ever used.</li>
            <li> I use this shea butter as a skin moisturizer and it works pretty good.  It absorbs well and seems leave my skin soft.  Compared to Vaseline, this shea butter works better because it&#x27;s not greasy. It is a light vanilla color that has a mild smell.</li>
            <li> I used to buy my raw shea in 8oz containers for $8, but this price was too good to pass up.  Its just as good as any other high quality raw shea, but at a better price.  It works quite well, absorbs quickly, and has that good old (or bad depending on your opinion) raw shea smell.</li>
            <li> I love the color and consistency of this shea butter, you can really tell its pure and raw. It works beautifully in my soaps, and skin care products. I will definitely use this seller again. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I use it in homemade deodorant, chapstick, dream stick, and lotion bars.  works great!  Shea butter itself doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful, but it is great for the skin and can be tamed (smell wise) with essential oils!</li>
            <li> Looking at other reviews i decide to go ahead and try this product. This was my dirst time using shea butter. I Love this product! It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> My experience with shea butter is that this is my first time trying it. It arrived quickly, well packaged, and has an excellent feel and smell to it. I have used it in a hard lotion bar with other ingredients and it works perfectly for me. Would definitely re-order.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is of the highest quality. Absolutely love it and use it in soap making and body care products. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I made a combo butter with this as part of the mix and it mixed great and I use it for my body &amp; hair</li>
            <li> The product is great. I love the texture. I am likely to order it again and tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter for a number of years and really enjoy its&#x27; benfits for my skin and hair. This was reasonably priced and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and received it in a few days. It was fast and when it arrived, it was wrapped perfectly. It has a soft texture and was pure shea butter. I used some of it on my elbows and it made them really soft! Can&#x27;t wait to continue using it on my skin and in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used yellow shea butter in the past and I found it to be a great moisturizer but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell.  I heard that ivory shea butter did not have such a strong odor.  This raw unrefined grade A shea butter is the Holy Grail.  It has a much milder aroma and it absorbs much better on the skin than the yellow shea butter.  It did come packaged wrapped in plastic but I had no problem transferring it to a container with a tight fitting lid.  I mix mine with jojoba oil, coconut oil, vegetable glycerine, and vit E for use in my hair and on my skin.  Sometime I will mix it with a little argon oil.  I have sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use a lot of lotions and creams but I have no issues with this shea butter.  Even though this is two pounds, I seem to be going through this quickly.  I am happy to know I can always order this and it will be quality shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely stopped using lotions since I purchased this shea butter. You only need a little bit compared to lotion, if you use to much it will make your skin greasy. It quickly melts on your skin from your body temperature, easily allowing you to rub it in. It works much better than all of the lotions I used to buy and the 2 lbs will last forever. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Feels good on your rough hands and face too!!!  You can throw away (or stop buying) lotions with all the stuff you don&#x27;t want in it and use this instead!  That&#x27;s MY plan!</li>
            <li> This butter had a strong smell - not spoiled but not a good smell to me - and had a couple of dark specks in the butter.  Thought that adding essential oils (peppermint) to my whipped body butter made from this shea butter would help cover up the smell - but it did not.  Now not sure if I got a bad batch of body butter or if the smell is normal.  This is the first raw shea butter that I have purchased.  Plan on buying another brand to see if I can get one without a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Great product. I used it raw as a moisturizer and added it in my soaps.</li>
            <li> This original African Shea butter is very creamy, quite smooth, great to use all over the body to improve and prevent dryness, causes immediate hydration to all skin types, economical and an amazing health tool.  Thanks south!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is amazing. It&#x27;s so smooth and not gritty at all. It feels great  on my skin. I love it. Seller has great products.</li>
            <li> This is the all natural raw shea butter from Africa. The only thing that works for my skin. It keeps my skin soft, moist and radiant. I also use it on my 4 year old daughter. Its also good for pimples, dry patches, rashed and cuts. Yes the smell may be different, but this stuff works! The price is very reasonable. I use to buy it at a African shop and they wanted ten dollars for half the quantity. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> shea butter is a wonderful, natural &amp; healthy moisturizing product that I use to make numerous homemade bath &amp; body products with. Buying products, such as this, reduce the number of additional products you need, as mother nature provides you with it all here!</li>
            <li> theres sooo much shea butter!!!! i cant even think of enough things to make with it! it was so awesome finding shea butter at a great price thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Butter!  I&#x27;ve kept it in it&#x27;s original packaging and after a month it&#x27;s still in great shape!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it every day on me and my kids. When I run out I will get more! I did let it air out for about 2 weeks since the smell of shea butter can be strong, but that fixed the problem. I dont want the refined stuff so the smell after airing it out was fine.</li>
            <li> Yes, this comes in a big plastic bag.  But what do you expect from Ghana?  They are doing the best with what they have available.  It&#x27;s not a problem to take the product out and place it in another container.  I keep a small container of it in my bathroom to use on my elbows, heels and hands and just replenish it monthly.  It is an excellent quality product and I would recommend the seller.</li>
            <li> I love the explanation of uses on the lid label and the quality was extremely fresh as well as soft.  I use it as a facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;i apply a small dab on my face daily and my skin has such a glow.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make a cream for my hair and it was exactly what I needed. I still have some leftover for the next batch I need to make.</li>
            <li> This shea butter is heavenly. I ordered it to be sent overseas to me while I was deployed and it came in a huge block that has lasted me over a year! I keep it in a dry, cool place, and it is still fresh and as luscious as ever. Recommend for hair and skin care, definitely makes a difference!</li>
            <li> Completely met my expectations! Shea butter was soft and creamy at room temperature not hard like some I&#x27;ve experienced from other vendors. Great ivory/off white color. Will definitely repurchase from hahaleveryday! best yet!</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and was just as described. I used it in a mixture of castor, jojoba and coconut oil for my natural hair for a two stranded twist. My hair felt completely moisturized the entire time. The mixture is also heaven on the scalp for a steam treatment. I would buy this product again. Yes it does come in a plastic bag but I just placed the remainder in a jar for use later.</li>
            <li> I love this butter. It works wonders on cracked heals and dry skin anywhere. Mix it with some cocoa butter and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged ok</li>
            <li> This seller has great products I am very happy with delivery and what I purchased. I bought this to share with my mom and daughter and found out that I  have enough to give some to my best friend also to try.</li>
            <li> A great find!!  Was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews however my experience was A+.  Very nice product, packaged well and at a great price!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased when I received my package of shea butter. This is authentic shea butter from Ghana, indeed. Ivory in colour, soft and rich. And the price is by far the best I&#x27;ve found on the web unless you are importing from Ghana yourself. I&#x27;ll be buying my shea butter and black soap from this company from now on. Highly recommended. Just make sure you have some ziplock bags or storage containers for your shea butter. It comes double-bagged, but the bags are not resealable.</li>
            <li> Loved it! This is a great product, just what I was looking for...I will be ordering this product again soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using pure shea butter instead of lotions, especially during the cold, harsh winter we&#x27;ve had so far.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason I use the pure shea butter is to reduce ingredients such as parabens and laurel sulfates that could cause Xeno hormones.  I am in menopause and do not need anymore hormones that could confuse my body and put me at risk for activating cancer cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for the price.</li>
            <li> Buy with confidences this product comes well packaged and is the real thing.  I am married to a African and had the chance to compare to some shea butter hand carried from Ghana to us personally.  Wonderful for winter moisturiser.  I usually melt it down in a double boiler or you can put in a pot with water and place the shea butter in a large bowl or glass jar.  Once melted you can infuse your favorite lotion.  I add some coconut oil and olive oil the the mix as well.</li>
            <li> The item is listed as being 2 lbs. of actual shea butter.  The weight of the shea butter I received is 30.8 oz.  I will also post a picture to show what I&#x27;m talking about.  The shea butter &#x27;brick&#x27; was underweight even with the packaging!  I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from this seller before, as well as other items.  I did not own a scale, but I&#x27;m glad that I do now so that  I know I&#x27;ve been ripped off!  I contacted Amazon about this and they gave me a full refund.  I do however hope that they stop selling this product so that they can save some of their customers some inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be surprised when you open this. There is no fancying packaging, it is just a big raw hunk of butter wrapped in plastic wrap. Nothing fancy but it melted great and worked just fine for the body butter I was using it in.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous Shea Butter I ordered, this batch had an &#x27;old oil&#x27; smell to it. It is similar to the smell in the kitchen the morning after cooking french fries.</li>
            <li> Recieved shea butter fast. Product arrived wrapped in Saran wrapped blocks inside a Ziplock paper bag as pictured. The bag was labeled properly with \\&quot;raw, unrefined organic shea\\&quot; eliminating any doubt in my mind of the products quality and purity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I melted it down in warm water and mixed with jojoba oil to form a nice smooth body butter that I am very pleased with. There was no straining required, no mold, no unpleasant odors... Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with purchase and will be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap. I live in Las Vegas, and my family and I have a problem with dry skin. So, I set out to make a moisturizing soap for us that wouldn&#x27;t dry out our skin. Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li> I bought two pounds of this shea butter.  And so far, I&#x27;ve used just a little bit to make body butter.  It stores pretty well.  I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months and it hasn&#x27;t gone bad.  The quality seems great and it works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Hands have never been so soft. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product would definitely recommend anyone to purchase it.  People are complaining about the packaging and I&#x27;m not sure why.  I thought it was fine.  I didn&#x27;t buy it for the packaging I bought it for the product.  I have made homemade lip balms with this and everyone has loved them and have had no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is high quality shea butter. The smell can be a bit over whelming but when combined with fragrant essential oils the smell is just about unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea so my skin is often dry and thin, sometimes painful.  The Shea Butter oes on like silk and I love how it makes my skin feel smooth and healthy without feeling greasy or oily.  It has given me some much needed relief and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good quality Shea Butter but the packaging could be better -  it comes in a rolled up plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> The butter it self is good. I did not like the shells of the nut that is in the butter.  Next time I will buy refined only.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It is very different from most people are used for moisturizer.  It is long lasting and very very moisturizing and i melt a little and use it all over my body, face and the rest.</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter. There is a low odor and when I mix all of the different oils together it makes my hair feel soooo moisturized. This lasted me about 6 months and that is including doing other people&#x27;s hair. Will re-order a larger size soon!</li>
            <li> Love it! I combine some of the products and use them everyday! my skin feels AMAZING!! This is one of the best I have ever purchased and it works great!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t send Ivory as I ordered.  The yellow is fine but I&#x27;ve used that one before. Really wanted to try the Ivory. Arrived right on time. I give it one star only because it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This product did not come in any container and was hard to use as it was so firm. would probably buy another brand.</li>
            <li> This shea butter does come in an ivory color and I found it to be exactly what I was looking for. I used mine in homemade body butter and I love it!</li>
            <li> Product was moldy and mushy.  If I could have given a minus star, I would give it ten.</li>
            <li> As expected lots of good uses. Our family loves, love, loves.</li>
            <li> great stuff - waiting for the rest of my order so I can make lotion - my skin (body) does not like the chemicals in commercial lotions etc. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Love it.  Have used it to make different types of  lotions  and they are very rich and smooth.</li>
            <li> So a lot of people were saying this has a &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell or barely noticeable smell and they are so WRONG! I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this stuff! It is a big block that comes in a bag and it is really hard. I wanted to make my own moisturizer with this so I tried whipping it with my mixer and it did ok but there were still a lot of chunks in it that I had to try picking out. But I also added cocoa butter in with my mix (which smells really good) and vanilla extract and  some other good smelling things and the smell of this still overwhelms everything so I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing his again for that reason.</li>
            <li> This arrived just as described.  It was wrapped in clear plastic wrap, but then put into a sealed bag to help with temp control, I believe.  Foil lined inside and kraft paper outside.  It isn&#x27;t as strong as some of the other brands I have purchased and I can&#x27;t wait to try it!  So far, pleased with the value compared to other sites.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! Came double packaged!! excellent, shipped fast!!</li>
            <li> Great product. This is My 4th purchase from them. Superb quality. I look forward to my 5th.  Will only buy from them...</li>
            <li> excellent product. packaged well and makes a great addition to the lotions i make. Love it</li>
            <li> Great quality shea butter, use it in a shea butter essential oil mixture for my Hair. Great smell and texture, will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great product, wife digs it</li>
            <li> I bought this to start making my own shea butter and it is amazing my skin is so soft and nourished my cuticles look great.  I have made 3 to 4 batches of shea butter as gifts and they absolutely luv it. Will definitely buy more with the dry winters in wyoming this is a definite must.  I rather make my own body butters than buy them with all kinds of other chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> just ok nothing special</li>
            <li> Love all natural unrefined shea butter!  I use it in a coconut/jojoba oil blend for the face...it&#x27;s great.  Also use it in a body butter blend, etc, own hair treatment....so many uses....and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This was the first time buying this.  I recently learned to make my own body butter.  I really like this ivory shea butter, it is easy to work with and very creamy and I just love it.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It was ok, smelled really bad and had a sticky texture, felt really heavy on the skin, never really absorbed, just stayed oily.&lt;br /&gt;the shea butter I use now has a much more mellow smell, very creamy to the touch, soaks in very fast and leaves skin feeling very soft, and the stuff I use now is completely raw, unrefined, unfiltered so that really says something about its quality, and it&#x27;s much cheaper then this shea butter.</li>
            <li> It came on a Ziploc bag, I immediately use it to make a cream for my body. I melt a piece and use with coconut oil and essential oils for a soft cream; you can use it in your face and hair.</li>
            <li> Love the color, and the price is pretty good! Use it in all my home made recipes for scrubs, saves, ect.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the non professional looking packaging but product is good but i  do question quality control due to packaging.</li>
            <li> I was surprised this product was very yellow not ivory at all. I bought this for making soap and I wanted as white as possible to keep my soap white.</li>
            <li> not what I was l ooking for had chunks maybe I should keep to the yellow shea butter it had a better feel smell and ect</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I&#x27;m not disappointed at all. Thank you for a great product. Great price too! Buy some today.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a plastic bag and very clean. It&#x27;s smelly, but doesn&#x27;t smell very bad as some users said. The quality is very good, creamy and soft. I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering Shea Butter from anywhere. I went along with it because it was at the a low price and I wanted to experiment with it. It came in a large bag and looked promising until I opened the bag and got a whiff of what was inside. It smells absolutely disgusting. I know from research that Shea Butter is supposed to have a light nutty smell to it that blends with essential oils well. This was not the case. Even though it smelled awful, I wanted to get used to the texture of the butter and see what I could do as far as altering it. I added it into a pre-made mixture of oatmeal lotion with essential oils and coconut oil that I had made which smelled AMAZING before I added the Shea Butter. After I added the Shea Butter that I ordered from this company, it smelled like something that has been festering in a toilet bowl. Further experimentation proved that the smell didn&#x27;t evaporate off the skin either and if used, you will smell like said fermented toilet bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product as a trial run for experimenting with textures, whipping and adding other things. I will buy Shea Butter again, but I WILL NOT buy from this company again. If you&#x27;re paying for a product to make things from scratch, why would you purchase from someone who doesn&#x27;t make sure their stock isn&#x27;t putrid? Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> So easy to work with.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it with other creams.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Excellent as usual! Off-white, nutty scent, semi-soft and melts into hands and skin easily. Has evened out my complexion, clears dark spots quicker than a fade cream would and keeps skin moisturized. Will continue to buy from this supplier.</li>
            <li> It more then meet my needs. I used it to make bath melts and it works great, would recommend it</li>
            <li> I ordered my shea butter a few weeks ago I was overall was pleased with it. The packing was bad however doesnt really look like 2lbs to me I was expecting a little more. ButI love this stuff I made my own whipped shea butter mix that I use in my hair and on my skin I will difinally be purchasing more in the furture.</li>
            <li> Great product love it!! Have always ordered from halaleveryday. came inn well packaged. goes on well really natural. Came in alot will last me a long time. I mixed it with other oils i purchased from the same seller.will defitnetly buy from here again.</li>
            <li> Smooth creamy n blends well I use it in my hair and on my skin. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ve done without Shea butter all these years. I used to use the yellow Shea but I found out it has dyes in it. Although not chemical dyes I ragged use the purest form n this ivory butter is it. The packaging was flimsy just a vacuum sealed bag but I could careless about that. It&#x27;s a lovely deal for the price and I will continue to purchase from here</li>
            <li> I loveee this, I&#x27;m already seeing great results on my skin, mixed this with my jergen sea butter lotion. I gave my ill sis too I loveee this</li>
            <li> This was shipped quickly and packaged well.  I used it for homemade lotion bars and they turned out great.  It has a nice, natural sort of nutty smell and the texture is really smooth and wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is definitely pure shea butter.  Not like the yellow stuff you find in stores.  And you get  a lot! I gave about a quarter to my sister-in-law and am not even close to finishing my stash.  Very moisturizing for my naturally dry African hair!</li>
            <li> Ok this is the VERY BEST SHEA BUTTER!!!!! Seriously you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I recently purchased a much larger quantity of Shea butter from a different supplier it was around the same price but it was 10lbs. so I figured why not I use a lot of Shea butter anyway. I received it and it wasn&#x27;t the ivory I ordered and it felt very unclean when I applied it to my skin; it felt like I had a film on my skin and everything I came across would stick to me.. I tried to be positive. I then followed instructions and filtered it (I never filtered my Shea butter it  this was a first)it was so much dirt in my Shea butter I wanted to scream and I get it that it comes from a Shea nut tree blah blah blah. My other suppliers&#x27; was very smooth and when applied to my skin it felt so light and clean. So people who love to read reviews like me this in an AWSOME product you will not be disappointed..</li>
            <li> nice organic shea butter. this is now a stapple product.</li>
            <li> The product came well wrapped it is the only product&lt;br /&gt;I have used on my entire body it leaves skin very&lt;br /&gt;soft and  well conditioned. even for those with dry hair&lt;br /&gt;this is the product to try out. great product, fast&lt;br /&gt;shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect as it is, I melted mine down and added coconut oil, vitamin e oil and olive oil and whipped it up to a smooth consistency, glides on the skin beautifully and is by far the best I have come across, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Applying once in the morning after my shower and once in the evening keeps my skin from becoming dry and provides a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> excellent quality... I am storing this in the basement up against a cold concrete wall to keep it solid.</li>
            <li> It was great. I used it along with other oils for a mixture for my hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite Shea butter so far. Very creamy, not crumbly. Melts at very low temp. No visible impurities.</li>
            <li> the product came in a timely manner considering the hoilday. i incorporated the shea butter in my lotion and its great. the shea butter looked just like it did in the picture and will order it again soon</li>
            <li> Received my Shea Butter and I couldn&#x27;t wait to open and try it. Yes, the packaging is a simple plastic bag sealed in another plastic bag but I knew this before purchasing it. What would you expect with such a great deal on the butter? The Shea butter itself is amazing! It melts into the skin perfectly leaving you feeling smooth and silky. It also leaves a nice glow to the skin without being greasy or messy. Overall I am happy with this product and would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This product packaged very well. The nutty smell was not as strong as the yellow shea butter which was a plus with me. It arrived on time.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Nice natural butter..Packaging is great, quality is equally great.Body butter came out just right..Worth price will purchase again..</li>
            <li> I went straight to buying 2lbs thinking that it was good based on previous reviews, but I strongly do not recommend buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this with the intention to make my own whipped shea butter with argan oil. I have made 2 batches so far and noticed severe amounts of black dirt particles and little strands of little frizzy hair filled in all of them (i have long hair). Initially I couldn&#x27;t tell when just looking at it in the packaging, but when it came to actually using it, the unsanitary stuff just kept showing up. It was quite a lot. Very unnerving and unsettling, especially because I&#x27;m going through a bad patch of eczema with very dry skin and was looking for the best natural shea butter and I think the dirt sort of irritated my skin. I know I&#x27;m not allergic to shea butter because i have used other brands with soothing success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not buy just because it&#x27;s relatively cheaper</li>
            <li> The quantity was huge and the appearance good, but I found the product to be very grainy and I had to spend more time rubbing it in to ensure it did not leave white particles on my skin.I found this to be really annoying</li>
            <li> We buy this brand a lot because it&#x27;s a great product and quality. The Shea is pure and can be used easily alone or mixed with essential oils to make a great moisturizer. We use it ttyl make a diaper cream that smooths and prevents diaper rash. It also makes a great eczema cream.</li>
            <li> Love the Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> The ivory shea butter makes my hair feel so good; and it gives it a great texture.  It melts so easily between my fingers, and feels really good on my skin.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I used this for my extra dry skin! Its too cold to take cold showers and my skin typically dries out quickly after a hot shower this glides on easy is thick initially but then after awhile absorbs to leave your skin refreshed and supple. Its perfect as a massage balm!</li>
            <li> It was ok. It looked like gray and yellow chunky idk. Ive bought 100% unrefined shea butter before and it was a large brick as well but all one color and not chunky in consistency. If I had to buy again id go w a better review company.</li>
            <li> I ordered this last summer... and I still have another quarter of what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I use this ish on everything! (I wonder why I still have so much!)&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with other oils and plain lotions just so it&#x27;s easier to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVe LOVE LOve LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter was delivered as promised. I have ordered from this vendor before and the quality of the product has always been on point!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome if you want green slime!  Granted, it was in a delivery truck in the heat all day, so it was completely melted to the consistency of snot- I get that.  From what I have researched about raw unrefined IVORY shea butter, it can vary in color but should be somewhat close to ivory.  This shea butter was GREEN.  Returning it!</li>
