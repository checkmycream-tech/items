            <li>I am beyond happy with the results I&#x27;ve had and would definitely recommend trying this Tea Tree Oil for Acne from Keeva.</li>
            <li>product was provided to me free for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li>they stopped sending people free product for their &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; reviews.  </li>
            <li>It felt nice and cool at first, I could feel it working in a moment or two.</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes my skin feel soft, tingly and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve used this product my skin have gotten so much smoother!!!</li>
            <li>and I was excited to find it in an every day cream.</li>
            <li>skin has already cleared up pretty significantly and it feels better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>I would LOVE to be able to buy this product in a larger size to make it more affordable to use everywhere needed.</li>
            <li>im lucky to be one of the reviewers who got this item for free ....</li>
            <li>Used regularly, Keeva will quickly and safely diminish and eliminate stubborn pimples, persistent zits, unsightly blemishes, and more!</li>
            <li>, was I right!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results that are now apparent.  </li>
            <li>I love the cream it really does help with acne.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>For the reader&#x27;s information,  I paid for this item in full and was not given any samples to inflate ratings.</li>
            <li>I just wish that the packaging had a full list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>and it will make miracles whatever is in this stuff works for sure wow!!!</li>
            <li>and they were nothing like I had ever experienced before and really took a toll on my self esteem and of course made me not want to go anywhere in public.</li>
            <li>Incredible im a male 30 years old had acne</li>
            <li>I had mild blackheads on my nose and they have disappeared.</li>
            <li>This greatly reduces the redness and the swelling went down in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>im sure i will get new one after this....</li>
            <li>This uses tea tree seed extract as opposed to tea tree, so it is gentle, but does not have the strong tea tree smell.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and rubs in easily with no greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>but my face was clear most of the time.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are totally natural and safe as well.  </li>
            <li>u can feel it when u apply in ur face makes me feel fresh....</li>
            <li>Right before &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeva feels cool on application and is more gel-like than lotion to leave your skin, no matter how sensitive, feelings soft and fresh!</li>
            <li>They better have a new batch for sale real soon.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff feels very nice and tingly after you put it on :)  Wished they changed the price earlier now it $10 cheaper then the last few times I bought it</li>
            <li>Every day id wake to new blemishes, and at the end of the day after washing my face, there would be more new ones.</li>
            <li>More importantly my sister is getting married in 2 wks and has suffered from cystic acne for years due to PCOS</li>
            <li>and it gives my face clear and smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just short of magic.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>If you’re suffering from acne, then chances are you aren’t able to moisturize your skin on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This is my first review ever.</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 weeks and the first week worked but</li>
            <li>More importantly I believe this will work vs. The countless products and regimens we have used to clear up this stubborn acne.</li>
            <li>I got this product as I was willing to try anything for my acne problem.  </li>
            <li>The product is  Thanks to its high potency and purity, Keeva provides a unique combination of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li>I love that is all natural because I don&#x27;t feel like I am damaging my face like many other acne treatments</li>
            <li>I used it as more of a spot type treatment on areas where I was having break outs and definitely saw some positive changes in the clearing of my skin.</li>
            <li>Proactive, clean and clear, murad,</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>As a young 20&#x27;s like me specially teenager acne is part of growing up</li>
            <li>I love tea tree oil, just be sure not to use it all over your face for a long period of time or it will dry your skin.</li>
            <li>Growing up, I&#x27;ve been having problems and being bullied for having too much acne on my face.</li>
            <li>So when this started to happen it was really upsetting my kids would say things and ask why my face looked like that</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of the tea tree oil too.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>I am very grateful that I got to try Keeva&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment because it truly helped me with my skin issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten a zit in over a month (unusual for me).  </li>
            <li>Maybe not that fast, but oily skin can be a breeding ground for acne.</li>
            <li>And I really didn&#x27;t want to put all those chemicals to my face.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my son has so much acne on his face.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Real customers do not like paid reviews (I&#x27;m one of them).  </li>
            <li>Previously I only rocked the beard but this product has left my skin so glowing that I am loving the close shave</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I was even blessed enough to get this product on a promotional as long as I gave my honest opinion and it really is something</li>
            <li>I usually get the cyst kind and not one</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and hormonal breakouts pretty frequently, with the cystic acne.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s greasy and full of facial acne.</li>
            <li>I have mild adult acne and tis worked very well especially on my cheeks where it is really noticeable.</li>
            <li>Ive been struggling with my skin for quite awhile and have spent a small fortune in many products that dont work, that wreaked more havoc than help.</li>
            <li>and it highly  recommended to all.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that would replace the high cost of the Proactiv skincare system.  </li>
            <li>With all the 5 star reviews,  I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree oil is truly a very healing and natural substance</li>
            <li>My skin feels protected, soft and much improved in coloration.</li>
            <li>I recently received Keeva&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil, and while the cream was fresh and okay smelling, and housed in a nice jar, I found it a bit unsettling that the verbiage on the packaging was totally butchered.</li>
            <li>which is a normal occurrence when I use Acne Treatment products.</li>
            <li>I would give new users</li>
            <li>thing i noticed is i dont get new acnes after using this product.</li>
            <li>My face is almost completely clear!</li>
            <li>Three days later, two were on the way out and the other two had improved more than I would ever have believed.</li>
            <li>It is better used in small problem areas.</li>
            <li>While these have helped somewhat over the years, no single product has made such a quick and drastic improvement like the Keeva Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fyi if anyone struggles with adult acne: I use Clearzine dietary supplements, I think these are the main reason my skin is clear.</li>
            <li>The cream is very sort and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I also put this on my nose because I have large pores and they seem to be getting smaller!!</li>
            <li>It doesnt clear up.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so clear.</li>
            <li>My face has never been so clear..</li>
            <li>If I could get my son to apply it every night, I know his acne would clear</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and have struggled with Cystic Acne.</li>
            <li>I GAVE SOME TO MY 32 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER</li>
            <li>AND I&#x27;M 60 YEARS OLD....</li>
            <li>Then when I got in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re 33 years old and you need an acne treatment, it&#x27;s embarrassing.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing ive found that really works.</li>
            <li>If i were using it only on my face, it would last considerably longer, making it worth the somewhat pricey cost.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your skin soft and looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been one to gravitate towards natural treatments, but this product has opened my eyes to how beneficial they can be.</li>
            <li>Keeva will permanently be replacing my old acne washes and treatments.</li>
            <li>All I have to say is WOW.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soooo tingly and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled with face acne for years and this is the only product that has given me any real improvement.</li>
            <li>Wow does this stuff tingle n let you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Too old to have zits, but am using it on a skin wart which is gradually disappearing.</li>
            <li>I am 48 and have adult cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 12 year old son whos hormones are out of whack.</li>
            <li>I hope they will have more of this in the next few weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it is worth that much!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had cystic acne since I was in jr high, and now I&#x27;m my twenties, and I finally found a routine that keeps my skin clear without taking antibiotics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally use tea tree oil on my face daily anyways, and then I saw this, and I had to have it.</li>
            <li>I love that the tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t smell really strong because I hate the smell of tea tree normally.</li>
            <li>I had acne all my life and had few scars this has helped my acne tremendously</li>
            <li>The key ingredient, Tea Tree Oil, is known for being a powerful drying agent to help fight blackheads, pimples, and other skin blemishes associated with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within a week of going back to Proactiv,  my skin was clear again.</li>
            <li>a 32 yr old female and struggled with acne all my life!</li>
            <li>The only thing left on my skin is the old blemishes.</li>
            <li>Moisturizers usually leave your skin too oily, full of chemicals, and can cause your next breakout in a nanosecond.</li>

            <li> I am beyond happy with the results I&#x27;ve had and would definitely recommend trying this Tea Tree Oil for Acne from Keeva.</li>
            <li> product was provided to me free for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> they stopped sending people free product for their &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; reviews.  </li>
            <li> It felt nice and cool at first, I could feel it working in a moment or two.</li>

            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used this product my skin have gotten so much smoother!!!</li>

            <li> I would LOVE to be able to buy this product in a larger size to make it more affordable to use everywhere needed.</li>
            <li> im lucky to be one of the reviewers who got this item for free ....</li>
            <li> Used regularly, Keeva will quickly and safely diminish and eliminate stubborn pimples, persistent zits, unsightly blemishes, and more!</li>
            <li> , was I right!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results that are now apparent.  </li>
            <li> I love the cream it really does help with acne.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> For the reader&#x27;s information,  I paid for this item in full and was not given any samples to inflate ratings.</li>
            <li> I just wish that the packaging had a full list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> and it will make miracles whatever is in this stuff works for sure wow!!!</li>
            <li> and they were nothing like I had ever experienced before and really took a toll on my self esteem and of course made me not want to go anywhere in public.</li>
            <li> Incredible im a male 30 years old had acne</li>
            <li> I had mild blackheads on my nose and they have disappeared.</li>
            <li> This greatly reduces the redness and the swelling went down in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> im sure i will get new one after this....</li>
            <li> This uses tea tree seed extract as opposed to tea tree, so it is gentle, but does not have the strong tea tree smell.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and rubs in easily with no greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> but my face was clear most of the time.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are totally natural and safe as well.  </li>
            <li> u can feel it when u apply in ur face makes me feel fresh....</li>
            <li> Right before &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeva feels cool on application and is more gel-like than lotion to leave your skin, no matter how sensitive, feelings soft and fresh!</li>
            <li> They better have a new batch for sale real soon.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff feels very nice and tingly after you put it on :)  Wished they changed the price earlier now it $10 cheaper then the last few times I bought it</li>
            <li> Every day id wake to new blemishes, and at the end of the day after washing my face, there would be more new ones.</li>
            <li> More importantly my sister is getting married in 2 wks and has suffered from cystic acne for years due to PCOS</li>
            <li> and it gives my face clear and smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just short of magic.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> If you’re suffering from acne, then chances are you aren’t able to moisturize your skin on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 weeks and the first week worked but</li>
            <li> More importantly I believe this will work vs. The countless products and regimens we have used to clear up this stubborn acne.</li>
            <li> I got this product as I was willing to try anything for my acne problem.  </li>
            <li> The product is  Thanks to its high potency and purity, Keeva provides a unique combination of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
            <li> I love that is all natural because I don&#x27;t feel like I am damaging my face like many other acne treatments</li>
            <li> I used it as more of a spot type treatment on areas where I was having break outs and definitely saw some positive changes in the clearing of my skin.</li>
            <li> Proactive, clean and clear, murad,</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> As a young 20&#x27;s like me specially teenager acne is part of growing up</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil, just be sure not to use it all over your face for a long period of time or it will dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Growing up, I&#x27;ve been having problems and being bullied for having too much acne on my face.</li>
            <li> So when this started to happen it was really upsetting my kids would say things and ask why my face looked like that</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of the tea tree oil too.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> I am very grateful that I got to try Keeva&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment because it truly helped me with my skin issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten a zit in over a month (unusual for me).  </li>
            <li> Maybe not that fast, but oily skin can be a breeding ground for acne.</li>
            <li> And I really didn&#x27;t want to put all those chemicals to my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my son has so much acne on his face.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Real customers do not like paid reviews (I&#x27;m one of them).  </li>
            <li> Previously I only rocked the beard but this product has left my skin so glowing that I am loving the close shave</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I was even blessed enough to get this product on a promotional as long as I gave my honest opinion and it really is something</li>
            <li> I usually get the cyst kind and not one</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and hormonal breakouts pretty frequently, with the cystic acne.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s greasy and full of facial acne.</li>
            <li> I have mild adult acne and tis worked very well especially on my cheeks where it is really noticeable.</li>
            <li> Ive been struggling with my skin for quite awhile and have spent a small fortune in many products that dont work, that wreaked more havoc than help.</li>
            <li> and it highly  recommended to all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would replace the high cost of the Proactiv skincare system.  </li>
            <li> With all the 5 star reviews,  I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree oil is truly a very healing and natural substance</li>
            <li> My skin feels protected, soft and much improved in coloration.</li>
            <li> I recently received Keeva&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil, and while the cream was fresh and okay smelling, and housed in a nice jar, I found it a bit unsettling that the verbiage on the packaging was totally butchered.</li>
            <li> which is a normal occurrence when I use Acne Treatment products.</li>
            <li> I would give new users</li>
            <li> thing i noticed is i dont get new acnes after using this product.</li>
            <li> My face is almost completely clear!</li>
            <li> Three days later, two were on the way out and the other two had improved more than I would ever have believed.</li>
            <li> It is better used in small problem areas.</li>
            <li> While these have helped somewhat over the years, no single product has made such a quick and drastic improvement like the Keeva Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fyi if anyone struggles with adult acne: I use Clearzine dietary supplements, I think these are the main reason my skin is clear.</li>
            <li> The cream is very sort and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I also put this on my nose because I have large pores and they seem to be getting smaller!!</li>
            <li> It doesnt clear up.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so clear.</li>
            <li> My face has never been so clear..</li>
            <li> If I could get my son to apply it every night, I know his acne would clear</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have struggled with Cystic Acne.</li>
            <li> I GAVE SOME TO MY 32 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER</li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;M 60 YEARS OLD....</li>
            <li> Then when I got in my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re 33 years old and you need an acne treatment, it&#x27;s embarrassing.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing ive found that really works.</li>
            <li> If i were using it only on my face, it would last considerably longer, making it worth the somewhat pricey cost.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your skin soft and looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been one to gravitate towards natural treatments, but this product has opened my eyes to how beneficial they can be.</li>
            <li> Keeva will permanently be replacing my old acne washes and treatments.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is WOW.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soooo tingly and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with face acne for years and this is the only product that has given me any real improvement.</li>
            <li> Wow does this stuff tingle n let you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Too old to have zits, but am using it on a skin wart which is gradually disappearing.</li>
            <li> I am 48 and have adult cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 12 year old son whos hormones are out of whack.</li>
            <li> I hope they will have more of this in the next few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is worth that much!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had cystic acne since I was in jr high, and now I&#x27;m my twenties, and I finally found a routine that keeps my skin clear without taking antibiotics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use tea tree oil on my face daily anyways, and then I saw this, and I had to have it.</li>
            <li> I love that the tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t smell really strong because I hate the smell of tea tree normally.</li>
            <li> I had acne all my life and had few scars this has helped my acne tremendously</li>
            <li> The key ingredient, Tea Tree Oil, is known for being a powerful drying agent to help fight blackheads, pimples, and other skin blemishes associated with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a week of going back to Proactiv,  my skin was clear again.</li>
            <li> a 32 yr old female and struggled with acne all my life!</li>
            <li> The only thing left on my skin is the old blemishes.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers usually leave your skin too oily, full of chemicals, and can cause your next breakout in a nanosecond.</li>
            <li> These disinfecting and soothing properties, unlike other acne treatments, will not strip the skin of its natural oils and cause further damage.</li>
            <li> Now my face is almost completely clear, any blemish i do get is smaller, less red, and heals within hours.</li>
            <li> Keeva doesnt irritate or dry my skin, and though i was worried about a cream, it is actually regulating my oily skin.</li>
            <li> HER ACNE IS ALREADY STARTING TO DRY UP.  </li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY FACE TIGHT AND FEEL YOUNG.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend anyone who has trouble with acne to give this product a try!</li>
            <li> I apply the cream after washing my face and I love the cold and tingling sensation on my face.</li>
            <li> I have minor acne and it seems to be clearing up.</li>
            <li> The scars are still there but there are no more new ones.</li>
            <li> I will say, in the time I&#x27;ve been using it, I have seen a little bit of lessening of acne bumps, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Traditional acne moisturizers prevent dry skin, but leave you flaky after extended use.</li>
            <li> and she has a combination of dry and eczema also on her face and body.</li>
            <li> After couple of days using it, I noticed my pimples subsiding without my face getting dry.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the breakout I did have significantly went down in size and the redness was decreased after applying this treatment only a few days.</li>
            <li> Instead of getting better I broke out really badly.</li>
            <li> The only complaint i have is that you dont get enough!</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed..lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> That’s not for me, and I know that’s not really for anyone.</li>
            <li> At first my face got little worse</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was an oversight, but it really kills the mood of the product, at least for me</li>
            <li> I use their other hair products.</li>
            <li> After few days of applying, my acne became and dry and started healing and disappearing.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that they would leave little pink scars afterwards once they went away</li>
            <li> The only negative I would give this product is, theres</li>
            <li> Helps fight acne and keep redness down.</li>
            <li> I have plenty of other acne treatments and none of them even compare to Keeva!</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours, all four pimples were dramatically less inflamed - the redness had all but gone and my skin had healed some that had previously been rough and raw.</li>
            <li> This product has already worked wonders for me in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with acne for at least ten years.</li>
            <li> It even got rid of my black heads.</li>
            <li> The container will go for at least a few weeks of heavy use, or over a month of moderate.</li>
            <li> The cream has a little scent, but it is not very strong.  </li>
            <li> I had the normal teenage acne growing up nothing really bad.</li>

            <li> The scars have reduces but not significantly.</li>
            <li> Having acne doesn’t mean that you don’t have dry skin, so why suffer with the flake for fear of another breakout?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can use it everyday with no drying effects.</li>

            <li> This product is wonderful! I am 30 years old and have struggled with Cystic Acne. If you are a severe sufferer of Cystic Acne I would strongly recommend additional treatments, but this cream is really wonderful for oily acne prone skin.I am taking an Herbal supplement and using this cream during the day. Its light and has a wonderful tingly sensation when you put it on. Tea Tree oil is truly a very healing and natural substance and I was excited to find it in an every day cream. My skin feels protected, soft and much improved in coloration. I can use it everyday with no drying effects. Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only advice I would give new users is to close your eyes for a while after putting it on (maybe have a mini mediation time) so it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes, but that only lasts about 2 minutes. We could all use 2 minutes of meditation a day anyway!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so lucky that I was able to buy this product before it became unavailable! Growing up, I&#x27;ve been having problems and being bullied for having too much acne on my face. I tried every ointment and cream out there but nothing gave me the result I got with this Keeva. After few days of applying, my acne became and dry and started healing and disappearing. Now i&#x27;m confident with how I look. I hope they will have more of this in the next few weeks so I can get some for my friends and families.</li>
            <li> LOVE! LOVE! LOVE1 THIS PRODUCT!!!  I WILL ALWAYS USE IT!  I GAVE SOME TO MY 32 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES IT ALSO....PLEASE NEVER BE OUT OF IT...IT MAKES MY FACE TIGHT AND FEEL YOUNG.  I USE WITH RETINA....IT TOOK ALL MY WRINKLES AWAY AND I&#x27;M 60 YEARS OLD....LOL  GREAT SELLER....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this stuff actually works ! I&#x27;m 27 yrs old and this past year I started getting these painful red bumps on my face. I&#x27;d only get one or two sometimes three of them and they were nothing like I had ever experienced before and really took a toll on my self esteem and of course made me not want to go anywhere in public. Which was impossible b/c I&#x27;m a mom of 3 and I had to take them to school and run errands etc. So these weird bumps didn&#x27;t pop and if I tried to pop them they would get inflamed and become way worse and even scab over . Not to mention that they would leave little pink scars afterwards once they went away which was something I also never dealt with before from acne. I had the normal teenage acne growing up nothing really bad. Then when I got in my early 20&#x27;s I had occasional breakouts but my face was clear most of the time. So when this started to happen it was really upsetting my kids would say things and ask why my face looked like that and my husband was nice about it , but I know he noticed it too. I had to do something so I started researching and found that tea tree oil is like magic for getting rid of acne issues . This stuff is the only thing that got rid of my problem and it&#x27;s helping fade and get rid of the scars too. I recommend Keeva tea tree oil acne treatment to anyone who is having problems with acne or scars . This is truly like magic acne killer in a bottle !! It saved my face and myself esteem !!</li>
            <li> This product has already worked wonders for me in less than a week. My skin looks great while I&#x27;m clean shaven for seemingly the first time in months! Previously I only rocked the beard but this product has left my skin so glowing that I am loving the close shave look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has already cleared up pretty significantly and it feels better than it ever has. The product instantly leaves a cooling sensation that provides an instant moisturizing/cooling sensation. Great product, will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Incredible im a male 30 years old had acne I had acne all my life and had few scars this has helped my acne tremendously it also fades the scars and helps maintain my face just once a day i use it after i shower at night its really amazing my acne is just about gone give it 1 week and it will make miracles whatever is in this stuff works for sure wow!!! buy it!!!give it one try its all it took for me!</li>
            <li> I received This to review. I love the cream it really does help with acne.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff feels very nice and tingly after you put it on :)  Wished they changed the price earlier now it $10 cheaper then the last few times I bought it</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re 33 years old and you need an acne treatment, it&#x27;s embarrassing. Tea tree oil is good for so many things, I thought a tea tree oil acne treatment had to be better than the stuff my teenager uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, was I right! After washing my face in the shower, I applied just a little but and rubbed it in all over my face. It felt nice and cool at first, I could feel it working in a moment or two. The tingle was noticeable, but not overpowering, but I would definitely remind you to stay away from your eyes. The tea tree oil in the cream was effective, but it didn&#x27;t have that overpowering scent a lot of tea tree oil treatments and products do. It smelled nice. My face looked fresher and more even. My son asked if he could try some. I said sure. When you can buy your own. This one is all mine. He can stick to his blue tub and cleaning pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY FAIR, HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN. I HAVE IN NO WAY BEEN COMPENSATED BY THE MANUFACTURER, DISTRIBUTOR OR ANY URGE ENTITY ASIDE FROM SAID DISCOUNT*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a few weeks now and am very happy with the results. I have minor acne and it seems to be clearing up. I had mild blackheads on my nose and they have disappeared. My pores appear smaller too. I really like the smell of the tea tree oil too. It goes on nice and smooth leaving my skin nice and smooth as well with no irritation.</li>
            <li> This a good product , I try this and it gives my face clear and smooth, It removes my dark spots, and it is perfect to make my face amazing. I like it so much, I can tell this is a good and excellent product gives me a good best result to my face, the darker spots in my face is easily removes and i felt my skin very smooth.Why I buy this product for my face problem and this is it I got the solution that makes me happy and satisfied. The product is  Thanks to its high potency and purity, Keeva provides a unique combination of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. These disinfecting and soothing properties, unlike other acne treatments, will not strip the skin of its natural oils and cause further damage. Used regularly, Keeva will quickly and safely diminish and eliminate stubborn pimples, persistent zits, unsightly blemishes, and more! Mostly i used this product everyday, and it gives me best result. I got this product with a good price discount for product reviews unbiased and honest that i can tell is true. the product is perfect for my problem. and it highly  recommended to all.</li>
            <li> I recently received Keeva&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil, and while the cream was fresh and okay smelling, and housed in a nice jar, I found it a bit unsettling that the verbiage on the packaging was totally butchered. Not sure if this was an oversight, but it really kills the mood of the product, at least for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting a cream that smelled like tea tree oil, which I love, but I couldn&#x27;t detect the fragrance at all. I got this product to use on my cyclical cystic acne, which I get on my chin. I will say, in the time I&#x27;ve been using it, I have seen a little bit of lessening of acne bumps, but nothing major. I will continue to use this, and see if it makes a big difference say after 2 months or so.</li>
            <li> I normally use tea tree oil on my face daily anyways, and then I saw this, and I had to have it. It makes my face feel so great! The smell is wonderful and leaves my face feeling smooth. I have not had any break outs and no oily feeling after I use this.</li>
            <li> This product is a must if you have acne. It feels so tingly and clean when I put it on! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had cystic acne since I was in jr high, and now I&#x27;m my twenties, and I finally found a routine that keeps my skin clear without taking antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fyi if anyone struggles with adult acne: I use Clearzine dietary supplements, I think these are the main reason my skin is clear. I also use Clearogen foaming and this keeva tea tree oil cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this Keeva stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This Stuff Works! I had four stubborn, inflamed, painful pimples that would not clear up; I have used expensive and prescription creams, etc., for a long time, but acne is persistent. Adding this tea tree cream has made all the difference. Within 24 hours, all four pimples were dramatically less inflamed - the redness had all but gone and my skin had healed some that had previously been rough and raw. Three days later, two were on the way out and the other two had improved more than I would ever have believed. I swear by this now. It&#x27;s pricey but nothing compared to what I&#x27;ve lost to acne in self confidence. Try it. It&#x27;s just short of magic. I am so glad I found this!!</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to tell all of you how frustrating it is to have periodic breakouts due to hormonal changes. This Acne Treatment has been a godsend because it works on my breakouts without drying my skin out - which is a normal occurrence when I use Acne Treatment products. I have also started getting cystic acne on my back - one or two when I&#x27;m on my monthly period. It&#x27;s so annoying, painful and disgusting! I am very grateful that I got to try Keeva&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment because it truly helped me with my skin issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Ive been struggling with my skin for quite awhile and have spent a small fortune in many products that dont work, that wreaked more havoc than help. I stumbled onto keeva on amazon and decided to give it a try. It is the only thing ive found that really works. Ive never written a review for anything, but if this helps even one person, im glad. Im 36 and it is so humiliating to have my skin. It doesnt break out, it is in a constant stage of outbreak. It doesnt clear up. Every day id wake to new blemishes, and at the end of the day after washing my face, there would be more new ones. Every day. Until now. Now my face is almost completely clear, any blemish i do get is smaller, less red, and heals within hours. Keeva doesnt irritate or dry my skin, and though i was worried about a cream, it is actually regulating my oily skin. The only complaint i have is that you dont get enough! If i were using it only on my face, it would last considerably longer, making it worth the somewhat pricey cost. But i suffer from acne on my back, shoulders, arms etc. I would LOVE to be able to buy this product in a larger size to make it more affordable to use everywhere needed.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I haven&#x27;t gotten a zit in over a month (unusual for me).  I usually get the cyst kind and not one did I get while using this.  I used it in the morning after I shower and evening.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few acne treatments in my life. There is always another one claiming to be the best, but of those creams, this really is the best I have ever used. The ingredient list is short. The cream is very sort and does not dry out my skin. Tea tree oil is fantastic for acne and is much better for you than synthetic treatments. The cream has a very light smell, nothing that would bother you at all. The container will go for at least a few weeks of heavy use, or over a month of moderate. Simple to use after a shower and it leaves your skin soft and looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND IN NO WAY INFLUENCED</li>
            <li> This seems to work nicely as a spot treatment to heal blemishes. I love tea tree oil, just be sure not to use it all over your face for a long period of time or it will dry your skin. It is better used in small problem areas.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with acne for at least ten years. I have been to countless dermatologist appointments and have been prescribed a number of different medications to control my acne. While these have helped somewhat over the years, no single product has made such a quick and drastic improvement like the Keeva Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment. I have never been one to gravitate towards natural treatments, but this product has opened my eyes to how beneficial they can be. Keeva will permanently be replacing my old acne washes and treatments. I would highly recommend anyone who has trouble with acne to give this product a try!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 3 weeks and I have seen such improvement on my skin. I have oily skin and hormonal breakouts pretty frequently, with the cystic acne. Since I&#x27;ve used this product my skin have gotten so much smoother!!! It even got rid of my black heads. The only thing left on my skin is the old blemishes. I love the clean feel after putting it on too. It&#x27;s nice and tingly and smells great! The only negative I would give this product is, theres so little that comes in the jar!!!!</li>
            <li> Well my face has been doing this really crazy thing where it breaks out at really random times, very frustrating. So when I was offered this Tea Tree Oil for Acne from Keeva for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion and thoughts about it, so I ordered it because something needs to help. Well, it arrived and I of course had a couple zits on my face. I put this on the spots and by the next day they were gone. I am beyond happy with the results I&#x27;ve had and would definitely recommend trying this Tea Tree Oil for Acne from Keeva.</li>
            <li> If you’re suffering from acne, then chances are you aren’t able to moisturize your skin on a regular basis. Moisturizers usually leave your skin too oily, full of chemicals, and can cause your next breakout in a nanosecond. Maybe not that fast, but oily skin can be a breeding ground for acne. Having acne doesn’t mean that you don’t have dry skin, so why suffer with the flake for fear of another breakout?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traditional acne moisturizers prevent dry skin, but leave you flaky after extended use. That’s not for me, and I know that’s not really for anyone. With Keeva Tea Tree Oil for Acne, you can apply the cream to hydrate your skin and fight acne without all those chemicals drying out your face. It’s an all-natural ingredient moisturizer that’s safe for any skin type. The key ingredient, Tea Tree Oil, is known for being a powerful drying agent to help fight blackheads, pimples, and other skin blemishes associated with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeva feels cool on application and is more gel-like than lotion to leave your skin, no matter how sensitive, feelings soft and fresh! Treat your acne with an all-natural moisturizer that doesn’t cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I received Keeva Tea Tree Oil for Acne to review (for free) and love it. I have mild adult acne and tis worked very well especially on my cheeks where it is really noticeable. Tea Tree oil is a wonderful thing for antibacterial and cleansing effects but this also moisturizes which is wonderful because a lot of acne treatments dry skin out.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  They better have a new batch for sale real soon.  This is hands down the best Acne cream I have ever used.  It actually delivers what it promises.  I am upset that they are out of stock (Amazon, don&#x27;t let it happen again)..  All I have to say is WOW.</li>
            <li> It feels and smells so incredible.  Leaves my skin soooo tingly and soft.  I love this product. I used it in the night and in the morning my skin looked amazing.  After only one use! I&#x27;m sold.  The ingredients are totally natural and safe as well.  Basically its awesome.  I was even blessed enough to get this product on a promotional as long as I gave my honest opinion and it really is something</li>
            <li> This product feels great on and has a very pleasant smell. I used it as more of a spot type treatment on areas where I was having break outs and definitely saw some positive changes in the clearing of my skin. The labeling on this is vague though, and that does give me pause. There were some grammatical errors in the directions, which does make you feel as if you have to question the product. This uses tea tree seed extract as opposed to tea tree, so it is gentle, but does not have the strong tea tree smell. I would love to see better labeling on both the box and the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me free for evaluation and review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  I GOT THIS FOR MY FRIEND&#x27;S DAUGHTER WHO SUFFERS WITH ACNE.  SHE HAS USED IT TWICE, AND THE RESULTS WERE AMAZING!!  HER ACNE IS ALREADY STARTING TO DRY UP.  THIS IS AFTER JUST 2 USES!!</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever. I am 27 and my skin got very bad about 4 years ago. I tried everything, changed my diet, I tried acne pills, different acne washing treatments and only thing that helped me was PROACTIVE. And I really didn&#x27;t want to put all those chemicals to my face. And I found KEEVA, it is amazing. At first my face got little worse but now I have been using it more than a week and I am amazed. There were so many whiteheads all over my face. My face looked like a moon. And my face is clearing up. I am just so so so happy. I am using it every morning and every evening before going to bed. Buy this product ,it is amazing! I wasted so much money before, I wish I would bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! When I found it I was a little skeptical but thought I would try it. It works great! I have struggled with face acne for years and this is the only product that has given me any real improvement. My face is almost completely clear! I would recommend you at least try this product if you have trouble with acne.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so clean and soft. Helps fight acne and keep redness down.</li>
            <li> I have heard of tea tree oil for acne before but never tried it. I decided to give it a go. Right before &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; is the worst on my chin. I usually get those deep cystic acne spots at least one or two. I started dabbing some of this on a couple times a day and the acne spots diminishes. I also put this on my nose because I have large pores and they seem to be getting smaller!! Tea tree oil for acne is something everyone should know.</li>
            <li> works better than proactiv</li>
            <li> Keeva is hands down the BEST acne treatment I have ever tried. I have plenty of other acne treatments and none of them even compare to Keeva! It leaves your face feeling as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom and it even smells awesome. I love that is all natural because I don&#x27;t feel like I am damaging my face like many other acne treatments have made me feel. Bottom line, if you have acne you NEED to try Keeva.</li>
            <li> Instead of getting better I broke out really badly. I used it for 2 weeks and the first week worked but not the second one, now I look like a monster. I would not recommend this acne cream</li>
            <li> Wow the best purchase ever really work, perfect !! Love it</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it after oil cleansing my face. It smells good and makes my skin feel soft, tingly and refreshed. Making the switch to using natural products for my skin care routine was the best decision. My skin has never been so clear.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Im a 32 yr old female and struggled with acne all my life! Ive tried everything! Proactive, clean and clear, murad, im mean everything! And nothing seemed to work! If anything it made it worse! Its only been a week and u can see drastic changes! Ive never wrote a review before and have been shopping on amazon for 6 years! I just had to! Ive never been so happy about a product and have pics to prove! Doesnt hurt trying!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this product, I will like my sister to try this product out and myself.  More importantly my sister is getting married in 2 wks and has suffered from cystic acne for years due to PCOS and she has a combination of dry and eczema also on her face and body. Then I just have scars from my cystic acne and look forward to the both of us using this product.  More importantly I believe this will work vs. The countless products and regimens we have used to clear up this stubborn acne. So let the healing begin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my son has so much acne on his face. After putting the cream on his acne spots, his face is softer and clearer. I recommend this product if you are having problems with acne blemishes. Keeva Tea Tree Oil Acne Treatment is a great alternative to the products on the market that have chemicals in them. You will see a difference in your looks.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would replace the high cost of the Proactiv skincare system.  With all the 5 star reviews,  I had high hopes. This cream felt great going on (it tingled and made my skin feel energized), and the smell was wonderful.  However,  within three weeks of using this product,  my chin started consistently breaking out in cystic pimples that were extremely painful.  Within a week of going back to Proactiv,  my skin was clear again. What a shame it didn&#x27;t work for me. For the reader&#x27;s information,  I paid for this item in full and was not given any samples to inflate ratings.</li>
            <li> Wow does this stuff tingle n let you know it&#x27;s working. Smells wonderful. I noticed that the breakout I did have significantly went down in size and the redness was decreased after applying this treatment only a few days. Works great. Glad to find something that works in reducing the dreaded pimples. Received this product for review and happy for it.</li>
            <li> The product meets its expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing i noticed is i dont get new acnes after using this product. Even harmonal acnes dont appear. The scars have reduces but not significantly.I will buy this product again</li>
            <li> I really love this acne cream. I have the deep acne that tends to be hormonal. It is really red and swollen. This greatly reduces the redness and the swelling went down in a couple of days. I was very happy with how quickly it works. I love that the tea tree oil doesn&#x27;t smell really strong because I hate the smell of tea tree normally. I love the tingly feeling on my face, you can feel it working. I just wish that the packaging had a full list of ingredients. I don&#x27;t like that it says etc in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift to my aunt who in her 40&#x27;s still have acne. On day 3, her acne started clearing up. The scars are still there but there are no more new ones.</li>
            <li> As a young 20&#x27;s like me specially teenager acne is part of growing up but there is a way to avoid it and make me more comfortable and make me feel beautiful this cream is very effective.... u can feel it when u apply in ur face makes me feel fresh....im lucky to be one of the reviewers who got this item for free .... im sure i will get new one after this....</li>
            <li> Too old to have zits, but am using it on a skin wart which is gradually disappearing. Ask me in another month. I am 85.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RGC</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I got this product as I was willing to try anything for my acne problem.  I apply the cream after washing my face and I love the cold and tingling sensation on my face. After couple of days using it, I noticed my pimples subsiding without my face getting dry.  I believe this product works!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results that are now apparent.  Only a small amount is needed..lasts a long time. you need to apply as soon as zit forms. it clears up within a few days, and no scars. I use their other hair products. Good service</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!! I am 48 and have adult cystic acne. My face has never been so clear.. I still break out but my skin has improved by 80%</li>
            <li> This cream is the best acne treatment I have ever used !!!!!!!!!!!!  Now Amazon says they do not know IF they will have it in stock again !!!!!!! I could just scream, in fact I did.  Why Why Why ???</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 12 year old son whos hormones are out of whack. He&#x27;s greasy and full of facial acne. He&#x27;s not good at washing his face in the AM/PM which has made the problem worse.  I decided to try this after reading some reviews. It has worked wonders for my son and he has NOT applied it as often as I had wanted. However, I&#x27;m still seeing great results. I paid $19 for it in Amazon and that was a fair price. The price has increased a lot.  I&#x27;m not sure it is worth that much!  It is a very small jar.  The cream has a little scent, but it is not very strong.  It is very lightweight and rubs in easily with no greasy feeling.  It has a cooling affect on the skin.  Pictures are prior to treatment and after about a week of using the lotion.  ***Unlike many others on here, I did not receive my product free.  I was a paying customer.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/1/2016&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased my second jar of this for my son.  We stopped using it after our jar ran out and his acne is back.  After just one night I could see a difference.  I am pleased with the product.  If I could get my son to apply it every night, I know his acne would clear up.&lt;br /&gt;We did try the Keeva serum when this was unavailable but it did not work for us.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know anything about this company, but I think they would have more people trying this of they stopped sending people free product for their &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; reviews.  Real customers do not like paid reviews (I&#x27;m one of them).  If your product is good, you don&#x27;t need them!!  And in my opinion, this product works.</li>
