            <li>I love the smell - its a captivating scent that is very sexy....</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into the deep musky smell that would be the best reason to buy this scent.</li>
            <li>As much as I love perfumes, my budget is more for the body mists and knock offs.  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite island fragrance from Michael Kors called &amp;#34;Bermuda&amp;#34; was discontinued, so I tried this instead.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume and was so glad to find it after being discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>I have had this product and used it 3 times, so I am very familiar with the scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the light, tropical scent.  </li>
            <li>Just does not have the exotic and original fragrance as the &amp;#34;Bermuda&amp;#34; fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wish it were available in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>and I was excited to find this on sale.</li>
            <li>I smelled it briefly, and immediately loved it.  </li>
            <li>It has a great light citrusy scent for only a very brief time (3 minutes?).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very summery and light.</li>
            <li>The Fun.  </li>
            <li>This \\&quot;de parfum spray\\&quot; captures a memory that lends me a wicked smile to my demeanor.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>More like dry leaves in winter.</li>
            <li>The scent of lime and light pepper brings me back to my time FL - working on Palm Beach and partying in West Palm.  </li>
            <li>but since this item is discontinued in stores I didn&#x27;t have much of a choice.  </li>
            <li>It starts out with a promising citrus top notes, the middle notes are supposed to be jasmine, pink pepper and rum...</li>
            <li>After an hour or so, the scent had completely changed.  </li>
            <li>Surprised my wife with this before our vacation.</li>
            <li>When the top notes dissipate in a few minutes, what remains is the opposite of a \\&quot;summer\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
            <li>I like the lime/pepper scent as it changes melody during the day - vibrant and sharp at first mellowing to a soft citrus/pepper blend.</li>
            <li>The citrus and jasmine were gone, and all I could smell was the scent of freshly ground black pepper.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and still had the original scent (did not appear old or stale.)</li>
            <li>You can wear it day or night and it smells the same, if you like LOUD and overbearing perfume</li>
            <li>this is not the one for you because this is low key and soft.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed because I loved it at first!  </li>

            <li> I purchased Palm Beach by Michael Kor just this week and I love it, it is very sexy and feminine. You can wear it day or night and it smells the same, if you like LOUD and overbearing perfume this is not the one for you because this is low key and soft.</li>
            <li> This smells SO good, reminds me of being on the beach.  It is perfect!  I do not agree with the negative reviews.  I think it is perfect!!!</li>
            <li> It starts out with a promising citrus top notes, the middle notes are supposed to be jasmine, pink pepper and rum...none of this happens.  The base notes are supposed to be vanilla and black tea but there is no vanilla and what is supposed to be black tea is merely a rather bitter fragrance. That&#x27;s why I say it is unbalanced. When the top notes dissipate in a few minutes, what remains is the opposite of a \\&quot;summer\\&quot; fragrance. More like dry leaves in winter.</li>
            <li> This scent is deceptive. It has a great light citrusy scent for only a very brief time (3 minutes?). Under that scent is a deep musky vanilla type smell that lasts forever. If you&#x27;re into the deep musky smell that would be the best reason to buy this scent. If you&#x27;re into crisp, light citrusy scents (like I am), you will be disappointed. I think it also gave me headaches both times I sucked it up and wore it.</li>
            <li> I recently received a magazine that had a sample insert of this fragrance.  I smelled it briefly, and immediately loved it.  The hints of citrus and jasmine were delightful, and I thought I had found a new favorite!  A week or so later, I went to a beauty store and tried the tester.  I sprayed some on my wrist and decided to see how it wore the rest of the day.  After an hour or so, the scent had completely changed.  The citrus and jasmine were gone, and all I could smell was the scent of freshly ground black pepper.  My boyfriend said he thought it smelled the same way.  I was very disappointed because I loved it at first!  I will NOT be purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I was hooked when ISLAND PALM BEACH 1st came out in a magazine - from scent to packaging I was a fan.  As much as I love perfumes, my budget is more for the body mists and knock offs.  Every so often though, I splurge on a perfume that excites me.  The scent of lime and light pepper brings me back to my time FL - working on Palm Beach and partying in West Palm.  The Fun.  The Dares.  This \\&quot;de parfum spray\\&quot; captures a memory that lends me a wicked smile to my demeanor. I like the lime/pepper scent as it changes melody during the day - vibrant and sharp at first mellowing to a soft citrus/pepper blend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girl, and think it&#x27;s the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  It makes me think primal thoughts.  Use with caution/protection...</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite island fragrance from Michael Kors called &amp;#34;Bermuda&amp;#34; was discontinued, so I tried this instead. It smells good, but do not think I would buy again. Just does not have the exotic and original fragrance as the &amp;#34;Bermuda&amp;#34; fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the smell - its a captivating scent that is very sexy....you can wear anytime of the year and feel good when you do...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It&#x27;s a shame that Michael Kors no longer makes this product!  It&#x27;s very summery and light.</li>
            <li> Surprised my wife with this before our vacation. She mentioned it some time ago, but had forgotten about the fragrance. She likes it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance ever!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and was so glad to find it after being discontinued.  It&#x27;s my all time favorite!  I love the light, tropical scent.  I can really smell the green tea scent.  I&#x27;ve had many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful perfume I have ever used. I wish it were available in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Some perfumes are overpowering but this one is not. I have gotten compliments when I&lt;br /&gt;wear it.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find product and I was excited to find this on sale. It was exactly what I wanted and still had the original scent (did not appear old or stale.)</li>
            <li> I was leery about purchasing perfume online but since this item is discontinued in stores I didn&#x27;t have much of a choice.  Needless to say, I was very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered Michael Kors Palm Beach.  I have had this product and used it 3 times, so I am very familiar with the scent.  The package came opened, usually it is sealed in a complete cellophane wrap, it only had a piece of tape on it.  The scent was not the right one and was terrible.  I tried to go on line to return it but it will not let me return the item.  Amazon also makes themselves totally unavailable so that I cannot contact ANYONE with the problem.  This was definately a scam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
