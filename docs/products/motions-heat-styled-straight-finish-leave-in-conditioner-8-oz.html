            <li>I can sleep on them and they still look great.</li>
            <li>Motions are really great products when they are used together.</li>
            <li>This works fine for my hair, but isn&#x27;t the best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I can recommend this for a good product to try.</li>
            <li>My goodness, the fragrance of this product is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the Motions Straight Finish Leave in Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Motions has a good line of products and most of them I find often exceed my expectations, however this one was a draw.  </li>
            <li>This is a pleasant cream and appears to work, but is too greasy and is so clumpy that it can&#x27;t be easily spread around.</li>
            <li>Motions straight finish leave in conditioner is light weight and smells good, but it isn&#x27;t the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It can be easily made to look like silk with a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes your hair and has a light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly good for straight hair too, to prevent fly away&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will love!</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t be able to use it again.</li>
            <li>I keep thinking that I can apply magic conditioner/mousse/leave-in</li>
            <li>It left the hair tamed, flowing, and wonderful!  </li>
            <li>My hair feels better than it did before I used it</li>
            <li>This condition works great with the Motions Straight Finish Cleaner.</li>
            <li>But I tried using it differently and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>Then magic happens.</li>
            <li>The curls are so healthy and bouncy</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells and feels lovely.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Use a tiny amount and it works great, and that also makes this a good value.</li>
            <li>This is an especially good product if you use a flat iron a lot as I do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty good too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>it left it with a real nice shine as well as full of body and a very light scent that will not irratate my sinuses.</li>
            <li>hair did not feel clean and I wash my hair more often than when I don&#x27;t apply this leave-in</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner smells great, is easy to apply and keeps your hair well behaved until the next wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But otherwise, the hair feels nice, and not greasy like pure coconut oil can leave it.</li>
            <li>This lightly scented product was used after washing my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for humidity in the summer.</li>
            <li>This hair product is actually very effective, especially on African-American hair.</li>
            <li>I also got great results when I used all three products in the line with blow drying and flat ironing my hair!  </li>
            <li>I loved that it left me a feeling afterwards that my hair felt managable and easy to style.</li>
            <li>I originally gave this product 2 stars.</li>
            <li>So I was pleased with this at first.  </li>
            <li>I dislike the odor but its pleasant enough.</li>
            <li>I truly love the Motions Straight Finish Leave in Conditioner.</li>
            <li>If I can keep from touching my hair (its so so so soft) my hair dries in gorgeous soft waves and curls.</li>
            <li>but it is cool</li>
            <li>I love the new Motions Leave In Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Previous Motions brand products had left me thinking that all of their items had to strong smells, but this leave in conditioner gives a great shine to my hair, without being too goopy  or strong smelling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it didn&#x27;t work for me 100%, I&#x27;d venture to say that the Motions line is well priced and well worth a try.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s matching shampoo have been the rare Motions product that I am not crazy about.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell divine, so if you wash your hair frequently, it should be okay.</li>
            <li>- it just doesn&#x27;t have the right texture for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my one Asian daughter and two African daughters, though, this is great.</li>
            <li>After using it a few times, I can safely say that I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love a leave in conditioner for that extra softening step and this one performed well.  </li>
            <li>We love them and use them daily.</li>
            <li>(first I just squeeze the water out my hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad they did because it actually works to combat that problem.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product, I used way too much.  </li>
            <li>First, let me be clear: the Motions product line is NOT for most white folks.</li>
            <li>By using just a small amount your hair will be softer and more manageable while the natural curl of your hair more defined.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this particular product.  </li>
            <li>I have really curly hair now.</li>
            <li>As a child, I had perfectly straight hair.</li>
            <li>, whatever and my hair will be model straight yet again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found, also, it&#x27;s better to put it on immediately after the shower when my hair is really wet, before towel drying.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>The Motions Straight Finish Leave in Conditioner functions very well as a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Also this works very well with the Motions cleanser and finish sealer.</li>
            <li>For the first day, my hair was soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I might not be the target market for this particular product, which I think is for coarser hair.</li>
            <li>The result is very soft, very fragrant</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Using it without the matching shampoo was a little better</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with my hypothesis, and this product still din&#x27;t get rid of 100% of the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I really like the product and have no complaints.</li>
            <li>It seems like it would be nice for relaxed hair or hair that isn&#x27;t as thick as mine.</li>
            <li>I mostly wear my hair natural and just occasionally straighten it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>Motions line smells pretty good, so at least there is a terrific smell following you around all day</li>
            <li>After using the Motions Straight Finish Leave in Conditioner my hair was not only soft to the touch but also very manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair drys soft and curly with almost no frizz!  </li>
            <li>My hair has natural roots and relaxed ends</li>
            <li>I also tried this on my son&#x27;s naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Happily surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>Smooth, shiny, manageable hair that dried with ease</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft but not limp or coated.  </li>
            <li>only caution is that you can&#x27;t use too much, or your hair will be duller and flatter.  </li>
            <li>Motions Straight Finish Leave in conditioner is a 8 ounce product  that actually does the job it describes.</li>
            <li>But it seemed that the second day it was becoming weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that is normal and soft in some places and very dry and coarse in others.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t major moisturizing to me</li>
            <li>I conditioned my hair with this after shampooing and conditioning it and it had a decent effect, didn&#x27;t straighten it out entirely but helped immensely especially with the frizzing.</li>
            <li>It left his hair soft and added definition to the curls.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t using anywhere near enough.</li>
            <li>I distribute this through my hair being careful not to get much at the roots.</li>
            <li>It combs smoothly and evenly through my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I love leave-in conditioners that aren&#x27;t too heavy on my hair, weighing it down or making it look greasy.</li>
            <li>but it was much less full than normal and found it weighed my hair down quite a bit.</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner is much heavier than other leave-ins in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It certainly kept my unruly hair down without creating much need for any other style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with natural hair</li>
            <li>Then I comb my hair straight down.</li>
            <li>It really helped define my curls and keep down frizz.  </li>
            <li>Just a very small amount of this stuff run through my hair after I towel dry, and my hair is easy to comb and looks healthier.  </li>
            <li>The thing about natural hair is that it gets very dry.  </li>

            <li> The thing about natural hair is that it gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, it gets through the hair easier this way than when I towel dry first (it left some residue when the hair was towel dried, maybe because I couldn&#x27;t work it in as well at that</li>

            <li> By the second day, I needed to rewash my hair because it was dry and unruly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works fine for my hair, but isn&#x27;t the best leave-in conditioner I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s probably a personal preference, but something about the texture seems off to me, and I have a use a lot of it to make it work. With some things, a little goes a long way. Not with this product. I&#x27;ve got a lot of hair, but  that&#x27;s not it - it just doesn&#x27;t have the right texture for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have dark brown Caucasian hair of medium thickness. I might not be the target market for this particular product, which I think is for coarser hair.</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the Motions Straight Finish Leave in Conditioner.  I have coarse, very dry hair, so conditioning is a necessary step whenever I wash my hair.  I love a leave in conditioner for that extra softening step and this one performed well.  The scent wasn&#x27;t bad and my hair didn&#x27;t feel like it left a film in it like some other brands can.  I can recommend this for a good product to try.</li>
            <li> This lightly scented product was used after washing my color treated hair. My hair has natural roots and relaxed ends (In need of a touch up) I like the thick consistency of the conditioner. For the first day, my hair was soft and manageable. By the second day, I needed to rewash my hair because it was dry and unruly. I also tried this on my son&#x27;s naturally curly hair. It left his hair soft and added definition to the curls. However, it left his scalp quite itchy so I won&#x27;t be able to use it again.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that is normal and soft in some places and very dry and coarse in others. It can be easily made to look like silk with a good conditioner. This is not that conditioner. It stinks - it&#x27;s an offensive smell like a rancid oil. and, it just made my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> First, let me be clear: the Motions product line is NOT for most white folks. I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my one Asian daughter and two African daughters, though, this is great. I also use it sometimes for my African son.</li>
            <li> Happily surprised by this product. Previous Motions brand products had left me thinking that all of their items had to strong smells, but this leave in conditioner gives a great shine to my hair, without being too goopy  or strong smelling.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair now. As a child, I had perfectly straight hair. I keep thinking that I can apply magic conditioner/mousse/leave-in, whatever and my hair will be model straight yet again. So far, I haven&#x27;t had much luck with my hypothesis, and this product still din&#x27;t get rid of 100% of the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Motions line smells pretty good, so at least there is a terrific smell following you around all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it didn&#x27;t work for me 100%, I&#x27;d venture to say that the Motions line is well priced and well worth a try.</li>
            <li> My goodness, the fragrance of this product is simply amazing. You only need to use a tiny amount or this will overpower you. I&#x27;ve found, also, it&#x27;s better to put it on immediately after the shower when my hair is really wet, before towel drying. For some reason, it gets through the hair easier this way than when I towel dry first (it left some residue when the hair was towel dried, maybe because I couldn&#x27;t work it in as well at that point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I figured out how to best use the product on my hair, I was thrilled with the results. Smooth, shiny, manageable hair that dried with ease (I could get the brush through which is always a problem for me) and no knots. This is an especially good product if you use a flat iron a lot as I do. Seems to protect the hair and make it easier to iron. The result is very soft, very fragrant hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> This hair product is actually very effective, especially on African-American hair. It left the hair tamed, flowing, and wonderful!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I know that this product if marketed for African Americans, but I wanted to see if it would aid my hair which gets quite corse during the summer months. The fact that it&#x27;s heat activated also makes it an ideal product for the summer. After using it a few times, I can safely say that I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is a bit heavy, but that&#x27;s not really a big problem if you want it to double as a styling gel. It certainly kept my unruly hair down without creating much need for any other style. Despite its heaviness, it rinsed out quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leave in conditioner worked great. My hair feels better than it did before I used it and it isn&#x27;t too expensive. For those of you looking to tame your hair, give this one a shot.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner smells great, is easy to apply and keeps your hair well behaved until the next wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need to use much. The bottle will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great leave-in conditioner at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a pleasant cream and appears to work, but is too greasy and is so clumpy that it can&#x27;t be easily spread around. I dislike the odor but its pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> After using the Motions Straight Finish Leave in Conditioner my hair was not only soft to the touch but also very manageable. For anyone who has curly hair this is a great product and one I&#x27;m sure you will love!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this particular product.  It made my hair feel soft and manageable.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I truly love the Motions Straight Finish Leave in Conditioner. This condition works great with the Motions Straight Finish Cleaner. By using just a small amount your hair will be softer and more manageable while the natural curl of your hair more defined. My hair was easier to comb, removed the tangles and my hiair felt great.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this product 2 stars. But I tried using it differently and it was awesome. I get lots of shampoos and conditioners to try. But I came back and bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the matching shampoo and then rinse with cold water. Lots of rinsing. I blot dry with a towel. Then I use this. I wasn&#x27;t using anywhere near enough. Now I use a squirt a little bigger than a half dollar. I distribute this through my hair being careful not to get much at the roots. Then I comb my hair straight down. Then magic happens. If I can keep from touching my hair (its so so so soft) my hair dries in gorgeous soft waves and curls. I do nothing. The curls are so healthy and bouncy I can sleep on them and they still look great. My hair is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original dumb review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used lots of Motions products. We love them and use them daily. This and it&#x27;s matching shampoo have been the rare Motions product that I am not crazy about. This conditioner smells and feels lovely. But using it after it&#x27;s matching shmpoo left my hair tacky. Using it without the matching shampoo was a little better but then it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough to stand on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> The Motions Straight Finish Leave in Conditioner functions very well as a conditioner.  It moisturizes your hair and has a light and pleasant scent. It doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh your hair down like some conditioners do.  Also this works very well with the Motions cleanser and finish sealer.</li>
            <li> Did not work like the thought it would.  It left my hair hard and dry.</li>
            <li> Motions straight finish leave in conditioner is light weight and smells good, but it isn&#x27;t the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m African American with natural hair and I have to use lots of this product to attain the conditioning my hair needs.  It seems like it would be nice for relaxed hair or hair that isn&#x27;t as thick as mine.</li>
            <li> I love the new Motions Leave In Conditioner. I loved that it left me a feeling afterwards that my hair felt managable and easy to style. I used this after I washed my hair and used a blowdryer to dry it. (was in a rush),I have ti say it did not dryout my hair it left it with a real nice shine as well as full of body and a very light scent that will not irratate my sinuses. Motions are really great products when they are used together.</li>
            <li> i wish they had bigger containers. im probably going to try something else by motions and see how that works</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I am mixed race ( black and white ) I have long,frizzy, DRY and curly hair. I mostly wear my hair natural and just occasionally straighten it with a flat iron. I love that this product is a leave in conditioner. The scent is fantastic. I use it on slopping wet hair (first I just squeeze the water out my hair... no toweling ) I work the conditioner through my hair with my hands.I then  finger comb my hair into place. I then let my hair air dry. My hair drys soft and curly with almost no frizz!  I also got great results when I used all three products in the line with blow drying and flat ironing my hair!  Overall if dry hair is your issue please give this product and the cleanser a try.</li>
            <li> The thing about natural hair is that it gets very dry.  I suppose Motions wanted to address that problem and created this leave-in conditioner.  I&#x27;m really glad they did because it actually works to combat that problem.  I&#x27;m giving it a five.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner is much heavier than other leave-ins in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did not feel clean and I wash my hair more often than when I don&#x27;t apply this leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left me with a heavy coated feeling which was unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product, I used way too much.  My hair was limp and coated and heavy.  The next time, I used about a nickel-sized dollop on my shoulder-length hair.  My hair was soft but not limp or coated.  It really helped define my curls and keep down frizz.  Since I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair often, I can&#x27;t attest to the heat protection yet. So far, I really like the product and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t major moisturizing to me but it is cool</li>
            <li> I love leave-in conditioners that aren&#x27;t too heavy on my hair, weighing it down or making it look greasy. So I was pleased with this at first.  But it seemed that the second day it was becoming weighed down.  Day three my hair had lost it&#x27;s shine and the ends were not lying straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell divine, so if you wash your hair frequently, it should be okay.</li>
            <li> This is a convenient way to keep hair manageable.  I have curly hair and I swim, so I need something to help keep my hair from being dried out or tangled.  Just a very small amount of this stuff run through my hair after I towel dry, and my hair is easy to comb and looks healthier.  It&#x27;s also much more comfortable.  Long term, it seems to be helping protect my hair from the effects of chlorine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caution is that you can&#x27;t use too much, or your hair will be duller and flatter.  Use a tiny amount and it works great, and that also makes this a good value.</li>
            <li> Motions Straight Finish Leave in conditioner is a 8 ounce product  that actually does the job it describes. Fabulous for humidity in the summer.</li>
            <li> Motions has a good line of products and most of them I find often exceed my expectations, however this one was a draw.  I found that it did help condition my hair but it was much less full than normal and found it weighed my hair down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfectly good for straight hair too, to prevent fly away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears like a homemade mayonaise conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty good too</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner seems to have a base of coconut oil, yet doesn&#x27;t have a coconut smell. It combs smoothly and evenly through my thick hair. It leaves the hair soft and fluffy, instead of weighing it down. I already have thick puffy hair, so I actually do want some weighing down of my hair. But otherwise, the hair feels nice, and not greasy like pure coconut oil can leave it. It&#x27;d probably suit you well if you have thin to medium thickness hair that isn&#x27;t puffy.</li>
            <li> I conditioned my hair with this after shampooing and conditioning it and it had a decent effect, didn&#x27;t straighten it out entirely but helped immensely especially with the frizzing. helped my hair look and smell great!</li>
