            <li>Included with the mask was a pair of ear plugs, in addittion to blocking out the light with the mask</li>
            <li>I did receive this product, free, for testing purposes-</li>
            <li>The mask fit well</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t hear a sound from the ship or the kids running around in the hallways.</li>
            <li>Keeps all the light out.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Blocks out the light well.  </li>
            <li>The earplugs are comfortable too and block out noise.</li>
            <li>It keeps the light out allowing her sleep with ease during the day and the ear plugs help block out the household noise.</li>
            <li>I like how it blocks out the light</li>

            <li>It fits comfortably, feels good, and definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li>, I felt like I was able to go into a much deeper sleep.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good sleep mask.</li>
            <li>Sweet dreams are made of products like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my new magnetic sleep mask.</li>
            <li>This magnetic sleep mask by Adella is such a great new concept in sleep masks.</li>
            <li>I like that the sleep mask is soft on the inside and very comfortable on the eyes, even thought there are magnets on it.  </li>
            <li>tattoos are a great way to add a little sparkle to the skin without the need to remember to put your jewelry on.</li>
            <li>a the earplugs block out the sound, making for a very restful night.  </li>
            <li>Finally a great night of sleep no light or snoring noise.  </li>
            <li>I really like that they came with a set of ear plugs, for blocking out sound.</li>
            <li>the statements above are my own.</li>
            <li>love sleep masks because in this day and age I find a room is never completely dark.</li>
            <li>Helps her fall right to sleep</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft, comfortable and stays in tact.</li>
            <li>When I woke up in the morning I felt very much rested</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to see any benefits of the magnets, but that could be because the mask refused to stay on my head the entire night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned a magnetic mask before so this was a first for me.  </li>
            <li>After the first night using the magnetic mask</li>
            <li>Worked really well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really interested in seeing how the magnets work</li>
            <li>compared to other masks I&#x27;ve tried, I love the satiny finish against my eyes!</li>
            <li>very silky and pleasant over my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;The double band in back holds in place</li>
            <li>I would however recommend at the peak of the application process to continue applying pressure an extra 15 sec or more, just to be sure that they are applied.</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that they come with their own little case.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s a nice little bonus with your purchase.</li>
            <li>These are a great way to add a little extra sparkle to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is too much digital light.</li>
            <li>It actually fits my eyes and blocks out all light unlike others i have tried.  </li>
            <li>so when i saw this one i really wanted her to try it out.</li>
            <li>thank you so much..</li>
            <li>date(s) item was reviewed in real time.</li>
            <li>The strap and padding is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is super soft and silky, fits well and comes with ear plugs that are as soft as marshmallows!</li>
            <li>It not only keeps them clean, it keeps my cat from getting a hold of them and flicking them around the house.  </li>
            <li>love the earplugs, and especially love the nice sturdy little case that comes with them, since I am very bad about losing things like those!</li>
            <li>The stitching and fabric is of a high quality and placed and stitched together very well.</li>
            <li>The earplugs also come in a little plastic box for safe keeping.</li>
            <li>I would like it if the straps were a little tighter or more adjustable.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion they are easy to apply, just like any other temporary tattoo.</li>
            <li>This mask is super soft, velvety on the outside, silky on the underside.</li>
            <li>I have a smaller head, and they seemed to fit well- not too big...</li>
            <li>The mask has a very soft feel to it, on one side</li>
            <li>and i was able to sleep in a bit longer than usual this morning.  </li>
            <li>These are so silky and soft!</li>
            <li>I just used this last night and it really helped!</li>
            <li>As a frequent migraine suffer, this product is a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li>This sleep mask also contains Magnetic properties that help you sleep like the natural hormone melatonin.</li>
            <li>Soft, well made.</li>
            <li>This seems to have fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>, therefore they are too big for my particular head size.</li>

            <li> she was so excited when she saw it and all of its benefits and then after she tried it out she was sold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited that I received an opportunity to review this I mask and earplugs that as part of the promotion.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does not cause any irritation which I have experienced with other brands.</li>
            <li> It fits comfortably, feels good, and definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> , I felt like I was able to go into a much deeper sleep.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good sleep mask.</li>
            <li> Sweet dreams are made of products like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my new magnetic sleep mask.</li>
            <li> This magnetic sleep mask by Adella is such a great new concept in sleep masks.</li>
            <li> I like that the sleep mask is soft on the inside and very comfortable on the eyes, even thought there are magnets on it.  </li>
            <li> tattoos are a great way to add a little sparkle to the skin without the need to remember to put your jewelry on.</li>
            <li> a the earplugs block out the sound, making for a very restful night.  </li>
            <li> Finally a great night of sleep no light or snoring noise.  </li>
            <li> I really like that they came with a set of ear plugs, for blocking out sound.</li>
            <li> the statements above are my own.</li>
            <li> love sleep masks because in this day and age I find a room is never completely dark.</li>
            <li> Helps her fall right to sleep</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft, comfortable and stays in tact.</li>
            <li> When I woke up in the morning I felt very much rested</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to see any benefits of the magnets, but that could be because the mask refused to stay on my head the entire night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a magnetic mask before so this was a first for me.  </li>
            <li> After the first night using the magnetic mask</li>
            <li> Worked really well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really interested in seeing how the magnets work</li>
            <li> compared to other masks I&#x27;ve tried, I love the satiny finish against my eyes!</li>
            <li> very silky and pleasant over my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;The double band in back holds in place</li>
            <li> I would however recommend at the peak of the application process to continue applying pressure an extra 15 sec or more, just to be sure that they are applied.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that they come with their own little case.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s a nice little bonus with your purchase.</li>
            <li> These are a great way to add a little extra sparkle to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is too much digital light.</li>
            <li> It actually fits my eyes and blocks out all light unlike others i have tried.  </li>
            <li> so when i saw this one i really wanted her to try it out.</li>
            <li> thank you so much..</li>
            <li> date(s) item was reviewed in real time.</li>
            <li> The strap and padding is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is super soft and silky, fits well and comes with ear plugs that are as soft as marshmallows!</li>
            <li> It not only keeps them clean, it keeps my cat from getting a hold of them and flicking them around the house.  </li>
            <li> love the earplugs, and especially love the nice sturdy little case that comes with them, since I am very bad about losing things like those!</li>
            <li> The stitching and fabric is of a high quality and placed and stitched together very well.</li>
            <li> The earplugs also come in a little plastic box for safe keeping.</li>
            <li> I would like it if the straps were a little tighter or more adjustable.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion they are easy to apply, just like any other temporary tattoo.</li>
            <li> This mask is super soft, velvety on the outside, silky on the underside.</li>
            <li> I have a smaller head, and they seemed to fit well- not too big...</li>
            <li> The mask has a very soft feel to it, on one side</li>
            <li> and i was able to sleep in a bit longer than usual this morning.  </li>
            <li> These are so silky and soft!</li>
            <li> I just used this last night and it really helped!</li>
            <li> As a frequent migraine suffer, this product is a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> This sleep mask also contains Magnetic properties that help you sleep like the natural hormone melatonin.</li>
            <li> Soft, well made.</li>
            <li> This seems to have fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> , therefore they are too big for my particular head size.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a dark night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> and she didnt have as much pressure in her head as usual...</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and have trouble sleeping in new places.  </li>
            <li> Magnets press on skin, not very soft.</li>
            <li> I need complete darkness and quiet which is hard to get in a household with a teenage daughter, two dogs, two cats and a husband.  </li>
            <li> This one is different from all of the other I have.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was a little different is the straps.  </li>
            <li> I plan on cutting the strap and sewing it back on so that it is custom fit for my head.</li>
            <li> well, however I didn&#x27;t like the tightness of both, so I just lift one up and leave it loose</li>
            <li> Only minor complaint I have is the straps that go around your head is too big for me</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as tight as I would prefer, but does not fall off so overall</li>
            <li> and it was a little big</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there is a seam with an extra piece of material sticking up that bothers my cheek.  </li>
            <li> The problem is, the strap on the mask is not adjustable and the mask kept slipping off my head.  </li>
            <li> the straps are very loose, there is a zipper</li>
            <li> The puffy circles under my eyes have gone way down after only a few nights.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a velvety material and on the other side it&#x27;s a silky material.  </li>
            <li> body&#x27;s reaction may differ from any other user of this</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> This is like my other mask</li>
            <li> I have been trouble sleeping the last few weeks, and when I did manage to sleep, I wasn&#x27;t feeling refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li> This was a little tight for me</li>
            <li> I did not realize all the benefits that having little magnets in this sleep mask, could bring....</li>
            <li> You will see, from my photos, the little zipper compartment-</li>
            <li> I like the little zipper pouch, where you can place your ear plugs</li>
            <li> Lover there is a little pouch with zipper</li>
            <li> The mask fits well, although a little snug.</li>
            <li> I like the weight of the mask as well, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It even has a small, hidden zipper compartment to keep them in.</li>
            <li> my oldest daughter suffers from migraine headaches daily and has a really hard time sleeping and recently asked me for a sleep mask</li>
            <li> No more waking up with headaches.</li>
            <li> This one has a small zipper on the underside; you can put in a gel pack or an eye mask from the fridge or freezer fro added comfort.</li>
            <li> mask also comes with earplugs and a small carry case that fits both the mask and the earplugs.</li>
            <li> I wore this sleep mask for the past 3 nights.  </li>
            <li> On the silky side there is a zippered area that holds the magnets, the magnets are fairly small</li>
            <li> she had a restful sleep for once and her head wasnt pounding when she woke up like it usually does.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it actually works.</li>
            <li> not very impressed</li>
            <li> so I could put little cold packs inside for my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this mask would be heavy to wear</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful sleeping mask. Really comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was waking up with headaches in the morning. The mask has helped immensely. No more waking up with headaches.</li>
            <li> My daughter works nights and this had worked great for her to help keep the light out and the sounds out when she is trying to sleep during the day.</li>
            <li> Magnets press on skin, not very soft.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is super soft and silky, fits well and comes with ear plugs that are as soft as marshmallows! It even has a small, hidden zipper compartment to keep them in. These are great when you&#x27;re away from home, have a partner who sleeps with the tv or a light on, or have noisy neighbors among many other circumstances. The only problem I&#x27;ve had is keeping my daughter from stealing it!!</li>
            <li> I have many sleep masks; I need them to sleep! This one is different from all of the other I have. This one has a small zipper on the underside; you can put in a gel pack or an eye mask from the fridge or freezer fro added comfort. This is a definite bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I love sleep masks because in this day and age I find a room is never completely dark. There is too much digital light. This mask is super soft, velvety on the outside, silky on the underside. It blocks out all of the unnatural light from phones, cable boxes, clocks and the like.&lt;br /&gt;This mask also comes with earplugs and a small carry case that fits both the mask and the earplugs. I was given the opportunity to test and try this mask while I sleep. It is perfect. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a dark night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> I love how comfy this sleep mask is. It actually fits my eyes and blocks out all light unlike others i have tried.  i RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this mask would be heavy to wear but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s comfortable and the band adjusts so it stays in place. Helps great with headaches!!</li>
            <li> When I read that the sleep mask had magnets inside, I was intrigued. I read up on some of the benefits of &amp;#34;magnet therapy&amp;#34; and gave it a shot. I like that the sleep mask is soft on the inside and very comfortable on the eyes, even thought there are magnets on it.  You don&#x27;t feel the magnets when you are wearing the mask because the magnets are so tiny and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have chronic sinusitis and hoped that the magnets would relieve some of the pressure in my eye area. I wore this sleep mask for the past 3 nights.  I wasn&#x27;t able to see any benefits of the magnets, but that could be because the mask refused to stay on my head the entire night. The problem is, the strap on the mask is not adjustable and the mask kept slipping off my head.  All three mornings I woke up with the mask next to me. I plan on cutting the strap and sewing it back on so that it is custom fit for my head. Should be simple enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I love my new magnetic sleep mask. I&#x27;ve never owned a magnetic mask before so this was a first for me.  After the first night using the magnetic mask I immediately could feel a difference, I felt like I was able to go into a much deeper sleep.  When I woke up in the morning I felt very much rested and I hadn&#x27;t felt that in years.  The mask has a very soft feel to it, on one side it&#x27;s like a velvety material and on the other side it&#x27;s a silky material.  On the silky side there is a zippered area that holds the magnets, the magnets are fairly small so you don&#x27;t feel them while your sleeping but they are big enough to make a difference in your sleep.  Included with the mask was a pair of ear plugs, in addittion to blocking out the light with the mask a the earplugs block out the sound, making for a very restful night.  The only problem I had with the mask is that the Straps don&#x27;t have any way to adjust them. The package says they are adjustable. In order for them to stay on my head I had to tie them. But the mask is a great product over all.  I was given the opportunity to purchase this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Worked really well! And so comfortable!  Wore  them last night and i was able to sleep in a bit longer than usual this morning.  Haven&#x27;t used the ear plus yet but ill be sure and take them on my next trip with me. Im sure they will be handy on the plane or at the hotel!</li>
            <li> Finally a great night of sleep no light or snoring noise.  You saved my marriage.</li>
            <li> I am a horrible insomniac... I will try anything that may help me fall asleep and stay asleep. I have heard of and used sleep mask before, but never with magnetic therapy! I did not realize all the benefits that having little magnets in this sleep mask, could bring.... I like the lightness of this mask, it does not smother you like some others do. Your eyes feel like they still have room to move around. I have a smaller head, and they seemed to fit well- not too big... the color is nice too. I really like that they came with a set of ear plugs, for blocking out sound. You will see, from my photos, the little zipper compartment- where the magnets are... I did receive this product, free, for testing purposes- the statements above are my own.</li>
            <li> great sleep mask! i received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. This magnetic sleep mask by Adella is such a great new concept in sleep masks. The stitching and fabric is of a high quality and placed and stitched together very well. the many benefits of the magnetic feature is of nothing but great additional bonuses in a sleep mask. my oldest daughter suffers from migraine headaches daily and has a really hard time sleeping and recently asked me for a sleep mask so when i saw this one i really wanted her to try it out. she was so excited when she saw it and all of its benefits and then after she tried it out she was sold. she had a restful sleep for once and her head wasnt pounding when she woke up like it usually does. she felt more relaxed and at ease and she didnt have as much pressure in her head as usual...i can definatly say i am so happy she tried this sleep mask with the added benefit of the magnetic features ...i had heard about magnetic therapy for health reason but i wasnt sure of if it worked at all and now i am a believer....thank you so much..mom and daughter approved</li>
            <li> I love this mask it is very comfortable to use. It is not adjustable but it fits me just fine. I like that your plugs that come with it and I like the fact that they come with their own little case. My six-year-old daughter wanted to steal this from me so I let her try it on and it was a little big but she still was able to where it for a bit I even let her put your plugs in for a minute she was so cute. I&#x27;m really excited that I received an opportunity to review this I mask and earplugs that as part of the promotion. I&#x27;m really interested in seeing how the magnets work hopefully I will be able to update soon about getting a better night sleep. I will be updating with my honest and unbiased experience based solely on my use of this product.</li>
            <li> As a frequent migraine suffer, this product is a lifesaver.  I need complete darkness and quiet which is hard to get in a household with a teenage daughter, two dogs, two cats and a husband.  The mask fit well and I love the case for the earplugs.  It not only keeps them clean, it keeps my cat from getting a hold of them and flicking them around the house.  This is now a staple item that is kept in my bedside night stand.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sleep masks I have purchased. I am really impressed at how soft the mask is and I love that it comes with ear plugs. I purchased this item to take on a cruise and really needed a good mask with ear plugs to get a good nights sleep .I didn&#x27;t hear a sound from the ship or the kids running around in the hallways. I am impressed at how well put this masked stayed on through out the night and kept all light out !! This sleep mask also contains Magnetic properties that help you sleep like the natural hormone melatonin.</li>
            <li> These are so silky and soft! I like the weight of the mask as well, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect sleep mask. I forgot mine on the plane recently, and immediately came home and ordered a replacement, so I would have it for the next trip. Very comfortable, does not press against the eyes. Keeps all the light out. There&#x27;s also an adjustable strap in the back. What more could you ask of a sleep mask?</li>
            <li> This product was purchased at an amazing discounted rate. I like the little zipper pouch, where you can place your ear plugs so they don&#x27;t get lost. The earplugs also come in a little plastic box for safe keeping. The only con there is with these is they do not have an ability to adjust around my head, therefore they are too big for my particular head size. I still use them because I do like the effect I receive from the magnetic field transferred while resting. In my opinion I am happy with the product, and it&#x27;s ability to assist in a good resting period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tattoos are a great way to add a little sparkle to the skin without the need to remember to put your jewelry on. When I was offered these at a great discounted rate, I was happy to take advantage of the offer. In my opinion they are easy to apply, just like any other temporary tattoo. I would however recommend at the peak of the application process to continue applying pressure an extra 15 sec or more, just to be sure that they are applied. These are a great way to add a little extra sparkle to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My body&#x27;s reaction may differ from any other user of this product.&lt;br /&gt;*Take note: The date(s) I choose to place a review on Amazon, may not reflect date(s) item was reviewed in real time.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and have trouble sleeping in new places.  The Magnetic sleep mask helps me get some rest!  Its made with very comfortable fabric and I got a free pair of ear plugs in their own case with my order!  I&#x27;ve always heard good things about magnets helping with hormone balance, and stimulating melatonin, which aids in sleep.  I need all the help I can get when I travel.  I wake up feeling refreshed and well rested after a good night&#x27;s sleep, and no puffy eyes for me!  I received product for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> My daughter is going to love this. Helps her fall right to sleep</li>
            <li> This is very comfortable. I got a great nights sleep. The puffy circles under my eyes have gone way down after only a few nights.</li>
            <li> the straps are very loose, there is a zipper but I cant find what for. the stitching is done sloppy. there is a piece of fabric they didn&#x27;t cut, causing it to look cheap. not very impressed</li>
            <li> Great mask! Soft, well made. Lover there is a little pouch with zipper so I could put little cold packs inside for my eyes. Only minor complaint I have is the straps that go around your head is too big for me and I&#x27;m sure I have a huge head. I wish they are adjustable. Other than that everything is perfect!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mask!  I am a migraine sufferer and this mask seems to be helping me bounce back quicker from them.  The mask has helped me to sleep more sound - I know it sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s true.  I wish I had one of these years ago.  It&#x27;s very soft, comfortable and stays in tact.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this sleep mask, and am very happy that it arrived with earplugs too! I have had the best and most comfortable night since receiving it. It is easy to use and does not cause any irritation which I have experienced with other brands. The strap and padding is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to try this product for free, and would recommend this sleep mask to other people to use! It&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li> I have used the sleep mask for several nights in a row. My room tends to have lights from chargers, air purifier, alarm clock and that kind of things. I figured this would help block those lights and help me get a better night sleep. The mask fits well, although a little snug. There is no way to adjust the strap but it still fits my head okay. My only complaint is that there is a seam with an extra piece of material sticking up that bothers my cheek.  I cut the piece on and placed a bandaid over it.  This seems to have fixed the problem. Overall a good sleep mask.</li>
            <li> I recently went on vacation and used these on the plane. I was able to take a nice nap. These are now a permanent part of my carry-on bag.</li>
            <li> very silky and pleasant over my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;The double band in back holds in place well, however I didn&#x27;t like the tightness of both, so I just lift one up and leave it loose and it&#x27;s perfectly comfortable!&lt;br /&gt;I love the earplugs, and especially love the nice sturdy little case that comes with them, since I am very bad about losing things like those! the case keeps them together and can be stored anywhere you want.&lt;br /&gt;As compared to other masks I&#x27;ve tried, I love the satiny finish against my eyes!</li>
            <li> I just used this last night and it really helped!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for use while traveling.  I tried it on.  It&#x27;s comfortable.  Blocks out the light well.  The earplugs are comfortable too and block out noise. The only thing I wish was a little different is the straps.  I would like it if the straps were a little tighter or more adjustable.  It isn&#x27;t as tight as I would prefer, but does not fall off so overall I like it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it actually works. I have been trouble sleeping the last few weeks, and when I did manage to sleep, I wasn&#x27;t feeling refreshed in the morning. Every time I have worn this mask, I have had a great nights sleep.  It fits comfortably, feels good, and definitely makes a difference. I strongly suggest giving this thing a try.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter as she works nights and has to sleep during the day.  She LOVES it!  It keeps the light out allowing her sleep with ease during the day and the ear plugs help block out the household noise.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift with a discount. The person I bought it for is really happy with it. She said it works great! Keeps out the light, helps her sleep better and is over all a great present. She was thrilled about the ear plugs that come with it! So that&#x27;s a nice little bonus with your purchase. She said it stays on and in place which I had been unsure about but, I guess it works wonderfully! She&#x27;s happy with her gift, so I&#x27;m really happy with decision to purchase it for her!</li>
            <li> Was able to get this for a great price.  Very comfortable and loved the ear plugs that came along with!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot better sleep since using this product. I like how it blocks out the light and I can use the earplugs to block out the neighbors screaming at night. Sweet dreams are made of products like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Ok quality.  I didn&#x27;t get the book or ear plugs as said.</li>
            <li> This is like my other mask I just got I love this one too. It seems to help any sleeping problems. It has ear plugs so you don&#x27;t hear anything that is going on and the mask keeps out the light. Also with it being magnetic you don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off while you are sleeping. Thanks for making a great product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t verify the healing properties, but the product is well made.</li>
            <li> This was a little tight for me so they hurt my eyes but I did cut the straps and made my own so they&#x27;re great!</li>
