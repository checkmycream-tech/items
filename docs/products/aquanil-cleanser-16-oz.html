            <li> My skin was highly reactive, and had dry scaly places that would not resolve.  I could tell a HUGE difference within 24 hours of switching to this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Used this for many, many  years. I have rosacea and this cleanser is the only thing my skin likes - I&#x27;ve tried Cetaphil and could not tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my wife&#x27;s dermatologist, she uses it every day.  We have a hard time finding it at our local pharmacy.  The three-pack is a cost savings opportunity and there is never a doubt the product will be there before she runs out.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for cleaning face.  I have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> Have used it for many years, great product.  I CAN EVEN USE IT FOR EYE MAKEUP REMOVAL.</li>
            <li> A gentle and great face washing liquid that I have been using for years. Also, works well in taking off make-up.</li>
            <li> Good face cleanser, but also removes eye makeup really with a tissue or cotton ball.  Very gentle and does not irritate my skin!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin -- also works in lieu of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Very mild, but does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get in local drugstores, but Amazon fills the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like ordering 3-5 at a time.</li>
            <li> This product used to be sold in all major drug stores---I found it when a dermatologist recommended it for my sensitive skin.  This was years ago and I&#x27;ve never found anything better to clean my skin morning and night. They never advertised.....just had a GREAT PRODUCT. Now I have to order it online.</li>
            <li> Use daily. Convenient shopping!</li>
            <li> good product.well shipped!</li>
            <li> This is certainly an excellent product. It provides a thorough cleaning for sensitive skin without any harsh after effects.</li>
            <li> I was told only to use this cleanser by my dermatologist.  It is lotiony, which I don&#x27;t love because I prefer a cleaner that makes suds.  I was having reactions to even the most gentle cleansers until I went on this one. It does not remove makeup terribly well, and I often use it twice at night.  It is incredibly hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Used by person with sensitive, age blemished skin - feels good, and makes skin look clearer.  Was recommended by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my Dermatologist.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face.  It makes it feel clean without being dry.</li>
            <li> was everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and works exceptionally well with any skin type.  My skin is normal to oily and I found it perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I use it twice daily.  My grandkids shower with it.  Have used it for years since recommended by my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve used lots of expensive facial cleansers, some recommended by doctors, others by aestheticians. A new dermatologist recommended aquanil cleanser about five years ago and I don&#x27;t plan on changing any time soon.  This is non-comedogenic, inexpensive, and my skin looks great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just love this cleanser.  Takes off 100% of make-up easily and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my doctor.  I tried it but, it doesn&#x27;t get sudsy so, you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working.  I just put it on and hope it&#x27;s cleaning.  I&#x27;ll use what I have but , won&#x27;t be ordering any more.</li>
