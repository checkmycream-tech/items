            <li>Love my personalized Go-Comb.</li>
            <li>I think a plastic comb with the identical look would be better.</li>
            <li>More of a novelty item.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more teeth</li>
            <li>Great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The go comb was the first result on Google, and probably for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in a jacket or pant pocket or in your dopp kit and</li>
            <li>I happen to enjoy the feeling</li>
            <li>This product is great overall.</li>
            <li>fit in a wallet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: For those like me who use a bit of sticky product on their hair, this is also super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s no hardship remembering to clean</li>
            <li>Once you own one, you&#x27;ll be surprised how often you use it!</li>
            <li>The plastic version broke pretty quickly, but the steel comb has been a life saver on more than one occasion.  </li>
            <li>The Go Comb is a very convenient, stylish, and unique comb.</li>
            <li>The creator of this comb, Heather Burkman, respectfully contacted me regarding my review and sent me a new version with plastic tips for free.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they make this thing, but it&#x27;s super durable and just looks really cool.</li>
            <li>I carry it in my purse for quick touch ups (for may hair and my boyfriend&#x27;s beard).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super portable and looks wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased, and if I lose this one I&#x27;ll definitely buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s pretty much the most portable grooming tool ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little comb if you have a beard or mustache.</li>
            <li>There is no problem with teeth breaking or bending while in my wallet, and it&#x27;s nice to have a comb in the unexpected event that someone wants to do a photo.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price, not just because it&#x27;s useful, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a cool unique accessory.</li>
            <li>The comb feels well-made and certainly looks unique.</li>
            <li>Gunk rolls right off.</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s a good thing as it can fit in compartments that might be to small for a credit card</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid yet flexible design is perfect for contorting to your wallet shape, but holding up when you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated between the standard and fine tooth, but went with the standard.</li>
            <li>Super durable and cool how it has my last name on it.</li>
            <li>And while it does bend a bit out of shape, it just as easily bends back.</li>
            <li>Smart.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit getting used to dragging the metal tines across your head, but it more or less works like a regular brush, albeit with a bit more abrasion.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to carry; fits in wallet.</li>
            <li>Made of stainless steel</li>
            <li>Its very helpful when keeping your hair neat if you are out on the go without having to carry a hairbrush.</li>
            <li>my hair is real think, and it feels scratchy.</li>
            <li>I got the stainless steel vesion of the wallet comb.</li>
            <li>The comb is nice and small, but sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I would think that a twelve dollar  stainless steel comb would have a little bit better finish quality.  </li>
            <li>I do think the price for that convenience is a bit high at around $12.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Love this little thing.</li>
            <li>Strong metal and does not damage the other cards.  </li>
            <li>Digging my new comb</li>
            <li>Keeps it fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars, is that the metal used is very pliable and requires flattening out from time to time.</li>
            <li>This works really well in my low profile stretch wallet.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of a stainless steel comb than the actual practically of it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, especially at this price point.</li>
            <li>Zero complaints, and five-star customer service from a small businessperson is fantastic to see.</li>
            <li>practical than general</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I highly recommend this to anyone with hair, a wallet, wind, and dry weather.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed its aluminum material that its made of which makes it very sturdy and makes the likely hood of it breaking very unlikely during normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think the coating will come off in my wallet, it has bent once from being sat on but went back in shape with no problems or chipping of the coating.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thin as most credit cards</li>
            <li>I have the more recent comb with the coating on it, I&#x27;m not sure what the problems other people are having with this comb, it feels well made</li>
            <li>I did smooth the edges with a file because I felt they were a little sharp.</li>
            <li>Has just a little flex in it, but you would really have to go out of your way to bend it.</li>
            <li>The end you hold onto with all the little whole also grabs hairs and rips them out as they go into it.  </li>

            <li> People have complained of getting sharp teeth on theirs, but mine are as smooth as butter.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s going to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s roughly the size of a credit card, with teeth a little wider apart than an ordinary comb, but it works fine</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s s bit smaller in the other demensions</li>
            <li> Just take dishwashing or hand soap, rub your hands together, and towel dry.</li>
            <li> And it fits inside of my new hard case wallet.</li>
            <li> For years I had been cutting plastic combs in half so that I could fit one of them inside my wallet, when I FINALLY came across this product.</li>
            <li> only knock is the steel is a little too flexible.</li>
            <li> I roll into work with bedhead and wet and brush my hair In the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Fits in my wallet as expected, and works well for hair, but combing my beard with it just rips the hairs out of my head.  </li>
            <li> I even use the other side (with the holes) as a nail filer.</li>
            <li> My beard loves it, mine wasn&#x27;t sharp like some reviewers mentioned</li>
            <li> but other might not.  </li>
            <li> However, the edges in-between the comb teeth are sharp, so I am concerned about how that will affect my hair.</li>
            <li> Sharp points and edges.  </li>
            <li> looks really cool, and I feel bad ass when I take it out of my wallet when I actually need it, but the teetch are a bit spaced apart, and its harsh on the hair.</li>
            <li> The edges of the tines felt little sharp to me and I worry that the sharp e.dges might damage the hair shaft with use.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little sharp.  </li>
            <li> In any case, this solved my issue of carrying a pocket comb, and has helped my pockets become even less cluttered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it everyday for months.</li>
            <li> Everyday carry.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for a small piece of thin metal.</li>
            <li> As a guy who travels a lot, it&#x27;s hard to remember to bring a comb.</li>
            <li> The teeth are thick</li>
            <li> but then again I am thick skinned.</li>
            <li> Wafer thin.</li>
            <li> I gave it away  and too thin for me.</li>
            <li> it irritate my thin scalp pain</li>

            <li> Excellent credit card-size comb that fits in my wallet.</li>
            <li> I backed this project on Kickstarter, and I have to say it&#x27;s been very handy, even as a guy.  The comb is nice and small, but sturdy.  There is no problem with teeth breaking or bending while in my wallet, and it&#x27;s nice to have a comb in the unexpected event that someone wants to do a photo.</li>
            <li> Great comb, fits in the wallet. Wish the teeth were finer.</li>
            <li> Perfect. It&#x27;s a comb you carry in your wallet, made of metal so the teeth aren&#x27;t going to chip off. It&#x27;s roughly the size of a credit card, with teeth a little wider apart than an ordinary comb, but it works fine and it&#x27;s always there, in your wallet.</li>
            <li> yup, I used it and carried it since it arrived.  Strong metal and does not damage the other cards.  The teeth are thick so it is closer to a brush then a comb when fixing your hair.</li>
            <li> After seeing a million various credit card shaped utilities, I knew there had to be a credit card shaped comb. The go comb was the first result on Google, and probably for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is great to tuck away &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;, but also works as a go-to comb. It&#x27;s solid yet flexible design is perfect for contorting to your wallet shape, but holding up when you are using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I debated between the standard and fine tooth, but went with the standard. I&#x27;m very happy with my choice, as it does an excellent job of cleaning up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend this to anyone with hair, a wallet, wind, and dry weather.</li>
            <li> Love this thing! I&#x27;ve used it everyday for months. Fits perfectly in my wallet. A great comb for the minimalist EDCer.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing. Stays in my wallet and keeps my hair manageable. I roll into work with bedhead and wet and brush my hair In the bathroom. Keeps it fresh all day long. Super durable and cool how it has my last name on it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Works well. Conversation starter. Smart.</li>
            <li> I have the more recent comb with the coating on it, I&#x27;m not sure what the problems other people are having with this comb, it feels well made and I don&#x27;t think the coating will come off in my wallet, it has bent once from being sat on but went back in shape with no problems or chipping of the coating.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thin as most credit cards but it&#x27;s s bit smaller in the other demensions and I think that&#x27;s a good thing as it can fit in compartments that might be to small for a credit card</li>
            <li> Great little comb if you have a beard or mustache. Very convenient to carry; fits in wallet. Built well. Has just a little flex in it, but you would really have to go out of your way to bend it.</li>
            <li> For years I had been cutting plastic combs in half so that I could fit one of them inside my wallet, when I FINALLY came across this product. It&#x27;s wonderful. Made of stainless steel so I can&#x27;t break it. Wafer thin. And it fits inside of my new hard case wallet. Kudos to whoever came up with this product.</li>
            <li> As a guy who travels a lot, it&#x27;s hard to remember to bring a comb. With the Go-Comb, I just leave it in my wallet and forget about it. It&#x27;s especially helpful after I just slept on a red-eye flight and need to look presentable for a morning meeting. I even use the other side (with the holes) as a nail filer. I don&#x27;t know how they make this thing, but it&#x27;s super durable and just looks really cool. It a good conversation piece, too. Highly recommend, especially at this price point.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my go-comb.  Got several as holiday gifts.  Saves space in my purse, don&#x27;t need to take a brush any more.  Great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great stocking stuffer. The comb feels well-made and certainly looks unique. It fits anywhere a credit card does; perfect for a guy&#x27;s pocket.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Digging my new comb</li>
            <li> Very cool idea, and to my mind perfectly executed. People have complained of getting sharp teeth on theirs, but mine are as smooth as butter. And while it does bend a bit out of shape, it just as easily bends back. It looks neat, feels good in the hand, sets my hair perfectly, and feels great on my scalp. Plus it&#x27;s pretty much the most portable grooming tool ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased, and if I lose this one I&#x27;ll definitely buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: For those like me who use a bit of sticky product on their hair, this is also super easy to clean. Just take dishwashing or hand soap, rub your hands together, and towel dry. Gunk rolls right off. I take it out of my pocket whenever I&#x27;m in front of a mirror,  so it&#x27;s no hardship remembering to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb is A+++!</li>
            <li> My beard loves it, mine wasn&#x27;t sharp like some reviewers mentioned but then again I am thick skinned.</li>
            <li> It does fit great in my wallet but it&#x27;s a little sharp.  Whenever I comb my head or beard with this the edges scrape.  I happen to enjoy the feeling but other might not.  The end you hold onto with all the little whole also grabs hairs and rips them out as they go into it.  The ends are also pointy so I may be able to use this to slice someones throat if I need to.</li>
            <li> The Go Comb is a very convenient, stylish, and unique comb. The comb is about the same size of any credit card and fits in any credit card slot in a wallet. Its very helpful when keeping your hair neat if you are out on the go without having to carry a hairbrush. Although its not as good as a hair brush its still good for making yourself look presentable. I also enjoyed its aluminum material that its made of which makes it very sturdy and makes the likely hood of it breaking very unlikely during normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a cool unique accessory. And if you have space in your wallet it does not do any harm in buying this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great overall. Fits in my wallet just like a credit card. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars, is that the metal used is very pliable and requires flattening out from time to time.</li>
            <li> Love this thing, think everyone should have one!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. However, the edges in-between the comb teeth are sharp, so I am concerned about how that will affect my hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome comb that fits right in your wallet. You will probably lose this comb before it breaks. Very nice. A little pricey for a small piece of thin metal.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the on the go bearded guy.</li>
            <li> This works really well in my low profile stretch wallet. It takes a bit getting used to dragging the metal tines across your head, but it more or less works like a regular brush, albeit with a bit more abrasion. In any case, this solved my issue of carrying a pocket comb, and has helped my pockets become even less cluttered.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  Fits in my wallet perfectly and I never have to look for a brush or comb in my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> Fits in my wallet as expected, and works well for hair, but combing my beard with it just rips the hairs out of my head.  The tines have a bit of an edge to them, which I believe is causing this.    UPDATE:  The creator of this comb, Heather Burkman, respectfully contacted me regarding my review and sent me a new version with plastic tips for free.  This new version works great!  Zero complaints, and five-star customer service from a small businessperson is fantastic to see.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! Product as described. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Love this, I don&#x27;t always have a comb on me, but I always have my wallet, so this item is spot on for people who have awful hair and need to fix it up more often than others.  The plastic version broke pretty quickly, but the steel comb has been a life saver on more than one occasion.  Totally worth the price, not just because it&#x27;s useful, but because it&#x27;s going to last a long time.  Fits perfectly in my wallet just as described!</li>
            <li> Love my personalized Go-Comb. I carry it in my purse for quick touch ups (for may hair and my boyfriend&#x27;s beard). I carry it in my beach bag as well to hold off on inevitable pool/beach induced rat nested hair. Once you own one, you&#x27;ll be surprised how often you use it!</li>
            <li> looks really cool, and I feel bad ass when I take it out of my wallet when I actually need it, but the teetch are a bit spaced apart, and its harsh on the hair. my hair is real think, and it feels scratchy. I like the idea of a stainless steel comb than the actual practically of it. I think a plastic comb with the identical look would be better. Will still stay in my wallet till I lose it though.</li>
            <li> I got the stainless steel vesion of the wallet comb. It&#x27;s a great way to assure yourself that you have a comb handy at all times without more clutter in the pocket or purse.  I do think the price for that convenience is a bit high at around $12.  I would think that a twelve dollar  stainless steel comb would have a little bit better finish quality.  The edges of the tines felt little sharp to me and I worry that the sharp e.dges might damage the hair shaft with use.  I smoothed those edges with a diamond sharpener until I could no longer feel the edginess in the tines There were no burrs on the comb.  Overall 4 stars, Recommended.</li>
            <li> I gave it away  and too thin for me.</li>
            <li> does what it needs to.  fit in a wallet.  the corners on the comb edge could have been rounded a lil though.</li>
            <li> good fit to my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;good metallic silver design&lt;br /&gt;but comb my hair it irritate my thin scalp pain&lt;br /&gt;less practical than general comb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;card comb- 카드빗 ㅋㅋㅋ</li>
            <li> Everyday carry. I did smooth the edges with a file because I felt they were a little sharp.</li>
            <li> Not finished well. Sharp points and edges.  More of a novelty item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. I like the way it looks. I wish there were more teeth and they were narrower and closer together.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Easy to carry in a jacket or pant pocket or in your dopp kit and the design is awesome - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I backed this product in Kickstarter and it&#x27;s been a delight to use. It&#x27;s super portable and looks wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The only knock is the steel is a little too flexible. After a day in my wallet, I have to unbend it a bit to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;But with the hairs needs combin&#x27;, Go-Comb to the rescuin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent wallet comb. Highly recommended.</li>
