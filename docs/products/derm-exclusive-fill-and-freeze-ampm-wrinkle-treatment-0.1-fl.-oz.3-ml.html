            <li>I&#x27;m not at all impressed with fill&#x27;n freeze cream.</li>
            <li>and I was impressed by what I saw.  </li>
            <li>The shipping end of it was great though!</li>
            <li>Wonderful!</li>
            <li>The product is very good, except that when you use it day and night, it runs out quicker, all in all, I will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li>Excellent product and really works</li>
            <li>wonderful product, I wish seller could offer a larger size at a reasonable price!!!!!</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>ok I guess.</li>
            <li>Ok product.</li>
            <li>Good on wrinkles not so much on bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I wear causes a significant color change patch.</li>
            <li>Its not even worth my time returning!</li>
            <li>It works, but do I put makeup first or the Derm Exclusive fill&amp; freeze first</li>
            <li>I was only able to use it 4 or 5 times.  </li>
            <li>and I used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li>Also, there wasn&#x27;t much in the tube I got.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more the amount of &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; in that little tube is miniscule!  </li>

            <li> Little tiny applicator and amount for a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Thought tube was empty.  </li>
            <li> Makes skim tight but use some waser and that helps.</li>

            <li> VERY small and worn over the make</li>
            <li> Container was almost empty and it was expensive!</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> Sorry, I didn&#x27;t notice any visible change.  </li>

            <li> What a rip off. I thought because the guy on the TV show &amp;#34;The Doctors&amp;#34; recommended it I would give it a try. The tube is 99% air - it was gone after 5 applications and I used it very sparingly.</li>
            <li> The fill and freeze cream only worked on my above eyes wrinkles.  I tried it on my under eyes wrinkles and it just &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; my wrinkles together! I&#x27;m not at all impressed with fill&#x27;n freeze cream.</li>
            <li> Good on wrinkles not so much on bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li> wonderful product, I wish seller could offer a larger size at a reasonable price!!!!!</li>
            <li> There was hardly any cream in container. Only made 10 applications</li>
            <li> Not what cranked-up to be and do.  Would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Walgreens has better product(s).</li>
            <li> It works, but do I put makeup first or the Derm Exclusive fill&amp; freeze first</li>
            <li> VERY small and worn over the make I wear causes a significant color change patch.</li>
            <li> Saw this product on tv and I was impressed by what I saw.  I received it quickly, but, unfortunately this didn&#x27;t work for me.  Also, there wasn&#x27;t much in the tube I got.  I was only able to use it 4 or 5 times.  It was the small size tube.  The shipping end of it was great though!</li>
            <li> Thought tube was empty.  Had to cut tube open to use product.  Have not noticed an improvement in skin yet.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! My daughter had given me a sample. Love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any problems with past orders until this one. I opened the box, then the seal and see photo of what came out. How disappointing! $64.85 for this? Its not even worth my time returning! I want my money credited back! Not happy!</li>
            <li> Container was almost empty and it was expensive!</li>
            <li> Works ok I guess. Leaves residue.</li>
            <li> The product is very good, except that when you use it day and night, it runs out quicker, all in all, I will continue to use it :)</li>
            <li> my last order I ordered 2 tubes one of them was empty</li>

            <li> It does nothing... and if you put it under makeup ot cracks up....bad buy</li>
            <li> Did see some improvement.  Makes skim tight but use some waser and that helps. Ok product.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any difference. Little tiny applicator and amount for a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and really works</li>
