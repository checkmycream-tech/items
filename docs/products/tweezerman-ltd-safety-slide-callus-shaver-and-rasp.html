            <li>Musta been there for a while cause it was in there real good.</li>
            <li>Awesome Callus shaver, I like that it comes with an integrated rasp, which helps me keep my hands from ripping.  </li>
            <li>Excellent value and quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the produce works perfectly for me</li>
            <li>This is the best tool I have used!  </li>
            <li>Love this tool!!!</li>
            <li>Once I figured out how to use it (a user here posted a very good tutorial)</li>
            <li>works great.  </li>
            <li>Worked great shaving off almost a 1/4 &amp;#34; of callus.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT MUST BUY</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to and looked intimating, but they worked great.</li>
            <li>Great price and as always speedy shipping by Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product works great for keeping my callouses under control.  </li>
            <li>Great tool.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I do this for the wife!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT,  WORKS GREAT AND GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>When my dainty hands get boo-boos, this amazing tool gets them all smooth again...</li>
            <li>And make sure to buy replacement blades!</li>
            <li>The rasp looks and feels real cheap</li>
            <li>Even better than the salon, honestly.</li>
            <li>I wished it cAme with more than one blade though.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE CROSSFIT.</li>
            <li>Probably works best if used for feet only.</li>
            <li>The rasp works much better than the one my wife was using.  </li>
            <li>Use with caution and you will love the results.</li>
            <li>I tried a cheap callus shaver from wallyworld and couldn&#x27;t make a dent with my feet calluses.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously my favorite self-care/beauty product right now.</li>
            <li>If you just have a mild touch up job between pedis than this is fine.</li>
            <li>Have to clean the razor every couple of swipes though.</li>
            <li>Very nonsensical and easy to use.</li>
            <li>so I find it&#x27;s hardly worth using.</li>
            <li>Second and more importantly, when switching the plastic guard between rasp and cut modes, it will trigger the blade to spring off the shaver and onto the floor.</li>
            <li>They are cheap, they send you a ton, and the results are much better if you change the blade regularly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even worth using.</li>
            <li>I just use my finger to peel them now because trying to angle this thing in the right manner to actually shave off the callus is so much work, and often not even successful or even possible with the thickness of most calluses.</li>
            <li>But this gadget lets me take care of calluses myself quickly and easily, after a shower when my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>Steam made it rust, you heard right.</li>
            <li>RETURNED IT RIGHT AWAY EVEN BEFORE MY FOOT HEALED.</li>
            <li>I have found that the product doesn&#x27;t work well on my hands when they are wet, but works perfectly when dry.  </li>
            <li>It easily snaps/slides back on and still works well to smooth out the callus.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth struggling with it the first time - then you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li>Seems like it could be better, easier, and just different.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to tackle something much grosser then look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this version as much.</li>
            <li>Cross fit tears up my hands.</li>
            <li>I also have been using the Tweezerman on my heels, since the callouses really built up during the summer when wearing sandals during vacation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fixed my callus right away.  </li>
            <li>It works really well -- gets all the dead skin and calluses off your feet quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I get to shave the callus on my foot safely and the other benefit is knowing that the shaver is sanitary.  </li>
            <li>At first I was thinking she wasn&#x27;t getting anywhere near me with a dang razor, but she insisted</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an older Tweezerman I had with no rasp.</li>
            <li>I had a callus build up on my foot and regular methods and attempts to remove it with a grinder just were not cutting it ...</li>
            <li>I have thick calluses and this removes them nicely.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of anything like this until I got a pedicure at a new place and instead of a pummus stone this woman whips out one of these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new callus shaver and am literally throwing this one in the trash.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman LTD Safety Slide Callus Shave and Rasp works great to remove thick callouses that I develop on my hands due to bar work during my Crossfit workouts.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a week and my heels are baby soft after every use.</li>
            <li>This worked very well at removing the callus by shaving it down then using the other end to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>Saving money on a pedicure is another major plus!</li>
            <li>as well becuase they get dull pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I put the clear case back on &amp; now it won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s much easier to hurt yourself and cut too deep if your feet are wet.</li>
            <li>I can see how it would be possible to cut yourself if your not careful.</li>
            <li>I have to worry about my feet half as much as I ever did before.</li>

            <li> I have to worry about my feet half as much as I ever did before.</li>
            <li> Since foot calluses are always an issue for me, a regular pedicure has long been necessary and I prefer places that use a shaver.</li>
            <li> I have nicked myself slightly a couple times, but if you are not careful, you could do some major damage and end up in the ER.</li>
            <li> The distance between the blade and smooth surface is so small that the thickness of callus this can shave is so small</li>
            <li> Also the blades go dull FAST.</li>
            <li> It shaver gets rid of the tough skin, and then you can smooth it down with the rasp at the end.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that I do still pummus after because of the ragged look the shaving gives, but I expected that anyway.</li>
            <li> you barely need to press down at all.</li>
            <li> I watched all the dead skin fly in these thin little flakes as I hardly felt a thing.</li>
            <li> First, the rasp side is really weak</li>
            <li> , I use it with my feet dry.  </li>
            <li> and I prefer using it with dry feet.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it a five star review is becuase I wish it came with a few extra blades, so you will want to purchase those</li>
            <li> I have tried it with dry and wet feet</li>
            <li> Be careful when switching out the blades.</li>
            <li> Not much to this</li>
            <li> The rasp part is OK but the cutting edge shaves very little.</li>
            <li> The blade looked way too sharp to use on my skin unless I was a construction worker.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to get a pedicure every week or every other week, so this is my solution.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> Be VERY careful with it, though.</li>
            <li> Of course it is very sharp and if you have never used one before, be careful as instructed.  </li>
            <li> This is a big negative.</li>
            <li> At least now instead of using the pummus stone daily just to keep up with my feet, I know can go days, even a couple weeks without having to worry about them or how they look</li>
            <li> However, there are no instructions and it will take you a little time to figure out how to use the shaver, how to use the rasp, and how to remove the blades (which need to be removed and cleaned after each use).</li>
            <li> Also it does take a little research to put it together correctly.</li>
            <li> I am on my feet constantly and my poor heels could always use some work to look sandal-ready.</li>
            <li> The other reason is that the other end that I refer to as the &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; is a thin piece of metal that is curved and snaps/slides into place on the handle and has fallen out a couple times during use.</li>
            <li> Worked on some really thick ones but found it hard to use on the other parts of my hand.  </li>
            <li> It also cut me so bad that my foot did not stop bleeding for a day straight.</li>
            <li> every crossfire or heavy lifter needs this!</li>
            <li> This is difficult to use and does not really work.</li>
            <li> not good with someone who has a hard time using hands.</li>
            <li> that is a SERIOUS razorblade.</li>
            <li> Obviously this was a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to pick that thin razor off the floor</li>
            <li> The shaver removes a very thin layer of the callous and I haven&#x27;t had any problems cutting the surrounding skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels awkward in my hands.</li>
            <li> This happens every time and it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from terrible, painful calluses for years!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely a terrible metal used here.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS TERRIBLE.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is difficult to use and does not really work.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out how to use it (a user here posted a very good tutorial) it works well, Be careful when switching out the blades.</li>
            <li> Local laws seem to vary regarding the use of shavers by pedicurists. Some places allow them, others don&#x27;t. Since foot calluses are always an issue for me, a regular pedicure has long been necessary and I prefer places that use a shaver. But this gadget lets me take care of calluses myself quickly and easily, after a shower when my skin is soft. It works like a charm. However, there are no instructions and it will take you a little time to figure out how to use the shaver, how to use the rasp, and how to remove the blades (which need to be removed and cleaned after each use). This is a big negative. If the manufacturer added an instruction booklet with some diagrams then this would be a five star product. But it&#x27;s worth struggling with it the first time - then you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Not much to this but it works for removing my calluses.  Haven&#x27;t changed the blade yet, but have ordered extra.</li>
            <li> works great.  saves me a lot of money on a pedicure.  its a two in one for shaving or just filing.  very great in compact size so all parts are together</li>
            <li> Worked great shaving off almost a 1/4 &amp;#34; of callus. I wished it cAme with more than one blade though. I ruined mine when I ran it into a nail that I didn&#x27;t know was stuck in my foot callus. Musta been there for a while cause it was in there real good.</li>
            <li> Well it works. sort of. Seems like it could be better, easier, and just different. It feels awkward in my hands. No directions either. If you just have a mild touch up job between pedis than this is fine. If you&#x27;re looking to tackle something much grosser then look elsewhere. Also the blades go dull FAST.</li>
            <li> The rasp part is OK but the cutting edge shaves very little.Also it does take a little research to put it together correctly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!!  NO INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE.  I TRIED THIS WAY AND THAT WAY TO NO AVAIL.  NEVER WILL I PURCHASE ANYTHING MADE IN GERMANY-THEY CAN KEEP THEIR STUFF.</li>
            <li> I tried a cheap callus shaver from wallyworld and couldn&#x27;t make a dent with my feet calluses.  This went through them like butter.  The rasp looks and feels real cheap but it works well enough.  It didn&#x27;t come with ANY extra blades.  Even the  one from wm came with a couple.  Also it doesn&#x27;t have the feel of a quality tool.  Just throw in a couple blades and I would have given it 5stars.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hands for weight lifting. This was a replacement for an older Tweezerman I had with no rasp. I don&#x27;t like this version as much. First, the rasp side is really weak so I find it&#x27;s hardly worth using. Second and more importantly, when switching the plastic guard between rasp and cut modes, it will trigger the blade to spring off the shaver and onto the floor. This happens every time and it&#x27;s annoying. It&#x27;s a pain to pick that thin razor off the floor safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to buy again, I would just get another simple model sans rasp.</li>
            <li> I knew the blade would rust eventually, BUT THE ENTIRE SHAVER RUSTED the next day after using it. It also cut me so bad that my foot did not stop bleeding for a day straight.</li>
            <li> i bought this after always tearing my callus in corssfit and what a world of pain it has saved me! every crossfire or heavy lifter needs this!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT MUST BUY</li>
            <li> Awesome Callus shaver, I like that it comes with an integrated rasp, which helps me keep my hands from ripping.  A must have for any CrossFit enthusiast.</li>
            <li> Aboutsolutely junk!!!</li>
            <li> I never got to use it. The blade looked way too sharp to use on my skin unless I was a construction worker. I put the clear case back on &amp; now it won&#x27;t come off. Obviously this was a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent value and quality.</li>
            <li> This is the same as they use at Salon. It took some getting used to and looked intimating, but they worked great. I used them about every 2 weeks. I suggest these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone who shaves their calluses as much as Italian restaurants shaves parmesean cheese. I used it once and set it in my bathroom. Month later it&#x27;s all rusted. Steam made it rust, you heard right. Absolutely a terrible metal used here.</li>
            <li> Love this tool!!! Took me a minute to figure it out, but it has done wonders for my feet.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. Very nonsensical and easy to use. Great price and as always speedy shipping by Amazon. My feet at thankful-Bring on the flip flop weather!</li>
            <li> Cross fit tears up my hands. I LOVE CROSSFIT. When my dainty hands get boo-boos, this amazing tool gets them all smooth again...before the next WOD tears me up again. Honestly, I do this for the wife!</li>
            <li> This took care of my heels in about 3 sessions what months with a pumice stone couldn&#x27;t do. It&#x27;s not for the squeamish, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to shave built-up callous on my hands from working out.  Worked on some really thick ones but found it hard to use on the other parts of my hand.  Probably works best if used for feet only.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman LTD Safety Slide Callus Shave and Rasp works great to remove thick callouses that I develop on my hands due to bar work during my Crossfit workouts.  After tearing during a workout several weeks ago I knew that I needed to do something for my hands.  This product works great for keeping my callouses under control.  The shaver removes a very thin layer of the callous and I haven&#x27;t had any problems cutting the surrounding skin.  The rasp works much better than the one my wife was using.  I have found that the product doesn&#x27;t work well on my hands when they are wet, but works perfectly when dry.  I also have been using the Tweezerman on my heels, since the callouses really built up during the summer when wearing sandals during vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the produce works perfectly for me and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works well, I use it with my feet dry.  Have to clean the razor every couple of swipes though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a crossfitter, and this is something that you must have. It shaver gets rid of the tough skin, and then you can smooth it down with the rasp at the end.</li>
            <li> This is seriously my favorite self-care/beauty product right now. I am on my feet constantly and my poor heels could always use some work to look sandal-ready. I&#x27;ve tried the ped-egg -- PSH. I can&#x27;t afford to get a pedicure every week or every other week, so this is my solution. It works really well -- gets all the dead skin and calluses off your feet quickly and easily. I use it once a week and my heels are baby soft after every use. Even better than the salon, honestly. Be VERY careful with it, though. that is a SERIOUS razorblade. I have nicked myself slightly a couple times, but if you are not careful, you could do some major damage and end up in the ER. I have tried it with dry and wet feet and I prefer using it with dry feet. I think it&#x27;s much easier to hurt yourself and cut too deep if your feet are wet. you barely need to press down at all. Use with caution and you will love the results. And make sure to buy replacement blades! They are cheap, they send you a ton, and the results are much better if you change the blade regularly.</li>
            <li> I had a callus build up on my foot and regular methods and attempts to remove it with a grinder just were not cutting it ... no pun intended. This worked very well at removing the callus by shaving it down then using the other end to smooth it out. The way the blade is mounted makes it safer so you don&#x27;t accidentally cut yourself but you should still be cautious becuase I can see how it would be possible to cut yourself if your not careful. The handle and angle of the blade helps reach the bottom of your foot easier and it has a protective cover that slides back and forth and snaps into place so you can switch back and forth from using the blade or the &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34;. The only reason I did not give it a five star review is becuase I wish it came with a few extra blades, so you will want to purchase those as well becuase they get dull pretty fast. The other reason is that the other end that I refer to as the &amp;#34;cheese grater&amp;#34; is a thin piece of metal that is curved and snaps/slides into place on the handle and has fallen out a couple times during use. It easily snaps/slides back on and still works well to smooth out the callus.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of anything like this until I got a pedicure at a new place and instead of a pummus stone this woman whips out one of these. At first I was thinking she wasn&#x27;t getting anywhere near me with a dang razor, but she insisted so I let her do her job. I watched all the dead skin fly in these thin little flakes as I hardly felt a thing. I got all the information about it from her and ordered one when I got home. I have to worry about my feet half as much as I ever did before. The only downfall is that I do still pummus after because of the ragged look the shaving gives, but I expected that anyway. At least now instead of using the pummus stone daily just to keep up with my feet, I know can go days, even a couple weeks without having to worry about them or how they look</li>
            <li> constantly had to have fumbled with pieces to change blade. not good with someone who has a hard time using hands.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from terrible, painful calluses for years!  This is the best tool I have used!  It fixed my callus right away.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Great tool.  Of course it is very sharp and if you have never used one before, be careful as instructed.  I have thick calluses and this removes them nicely. The extra rasp smooths out the edges.</li>
            <li> Works for me!!  I get to shave the callus on my foot safely and the other benefit is knowing that the shaver is sanitary.  Saving money on a pedicure is another major plus!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well. The distance between the blade and smooth surface is so small that the thickness of callus this can shave is so small it&#x27;s not even worth using. I just use my finger to peel them now because trying to angle this thing in the right manner to actually shave off the callus is so much work, and often not even successful or even possible with the thickness of most calluses. I&#x27;m looking for a new callus shaver and am literally throwing this one in the trash.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT,  WORKS GREAT AND GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> THIS WAS TERRIBLE. NO DIRECTIONS. I HAD ONE BEFORE BUT IT HAD A GUARD SO YOU COULDN&#x27;T CUT YOURSELF. I CUT MYSELF  AND HAD BLOOD EVERYWHERE. RETURNED IT RIGHT AWAY EVEN BEFORE MY FOOT HEALED.</li>
            <li> I cut too deep once. Be careful!</li>
