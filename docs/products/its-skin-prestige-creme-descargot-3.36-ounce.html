            <li> i think its a fake one，because the smell is different than before... And the cover is already open.</li>
            <li> It is ok. Its scent is very strong, but it moisturizes my face. However, I am not happy with this because I have an allergy reaction on my eye&#x27;s lids after I use it. Not much serious, but It makes me itch on one of eye lids. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is as good as I heard before. Also, the price is great!</li>
            <li> Great! Just finished the 1st jar. It lasted for 3 months. It helped my hormonal acne tremendously. hadn&#x27;t had any major breakout (or none) for the past 3 months. In addition, it has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I have a normal to combination skin type.</li>
            <li> I once bought one in Korea, and it&#x27;s the best face cream I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;this time I bought it online, it&#x27;s great and even cheaper than the one I bought from Korea. I will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> very good! I use it every day I can see my face is changing!</li>
            <li> Second time use it. Helpful for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it so much！After using it，my skin looks better！</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it is a fake product, would not buy products here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing product!. There is not dry any more after i use it. My face is so smooth now. BTW, the price i reasonable, i love it and will order it again</li>
            <li> I just got this product 5 minutes ago. I found that it was not a new one because it seemed that someone already opened it. Also I feel unsure about the date, February 27, 2015. Is that the expired date? I haven&#x27;t tried it, so I do not know how it works on me.</li>
            <li> The package is broken but the cream is useful.</li>
            <li> I Love this product, has a great smell and goes on smoothly. It does leave your face feeling a bit greasy but that does fade. When I wake up in the morning my face feels amazing. Since I started using this 5 days ago, I have received so many compliments on how my skin looks refreshed, younger and healthier.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent cream ,it moisturizes my skin , i use it daily and at the same time it clears my dark spots leaving my face with perfect tone, and radiance</li>
            <li> Not that good as everybody said. But it is okay.</li>
            <li> The production date on the bottom has problem.&lt;br /&gt;1. The production date format is different from the one which I bought before.&lt;br /&gt;2. I bought this cream on Oct. 23,2014 and shipped on Oct. 24.2014. But the production date on the bottle is Oct. 21.2014, I don&#x27;t think it is possible. If you want to say the date on the bottle is expiration date, then it has been expired.&lt;br /&gt;So there are three possible for these product:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is a fake product.&lt;br /&gt;2. The product has been expired.&lt;br /&gt;3. They changed the production date on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I want an explaination</li>
