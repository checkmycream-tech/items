            <li>Love it !!</li>
            <li>it is very nice on the skin, it is no wonder creme&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Very nice</li>
            <li>I really love this product - it&#x27;s the best face cream I&#x27;ve used to date.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 and spend a lot of time outdoors in sunny Arizona, so I need good skin care.</li>
            <li>not as good as i thought.</li>
            <li>, if there is no reaction you are good to go.</li>
            <li>A good moisturizing cream which could be used on the body too.</li>
            <li>This is a good product &amp; I will use it again.</li>
            <li>it makes your face feel good ,look bright but wrinkles do not change..</li>
            <li>Bought it because I saw that Dr. Oz said it was good for sagging skin along the jaw line.  </li>
            <li>Is good for wrinkles ....</li>
            <li>I heard about  &#x27;peptide&#x27; cr&amp;egrave;me on Dr. Oz, that it was a good firming cream, after three uses each at bedtime, I do feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that it uses stuff that&#x27;s good for your skin - grapefruit seed oil and vitamin E - as preservatives instead of parabens.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>It smells really pleasant and has a warm sensation when applied.</li>
            <li>A lovely product!</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>Of course, I think CeraVe works great, so maybe that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Nice cream that applies well and does moisturize.</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective!!!  </li>
            <li>Nice quality product and well priced.</li>
            <li>It can be a bit on the greasy side and lingers some, but I honestly don&#x27;t mind that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff, with a healthy ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>Nice texture and not greasy.</li>
            <li>The delivery time was excellent the product is still new to my skin, but</li>
            <li>This is the best Natural Peptide face cream I have found!</li>
            <li>It does moisturize my skin nicely, but as for helping with fine lines and wrinkles I see no difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works any better than CeraVe.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It is an ok cream.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>Oz advertises and think this is better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to like it and is a better texture as a result of using it.  </li>
            <li>Love this face cream</li>
            <li>I love this cream .</li>
            <li>I tried this cream for a short period of time and wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  </li>
            <li>I love this face creme.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years because it is the best.  </li>
            <li>I have a good skin to begin with, but I like to buy different creams for the face, but this one is particularly smooth and its smells so good</li>
            <li>It is light weight, has a lovely fragrance and makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cream that seems to lessen the visibility of wrinkles and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks more full, moisturized and refreshed.</li>
            <li>love this peptide...........everything you need to look younger, radiant and erase those sagging skin and fine lines, love, love, love</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know that I saw any real improvement in sagging or wrinkles, but it is a nice light weight cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s far superior to regular moisturizers and is a great treat for your skin.</li>
            <li>I got it as a night cream and was hoping for a light yet moisturizing cream that would not irritate my reactive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product and line is simply fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so comfortable and light, and my skin never feels &amp;#</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasing to me, light and unisex and not perfumey at all.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this if your looking for smooth and youthfulness.</li>
            <li>Love it, worth the money.</li>
            <li>But so far it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>To be fair my skin is very reactive so if you have mildly sensitive skin maybe it will be okay for you</li>
            <li>My original product was discontinued</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s seems to work for so many of you really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they developed it, but it is soothing and effective -- like silk on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I searched everywhere for something that I could love that much.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin that has reacted to all kinds of lotions and potions, but this stuff feels really nice on my skin and gives me no redness or breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I love the product and will order more in the future .  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is</li>
            <li>feels fine but for  a lot less money Cerave is just as good.</li>
            <li>Really softens the fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is light going on but keeps my face very moist, not greasy, all day.</li>
            <li>Worth a try, though.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>more importantly it caused my skin to burn and became red.  </li>
            <li>non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth every penny I paid for  it.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to perfumes and I am able to use this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to make an honest judgment on this product, so far I did notice some changes under my chin where the skin is loose because I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight, but I would like to give it more time to see the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light yet very hydrating and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This my wife&#x27;s,and she likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this long enough  to know if iit works or not, but for right now, my skins looks great.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating like it says!</li>
            <li>Can report more later.</li>
            <li>and it does exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I would love to send this product back, but since I no longer have the box it arrived in</li>
            <li>To be fair, I&#x27;m using a retin A cream as well, but the thing is, the retin A is too harsh on my skin</li>
            <li>I tried this Creme after reading a few reviews.and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>So far, good results in combination with other products.</li>
            <li>I was able to get back to normal in under an hour.</li>
            <li>My 64 year-old skin never feels dry, always looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>She gave it a very fair chance to work its miracle, but she sadly reports that, &amp;#34;while</li>
            <li>this cream really works.</li>
            <li>This really works for me.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>The cream is very watery but</li>
            <li>It hydrates really well without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>So, I can&#x27;t say how peptide cream would act without the other serum, but I am pleased with the results I am getting with this, the Vit C serum, and Jason&#x27;s Age Renewal cream with</li>
            <li>but I have tried other creams that worked better from the onset.</li>
            <li>The main stay of my skin care program.  </li>
            <li>I alternate several products to keep my skin well balanced, but I use this the most.  </li>
            <li>and as far as ultra-hydrating, either my skin absorbs it fast or it evaporates fast</li>
            <li>My Estheticians sells this product and he highly recommends this company.  </li>
            <li>Really high quality for the money.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Product.  </li>
            <li>The two stay mixed and still look fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Hopefully in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>But it is good for everyday use also if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty obvious that water is the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I have very see sensitive skin and so far no reaction.  </li>
            <li>Most likely will try something else and may come back to this one later.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance, this one smells like natural fruit, so doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>the cream seems to be working so far</li>
            <li>I found this cream to be very moisturizing after I do my facial peels.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive...</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>then I get soft dewy moisturized skin with no breakouts (which have plagued me since my teens).  </li>
            <li>I wish they would send it to me every month without ordering it I am 63 years young.....</li>
            <li>I am 49.5 years old</li>
            <li>so far im liking it.  </li>
            <li>I am 56 and would never go back to any other cheap brand again.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see much in the way of results, but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my skin seems very soft and dewy, and my fine lines are slightly diminished.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this and other items, friends have commented that my skin looks &#x27;fresh&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>when you get older you need the extra help you can get.</li>
            <li>I have gone back to test any new creme on my Underarm</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to be part of a daily face care regimen, but I have a hard time using this product everyday (too busy taking care of my family to pay a lot of attention to myself), so I do not feel I can fairly rate</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times so far, but</li>
            <li>In this little jar I&#x27;ve found it, and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>in mind my previous face creme was none, like most guys, so it isn&#x27;t hard to improve on that.</li>
            <li>I get ferociously dry around my nose and cheeks (probably due to sjogrens syndrome), and it really quenches that spot.  </li>

            <li> So far, good results in combination with other products.</li>
            <li> I was able to get back to normal in under an hour.</li>
            <li> My 64 year-old skin never feels dry, always looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> She gave it a very fair chance to work its miracle, but she sadly reports that, &amp;#34;while</li>
            <li> this cream really works.</li>
            <li> This really works for me.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> The cream is very watery but</li>
            <li> It hydrates really well without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t say how peptide cream would act without the other serum, but I am pleased with the results I am getting with this, the Vit C serum, and Jason&#x27;s Age Renewal cream with</li>
            <li> but I have tried other creams that worked better from the onset.</li>
            <li> The main stay of my skin care program.  </li>
            <li> I alternate several products to keep my skin well balanced, but I use this the most.  </li>
            <li> and as far as ultra-hydrating, either my skin absorbs it fast or it evaporates fast</li>
            <li> My Estheticians sells this product and he highly recommends this company.  </li>
            <li> Really high quality for the money.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Product.  </li>
            <li> The two stay mixed and still look fresh at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Hopefully in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> But it is good for everyday use also if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty obvious that water is the main ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I have very see sensitive skin and so far no reaction.  </li>
            <li> Most likely will try something else and may come back to this one later.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance, this one smells like natural fruit, so doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> the cream seems to be working so far</li>
            <li> I found this cream to be very moisturizing after I do my facial peels.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive...</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> then I get soft dewy moisturized skin with no breakouts (which have plagued me since my teens).  </li>
            <li> I wish they would send it to me every month without ordering it I am 63 years young.....</li>
            <li> I am 49.5 years old</li>
            <li> so far im liking it.  </li>
            <li> I am 56 and would never go back to any other cheap brand again.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see much in the way of results, but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my skin seems very soft and dewy, and my fine lines are slightly diminished.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this and other items, friends have commented that my skin looks &#x27;fresh&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> when you get older you need the extra help you can get.</li>
            <li> I have gone back to test any new creme on my Underarm</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to be part of a daily face care regimen, but I have a hard time using this product everyday (too busy taking care of my family to pay a lot of attention to myself), so I do not feel I can fairly rate</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times so far, but</li>
            <li> In this little jar I&#x27;ve found it, and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> in mind my previous face creme was none, like most guys, so it isn&#x27;t hard to improve on that.</li>
            <li> I get ferociously dry around my nose and cheeks (probably due to sjogrens syndrome), and it really quenches that spot.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I did not stick with it long enough</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results.  </li>
            <li> (results in flaky red dry skin)</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and i would recommend it to anyone 50+ who is thinking about improving, or at least maintaining, their appearance.</li>
            <li> Only problem for me is I broke out with little red bumps here</li>
            <li> Vit E. All in all, my dry skin need every bit of it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using very long but think I feel a pulling sensation which means it nat be tightening my loose skin.  </li>
            <li> Learned from Dr. Oz that my type of aging is loose skin.  </li>
            <li> I heard that Peptides help make your facial skin less saggy.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and find it a challenge to find a cream that doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied during the day.</li>
            <li> simply.to finish my money spent..</li>
            <li> After Rachel Perry disappeared I was crushed.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this truly works as well as I expect it to because I only use this for 2 weeks..</li>
            <li> and if I use any other product, i have breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little expensive, but well worth it</li>
            <li> I had to learn to use less than other products.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way if you exfoliate a few times a week.</li>
            <li> The product goes far because it is so thin.  </li>
            <li> However, I do see a slight improvement on my neck.</li>
            <li> Lines across my neck are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people like this, but I don&#x27;t see any improvement on my face and it is a little greasy on my face.</li>
            <li> However it is a little sticky for a few minutes after using it.</li>
            <li> I noticed firmer and softer skin after using it just a few times.</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t care for heavy foundation</li>
            <li> Peptides are all the rage now, this product takes a while to see results,however thin enough to wear under makeup.</li>
            <li> It also provides a small barrier against the elements (pollution, stress, etc), to protect my skin during the day.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time finding something that actually works and that I can use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since late March -</li>
            <li> The product is thin ....</li>
            <li> I have not seen any dramatic results after using for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an oily or uncomfortable &#x27;feel&#x27; to it on the skin, and there are no perfume scents or chemicals to worry about in this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this cream really works.</li>
            <li> This my wife&#x27;s,and she likes it very much.</li>
            <li> This product truly does what it says, I saw improvements in a couple of weeks.  Only problem for me is I broke out with little red bumps here and there so I had to lay off of it, I have very fair skin, perhaps that is why.  Don&#x27;t know, but will try what I have left as it did work.</li>
            <li> Nice cream that applies well and does moisturize. I have not seen any dramatic results after using for about 3 weeks. Worth a try, though.</li>
            <li> My Estheticians sells this product and he highly recommends this company.  I gave it a try and agree.  Really softens the fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The reviews I read on this cream were great, but my experience with it has been meh.  It&#x27;s okay.  I don&#x27;t think it works any better than CeraVe.  Of course, I think CeraVe works great, so maybe that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream that seems to lessen the visibility of wrinkles and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Your skin will drink up the moisturizing benefits.  Strangers will compliment your beautiful skin.  I know, because it happens to me.</li>
            <li> I heard that Peptides help make your facial skin less saggy.  I tried this Creme after reading a few reviews.and am very pleased.  I have used it daily for 5 + weeks and there is a noticeable difference on my jaw line.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I really love this product - it&#x27;s the best face cream I&#x27;ve used to date. My skin feels and looks more full, moisturized and refreshed. It also provides a small barrier against the elements (pollution, stress, etc), to protect my skin during the day. It doesn&#x27;t have an oily or uncomfortable &#x27;feel&#x27; to it on the skin, and there are no perfume scents or chemicals to worry about in this product. Although it says anti-aging and it definitely has an anti-aging and protective effect, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone of any age, male or female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s far superior to regular moisturizers and is a great treat for your skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a Friday, and it was in my mailbox on Monday!  I was very happy with the quick delivery.  I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times so far, but like it a lot.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see much in the way of results, but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my skin seems very soft and dewy, and my fine lines are slightly diminished.  It makes my face and neck feel moist, but not oily or greasy feeling at all.  A lovely product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reordered this item now a couple times.  It&#x27;s light yet very hydrating and reasonably priced.  Though I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance, this one smells like natural fruit, so doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this and other items, friends have commented that my skin looks &#x27;fresh&#x27;.  I&#x27;m 53 and spend a lot of time outdoors in sunny Arizona, so I need good skin care.</li>
            <li> I believe this has helped my skin over a period of time. It smells really pleasant and has a warm sensation when applied. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this truly works as well as I expect it to because I only use this for 2 weeks.. But so far it&#x27;s good it  give the moisture my face need especially for  my brown skin.</li>
            <li> the cream seems to be working so far I like it a lot. when you get older you need the extra help you can get. love it thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased this face cream for my mom because she wanted something with Peptides. She had heard they do wonders for the skin. She gave it a very fair chance to work its miracle, but she sadly reports that, &amp;#34;while it is very nice on the skin, it is no wonder creme&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> not as good as i thought.</li>
            <li> I found this cream to be very moisturizing after I do my facial peels.  But it is good for everyday use also if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Might or might not purchase again. Most likely will try something else and may come back to this one later.</li>
            <li> Felt like sunburn, thankfully I had Benadryl and Cortisone cream at home so washing the face and applying the Cortisone Creme and Benadryl I was able to get back to normal in under an hour. Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive... I have gone back to test any new creme on my Underarm, if there is no reaction you are good to go. It&#x27;s too bad it&#x27;s seems to work for so many of you really well.</li>
            <li> It is an ok cream. A good moisturizing cream which could be used on the body too.</li>
            <li> Learned from Dr. Oz that my type of aging is loose skin.  This really works for me.</li>
            <li> Great service.  Love it</li>
            <li> This is the best Natural Peptide face cream I have found! Very hydrating like it says! I love it and will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective!!!  So glad I tried this product.  Will be my staple cream. Ordering more now, I never want to with out it!!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using very long but think I feel a pulling sensation which means it nat be tightening my loose skin.  Have tried the product Dr.Oz advertises and think this is better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize my skin nicely, but as for helping with fine lines and wrinkles I see no difference.</li>
            <li> I do see a different in my skin,</li>
            <li> Great for the face.Have using it for a year.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much at all.I had to learn to use less than other products. I would recommend this. I saw peptides being discussed on Dr. OZ and went and bought this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to make an honest judgment on this product, so far I did notice some changes under my chin where the skin is loose because I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight, but I would like to give it more time to see the results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Really high quality for the money. I noticed firmer and softer skin after using it just a few times. A+.</li>
            <li> Nice quality product and well priced. I found that it improved my skin tone and I plan to continue using it.  Great customer service also!</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.  I got it as a night cream and was hoping for a light yet moisturizing cream that would not irritate my reactive skin.  This was not it.  The cream is very watery but more importantly it caused my skin to burn and became red.  I had to discontinue use.  To be fair my skin is very reactive so if you have mildly sensitive skin maybe it will be okay for you but if you are truly reactive beware.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this long enough  to know if iit works or not, but for right now, my skins looks great.</li>
            <li> So far, good results in combination with other products. Dr. Oz said to look at a photo of your mother and her mother and see where the aging took place. If there was sagging in the jawline area, you needed peptides. If there were lines on the forehead, you needed Vit C serum with Hyalouric acid. I looked and saw I needed both. So, I am using both. It seems that when I added the peptide cream to my regimine, things began to improve, even the decrease in wrinkles. So, I can&#x27;t say how peptide cream would act without the other serum, but I am pleased with the results I am getting with this, the Vit C serum, and Jason&#x27;s Age Renewal cream with Vit E. All in all, my dry skin need every bit of it.</li>
            <li> I have a good skin to begin with, but I like to buy different creams for the face, but this one is particularly smooth and its smells so good</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ll be ordering this.</li>
            <li> I love the product and will order more in the future .  Amazon delivers on time ! Very happy with my purchase ! Thank you Kim Sommer Johnson</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and find it a challenge to find a cream that doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied during the day. This is great. It is light going on but keeps my face very moist, not greasy, all day. A little goes a long way if you exfoliate a few times a week. It works well under makeup. Because I don&#x27;t care for heavy foundation I mix this with a bit of foundation to use as a tinted moisturizer. The two stay mixed and still look fresh at the end of the day. If I could buy it by the vat I would use it as a body cream.</li>
            <li> This is a good product &amp; I will use it again.</li>
            <li> feels fine but for  a lot less money Cerave is just as good.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to like it and is a better texture as a result of using it.  It can be a bit on the greasy side and lingers some, but I honestly don&#x27;t mind that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind my previous face creme was none, like most guys, so it isn&#x27;t hard to improve on that.</li>
            <li> This product and line is simply fantastic.  I don&#x27;t know how they developed it, but it is soothing and effective -- like silk on the skin.  Can&#x27;t imagine not having it in my nightly and daily skin rituals</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know that I saw any real improvement in sagging or wrinkles, but it is a nice light weight cream.  However it is a little sticky for a few minutes after using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to be part of a daily face care regimen, but I have a hard time using this product everyday (too busy taking care of my family to pay a lot of attention to myself), so I do not feel I can fairly rate how well it works (or doesn&#x27;t work) regarding it&#x27;s implied &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; claim.  It is light weight, has a lovely fragrance and makes my skin glow.  It is reasonably priced and i would recommend it to anyone 50+ who is thinking about improving, or at least maintaining, their appearance.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream I would order this again</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people like this, but I don&#x27;t see any improvement on my face and it is a little greasy on my face. However, I do see a slight improvement on my neck. Lines across my neck are less noticeable. I only use it at night now to use it up.</li>
            <li> from reviews i read, thought i would give it a try.. actually have reordered.. then added to it with a recommended collagen cream.. it does nothing for the wrinkles !!! it makes your face feel good ,look bright but wrinkles do not change.. And i didnt have deep ones when i started using.. but they are.coming now.. and i have continued to.use simply.to finish my money spent..</li>
            <li> love this peptide...........everything you need to look younger, radiant and erase those sagging skin and fine lines, love, love, love</li>
            <li> The main stay of my skin care program.  I alternate several products to keep my skin well balanced, but I use this the most.  It&#x27;s so comfortable and light, and my skin never feels &amp;#34;too small&amp;#34; for my face.  My 64 year-old skin never feels dry, always looks healthy.  After Rachel Perry disappeared I was crushed.  I searched everywhere for something that I could love that much.  In this little jar I&#x27;ve found it, and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin that has reacted to all kinds of lotions and potions, but this stuff feels really nice on my skin and gives me no redness or breakouts.  It hydrates really well without feeling greasy.  I get ferociously dry around my nose and cheeks (probably due to sjogrens syndrome), and it really quenches that spot.  I&#x27;m hoping the peptides will help prevent wrinkles as I&#x27;m moving up through my thirties, and it does seem to have lessened the wrinkles on my neck and forehead over time.  To be fair, I&#x27;m using a retin A cream as well, but the thing is, the retin A is too harsh on my skin (results in flaky red dry skin) unless I mix it with this:  then I get soft dewy moisturized skin with no breakouts (which have plagued me since my teens).  Good stuff, with a healthy ingredient list.  I&#x27;m very glad that it uses stuff that&#x27;s good for your skin - grapefruit seed oil and vitamin E - as preservatives instead of parabens.  The fragrance is pleasing to me, light and unisex and not perfumey at all.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference.  Bought it because I saw that Dr. Oz said it was good for sagging skin along the jaw line.  Did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> no change in my skin balony</li>
            <li> I just order another jar, have to tell you I love this cream . I wish they would send it to me every month without ordering it I am 63 years young..... and no wrinkles...  When this jar is gone I will be ordering another one..... thank you Dr, Oz.  For telling us about this product.....  peptide. Is good for wrinkles .... will order again and again..............!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this Product.  It absorbs quickly and is non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth every penny I paid for  it.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream for a short period of time and wasn&#x27;t really impressed.  Maybe I did not stick with it long enough but I have tried other creams that worked better from the onset.</li>
            <li> I heard about  &#x27;peptide&#x27; cr&amp;egrave;me on Dr. Oz, that it was a good firming cream, after three uses each at bedtime, I do feel and see a difference. And..... I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s!! love this!</li>
            <li> i am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I have very see sensitive skin and so far no reaction.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any results.  Hopefully in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> and as far as ultra-hydrating, either my skin absorbs it fast or it evaporates fast (I&#x27;m opting for the latter), there is nothing hydrating about this product.  The product is thin .... it&#x27;s hard to explain but it&#x27;s pretty obvious that water is the main ingredient.  I&#x27;ve been using this since late March - I see no difference in my skin and apply it twice a day.  The product goes far because it is so thin.  I&#x27;m just using it now to get rid of it.  Seems a shame to throw it out.  If anything happens between now and the bottom of the jar, I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
            <li> Peptides are all the rage now, this product takes a while to see results,however thin enough to wear under makeup.</li>
            <li> Just started using it. Can report more later. Nice texture and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Love it !! Will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this face creme.  I use it twice daily and have notice a difference in my wrinkles.  I am 56 and would never go back to any other cheap brand again.  The price is a little expensive, but well worth it</li>
            <li> This face cream is marvelous I have used this cream for sometime and it does exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. I recommend this if your looking for smooth and youthfulness. HN</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years because it is the best.  My original product was discontinued so I tried this one and I am so thankful. I am 49.5 years old and if I use any other product, i have breakouts.  With this product NONE. Love it, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very nice and is very smooth on the skin!!</li>
            <li> I do like it.  It seems to minimize wrinkles if used nightly.  I am extremely sensitive to perfumes and I am able to use this one. I have a difficult time finding something that actually works and that I can use.  Very nice</li>
            <li> The delivery time was excellent the product is still new to my skin, but so far im liking it.  Thank you for your commitment to your customer satisfaction, it is what makes customers repeat shoppers..... Diane</li>
            <li> Feels like wax on your face. Threw out jar after 2 uses</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this product works well or not. I recently purchased this creme with the intention of using it, but once it was delivered I read the ingredients and noticed Almonds were listed there. Speaking for those who have allergies it would be beneficial if products, even those topically applied, listed allergy warnings. Skin reactions will occur if I come into contact with tree nuts and peanuts. Hives, severe itching, and possibly wheezing just from a topical application. I would love to send this product back, but since I no longer have the box it arrived in I will probably give it to a friend or relative.</li>
