            <li>its a great product....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I used this cleanser, I used the Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Face Wash which cleared up a lot of my acne, but it didn&#x27;t do a great job preventing any.</li>
            <li>Works great on BODY acne.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Peroxide which makes this cleanser very effective and</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, just wish I knew about it 5 years ago, would&#x27;ve saved a ton of money!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d suggest a good toner and a really good</li>
            <li>I must say I am very satisfied.</li>

            <li>Sooooo glad they still sell on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>3-in-one exfoliating cleanser has worked better in 2 months than ProActiv  did in 6 years!  </li>
            <li>Did not make me break out, notice my face looked more radiant!</li>
            <li>First and foremost, this product is great for treating AND preventing acne!</li>
            <li>would have been nice if the bottle mentioned that if you get this on any fabric, it will turn it a pinkish or orangish color.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it works well.</li>
            <li>The price online was nice.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>now feels amazingly clean!!</li>
            <li>The original product is great, I&#x27;ve purchased this cleanser many times.</li>
            <li>As far as a scrub goes, I&#x27;m not too impressed.</li>
            <li>I have always been fortunate to have good skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best acne cleansing product that I have used</li>
            <li>cleanser is more affordable than Proactive or Murad products but as effective as they are(if not better)!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>got this stuff for free, its nice.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this because I heard that benzoyl peroxide was better than salicylic acid for these types of breakouts.</li>
            <li>-The top five inactive ingredients are now Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Petrolatum, Steareth2, and Glycerin.  </li>
            <li>I ended up ruining 2 of my favorite shirts and will be using another product.</li>
            <li>It def exfoliates and seems to be okay on my skin.  </li>
            <li>if I didn&#x27;t moisturize after, it was okay.  </li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>It was almost pimple free!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s refreshing feeling towards the end :)</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This works like magic for me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>just wanted to say i love</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice face wash at a great price.</li>
            <li>and I am happy so far.  </li>
            <li>original top five inactive ingredients were: Glycerin, Petrolatum, C12-15</li>
            <li>I really liked the price so that is what made me purchase in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I like the cool, refreshing feel after washing my face with it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>So I used Clean and Clear and what a GREAT product.</li>
            <li>I would get huge pimples on my face, so embarrassed.</li>
            <li>Otherwise way worth the money!</li>
            <li>My daughters love this cleanser and it seems to work pretty well to fight acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to all kinds of skin because it&#x27;s not a harsh product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean with no burning sensation afterwards.</li>
            <li>I use it every two days now to help prevent future breakouts and honestly, i have been pimple free for four weeks now.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>i like the mild scrubbing it gives you and what ever it has in it that leaves your face tingling after you rinse off.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of peroxide, that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you CLEAN AND CLEAR!!!</li>
            <li>I am excited to say that Clean &amp; Clear has been a miracle for me.  </li>
            <li>within two days my skin is much clearer than it has been in weeks!</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser when the weather gets hot and humid.(only around oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I first got this cleanser</li>
            <li>but it makes skin soft and cleans very well and at the same time this cleanser is good for those who has acne problem .</li>
            <li>I have had mild acne on my face since I was freshman in high school.</li>
            <li>Very rare did I have a completely clear</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Advantage</li>
            <li>It leaves my adult skin (30) feeling very refreshed and blemish free.  </li>
            <li>B002UC5ZVU Clean &amp; Clear ADVANTAGE</li>
            <li>The doctors cleared the problem but then the acne was back and strong.</li>
            <li>With the Clean and Clear Advantage Acne Control Cleanser, I see result mainly within 1-2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it in place of a proper exfoliator, but as a cleanser it works just fine - it is kinda drying though</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really cleans your face without leaving residue.  </li>
            <li>I have some pimples on my forehead and this really helps out.</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t very scrubby for an exfoliating cleanser, it does work very well</li>
            <li>And it wasn&#x27;t really working for my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product really does work.</li>
            <li>really like this this wash.  </li>
            <li>only eat organic, clean with vinegar, etc.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So I went back to basics and bought Clean &amp; Clear medicated face wash.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this awesome product to anyone who has bad ane.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin as an adult.</li>
            <li>I used it last night and when I woke up this morning, my skin was so much clearer!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little drying in the sense that I need to use a light moisturizer after washing with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to determine if this will affect anything.</li>
            <li>use daily, gently.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin I would suggest not getting this</li>
            <li>Believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to get my face clear (and stay clear), including Proactiv, Acne Free and several other name brand cleaners.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every other product, this is the only one that leaves my face free all month</li>
            <li>Have been using the Clean and Clear 10% BP stuff for a few months and it got my body acne (chest, shoulders,</li>
            <li>Came out very pasty and dry.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, if you&#x27;re not using this product in the shower be careful about getting it on your shirts!</li>
            <li>I generally use St. Ives apricot scrub to exfoliate before using this product, but the combination of the two works wonders for me.</li>
            <li>Definitely will use this for the times when I need my adult acne under control.</li>
            <li>only developed acne 10 years ago at 25,</li>
            <li>When I actually remember to use it daily, it does clear my face up after a while.</li>
            <li>and I do experience breakouts still, however it is not too strong or too weak and keeps my breakouts to a minimum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: After using it in the shower for about 3-4 months, I have to say, my acne has really gone down!</li>

            <li> I did try some other clean and clear products, but not really great compared to this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got a facial a week later and was told to ditch as it was making my face drier than dry.</li>
            <li> Other cleaners either have too much or too little.</li>
            <li> If you have a major pimple issue, I cant say if it will get rid of them all as I only get a few here and there..</li>
            <li> However, this bottle was passed its expiration date and had a large amount of questionable, clear fluid that had gathered at the bottom of the tube.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s not really working as an exfoliator; I had to buy a sugar scrub to handle the occasional bouts of flakiness my face has.</li>
            <li> In high school I had average acne and it went away for a few years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face nor cause any itching feeling.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> lower back) down, but after switching to this stuff it has made a lot of it go away, or is in the process of making it go away.</li>
            <li> this cleanser has a very sharp smell when you put it on compare to any regular cleanser</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other clensers have, so</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it&#x27;s improved the appearance of my blemishes from prior breakouts</li>
            <li> only problem it dried out my skin</li>
            <li> As an adult I&#x27;ve been experiencing breakouts from time to time due to hormones and lately a lot of stress.</li>
            <li> One day, I happened to stumble upon this little guy</li>
            <li> Which is a problem I find, with other cleaners.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> got this stuff for free, its nice.  i like the purple cap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thirty and recently started getting acne again. WHAT? So I went back to basics and bought Clean &amp; Clear medicated face wash. Cleared it up instantly. Now I wash 2-3 times a week with this and viola, no acne. It&#x27;s a little drying in the sense that I need to use a light moisturizer after washing with it. Otherwise way worth the money!</li>
            <li> Have been using the Clean and Clear 10% BP stuff for a few months and it got my body acne (chest, shoulders, lower back) down, but after switching to this stuff it has made a lot of it go away, or is in the process of making it go away. Going to use this for a while now. Great value.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  my face looks and feels better!</li>
            <li> This my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; facial cleaner. I have very acne prone skin as an adult. It has just the right amount of peroxide, that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Which is a problem I find, with other cleaners. Other cleaners either have too much or too little. I love this. I can no longer find it at any of my local stores. Sooooo glad they still sell on Amazon!</li>
            <li> the little stuff inside got in my eyes when i washed it off my face n it burn so bad, it didn&#x27;t work for me, i still got break outs.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, if you&#x27;re not using this product in the shower be careful about getting it on your shirts! I&#x27;ve accidentally bleached the collars of several shirts before I realized what was causing it. There used to be a warning about getting it on your clothes, but it has been removed for some reason.  Anyway, I have extremely oily skin and am prone to those little on-the-surface whiteheads. I decided to try this because I heard that benzoyl peroxide was better than salicylic acid for these types of breakouts. When I actually remember to use it daily, it does clear my face up after a while. As far as a scrub goes, I&#x27;m not too impressed. I generally use St. Ives apricot scrub to exfoliate before using this product, but the combination of the two works wonders for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for delicate skin as it can be rather harsh.  NOTE: The newest bottle I have (expiration 06/2016) has changed the formula. -The active ingredient is still Benzoyl Peroxide at 5% -The top five inactive ingredients are now Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Petrolatum, Steareth2, and Glycerin.  -The original top five inactive ingredients were: Glycerin, Petrolatum, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Mineral Oil, and Water -Added Xanthan Gum  It&#x27;s too early to determine if this will affect anything. The consistency seemed thicker, and it didn&#x27;t seem to make my face as tingly. This may mean it won&#x27;t be as drying for those who have an issue with that (which is quite a few people.)</li>
            <li> would have been nice if the bottle mentioned that if you get this on any fabric, it will turn it a pinkish or orangish color. I ended up ruining 2 of my favorite shirts and will be using another product.</li>
            <li> I have always been fortunate to have good skin. As an adult I&#x27;ve been experiencing breakouts from time to time due to hormones and lately a lot of stress. My usual routine has quit working and now am experiencing breakouts. I was so frustrated I decided to give this a try again and within two days my skin is much clearer than it has been in weeks! Definitely will use this for the times when I need my adult acne under control.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to get my face clear (and stay clear), including Proactiv, Acne Free and several other name brand cleaners.  I am excited to say that Clean &amp; Clear has been a miracle for me.  I wanted something with Benzoyl Peroxide because that seems to work the best for me.  I use this once a day, in the morning (with my Olay Professionals scrubber).  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and within a few days I noticed a difference.  I highly recommend this cleanser, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have had mild acne on my face since I was freshman in high school. I felt like I had tried every facial cleanser known to man, but none of them seemed to work. One day, I happened to stumble upon this little guy and I thought I would give it a try. To my surprise, my face cleared up within 3 days and I have been a customer ever since. This is by far the best acne cleansing product that I have used and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this with my Clarisonic face wash thing and I am happy so far.  It def exfoliates and seems to be okay on my skin.  I really liked the price so that is what made me purchase in the first place.  I will continue with it.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my secret... If you look in my shower you&#x27;ll find this even though I&#x27;ll never admit to using it!&lt;br /&gt;I only developed acne 10 years ago at 25, and it&#x27;s totally hormonal. I&#x27;ve tried every other product, this is the only one that leaves my face free all month long.&lt;br /&gt;I only eat organic, clean with vinegar, etc.&lt;br /&gt;But I just can&#x27;t deal with acne so this is my one mainstream product.</li>
            <li> Since it took forever to arrive do to weather my face now feels amazingly clean!!</li>
            <li> This product changed the color of my towel. I got a facial a week later and was told to ditch as it was making my face drier than dry.</li>
            <li> Best of both worlds.. micro beads for blackheads and 5% benzoyl peroxide to kill bacteria. Overall, a nice face wash at a great price.</li>
            <li> Very good face cleanser/ scrub. I like that the scrubby things feel like sand. I don&#x27;t think they are those horrible tiny micro plastic pieces that go down the drain &amp; get into the environment.</li>
            <li> It really cleans your face without leaving residue.  I was seeing improvement after just one week of routine use.  My face looked less dull.  It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other clensers have, so if I didn&#x27;t moisturize after, it was okay.  Alas, it was confiscated at the airport because of the size.  I dound this at a local store and I still use it.</li>
            <li> I have some pimples on my forehead and this really helps out. i had no pimples the next day. it worked over night. I use it every two days now to help prevent future breakouts and honestly, i have been pimple free for four weeks now. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST for my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I have combination, both oily and dry :( both which causes pimples.&lt;br /&gt;I would always have at least one pimple.. Very rare did I have a completely clear face.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every night in the shower and moisturise with a non oily cream to stop my face from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;And I must say I am very satisfied. I did try some other clean and clear products, but not really great compared to this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I have skipped a night a few times, and no pimples. However after 2 days I did get one. So every night for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely give it a go. If you have a major pimple issue, I cant say if it will get rid of them all as I only get a few here and there..But stick with it and see how you go.</li>
            <li> Bought It at Rite Aid and it works great</li>
            <li> It gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Love this brand. I had bad acne for a the last couple of years. Went to a doctor and all. The doctors cleared the problem but then the acne was back and strong. I would get huge pimples on my face, so embarrassed. So I used Clean and Clear and what a GREAT product. My pimples were gone and my face was cleared again. Saved myself a doctors visit, copayment and medication copayment with this product. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face nor cause any itching feeling. I LOVE IT! Thank you CLEAN AND CLEAR!!!</li>
            <li> After years of using ProActiv, I finally decided to stop wasting my money and find a cheaper alternative for skin care.  Clean &amp; Clear Advantage 3-in-one exfoliating cleanser has worked better in 2 months than ProActiv  did in 6 years!  It leaves my adult skin (30) feeling very refreshed and blemish free.  This product is amazing, just wish I knew about it 5 years ago, would&#x27;ve saved a ton of money!</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t very scrubby for an exfoliating cleanser, it does work very well and it&#x27;s definitely helping to make an impact on my acne. I wouldn&#x27;t use it in place of a proper exfoliator, but as a cleanser it works just fine - it is kinda drying though so I&#x27;d suggest a good toner and a really good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using it in the shower for about 3-4 months, I have to say, my acne has really gone down! I get a few pimples under my jaw and on my neck but I don&#x27;t usually cleanse there. Still, it&#x27;s not really working as an exfoliator; I had to buy a sugar scrub to handle the occasional bouts of flakiness my face has. But for clearing acne it definitely does its job.</li>
            <li> I bought this product yesterday at Walmart and wanted to make a review about it.  This product is a miracle worker!  I have been using the advantage foaming acne wash  [[ASIN:B002UC5ZVU Clean &amp; Clear ADVANTAGE 3-In-1 Foaming Acne Wash , 8 Ounce]]  And it wasn&#x27;t really working for my skin.  I dcided to try this acne wash.  I used it last night and when I woke up this morning, my skin was so much clearer!  It was almost pimple free!  I would reccomend this awesome product to anyone who has bad ane.</li>
            <li> Works well. I&#x27;m impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> This product really does work.I use it everyday and it&#x27;s improved the appearance of my blemishes from prior breakouts and I mean prior because I have not had as may breakouts for 6 months already. Awesome product and it&#x27;s refreshing feeling towards the end :)</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser when the weather gets hot and humid.(only around oily T-zone. Not around eyes)&lt;br /&gt;Or, when I am lacking sleep and know that the troubles are going to show on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Contains Benz. Peroxide which makes this cleanser very effective and quick.&lt;br /&gt;And I like the cool, refreshing feel after washing my face with it.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is more affordable than Proactive or Murad products but as effective as they are(if not better)!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this cleanser to others.</li>
            <li> Love it...its a great product....Its no proactiv and I do experience breakouts still, however it is not too strong or too weak and keeps my breakouts to a minimum.</li>
            <li> This is okay. I didn&#x27;t see anything evidence that it actually worked. It smells nice and it works well. But I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. The price online was nice. It shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Came out very pasty and dry. Probably expired but has no expectation date.</li>
            <li> Love it. Have been using it everyday for months and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> use daily, gently. with a combination of a facial brush and you will notice excellent improvement; if you have problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Made me break out even worse. Made my face feel Itchy because I was allergic. hate it. If you have sensitive skin I would suggest not getting this</li>
            <li> After about four days using it my acne started to go away. After about 2 weeks my acne was almost gone, just a one or two&lt;br /&gt;the only problem it dried out my skin</li>
            <li> I use this product every night.. perfect amount of medication for my skin, and just the right amount of exfoliation as well. I always buy this one!</li>
            <li> really like this this wash.  i like the mild scrubbing it gives you and what ever it has in it that leaves your face tingling after you rinse off.  i use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all for years and had negative reactions including irritation, dry skin, WORSE acne, and bumps. This works like magic for me. Kills the germs, sloughs the skin, and hydrates!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing! Did not make me break out, notice my face looked more radiant! Love it. Note: I don&#x27;t not have severe acne just hormonal flares</li>
            <li> My daughters love this cleanser and it seems to work pretty well to fight acne.</li>
            <li> I am 16 and I have oily skin. First and foremost, this product is great for treating AND preventing acne! The longer I use this wash, the less breakouts I get. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I first got this cleanser but it amazed me the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used this cleanser, I used the Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Face Wash which cleared up a lot of my acne, but it didn&#x27;t do a great job preventing any. Also, it took the Neutrogena cleanser about 4 days to reduce the size of a pimple. With the Clean and Clear Advantage Acne Control Cleanser, I see result mainly within 1-2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to all kinds of skin because it&#x27;s not a harsh product. It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean with no burning sensation afterwards.</li>
            <li> Only face wash that works !</li>
            <li> this cleanser has a very sharp smell when you put it on compare to any regular cleanser but it makes skin soft and cleans very well and at the same time this cleanser is good for those who has acne problem .</li>
            <li> Works great on BODY acne. I would not recommend this for your face it is much to harsh. It has burned my face.</li>
            <li> The original product is great, I&#x27;ve purchased this cleanser many times. However, this bottle was passed its expiration date and had a large amount of questionable, clear fluid that had gathered at the bottom of the tube. I prefer not to use expired or potentially dangerous products on my skin, especially my face.</li>
            <li> In high school I had average acne and it went away for a few years. Recently with stress I have bad breakouts again and thus clears it up right away and helps keep it away as well</li>
            <li> i dont know that to write for the review. just wanted to say i love it&#x27;s great. recommend it to others.</li>
