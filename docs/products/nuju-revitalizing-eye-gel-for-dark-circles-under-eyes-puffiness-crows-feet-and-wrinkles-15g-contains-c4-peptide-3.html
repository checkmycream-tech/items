            <li>I have always had a huge problem with discoloration and this has helped tremendously!!</li>
            <li>Love this eye gel because it tightens and smooth.</li>
            <li>I’ll break this down the best</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, feels good, soaks right in!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 started to notice some fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li>I am 36 and I started to get fine wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right off the bat I noticed that this product claims to be paraben free, but has a number of contradicting Ingredients: Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben.</li>
            <li>Just going off of easily available information.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with this purchase and feel that this product was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>..seems to smooth + brighten the eye area.</li>
            <li>I use it every night before I go to bed to stay bag free.</li>
            <li>The aroma is of light cucumbers.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to try this after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>This is one is unique, I do like the way the gel feels, smells, &amp; does reduce the severity of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I love that the gel is really smooth and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>This is a light textured eye cream that goes on smooth and is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>It feels great, it cools and soothes under your eyes, and it has gotten rid of dark circles or diminish fine lines.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes really feels more hydrated and</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are diminishing and more important my dark circles and puffy eyes are looking a lot better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eye areas and so many eye gels sting and burn.</li>
            <li>Only been using this for 5 days, but the difference around my eyes already is amazing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I thought did a nice job, but never in my life have I used an eye treatment that I could actually FEEL the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li>In fact, it has created a very positive effect.</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t really give it a true rating yet.</li>
            <li>I just got all hyped up with the great reviews on this skincare line that I bought a large dark spot corrector bottle, anti-aging moisturizer cream and this eye gel for more than $200 total.  </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients and it feels great underneath my eyes - not anything like the other skin tightening concoctions that I have tried.</li>
            <li>First eye gel I&#x27;ve used as I am rounding 40 and noticing changes.</li>
            <li>will definitely keep using it in hopes of seeing more.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results so far and because the gel will support natural production of collagen the skin around my eyes looks younger.</li>
            <li>The bags were reduced the first week of use.</li>
            <li>Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone (naturally occurring bioflavinoid, often used for under eye circle treatments, helps combat free radical damage and inflammation);</li>
            <li>(liquid silicone, creates a temporary skin plumpness)din Methyl Chalcone (naturally occurring bioflavinoid, often used for under eye circle treatments, helps combat free radical damage and inflammation);</li>
            <li>I noticed results with first application.</li>
            <li>This product delivers immediate results with noticeable results within the first week of use.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different eye creams</li>
            <li>but I can tell you the technology is superior in a few locations throughout the country.</li>
            <li>I have only used this eye gel a couple of time so there has been a good different effect on the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Dipeptide-2 (effective skin conditioner, believed to help improve lymphatic circulation and so often found in under eye cream to reduce dark circles);</li>
            <li>Dipeptide-2 (effective skin conditioner, believed to help improve lymphatic circulation and so often found in under eye cream to reduce dark circles);</li>
            <li>but I could certainly see firmer skin tone around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as advertized nor does it say much about sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smooth fast absorbing hydrating, clean scented easy to use non irritating on my eyes.</li>
            <li>In addition, the cream had no instructions for use in the package, so I had to guess how often to apply it, and how much to use.</li>
            <li>Non ablative laser (ultrasound) which I paid a reasonable price for will take care of that problem.</li>
            <li>Revatilizing Eye Gel really gets results fast.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this light weight eye gel.</li>
            <li>This eye gel really delivers.</li>
            <li>It also has the faintest of scents that is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Last thing it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>And it is gentle.</li>
            <li>I purchased NuJu mainly because of the positive reviews but my expectations from any results were conservative.</li>
            <li>I’ve only used it for one day, and the gel is pleasant enough to use, but what I want to bring up is the disparity between the ingredients that are advertised for Nuju Revitalizing Eye Gel, and the actual ingredients.</li>
            <li>I noticed that in the morning I get more dark circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>Together with the fine lines it makes me look more tired.</li>
            <li>I noticed less puffiness and more tightening around the eyes.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel refreshed and those lines under my eyes seem to appear less prominent.</li>
            <li>I love the slight aroma of cucumbers.</li>
            <li>I love the eye gel because it has me looking wide awake and alive in the morning.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i have major bags under my eyes, my dad had major crepe paper eyes with the huge bags under his from the time he was in his early forties.  </li>
            <li>my fine lines and puffy eyes and dark circles are really improving.</li>
            <li>As a busy mom who doesn’t get much sleep</li>
            <li>okay if one does not use it everyday.</li>
            <li>The rare nights that I forget to apply the gel my eyes are back to their normal puffiness</li>
            <li>You can pair it with pretty much any aye cream for extra care.</li>
            <li>Due to this I have tremendous bags under my eyes and some slight wrinkling which I am sure is caused by the bags.</li>
            <li>Working well on my fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li>My eyes are VERY sensitive</li>
            <li>As usual I&#x27;m always trying something new, this time it was because I wasn&#x27;t fully satisfied with what I was using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had bags under my eyes all my life, and this is the first product that has actually made a difference.</li>
            <li>Overall worked pretty well</li>
            <li>Most products I have tried in the past have taken some time to take effect but not with this one.</li>
            <li>After all the only bags a women wants is shopping bags!</li>
            <li>It is less dry and more vibrant looking.</li>
            <li>The eye gel is made with natural and organic ingredients and does not contain parabens and sulfates.</li>
            <li>Interest:&lt;br /&gt;Ceramide 3 (part of naturally occurring skin structure, it helps retain moisture, regulates cellular barrier repair); Sphingolipids (naturally occurring in the body, it functions as protection for cells against environmental factors);</li>
            <li>Nuju works like a charm on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Personally I think this will be useful for moisturizing, and perhaps a temporary rejuvenated look, but it doesn’t seem to pack enough punch to tackle my under eye circles.</li>
            <li>; Triethanolamine ( ph adjuster *a “moderate concern” level ingredient for potential toxicity*);</li>
            <li>; Triethanolamine ( ph adjuster *a “moderate concern” level ingredient for potential toxicity*);</li>
            <li>The area around my eyes is extremely sensitive and easily irritated and this product did not cause a negative effect.</li>
            <li>As someone who suffers from chronic insomnia (and the lovely, inescapable dark raccoon circle eyes that come with it), I was pretty excited to try this.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days and my eyes definitely feel better.</li>
            <li>Super silky and hydrating around the eye area, you will see by the end of the first bottle how dark circles have improved dramatically and you will feel less bags every time you use it.</li>
            <li>This could be a major problem for anyone with allergies or sensitivities.</li>
            <li>Dark circles are less prominent.</li>
            <li>I should see maximum results in the near future.</li>
            <li>I barely sleep.</li>
            <li>better than some other ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Big fan of line as it&#x27;s truly natural and overall we&#x27;ll priced.</li>
            <li>One final general note.</li>
            <li>Generally only high concentrations have substantial effects on skin, but thought to help reduce swelling and inflammation among other things)&lt;br</li>

            <li> I just got all hyped up with the great reviews on this skincare line that I bought a large dark spot corrector bottle, anti-aging moisturizer cream and this eye gel for more than $200 total.  </li>
            <li> All natural ingredients and it feels great underneath my eyes - not anything like the other skin tightening concoctions that I have tried.</li>
            <li> First eye gel I&#x27;ve used as I am rounding 40 and noticing changes.</li>
            <li> will definitely keep using it in hopes of seeing more.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results so far and because the gel will support natural production of collagen the skin around my eyes looks younger.</li>
            <li> The bags were reduced the first week of use.</li>
            <li> Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone (naturally occurring bioflavinoid, often used for under eye circle treatments, helps combat free radical damage and inflammation);</li>
            <li> (liquid silicone, creates a temporary skin plumpness)din Methyl Chalcone (naturally occurring bioflavinoid, often used for under eye circle treatments, helps combat free radical damage and inflammation);</li>
            <li> I noticed results with first application.</li>
            <li> This product delivers immediate results with noticeable results within the first week of use.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different eye creams</li>
            <li> but I can tell you the technology is superior in a few locations throughout the country.</li>
            <li> I have only used this eye gel a couple of time so there has been a good different effect on the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Dipeptide-2 (effective skin conditioner, believed to help improve lymphatic circulation and so often found in under eye cream to reduce dark circles);</li>
            <li> Dipeptide-2 (effective skin conditioner, believed to help improve lymphatic circulation and so often found in under eye cream to reduce dark circles);</li>
            <li> but I could certainly see firmer skin tone around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as advertized nor does it say much about sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smooth fast absorbing hydrating, clean scented easy to use non irritating on my eyes.</li>
            <li> In addition, the cream had no instructions for use in the package, so I had to guess how often to apply it, and how much to use.</li>
            <li> Non ablative laser (ultrasound) which I paid a reasonable price for will take care of that problem.</li>
            <li> Revatilizing Eye Gel really gets results fast.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this light weight eye gel.</li>
            <li> This eye gel really delivers.</li>
            <li> It also has the faintest of scents that is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Last thing it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> And it is gentle.</li>
            <li> I purchased NuJu mainly because of the positive reviews but my expectations from any results were conservative.</li>
            <li> I’ve only used it for one day, and the gel is pleasant enough to use, but what I want to bring up is the disparity between the ingredients that are advertised for Nuju Revitalizing Eye Gel, and the actual ingredients.</li>
            <li> I noticed that in the morning I get more dark circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> Together with the fine lines it makes me look more tired.</li>
            <li> I noticed less puffiness and more tightening around the eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel refreshed and those lines under my eyes seem to appear less prominent.</li>
            <li> I love the slight aroma of cucumbers.</li>
            <li> I love the eye gel because it has me looking wide awake and alive in the morning.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i have major bags under my eyes, my dad had major crepe paper eyes with the huge bags under his from the time he was in his early forties.  </li>
            <li> my fine lines and puffy eyes and dark circles are really improving.</li>
            <li> As a busy mom who doesn’t get much sleep</li>
            <li> okay if one does not use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The rare nights that I forget to apply the gel my eyes are back to their normal puffiness</li>
            <li> You can pair it with pretty much any aye cream for extra care.</li>
            <li> Due to this I have tremendous bags under my eyes and some slight wrinkling which I am sure is caused by the bags.</li>
            <li> Working well on my fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li> My eyes are VERY sensitive</li>
            <li> As usual I&#x27;m always trying something new, this time it was because I wasn&#x27;t fully satisfied with what I was using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bags under my eyes all my life, and this is the first product that has actually made a difference.</li>
            <li> Overall worked pretty well</li>
            <li> Most products I have tried in the past have taken some time to take effect but not with this one.</li>
            <li> After all the only bags a women wants is shopping bags!</li>
            <li> It is less dry and more vibrant looking.</li>
            <li> The eye gel is made with natural and organic ingredients and does not contain parabens and sulfates.</li>
            <li> Interest:&lt;br /&gt;Ceramide 3 (part of naturally occurring skin structure, it helps retain moisture, regulates cellular barrier repair); Sphingolipids (naturally occurring in the body, it functions as protection for cells against environmental factors);</li>
            <li> Nuju works like a charm on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Personally I think this will be useful for moisturizing, and perhaps a temporary rejuvenated look, but it doesn’t seem to pack enough punch to tackle my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> ; Triethanolamine ( ph adjuster *a “moderate concern” level ingredient for potential toxicity*);</li>
            <li> ; Triethanolamine ( ph adjuster *a “moderate concern” level ingredient for potential toxicity*);</li>
            <li> The area around my eyes is extremely sensitive and easily irritated and this product did not cause a negative effect.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from chronic insomnia (and the lovely, inescapable dark raccoon circle eyes that come with it), I was pretty excited to try this.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days and my eyes definitely feel better.</li>
            <li> Super silky and hydrating around the eye area, you will see by the end of the first bottle how dark circles have improved dramatically and you will feel less bags every time you use it.</li>
            <li> This could be a major problem for anyone with allergies or sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Dark circles are less prominent.</li>
            <li> I should see maximum results in the near future.</li>
            <li> I barely sleep.</li>
            <li> better than some other ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Big fan of line as it&#x27;s truly natural and overall we&#x27;ll priced.</li>
            <li> One final general note.</li>
            <li> Generally only high concentrations have substantial effects on skin, but thought to help reduce swelling and inflammation among other things)&lt;br</li>

            <li> Generally only high concentrations have substantial effects on skin, but thought to help reduce swelling and inflammation among other things)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And what is really important that it does not bother my sensitive eyes and the thin skin around and under my eyes unlike other eye creams I used.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from under eye baggage.</li>
            <li> The aroma of cucumbers that this eye gel has relaxes me every evening after a long day.</li>
            <li> I have used a gazillion eye products way more expensive than this with less results.</li>
            <li> However, with mostly middle aged oily skin with some dry patches and definitively sagging skin, I would say this eye cream works for me in ways other eye creams have not.</li>
            <li> I am a male in my 50s with hereditary puffy eyes and Raccoon dark circles</li>
            <li> My eyes were less puffy and the lines seemed less apparent.</li>
            <li> Due to ageing - the skin all around my eyes was so dry</li>
            <li> You only need a small drop so this bottle will go a long way.</li>
            <li> and it felt so rough.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to anyone that ask what&#x27;s my secret.</li>
            <li> It had absolutely no effect on my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of other eye creams but the NuJu</li>
            <li> The only way I can get rid of them is to use green tea bags that takes about 20 minutes to half an hour for each eye!</li>
            <li> Not too thick, not too thin but just right.</li>
            <li> Nope, this did nothing for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks of applying the crème each morning under my eyes I began to see the dark circles lighten up</li>
            <li> My dark baggy under eye puffs are gone.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to reduce the appearance of under-eye dark circles.  </li>
            <li> you skew the ratings unfairly and two you don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, thinking it was just another serum, but this one works very well.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely puffy eyes just about every morning!</li>
            <li> Dark circles less, skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks and see a slight improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wake up every day now with less and less of a bagginess and</li>
            <li> They are flatter and much less pronounced.</li>
            <li> My eyes look less lined.</li>
            <li> It has also helped a little with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I still don’t get enough sleep but at least my eyes are not showing it anymore!</li>
            <li> The little lines around my eyes are disappearing and those obnoxious bags are gone.</li>
            <li> those little wrinkles are fading too.</li>
            <li> but if you have fatty tissue under your puffs don&#x27;t expect it to disappear.</li>
            <li> After using the eye gel for a few days I already saw results.</li>
            <li> It also cleared up a few clogged pores under my eye which was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> This product also claims to have time released retinol, which is notably missing from the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract (Green Tea extract.</li>
            <li> Increases collagen production when paired with Palmitoyl-Oligopeptide, which is not listed as an ingredient for this product); Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract (Green Tea extract.</li>

            <li> I bought this to firm up the crows feet around my under eye area.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past month and have seen a noticeable improvement in the bags that I typically have underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m generally dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> And because it has a gel like texture, you need very little, dab under eyes, let it sink in.</li>
            <li> I just need a small drop and dap it into my skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Well worry no more with NuJu Revitalizing Eye Gel</li>
            <li> Overall a disappointment for the money.</li>
            <li> no dryness all day in the CO mountain dry &amp; cold weather, even skiing.</li>
            <li> a look that is inherited and not welcome</li>
            <li> and I have been using this eye product for approximately one month.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this product to help me try to find a cure to my ‘tired eyes’.</li>
            <li> This product made me under eye worse.</li>
            <li> I woke up with the puffiness gone and my discoloration was not as bad as previous nights.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I ordered this product at how after one application my terribly puff discolored bags vanished overnight.</li>
            <li> If you are wary of purchasing this product because of this claim, I can say I will be requesting a refund.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, all products did not deliver.</li>
            <li> so I would say I qualify as possibly one of the worst cases in the reviews.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Have you ever woke up in the morning and been shocked to see what looked like cotton balls where your eyes should be!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used the product diligently for about a month, with no visible results. In addition, the cream had no instructions for use in the package, so I had to guess how often to apply it, and how much to use. Needless to say, I&#x27;m generally dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two months. It had absolutely no effect on my dark circles. If you are wary of purchasing this product because of this claim, I can say I will be requesting a refund. It also did not help with wrinkles, for a product so pricey.</li>
            <li> Only been using this for 5 days, but the difference around my eyes already is amazing. I am using this with hylauronic acid drops &amp; the combo is great. Dark circles less, skin tighter/less wrinkles &amp; eyes just look so much more alert. Big plus is eyes stay hydrated &amp; no dryness all day in the CO mountain dry &amp; cold weather, even skiing. I have used a gazillion eye products way more expensive than this with less results. I will keep using this product. Very exciting!!!  It&#x27;s been over 1.5 months &amp; I&#x27;m still just as happy with this product! Great stuff.  I will continue to use this cream.</li>
            <li> First eye gel I&#x27;ve used as I am rounding 40 and noticing changes. Working well on my fine lines and dark circles. Have nothing to compare as I don&#x27;t jump around brands. I am happy with this eye gel, lots of compliments from friends I haven&#x27;t seen in years. Big fan of line as it&#x27;s truly natural and overall we&#x27;ll priced.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to try this after reading the reviews.  Regretfully, after spending the $$$ for the product, NO results seen whatsoever after 3 weeks.  I&#x27;ll finish using it, but cannot recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> i have major bags under my eyes, my dad had major crepe paper eyes with the huge bags under his from the time he was in his early forties.  a look that is inherited and not welcome (i swear i got my genes from the genetic sludge pool).  this product is really good, reduces the puffy bags under my eyes, and no crepe -y look.  love it.</li>
            <li> My husband is in love with this cream when he looks at me now he smiles more I love my results I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Nope, this did nothing for my dark circles.  It seems NuJu products are not for me.  I am Asian ( well, Filipino, Spanish, Chinese).  I just got all hyped up with the great reviews on this skincare line that I bought a large dark spot corrector bottle, anti-aging moisturizer cream and this eye gel for more than $200 total.  Unfortunately, all products did not deliver. What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> better than some other ones I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I am a male in my 50s with hereditary puffy eyes and Raccoon dark circles so I would say I qualify as possibly one of the worst cases in the reviews. I purchased NuJu mainly because of the positive reviews but my expectations from any results were conservative. After two weeks of applying the crème each morning under my eyes I began to see the dark circles lighten up and I hope with the addition of proper diet, exercise and sleep I should see maximum results in the near future. Now for the puffiness under my eyes.......you might see some tightening of the skin but if you have fatty tissue under your puffs don&#x27;t expect it to disappear. Non ablative laser (ultrasound) which I paid a reasonable price for will take care of that problem. Please do not ask me were I went because I do not want to endorse the doctor but I can tell you the technology is superior in a few locations throughout the country. Nuju  is one of the best eye gels I have used for the price.</li>
            <li> I got a discount to review this product and I am glad I got the opportunity.  I noticed an immediate difference when I used this product.  My eyes were less puffy and the lines seemed less apparent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks and see a slight improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using it in hopes of seeing more. Can&#x27;t really give it a true rating yet.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream makes my eyes feel nice and moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This eye gel works wonders. As a busy mom who doesn’t get much sleep I noticed that in the morning I get more dark circles and puffy eyes. Together with the fine lines it makes me look more tired. I have used a lot of other eye creams but the NuJu Revatilizing Eye Gel really gets results fast. After using the eye gel for a few days I already saw results. My fine lines are diminishing and more important my dark circles and puffy eyes are looking a lot better. I use the gel in the morning and in the evening. It is very easy to apply with the dispenser. I just need a small drop and dap it into my skin around my eyes. The eye gel is made with natural and organic ingredients and does not contain parabens and sulfates. You only need a small drop so this bottle will go a long way. I love that the gel is really smooth and absorbs fast. It does not leave the skin sticky or greasy. And what is really important that it does not bother my sensitive eyes and the thin skin around and under my eyes unlike other eye creams I used. The skin around my eyes really feels more hydrated and my fine lines and puffy eyes and dark circles are really improving. I am happy with the results so far and because the gel will support natural production of collagen the skin around my eyes looks younger. I still don’t get enough sleep but at least my eyes are not showing it anymore! This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bags under my eyes all my life, and this is the first product that has actually made a difference. The bags were reduced the first week of use. Ive also noticed that the wrinkles on the side of my eyes are starting to fade. It also cleared up a few clogged pores under my eye which was an added bonus. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again because of the way it reduces puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have only used this eye gel a couple of time so there has been a good different effect on the wrinkles. It&#x27;s a smooth fast absorbing hydrating, clean scented easy to use non irritating on my eyes. I use it twice a day and I&#x27;m loving it so far. I&#x27;m 42 started to notice some fine lines under my eyes so I needed something and after reading and comparing a ton of eye gel ingredients and prices per oz this was in my top 3.</li>
            <li> As someone who suffers from chronic insomnia (and the lovely, inescapable dark raccoon circle eyes that come with it), I was pretty excited to try this. I’ve only used it for one day, and the gel is pleasant enough to use, but what I want to bring up is the disparity between the ingredients that are advertised for Nuju Revitalizing Eye Gel, and the actual ingredients. I’ll break this down the best I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat I noticed that this product claims to be paraben free, but has a number of contradicting Ingredients: Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben. This could be a major problem for anyone with allergies or sensitivities. This product also claims to have time released retinol, which is notably missing from the ingredient list. I’ve listed almost every ingredient in this eye cream, and its function, below. Personally I think this will be useful for moisturizing, and perhaps a temporary rejuvenated look, but it doesn’t seem to pack enough punch to tackle my under eye circles. Because of the disparity between advertised ingredients and the actual, I’m giving this two stars. Keep in mind I don’t claim to be a scientist. Just going off of easily available information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract (Skin Conditioner); Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) extract (thought to increase blood flow and aid in “congestion” under the skin); Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract (Green Tea extract.

Increases collagen production when paired with Palmitoyl-Oligopeptide, which is not listed as an ingredient for this product); Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract (Green Tea extract. Generally only high concentrations have substantial effects on skin, but thought to help reduce swelling and inflammation among other things)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else:&lt;br /&gt;Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate (emollient and skin conditioner); Propylene Glycol  (aids with shelf stability); Carbomer (thickener/controls gel consistency); Polysorbate 20 (emulsifier/solubilizer); Triethanolamine ( ph adjuster *a “moderate concern” level ingredient for potential toxicity*); Hydroxypropyl Methycellulose  (used for sustained release of ingredients); Ethylhexyl (lubricant/makes skin look soft and smooth); Cocoate (derived from coconut oil, skin conditioner); Steareth-20 (surfactant and emulsifier, often found in eye cream); Butylene Glycol (solvent and used to make creams more easily spreadable); Phenoxyethanol (Chemical preservative); Titanium Dioxide CI 77891 (white pigment and sunscreen); Cyclomethicone, Dimethiconol, Phenyl Trimethicone  (liquid silicone, creates a temporary skin plumpness)din Methyl Chalcone (naturally occurring bioflavinoid, often used for under eye circle treatments, helps combat free radical damage and inflammation); Dipeptide-2 (effective skin conditioner, believed to help improve lymphatic circulation and so often found in under eye cream to reduce dark circles); Palymitoyl Tetrapeptide-7 (helps reduce inflammation.

            <li> This is my second purchase of this light weight eye gel. It has definitely smoothed the fragile skin around my eyes and I find it&#x27;s brightening the area around my eyes as well. By day 5 both my eyes were physically &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;firmer&amp;#34;. You could literally feel the difference with your fingers. I&#x27;ve used plenty of eye creams before that I thought did a nice job, but never in my life have I used an eye treatment that I could actually FEEL the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have product.</li>
            <li> I am 36 and I started to get fine wrinkles around my eyes. I asked for a sample and was told it would take 4 weeks for me to notice a difference. I noticed a difference in 2 weeks!!! I have only been using it for two weeks but the skin around my eyes already reflects a difference in texture. It is less dry and more vibrant looking. I get that more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; look now that I been using this product. It&#x27;s done great things for my discoloration under my eyes as-well. Dark circles are less prominent. I am very happy with this product and can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term effects.</li>
            <li> This eye gel really delivers. All around this brands products are effective. I bought the whole line a few weeks ago and have just made it around to leaving a review. I love the eye gel because it has me looking wide awake and alive in the morning. Even if I am not well rested I appear to be. The little lines around my eyes are disappearing and those obnoxious bags are gone. What more can I say besides it works!</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this product in the mail I applied it that night under my eyes. I woke up with the puffiness gone and my discoloration was not as bad as previous nights. After a week of using this product my discoloration is gone along with the bags. I am really satisfied with this purchase and feel that this product was well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Have tried A lot of eye creams over 30 years. This is one is unique, I do like the way the gel feels, smells, &amp; does reduce the severity of wrinkles. I can tell a difference when I wear it. I am a product junkie and I am used to using high end products, and this one is the best eye product I have ever used. I was astonished! This is the best for dehydrated and puffy eyes. Overall I will keep buying this. Very moisturizing, feels good, soaks right in!</li>
            <li> This eye gel is working miracles for my under eye area! Miracles! I have always had a huge problem with discoloration and this has helped tremendously!! I am sold for life! Thank you Nuju!!</li>
            <li> Have you ever woke up in the morning and been shocked to see what looked like cotton balls where your eyes should be! and wondered how you were going to go to work? Well worry no more with NuJu Revitalizing Eye Gel, it depuffs your eyes, smooths out fine lines and just gives your eyes a wonderful brightness! This product is awesome and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and I have been using this eye product for approximately one month. I noticed less puffiness and more tightening around the eyes. A friend of mine noticed a difference in the puffiness under my eyes (not puffy anymore she said) a couple of weeks after I began using this product.  It has also helped a little with my dark circles. It worked for me, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to two weeks now. Upon application it feels amazing. This is a light textured eye cream that goes on smooth and is easily absorbed. I noticed results with first application. The area around my eyes was brighter and plumper. I do not think my eyes were deceiving me but I could certainly see firmer skin tone around my eyes. I use it once or sometimes twice a day. I do not have issues with wrinkles or under eye bags so I would not know if this would cream would be effective. However, with mostly middle aged oily skin with some dry patches and definitively sagging skin, I would say this eye cream works for me in ways other eye creams have not. I would buy this product again. It also has the faintest of scents that is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> I barely sleep. I toss and turn and constantly wake up periodically throughout the night. Due to this I have tremendous bags under my eyes and some slight wrinkling which I am sure is caused by the bags. Since using this eye gel at night before I go to bed, I have noticed a good difference. I wake up every day now with less and less of a bagginess and those little wrinkles are fading too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to firm up the crows feet around my under eye area. it helps my eye area look younger. It helps a great deal but is not a miracle product. My eyes are VERY sensitive so most product give me a reaction. Nuju works like a charm on my sensitive skin. Great combination in this gel, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle. Happy with it, will but again.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this product to help me try to find a cure to my ‘tired eyes’. It WORKED! He has made countless comments on how youthful my eyes look now since I have been using this product! Re-ordering soon!</li>
            <li> Some what moisturizing.  Overall a disappointment for the money.</li>
            <li> The area around my eyes is extremely sensitive and easily irritated and this product did not cause a negative effect. In fact, it has created a very positive effect. My dark baggy under eye puffs are gone. This also happened in a very short period of time which is another plus.</li>
            <li> This product made me under eye worse. Puffy and red</li>
            <li> Waste of money. No reduction in under eye bags!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product so far. It&#x27;s very lightweight and easy to apply. I totally feel that it is hydrating my skin. Would recommend and would re-buy. This product delivers immediate results with noticeable results within the first week of use. Great consistency for use both morning and night.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. It doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as advertized nor does it say much about sensitive skin. It works okay if one does not use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely puffy eyes just about every morning! The only way I can get rid of them is to use green tea bags that takes about 20 minutes to half an hour for each eye! I used this eye treatment and it literally got rid of my puffy eyes in about 5-10 minutes. Overall worked pretty well..seems to smooth + brighten the eye area.</li>
            <li> As usual I&#x27;m always trying something new, this time it was because I wasn&#x27;t fully satisfied with what I was using. Saw the reviews for this and thought..why not?? I love it, it&#x27;s light but very moisturizing. My eyes feel refreshed and those lines under my eyes seem to appear less prominent. And because it has a gel like texture, you need very little, dab under eyes, let it sink in. Great product, highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eye areas and so many eye gels sting and burn. This is very gentle and dries beautifully. It feels great, it cools and soothes under your eyes, and it has gotten rid of dark circles or diminish fine lines. Overall I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days and my eyes definitely feel better.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I ordered this product at how after one application my terribly puff discolored bags vanished overnight. Most products I have tried in the past have taken some time to take effect but not with this one. I use it every night before I go to bed to stay bag free. After all the only bags a women wants is shopping bags! I love this product and I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from under eye baggage.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is outstanding! Not too thick, not too thin but just right. The aroma is of light cucumbers. Very relaxing. Once applied in the evening I awake without puffy bags under my eyes! Although I have only used this product for a week, I&#x27;ve noticed some fading in those potentially pesky crowfeet I was beginning to see. This was a great purchase and I just placed an order for the moisturizer too!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to reduce the appearance of under-eye dark circles.  This gel (more like a cream) seems to be working as well as anything I&#x27;ve been able to find!</li>
            <li> I see a difference within a week for using it under eye area looks brighter. Love this eye gel because it tightens and smooth. One final general note. Please twenty two year olds, stop giving wrinkle creams a one star because they don&#x27;t work for you. One you skew the ratings unfairly and two you don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet. Last thing it is cruelty free. Hooray.</li>
            <li> The aroma of cucumbers that this eye gel has relaxes me every evening after a long day. In the morning I have no bags or discoloration. I’m getting complements from everyone about how well-rested I look! That is something I defiantly enjoy hearing!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past month and have seen a noticeable improvement in the bags that I typically have underneath my eyes. They are flatter and much less pronounced. With continued treatment, they will perhaps be totally gone! I highly recommend this product. All natural ingredients and it feels great underneath my eyes - not anything like the other skin tightening concoctions that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Due to ageing - the skin all around my eyes was so dry and it felt so rough. I have tried so many different eye creams but I have to say - this is one of the best ones out there! I was skeptical, thinking it was just another serum, but this one works very well. My eyes look less lined. And it is gentle. No irritation for me.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is wonderful! I love the slight aroma of cucumbers. I only apply it at night but have noticed that my discoloration and puffiness has faded. The rare nights that I forget to apply the gel my eyes are back to their normal puffiness so this gel DOES WORK! I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> This eye treatment does make a big difference in my eye care routine. I love it! Super silky and hydrating around the eye area, you will see by the end of the first bottle how dark circles have improved dramatically and you will feel less bags every time you use it. You can pair it with pretty much any aye cream for extra care. Highly recommend this product to anyone that ask what&#x27;s my secret.</li>
