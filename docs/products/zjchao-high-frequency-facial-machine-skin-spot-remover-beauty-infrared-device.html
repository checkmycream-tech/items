            <li>All the attachments fit perfectly in the hand held piece.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Great value, easy to use, portable.</li>
            <li>Illustrations would be nice.  </li>

            <li>Glides nicely over your face and you have the ability to choose the tensity.</li>
            <li>I take a lot of time, I am very happy if someone wants to buy a  </li>
            <li>Counting out 3 normal seconds per spot seems to be perfect.  </li>
            <li>Many come from China and can take more than 6 weeks for delivery!</li>
            <li>Device can best be described as a high frequency electric voltage not too dissimilar from the feeling of static.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and working!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on the description of the item I thought I was buying some kind of pulsed Infrared LED light kind of skin therapy...</li>
            <li>It is doing exactly what it is supposed to do, and I am happy with that.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using it for more than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe the company had it &amp;#34;in them&amp;#34; to do better.  </li>
            <li>How many times a week should the treatments be used?  </li>
            <li>Most pamphlets give a lot of background information, this did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does not make me feel confident it won&#x27;t break or come apart.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>But over all I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>... love it</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister and she love it</li>
            <li>I am glad it got it.</li>
            <li>touching the appliance to skin, place your finger on the glass and remove after you touch the device to your skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you:)</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Skin is softer then ever and its the best skin product i have purschased in a long time.</li>
            <li>I really think it&#x27;s effective and a legit good product, not expensive, and does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to leave it in a drawer or hang it to get to it easily because of the glass attachments.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong too</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for dark spots I use it to hit acne spots and it is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be great if the glass attachment(s) could remain attached for daily use.  </li>
            <li>When I contacted the seller, they shipped a replacement part hassle free.</li>
            <li>This high frequency was for my mom, she liked it</li>
            <li>I am keeping it in it&#x27;s original box.  </li>
            <li>Love my high frequency set and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It was delivered as expected and works great.  </li>
            <li>Effective yet easy are key words for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>But before I get into the user experience of the device I wanted to add a quick note about the seller Tooto Buy.</li>
            <li>It has improved my acne tremendously.</li>
            <li>The chord is long and not supple (probably a good thing)</li>
            <li>This is great for cleansing your face and other parts of bacteria and it heals acne pumps asap!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to all, my spa is now out of my business!!!</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first couple of weeks but just like other reviewers, the product stopped working after a month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and everything arrive fine.</li>
            <li>I like it, worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth spending the time</li>
            <li>This worked right away on my pimples.</li>
            <li>A decent telsa light therapy device.</li>
            <li>The current is very strong and I can feel that it&#x27;s working after I am done with this in the morning.  </li>
            <li>me this was one of those devices I wish I had discovered years ago, but overall am happy with and use regularly.</li>
            <li>So far it works fine after a replacement was sent.  </li>
            <li>This is a fun toy, but it certainly does not remove skin spots, moles, etc.</li>
            <li>When we first got it.</li>
            <li>What does this do EXACTLY.  </li>
            <li>For the price is ok a facial with this can be 3 times the price, but two of the glass part are not working like at the beginning they are loosing power</li>
            <li>For large moles I used up to 5 seconds with positive results.  </li>
            <li>3 star only because its not as strong as when I bought it</li>
            <li>Very good, you cannot go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li>It has improved my skin so much.</li>
            <li>It does work but the light in the tube went out after the 2nd use.</li>
            <li>So it is for age prevention but not so much for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed (((((</li>
            <li>it does really well.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>No product issues, all new!</li>
            <li>The device runs this current through a glass tube filled with gas that creates a soft plasma glow when turned on.</li>
            <li>I now have a portable high frequency machine for my skin care class</li>
            <li>free to include moles, skintags and other lumpy spots...</li>
            <li>so it does not fit in the box easily</li>
            <li>I could barely understand what was being instructed due to poor English and with this kind of a product more information would be helpful.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to keep skin clear from pimples and to treat them when you get them.  </li>
            <li>This is a very affordable alternative and is actually stronger.  </li>
            <li>I use mine often never had a problem with it so far.</li>
            <li>starting with this device I highly recommend watching a few youtube videos on howto as this is a device usually only seen in dermatologists offices and there are some important notes on the &#x27;how to&#x27; that aren&#x27;t very clear from the in the box instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would caution all of you to only order from a US vendor when ordering a high frequency machine.</li>
            <li>This is the second High Frequency Machine I purchased.  </li>
            <li>The item was exactly what I had ordered, with the correct plug for use in the US, and it came sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li>I rarely take the time to write product reviews due to a terminal case of shopper lazyness on amazon, but this device totally threw me a curveball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since the cost of the kit is affordable, It&#x27;s not as much of a problem since there are other glass bulbs that I can use instead.  </li>
            <li>The outside of the glass hums with a staticy charge and puts off a corona of ozone which apparently does wonders as a disinfectant anti microbial...</li>

            <li> Only reason I gave it four stars is because I did notice a slight difference after using it a little- in that it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as it was when I first got it.</li>

            <li> I unfortunately broke the large glass piece traveling, I may replace it if I can, or just buy a new set.  </li>
            <li> I hope to have it areound for a long time.</li>
            <li> But it does dry out my skin</li>
            <li> areas that were treated dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100%clear on why, but dry treated spots seem to heal better.&lt;br /&gt;*feel</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> returned item, was not what I expected</li>
            <li> With my schedule I find I feel I need to be too careful with it</li>
            <li> They are attached to their silver base with a kind of adhesive.  </li>
            <li> But cleared up half of my daughter&#x27;s face because she would only let me do half .</li>
            <li> , I am still using the little one lets see how long it will work.</li>
            <li> In combination with other products this machine works well.  </li>
            <li> It was not fun pulling it out.  </li>
            <li> One less bit of frustration for the customer.</li>
            <li> Previously had the dermawand and the bulb broke.  </li>
            <li> although I haven&#x27;t used it but a few times, I find it does help the wrinkles and lines on my face.</li>
            <li> Now that it not strong</li>
            <li> I broke one of the glass bulbs and am not sure where to get the replacement.  </li>
            <li> and I imagine in other areas for storage it will remain inflexible.  </li>
            <li> Also, and this isn&#x27;t a negative per say, the wands are neon orange not argon purple.</li>
            <li> The larger round glass atatchment doesn&#x27;t work:(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product manual was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Directions are vague and box had been previously opened!</li>
            <li> least mine worked!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I saw that there was a thin line of adhesive at the end of the glass piece to hold it to the metal.  </li>
            <li> It came as scheduled nothing broken thank you</li>
            <li> I waist my money on a broken staff.</li>
            <li> My shipment (although packaged well) had a broken piece.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to give only 3 stars because I want to support this &amp;#34;section&amp;#34; of the &amp;#34;anti-aging skincare industry&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> ( I have burned my skin using the wrong attachments</li>
            <li> Not happy about the poor quality of the base.</li>
            <li> I seem to have bad luck with them.  </li>
            <li> As I was pulling one of them from the machine after a treatment, the metal base STAYED within the machine!  </li>

            <li> 3 star only because its not as strong as when I bought it and I&#x27;ve only used it as couple of times..But cleared up half of my daughter&#x27;s face because she would only let me do half . When we first got it. Now that it not strong she does it by herself. Does not work as good</li>
            <li> This high frequency was for my mom, she liked it so I guess that&#x27;s all that matters</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using it for more than 3 weeks. The smell is strong too</li>
            <li> I like it, worth every penny.  I should use it more often, but when I do use it, i see a difference!  I really think it&#x27;s effective and a legit good product, not expensive, and does it&#x27;s job.  I unfortunately broke the large glass piece traveling, I may replace it if I can, or just buy a new set.  Very good, you cannot go wrong with this product.  It lifts my eyebrows and softens lines around eyes and mouth.  Only one catch, you have to use it!</li>
            <li> Great value, easy to use, portable.</li>
            <li> It get the job done. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. It shipped quickly. It was everything I expected. Its easy to use and working! No product issues, all new! Beats going to a spa and paying $25 a visit!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> returned item, was not what I expected</li>
            <li> it is great i don&#x27;t know how i lived without it. it has done wonder for spots,wrinkles and tightening</li>
            <li> I am sorry to give only 3 stars because I want to support this &amp;#34;section&amp;#34; of the &amp;#34;anti-aging skincare industry&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in this product.  In combination with other products this machine works well.  I used it with a microdermabrasion treatment beforehand and the results have been the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product manual was ridiculous.  I could barely understand what was being instructed due to poor English and with this kind of a product more information would be helpful.  I don&#x27;t believe the company had it &amp;#34;in them&amp;#34; to do better.  How many times a week should the treatments be used?  What does this do EXACTLY.  Illustrations would be nice.  Most pamphlets give a lot of background information, this did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hectic schedule means that beauty is a &amp;#34;drive by&amp;#34; thing for me.  Effective yet easy are key words for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does not make me feel confident it won&#x27;t break or come apart.  For storage the unit is unwieldy.  I am keeping it in it&#x27;s original box.  The chord is long and not supple (probably a good thing) so it does not fit in the box easily and I imagine in other areas for storage it will remain inflexible.  It&#x27;d be great if the glass attachment(s) could remain attached for daily use.  I don&#x27;t want to leave it in a drawer or hang it to get to it easily because of the glass attachments.  Either the glass could break from the metal bottom that attaches into the machine or who knows?  At the moment, the attachment feels like it is moving within the unit as I use  it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confidence-wise I worry about breaking the glass units.  They are attached to their silver base with a kind of adhesive.  As I was pulling one of them from the machine after a treatment, the metal base STAYED within the machine!  It was not fun pulling it out.  That&#x27;s when I saw that there was a thin line of adhesive at the end of the glass piece to hold it to the metal.  Hardly enough adhesive to maintain the connection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering sending mine back.  With my schedule I find I feel I need to be too careful with it and I don&#x27;t want to deal with attachments that can get stuck in the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least mine worked!  One less bit of frustration for the customer.</li>
            <li> Arrived in one piece.  Once working - it is really nice to use.  Glides nicely over your face and you have the ability to choose the tensity.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Previously had the dermawand and the bulb broke.  I would have had to pay $90 to get it replaced.  This is a very affordable alternative and is actually stronger.  I broke one of the glass bulbs and am not sure where to get the replacement.  Since the cost of the kit is affordable, It&#x27;s not as much of a problem since there are other glass bulbs that I can use instead.  The current is very strong and I can feel that it&#x27;s working after I am done with this in the morning.  I am not seeing immediate results but didn&#x27;t expect since it&#x27;s taken me years to get the wrinkles on my face.  I think this is going to take a while to see the difference but it is worth spending the time</li>
            <li> So far it works fine after a replacement was sent.  Will update in 12 months on if it is still functioning properly and/or if it helps with regenerating hair growth and thickness.  If after I have had time to assess its functionality, it meets and or exceeds my expectations, will increase # of stars from 3 to 4 or 5.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for dark spots I use it to hit acne spots and it is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> For the price is ok a facial with this can be 3 times the price, but two of the glass part are not working like at the beginning they are loosing power and I used them just like 5 times, I am still using the little one lets see how long it will work.</li>
            <li> A decent telsa light therapy device. The English from Chinese translation is horrendous and embarrassing though.</li>
            <li> Must have for skincare</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I bought this product for its multipe use.  I can do facials as well as scalp treatment, that s what I purchased it for.  Hopefully it will do what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to keep skin clear from pimples and to treat them when you get them.  It makes them go away quicker.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel smoother after using it. But it does dry out my skin ):</li>
            <li> Great electrolysis machine. It has improved my skin so much. I&#x27;ll never be without one again.</li>
            <li> It was delivered as expected and works great.  All the attachments fit perfectly in the hand held piece.  No problems at all.</li>
            <li> Love my high frequency set and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I had ordered one of these machines from a different vendor and had nothing but issues. When I placed my order with this vendor, they immediately responded and put my fears to rest. The item was exactly what I had ordered, with the correct plug for use in the US, and it came sooner than I expected. I would caution all of you to only order from a US vendor when ordering a high frequency machine. Many come from China and can take more than 6 weeks for delivery!</li>
            <li> So far so good! It does work but the light in the tube went out after the 2nd use. The item still works and although I haven&#x27;t used it but a few times, I find it does help the wrinkles and lines on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the second High Frequency Machine I purchased.  I seem to have bad luck with them.  This one must have came apart in shipment or something, but doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested I get this for my thinning hair.  It is doing exactly what it is supposed to do, and I am happy with that.  Hopefully, I will have thicker hair soon.</li>
            <li> Fabulose price, wonderfull resuts......</li>
            <li> I love it! It works amazing !!! I use it for my scalp and it stopped loos my hair. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Great Machine!!!</li>
            <li> It came as scheduled nothing broken thank you I now have a portable high frequency machine for my skin care class</li>
            <li> This worked right away on my pimples. Skin is softer then ever and its the best skin product i have purschased in a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and it seems to be working. Good purchase!</li>
            <li> It does what it suppose to do! Only reason I gave it four stars is because I did notice a slight difference after using it a little- in that it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; as it was when I first got it. But over all I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> Directions are vague and box had been previously opened!</li>
            <li> The frequency is not high enough to zap any zit.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first couple of weeks but just like other reviewers, the product stopped working after a month. Also, and this isn&#x27;t a negative per say, the wands are neon orange not argon purple. So it is for age prevention but not so much for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and everything arrive fine. Not happy about the poor quality of the base.</li>
            <li> This is a fun toy, but it certainly does not remove skin spots, moles, etc. as it claims.</li>
            <li> There is a shortage in wiring keeps shutting on and off</li>
            <li> I waist my money on a broken staff. And I asked to return it for a change and still didn&#x27;t receive a reply.  Very dissapointed (((((</li>
            <li> excellent... love it.. works great</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she love it</li>
            <li> It works like is is suppose to. I hope to have it areound for a long time. I am glad it got it.</li>
            <li> The larger round glass atatchment doesn&#x27;t work:(( I have burned my skin using the wrong attachments</li>
            <li> I rarely take the time to write product reviews due to a terminal case of shopper lazyness on amazon, but this device totally threw me a curveball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the description of the item I thought I was buying some kind of pulsed Infrared LED light kind of skin therapy... not even close.  But before I get into the user experience of the device I wanted to add a quick note about the seller Tooto Buy. My shipment (although packaged well) had a broken piece. When I contacted the seller, they shipped a replacement part hassle free. Great buyer experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Device can best be described as a high frequency electric voltage not too dissimilar from the feeling of static. The device runs this current through a glass tube filled with gas that creates a soft plasma glow when turned on. The outside of the glass hums with a staticy charge and puts off a corona of ozone which apparently does wonders as a disinfectant anti microbial... meaning for acne spot treatment it does really well.&lt;br /&gt;Before starting with this device I highly recommend watching a few youtube videos on howto as this is a device usually only seen in dermatologists offices and there are some important notes on the &#x27;how to&#x27; that aren&#x27;t very clear from the in the box instructions.&lt;br /&gt;My shorthand recommendations on usage is...&lt;br /&gt;*before touching the appliance to skin, place your finger on the glass and remove after you touch the device to your skin. This prevents an uncomfortable discharge shock when touching on your skin. Same process in reverse when moving away from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;*Keep your treatments short... Counting out 3 normal seconds per spot seems to be perfect.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend longer than 10 seconds on any spot... it seems you can do damage that way.&lt;br /&gt;*Keep areas that were treated dry. I&#x27;m not 100%clear on why, but dry treated spots seem to heal better.&lt;br /&gt;*feel free to include moles, skintags and other lumpy spots... they seem to fade over time with regular treatment. I recommend a Z zigzag pattern over each spot.  For large moles I used up to 5 seconds with positive results.  They aren&#x27;t gone yet, but they are definately shrinking and fading (three weeks in.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With acne spots, you might not notice much on treatment day, but by the next day they are much smaller or just plain gone.&lt;br /&gt;For me this was one of those devices I wish I had discovered years ago, but overall am happy with and use regularly.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!!!! It has improved my acne tremendously. I highly recommend to all, my spa is now out of my business!!! Thank you:)</li>
            <li> This is great for cleansing your face and other parts of bacteria and it heals acne pumps asap! I use mine often never had a problem with it so far. I am a happy camper!!</li>
            <li> I take a lot of time, I am very happy if someone wants to buy a  , I advise you to buy this product</li>
