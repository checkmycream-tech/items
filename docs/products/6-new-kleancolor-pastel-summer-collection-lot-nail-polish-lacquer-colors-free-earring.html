            <li>(You can&#x27;t expect perfection for so cheep :D)</li>
            <li>:D</li>
            <li>I especially love the purple.</li>

            <li>and they came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with these.</li>
            <li>Very cheery pastel colors!</li>
            <li>Very good formula, 2 coats does the trick.</li>
            <li>Ver beautiful</li>
            <li>but I still think they&#x27;re beautiful.</li>
            <li>colors stayed bright and never chipped.</li>
            <li>Loved the colors.</li>
            <li>the shipping was good</li>
            <li>, they didnt look good on me at all</li>
            <li>(I have fair skin, maybe thats why?)</li>
            <li>I loved everyone of them.</li>
            <li>I loved smells, but to paint the nails does not adhere correctly to the</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased when I received it even though the colours were not as bright as in the picture.</li>
            <li>I love the colors!</li>
            <li>Great colors, but does not apply smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice addition to your collection.</li>
            <li>Nice pastel colors but</li>
            <li>Therefore they do not work the greatest for detailed nail art when you need a splash of vibrant color with an art brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality is okay.</li>
            <li>Maybe with a gel coat on top.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love all over again.</li>
            <li>a lot of my friends love these</li>
            <li>Like I said before, I love the colours</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>The purple and teal are my favorite of the set.</li>
            <li>lovely colors</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty and application is good.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, I loved all the colors.</li>
            <li>How cool is that?!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These were a gift for my sister, who said that they chip off too easily.</li>
            <li>I used it they have a strong smell to them.</li>
            <li>I am a retired cosmetologist, and I know new polishes should be actually fairly runny off the brush.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy when this package arrived, I guess the colors do vary slightly from the picture</li>
            <li>With two coats they are perfect but they do chip a little faster than I&#x27;d like but for the price I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors!</li>
            <li>They even came with free earrings.</li>
            <li>cheap though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because these colors are so pretty, I&#x27;ll just be on the lookout for these colors in a better quality brand.</li>
            <li>The Brushes are not the greatest which cause the first coat of color to be a little streaky.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I love them so much.</li>
            <li>I ordered this same set a couple years ago and absolutely loved all of the colors.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I tried all the colours, except the blue of course, and I thought they were gorgeous.</li>
            <li>true when they say &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Thank You Very Much!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very pretty pastel purple almost lavender.</li>
            <li>These colors are lovely especially if you use a matte polish first to draw out the lovely colors</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They are also good quality, they go on easy and last a long time!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super inexpensive but NOT poor quality.</li>
            <li>colors were fine, but the polishes are old.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>but the colts are really pretty.</li>
            <li>Really pretty colors,</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with such a cheep price</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the picture,</li>
            <li>so so fast within a day!</li>
            <li>The nail polish colors are exactly what they look like on the computer.</li>
            <li>Pretty nail polish colors.</li>
            <li>I love the whole white pink look, but when i saw the Pastel Colors i had to buy them because i love Pastel Colors</li>
            <li>These nail polishes are really cute!I would highly recommend for Spring!</li>
            <li>You definitely need two coats to get a nice solid color.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>and I might look into some new colors someday.</li>
            <li>it comes out best using a white base coat first, helps the color pop!</li>
            <li>I love the colors, but the pigments leaves chunks all over your nail when applied, I have tried stirring and rolling and mixing and still no luck, maybe I got a bad batch, but other than that I am loving it!</li>
            <li>The colors are a little more sheer than I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>Since that has to be covered with a clear coat anyway, chipping wasn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a pretty pale orange/peach or that pale green, you wont be happy with this set.</li>
            <li>The yellow and purple are pretty, but I bought them only because it looked like the color orange</li>
            <li>so 2-3 coats are necessary, but make sure you let each coat dry COMPLETELY as I noticed I was smudging the previous coat when I put another one.</li>
            <li>However, after I put it on, it would NOT dry!!</li>
            <li>I like Kleancolor polishes in general, but I prefer their matte colors to these pastels.</li>
            <li>So can&#x27;t comment much on the quality, etc relative to other polishes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from these small complaints I think these polishes are worth the money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say that the purple is &amp;#34;pastel,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s more of a pale purple.</li>
            <li>I was looking for pastels and could not find that much in our little towns stores.</li>

            <li> I was looking for pastels and could not find that much in our little towns stores.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s not an awful color, but I love pale oranges and this color is more white than orange.</li>
            <li> And spent only $10</li>
            <li> I got this product not too long ago</li>
            <li> This tells me they have been on the shelf a long time.  </li>
            <li> The polish stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like that they took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I waited forever and it still wasn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> Pastel Purple, Green, Blue, Teal, Yellow, and Pink.</li>
            <li> The only downside is  they don&#x27;t have the little balls that mixes the polish when you shake it.  </li>
            <li> I was super disappointed when I left them outside</li>
            <li> As well as the pink and orange being too close to tell apart, both being very pink.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the orange color, which was a little more milky and beige-y than it looked in this photograph</li>
            <li> but basically they only take about 2 thin coats and dry like any other color.</li>
            <li> So it may get thick sooner than later.</li>
            <li> Usually require two coats to come out evenly, which is why they lose a star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The polishes are a little thin</li>
            <li> With the matte I can get away with one thin coat and with these I usually have to do two coats to build even coverage.</li>
            <li> Disappointed... the polish isn&#x27;t bad quality, but the blue and green colors are so close you can&#x27;t tell them apart - they&#x27;re very blue.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that they go on really thin and streaky</li>
            <li> It does smell terrible and it certainly isn&#x27;t high quality like OPI or Essie</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that issue when I used them though, but I used them as a base to apply glitter or other clear-base nail polish that I get from Etsy.</li>
            <li> However, when I opened the bottles I was very disappointed to see that the blue came without the brush.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the polish chips away</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> And even the slightest touch to the nails made your nails look terrible!!</li>

            <li> Loved the colors. colors stayed bright and never chipped. I got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice addition to your collection. It does smell terrible and it certainly isn&#x27;t high quality like OPI or Essie but the colts are really pretty.</li>
            <li> Really pretty colors, but, it does take 2 coats.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Quality is okay. Doesn&#x27;t last long. Maybe with a gel coat on top.</li>
            <li> I love the colors! With two coats they are perfect but they do chip a little faster than I&#x27;d like but for the price I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
            <li> I have never tried KleanColor nail polish before but the price was so unbeatable I had to try. the shipping was good I got it in the predicted time. wen I used it they have a strong smell to them. only about I or 2 colors required 3 coats but the others only 2 coats. when using the yellow it comes out best using a white base coat first, helps the color pop!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with such a cheep price but I am pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;m not blown away but I&#x27;m not tossing them out the window either. The colors are very pretty and exactly what I was looking for. My only complaints are small.&lt;br /&gt;1. The Brushes are not the greatest which cause the first coat of color to be a little streaky.&lt;br /&gt;2. The colors are a little more sheer than I would have hoped. You definitely need two coats to get a nice solid color. Therefore they do not work the greatest for detailed nail art when you need a splash of vibrant color with an art brush.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from these small complaints I think these polishes are worth the money (You can&#x27;t expect perfection for so cheep :D) and I might look into some new colors someday.</li>
            <li> Cracked immediately after applining. Peeled off within a hour of application.</li>
            <li> Very good formula, 2 coats does the trick. I received 6 colors. Pastel Purple, Green, Blue, Teal, Yellow, and Pink. I love them so much. And spent only $10</li>
            <li> I ordered this same set a couple years ago and absolutely loved all of the colors. I was super disappointed when I left them outside and they all exploded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered this set for the second time and I fell in love all over again. :D I especially love the purple. They&#x27;re super inexpensive but NOT poor quality. They even came with free earrings. How cool is that?!</li>
            <li> I love the whole white pink look, but when i saw the Pastel Colors i had to buy them because i love Pastel Colors so i was happy when i received them!!  They look exactly like the picture, Ver beautiful and i would buy again a lot of my friends love these and they want to purchase some! Thank You Very Much!💕</li>
            <li> I got this product not too long ago and I was very pleased when I received it even though the colours were not as bright as in the picture. However, when I opened the bottles I was very disappointed to see that the blue came without the brush. The cover literally didn&#x27;t have a brush. When I sent a message to the seller, I got no response. Guess I won&#x27;t be buying from them again. Anyway, I tried all the colours, except the blue of course, and I thought they were gorgeous. I didn&#x27;t like that they go on really thin and streaky and I had to put on about three coats. I also didn&#x27;t like that they took forever to dry. Like I said before, I love the colours but I would not recommend this product (or brand) to anyone.</li>
            <li> Its okay. These are pastel colors, I just dont use them all. I gave away the yellow and purple, they didnt look good on me at all (I have fair skin, maybe thats why?) but basically they only take about 2 thin coats and dry like any other color.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are really cute!I would highly recommend for Spring! They are also good quality, they go on easy and last a long time!</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail polish set around noon on friday, got it noon saturday (next day!) and I did not pay for any shipping at all and they came in perfect condition. I can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> Great colors, but does not apply smoothly. Nails appear blotchy even after two coats.</li>
            <li> I like Kleancolor polishes in general, but I prefer their matte colors to these pastels. With the matte I can get away with one thin coat and with these I usually have to do two coats to build even coverage. I was disappointed by the orange color, which was a little more milky and beige-y than it looked in this photograph -- it&#x27;s not an awful color, but I love pale oranges and this color is more white than orange. The purple and teal are my favorite of the set. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d say that the purple is &amp;#34;pastel,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s more of a pale purple.</li>
            <li> true when they say &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34;. I put this on and after 2 days, it&#x27;s starting to rip off. Nice pastel colors but cheap though.</li>
            <li> lovely colors but does not last.  These colors are lovely especially if you use a matte polish first to draw out the lovely colors but unfortunately the polish chips away so so fast within a day!</li>
            <li> The nail polish colors are exactly what they look like on the computer. I loved everyone of them. The polish stays on for a very long time. Would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Colors are pretty and application is good.  The only downside is  they don&#x27;t have the little balls that mixes the polish when you shake it.  So it may get thick sooner than later.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, but the pigments leaves chunks all over your nail when applied, I have tried stirring and rolling and mixing and still no luck, maybe I got a bad batch, but other than that I am loving it!</li>
            <li> Disappointed... the polish isn&#x27;t bad quality, but the blue and green colors are so close you can&#x27;t tell them apart - they&#x27;re very blue. As well as the pink and orange being too close to tell apart, both being very pink. If you&#x27;re looking for a pretty pale orange/peach or that pale green, you wont be happy with this set. The yellow and purple are pretty, but I bought them only because it looked like the color orange I had been looking for.</li>
            <li> colors were fine, but the polishes are old.  I am a retired cosmetologist, and I know new polishes should be actually fairly runny off the brush.  These were sticky and gooey from the moment I opened them.  This tells me they have been on the shelf a long time.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors! The polishes are a little thin so 2-3 coats are necessary, but make sure you let each coat dry COMPLETELY as I noticed I was smudging the previous coat when I put another one. The purple pastel is lighter than what is pictured it&#x27;s a very pretty pastel purple almost lavender.</li>
            <li> Pretty nail polish colors. I was looking for pastels and could not find that much in our little towns stores. I&#x27;m very happy with these.</li>
            <li> Thank you for shipping soon I&#x27;ve used this product but in reality is not working as I would like the. I loved smells, but to paint the nails does not adhere correctly to the</li>
            <li> I was very happy when this package arrived, I guess the colors do vary slightly from the picture but I still think they&#x27;re beautiful. So far I have worn the pink and yellow polish several times and they hardly last a day without chipping! It&#x27;s a shame because these colors are so pretty, I&#x27;ll just be on the lookout for these colors in a better quality brand.</li>
            <li> Very cheery pastel colors! Usually require two coats to come out evenly, which is why they lose a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were a gift for my sister, who said that they chip off too easily. I didn&#x27;t have that issue when I used them though, but I used them as a base to apply glitter or other clear-base nail polish that I get from Etsy. Since that has to be covered with a clear coat anyway, chipping wasn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I use nail polish maybe once every two years. So can&#x27;t comment much on the quality, etc relative to other polishes.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I loved all the colors. However, after I put it on, it would NOT dry!! I waited forever and it still wasn&#x27;t dry. And even the slightest touch to the nails made your nails look terrible!! I&#x27;m probably never going to use these.</li>
