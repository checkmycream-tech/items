            <li>I start off with the Renew Shampoo which is a nice wake-up every day.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo ever!</li>

            <li>The fragrance is nice and leave my hair clean and smelling nice.</li>
            <li>Amazon had a much better price than the salon</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this shampoo and it works great!  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using Neuma for a year now and absolutely love their products.  </li>
            <li>Lovely lanvender fragance.  </li>
            <li>I have been using neuma for a while love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase themoisturizer shampoo from amazon because I had a gift card, This shampoo was more watery</li>
            <li>When creme rinse disappeared off the shelves I was doomed, because most conditioners just thicken my hair more.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy and manageable-it isn&#x27;t drying like so many products.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy and protects the color from fading.</li>
            <li>So if moisture is your main need this shampoo and conditioner duo will really make your hair HAPPY!</li>
            <li>I first encountered it in a high-end non-toxic salon and am thrilled to be able to order it on amazon now.  </li>
            <li>I feel differently throughout the day when I know my hair is this incredible.  </li>
            <li>I love the sulfate free formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who has fine, easily tangled hair that they color a lot.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>It also smells good, which is a plus for me since I have a very sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind or even enjoy the fragrance, this is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased the 3 bottles through Amazon for this amazing price, but I knew as soon as I opened the bottle that these shampoos were not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The BEST shampoo for my heavy wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few months now and find my hair to be in the best condition it has been in for years.  </li>
            <li>So far I have loved every Nuema product I have tried.</li>
            <li>and I always thought my hair was pretty healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure if my hair could talk it would thank me and give me a hug.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super, super, super.</li>
            <li>It works better than most of the in salon deep conditioning treatment that are even offered.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and fluffy after using it, also great.</li>
            <li>but when a product is this quality I feel the investment is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo &amp; conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>Their products have made my hair so soft and healthy and I would recommend them to everyone.  </li>
            <li>Cleans, leaves your hair shiny and colorful even if treated.</li>
            <li>, I am very upset I was so excited to try this</li>
            <li>However the price on Amazon was right, and the shampoo works well.</li>
            <li>If you sound like me, I highly recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Great product for silky smooth hair--my fine thin hair does well with this product!</li>
            <li>I am a hair dresser working with some of the most high end natural hair care product lines, and this one by far is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>As a loyal Amazon customer, I really appreciate that they are listening to their customers and trying to fix the issues</li>
            <li>and this is a new line from their original creators.</li>
            <li>Been a fan since the first time I used it about a year ago.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the scent isn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and bouncy, full of volume and holds curl....</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because it is so gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp.</li>
            <li>Amazon was amazing and took them back and refunded my money instantly.  </li>
            <li>I ended up wasting so much money trying to find one that worked well.</li>
            <li>so I am hoping this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I bought three bottles of Neuma Moisture Shampoo from this vendor through Amazon and this is NOT the real Neuma shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Really like this whole product line.</li>
            <li>Versus when i spent more money on it and bought it from the salon.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, so one bottle lasts a while.  </li>
            <li>It smells the same but the consistency is far more runny than the ones I get from the salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true bush head and can barely get a comb through my hair after it is washed.  </li>
            <li>Less required for a shampoo and this rinses out so much better than anything else I ever used.</li>
            <li>with the Moroccan Oil brand, the argan oil is the 3rd ingredient listed (which means it contains more actual argan oil than the Neuma brand).  </li>
            <li>, only a small amount is needed, so it lasts, and it has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>Priced high.</li>
            <li>but I was sold a bad bottle by Best Bet beauty on Amazon in June 2104 and now can&#x27;t return it because the 30 day return period has expired.  </li>
            <li>and now I am going to have to waste more money and buy elsewhere</li>
            <li>Keeps frizz down and makes it easy to control.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair very soft and silky</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that can only be washed every other day, and I color it frequently.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong, but I like that the ingredients are natural &amp; there are no silicons.</li>
            <li>Using this and the renew conditioner i feel like my hair feels more dry and rough.  </li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with Nuema products but they are hard to find in my area.  </li>
            <li>I can get a comb through it and it blows out soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I am not the person to spend much on toiletries, don&#x27;t trim my hair often enough, don&#x27;t even wear make-up</li>
            <li>The color is darker, it smells different and is very runny.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Leave my hair soft and managable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>( I think I said old man in bus station).</li>
            <li>It cleans all the grease out of my hair without stripping away the color I frequently put into it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone would love thick lather and fullier hair .  </li>
            <li>Seriously I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair when I use this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It was more watery than usual and had a different smell to it.</li>
            <li>I like other lines for other certain needs but as far as moisture for dry coarse hair this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I will say however, I am not sure if this is the original stuff.</li>
            <li>#34;this was a batch of product that we (NEUMA) determined to be expired and not suitable for sale.&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t believe him because the shampoo is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thick, this product is moisturizing</li>
            <li>The only difference it looks like this bottle is an older version of the salon bottle (the product inside seems the same).</li>
            <li>Of course fragrance is a very subjective thing, but to me there is a hint of something similar to the &#x27;tar&#x27; shampoos of long ago.</li>
            <li>I used it with the Neuma conditioner and the combination left both my hair and facial hair soft.  </li>
            <li>The salon bought ones are super thick and concentrated</li>
            <li>Expensive keratin treatments help tremendously, of course, but this shampoo really does help keep my hair smoother, softer and straighter.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very dry and this product has completely changed the look and feel of my hair.</li>

            <li> The best for redheads who have a problem with color fading.</li>
            <li> I have the Renew Shampoo, Moisture Shampoo, Moisture Conditioner, Moisture Deep Conditioner, and Style Extender.  The only one I haven&#x27;t tried yet is the Style Extender.  I start off with the Renew Shampoo which is a nice wake-up every day.  I feel that it definitely gets out the styling products I use.  Then I shampoo a second time with the Moisture Shampoo, and man oh man is this a moisturizing shampoo.  Anyone with dry, brittle MUST try this product.  The Moisture conditioner by itself isn&#x27;t enough - so I put the Moisture Deep conditioner on my ends and use the regular Moisture Conditioner on the rest of my hair.  My hair is definitely healthier and shinier than it has been in a while.  I had previously been using Alterna because it doesn&#x27;t contain SLS....but my hair felt like straw.  As for the Argan Treatment - the argan is something like the 5th or 6th ingredient listed... with the Moroccan Oil brand, the argan oil is the 3rd ingredient listed (which means it contains more actual argan oil than the Neuma brand).  So that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t buy that specific product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product line I&#x27;ve ever used. I have really fine hair and i like to keep it long(ish) but it&#x27;s difficult to keep the ends from getting dry and splitting. I used pureology hydrate for years and I always thought my hair was pretty healthy. I recently moved and ran out of my pureology and decided to give the drug store brand another whirl. Big mistake. I ended up wasting so much money trying to find one that worked well. I did a search to see where I could buy pureology, I called one of the salons on the list and they told they don&#x27;t carry that line but they do carry Neuma. She explained that pureology sold out to L&#x27;oreal years back and this is a new line from their original creators. I picked up the shampoo &amp; conditioner and I couldn&#x27;t be happier...it puts pureology to shame. What&#x27;s in this stuff...magic? Angel tears? I&#x27;m pretty sure if my hair could talk it would thank me and give me a hug. My hair is so soft and bouncy, full of volume and holds curl....yay! Thank you creators of Neuma!! I&#x27;m never going back to anything else.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with Nuema products but they are hard to find in my area.  The Moisture shampoo provides a enough moisture for my high-lighted hair without weighing it down. My hair feels great I can get a comb through it and it blows out soft and shiny.  So far I have loved every Nuema product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great product for silky smooth hair--my fine thin hair does well with this product!</li>
            <li> Seriously I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair when I use this shampoo.  I first encountered it in a high-end non-toxic salon and am thrilled to be able to order it on amazon now.  A little goes a long way so I like to stock up with a big size and use it for 6 months or so on my short hair.  The shampoo and conditioner are both water-soluble so nothing gets left behind in your hair yet it feels amazing.  I am not the person to spend much on toiletries, don&#x27;t trim my hair often enough, don&#x27;t even wear make-up etc. but when a product is this quality I feel the investment is worth every cent.  I feel differently throughout the day when I know my hair is this incredible.  Unlike any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used, including other natural/organic products at other salons.</li>
            <li> My wife brought some of this home from the salon she visits.  I tried it and was amazed at how well it did.  My hair is very fine, whereas my beard and mustache are like wire.  I used it with the Neuma conditioner and the combination left both my hair and facial hair soft.  Amazon had a much better price than the salon so I bought our second bottle here.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does not make my scalp itchy, which is great. My hair feels clean and fluffy after using it, also great. If you don&#x27;t mind or even enjoy the fragrance, this is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I do *not* care for the fragrance at all. Of course fragrance is a very subjective thing, but to me there is a hint of something similar to the &#x27;tar&#x27; shampoos of long ago. I tried adding a few drops of peppermint oil to neutralize scent, which didn&#x27;t work well. For that reason only, I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Neuma products are the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo ever! Been a fan since the first time I used it about a year ago. I will say however, I am not sure if this is the original stuff. It smells the same but the consistency is far more runny than the ones I get from the salon. The salon bought ones are super thick and concentrated so I am hoping this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This item was great! Great price, great product.  The only problem is that it has leaked a little in the package when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Found this brand at the recommendation of my stylist. My hair is fine and thick, this product is moisturizing so no fly-aways. I paid $25 for the same product at the salon. The only difference it looks like this bottle is an older version of the salon bottle (the product inside seems the same).</li>
            <li> I purchased NEUMA moisture shampoo bottom code # 0K2214 and works as expected. A reviewer says &amp;#34;this was a batch of product that we (NEUMA) determined to be expired and not suitable for sale.&amp;#34;, but I don&#x27;t believe him because the shampoo is fantastic. Excellent product and excellent seller (shop &amp; save).</li>
            <li> I opened this and the smell was so gross i contacts Neuma and the code 0k2214 is a expired product from 2010 and was a bad batch to begin with and they sent it be destroyed these people got their hands on them, I am very upset I was so excited to try this and now I am going to have to waste more money and buy elsewhere</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this shampoo and it works great!  It doesn&#x27;t smell off/rancid/bad - although I&#x27;m not particularly keen on the smell.  I will definitely be buying it again.  FYI: it has the code OK2214.</li>
            <li> Had a bit of an odor.  Priced high.</li>
            <li> I had a perm recently and this shampoo was recommended by my hairdresser.  It makes your hair very soft and silky</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, yet cleans it thoroughly and lathers well. The scent is a little strong, but I like that the ingredients are natural &amp; there are no silicons. I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and will continue to do so!</li>
            <li> It smelled rancid. It&#x27;s 2 days since I used it and I can still smell it. I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and I love it. I just think this was a bad batch or it was exposed to something and the shampoo went bad.</li>
            <li> My mom let me use her Neuma shampoo &amp; conditioner when visited her, loved it, bought it &amp; will continue ordering it. I have long, thick hair. This shampoo &amp; conditioner leaves my hair soft, shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> A word of caution: it has been reported that there are several individuals selling EXPIRED and or adulterated NEUMA product through Amazon, E-Bay, Walgreens and other on-line retailers. These are NOT authorized re-sellers – buyer beware! Do not purchase NEUMA moisture shampoo bottom code # 0K2214 - this was a batch of product that we (NEUMA) determined to be expired and not suitable for sale. This was contracted to be destroyed  - however it appears that someone got ahold of the product and is now selling it on-line. If for any reason you are uncertain regarding ANY NEUMA purchase - please email the 6 digit code from the bottom of your bottle to: breath@neumabeauty.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUMA Research, LLC.</li>
            <li> I bought three bottles of Neuma Moisture Shampoo from this vendor through Amazon and this is NOT the real Neuma shampoo.  I have been using Neuma for a year now and absolutely love their products.  Their products have made my hair so soft and healthy and I would recommend them to everyone.  I purchased the 3 bottles through Amazon for this amazing price, but I knew as soon as I opened the bottle that these shampoos were not the real deal.  The color is darker, it smells different and is very runny.  Amazon was amazing and took them back and refunded my money instantly.  In addition, I now see a note under the product that Amazon is reviewing based on feedback from customers and this is no longer for sale.  As a loyal Amazon customer, I really appreciate that they are listening to their customers and trying to fix the issues so Kudos to Amazon and shame on the third party vendor who was selling a knock off product!</li>
            <li> Lovely lanvender fragance.  Less required for a shampoo and this rinses out so much better than anything else I ever used.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this line of products. My hair was very dry and this product has completely changed the look and feel of my hair. It feels silkier and smoother. Really like this whole product line. I will try other ones in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shampoo. My only complaint is the scent isn&#x27;t the greatest. It almost has a mediciney smell, which I hadn&#x27;t noticed in the previous bottle I had which was purchased at my salon. However the price on Amazon was right, and the shampoo works well.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep a beautiful hear! Definitly this is the option. I loove this shampoo. And I recomend the masks too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this shampoo, other than you have to try it! I&#x27;ve tried just about all of the hair products and the Moisture Shampoo is my favorite! I use it with the Moisture conditioner. Neuma customer for life!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in just one week. My hair is softer, fuller and curlier, with less breakage and hair loss.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells different and has a watery consistency.  Not as good as the one i bought from the salon. I never really liked the small of the one i bought before but this one smells way worse. Using this and the renew conditioner i feel like my hair feels more dry and rough.  Versus when i spent more money on it and bought it from the salon.</li>
            <li> This product was diluted.  I compared it to a bottle I bought from my salon and I could tell the difference.  It even smells different.</li>
            <li> I have been using neuma for a while love the way my hair feels. I decided to purchase themoisturizer shampoo from amazon because I had a gift card, This shampoo was more watery I used it and it left my hair horrible it made my scalp very dry and itchy. I wouldn&#x27;t never buy hair products by this seller waste of money. From now on I will buy them at the salon.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> It arrived opened and all over the package</li>
            <li> Different than what I&#x27;ve gotten at the salon</li>
            <li> I am very happy whith this shampoo. It&#x27;s the best I have ever used. A bottle goes a long way as you only need a dab to create a mountain of suds! Leave my hair soft and managable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon dealer was great too. I had a question about product so I emailed and got a timely response. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this shampoo and it&#x27;s conditioner for over a year and it performs well, only a small amount is needed, so it lasts, and it has a pleasant fragrance. The price was half of what I paid in a salon.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo in the past and it seemed different this time when bought through this seller.  It was more watery than usual and had a different smell to it.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist sold me a bottle of this sulfate-free shampoo (for twice what it costs here) after a keratin treatment.  I normally have long, very thick, coarse, wavy, fuzzy hair. It was great in the 60&#x27;s but not now.  I&#x27;m a true bush head and can barely get a comb through my hair after it is washed.  When creme rinse disappeared off the shelves I was doomed, because most conditioners just thicken my hair more.  Expensive keratin treatments help tremendously, of course, but this shampoo really does help keep my hair smoother, softer and straighter.  My hair doesn&#x27;t knot and tangle up and is easier to comb out.  No fuzzy ends.  And I can go longer between keratin treatments too.  I use a moisturizing conditioner and a daily keratin leave-in afterwards and my hair is finally under control after 60 years. I have very dry hair  and wash no more than twice a week or less (my scalp doesn&#x27;t get oily).  If you sound like me, I highly recommend this shampoo.  It&#x27;s super, super, super. And I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It keeps my hair healthy and manageable-it isn&#x27;t drying like so many products.  I love the sulfate free formula.</li>
            <li> Normally a great product but I was sold a bad bottle by Best Bet beauty on Amazon in June 2104 and now can&#x27;t return it because the 30 day return period has expired.  Beware of any bottles with a bottom stamp of OK2214.  They are rotten and the shampoo is a brown color.</li>
            <li> The BEST shampoo for my heavy wavy hair. Keeps frizz down and makes it easy to control. I have tried to find something cheaper that is similar with no luck. I liked Loreal eversleek except the SMELL was awful like bad overwhelming cologne. ( I think I said old man in bus station). this smells great and very mildly scented.</li>
            <li> Cleans, leaves your hair shiny and colorful even if treated. A little goes a long way. No Chemicals to damage your hair. Worth it.!!!</li>
            <li> When I opened this bottle, the shampoo was darker in color and the consistency was runny.  I the checked the code on the bottom of the bottle and it did say 0K2214 which reportedly had gone bad.  Shame on this company for continuing to sell this.</li>
            <li> I am a hair dresser working with some of the most high end natural hair care product lines, and this one by far is my favorite.  I like other lines for other certain needs but as far as moisture for dry coarse hair this one is by far my favorite.  It works better than most of the in salon deep conditioning treatment that are even offered.  So if moisture is your main need this shampoo and conditioner duo will really make your hair HAPPY!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have been using it for a few months now and find my hair to be in the best condition it has been in for years.  The fragrance is nice and leave my hair clean and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now.  I like the way my hair feels after using it.  You don&#x27;t need much, so one bottle lasts a while.  I have recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because it is so gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp. When my stylist stopped carrying it, I was really happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo. I would recommend it to anyone would love thick lather and fullier hair .  A great product.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on a recommendation from my hair stylist. I have very fine hair that can only be washed every other day, and I color it frequently. I was told that this product would be good for my hair, and it ha been! It cleans all the grease out of my hair without stripping away the color I frequently put into it. It also smells good, which is a plus for me since I have a very sensitive sense of smell. And while most scented shampoos make my scalp itch, this product does not! I only gave it a 4 out of 5 rating, however, because I do have to change out shampoos and conditioners every few weeks to clear out the buildup that eventually occurs with this product. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who has fine, easily tangled hair that they color a lot.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair healthy and protects the color from fading.</li>
            <li> wife loves it we have reordered twice</li>
