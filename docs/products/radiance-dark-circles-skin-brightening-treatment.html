            <li>I think it is pretty good serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about it!</li>
            <li>Today when I woke up my eyes were INCREDIBLY puffy - red and inflamed.</li>
            <li>but I do like that it is lighweight, hypo-allergenic and odor free.</li>
            <li>When I first got this product, I was very excited.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far!</li>
            <li>Normally the most I can do is just try to cover them with makeup</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and never got this much improvement.  </li>
            <li>I used the item for about a week and saw no differences in the darkness of my under-eye area (most reviewers expressed seeing a difference in only a few days to a week); if anything, my dark circles seemed to be getting darker.</li>
            <li>I have dark circles under my eyes - had them my whole life</li>
            <li>now I really havent seen a difference is the dark circles</li>
            <li>I have used this product on that area for the past few weeks and it is most definitely lighter!  </li>

            <li> Love this eye cream! It has helped lighten my dark circles!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes - had them my whole life and they are worse when I&#x27;m tired or my allergies are bad. Normally the most I can do is just try to cover them with makeup but that is just hiding the problem. This product works great at evening out my skintone and minimizing the appearance of my dark circles! I&#x27;m excited about it! Finally something that helps the problem instead of just hiding it!</li>
            <li> Received the item in discount in exchange of my honest review. Nice package. Starting trying the item go about the week and seeng minor improvement around the eyes. Hopefully the improvement will get better later.</li>
            <li> It is very good.  I have melasma and it is starting to lighten up after a month of using it I will be purchasing more .  It says to use it for three months to really make a difference</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.  I noticed a difference after about a month of steady use morning and night.  I&#x27;m 59 and was really not liking my dark under-eye bags.

            <li> This product is ok. I have been using it for 2 weeks now I really havent seen a difference is the dark circles but I do like that it is lighweight, hypo-allergenic and odor free. It does make a nice eye cream</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a discounted price for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this product is great.  The packaging makes it feel like a higher end product and the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this brightening cream.</li>
            <li> I had dark circles under my eyes.... This product has lightened them dramatically.  I would recommend it to others with this issue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily. I have always had a problem with dark circles so when I found this product I figured, why not. It seems to working and I will continue to use it. I would purchase again. My darkness seems to have faded and my under eyes are lighter. Loving it so far!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. My dark circles have almost disappered!!</li>
            <li> Love it! I ca see a difference already</li>
            <li> This is a Wonderful cream!  It has already started to change and brighten my skin.</li>
            <li> i can see my skin brightening already. works well, does not rub off.</li>
            <li> When I first got this product, I was very excited. I&#x27;ve had dark circles for years (and am only 27) and after reading the reviews I couldn&#x27;t wait to start trying out this product. However, my experience was quite different than the other users. I used the item for about a week and saw no differences in the darkness of my under-eye area (most reviewers expressed seeing a difference in only a few days to a week); if anything, my dark circles seemed to be getting darker. Aside from that, it seems I&#x27;ve had an allergic reaction of some sort - my eye area began to break out into a slight rash over the weekend, so I stopped using this product yesterday. Today when I woke up my eyes were INCREDIBLY puffy - red and inflamed. It&#x27;s terrible. I am returning this item and buying a cucumber cream instead.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Love it!</li>
            <li> I got this at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I got it for a week now, and have been using it 2 times a day. I do not have dark circle, but I have uneven skin tone. I have been feeling that my skin is brighter and my dark spots are not that visible now. I think it is pretty good serum. I will keep using it to see the best result.. Like it!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!

            <li> Been using a few weeks now and it&#x27;s ok.  Have not noticed much results though.  Maybe after a month or so.</li>
