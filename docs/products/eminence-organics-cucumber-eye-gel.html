    <ol>
            <li>Best thing out there.</li>
            <li>Not so impressed with how it works on puffiness, as I chose this for both.  </li>
            <li>My fiancee and I went for facials at a very nice day spa, and the esthetician recommended this product to him...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use all their products, but have been very happy with eye gel (more of a cream) and their chamomile cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I always buy products through Amazon and when I saw this on here at this price, I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>The cucumber is relaxing &amp; pleasant to the eyes.</li>
            <li>Good for an &amp;#34;in</li>
            <li>I was super impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for year now, love it!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best eye cream I have tried ever.</li>
            <li>Just OK.  </li>
            <li>Found another eye creme I like better from Eminence.</li>
            <li>Does not feel like an eye gel but more like a cream.</li>
            <li>Love both the eye gel and the eye cream.</li>
            <li>I love Eminence products.  </li>
            <li>Eminence is my favorite brand of face products and this gel doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth, silky, and my skin absorbs it quickly.</li>
            <li>I quickly ordered it andwithin a week of me using this product they started to get better.</li>
            <li>I know it works great because when I ran out of it for a month I thought oh I&#x27;ll get something different</li>
            <li>I paired it up with the Wild Plum Eye Cream and my eye area looks fresh and bright.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The is an honest review with no hidden motives.  </li>
            <li>This is my third bottle and the price is so much better on Amazon then from my anesthetician love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Pretty excited to see this so quick.  </li>
            <li>My eyes finally look healthy!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>I have switched around quite a bit with face care products, trying to find the most natural.  </li>
            <li>I have violet-red under eyes from birth, not dark circles (I&#x27;m a fair skinned male)</li>
            <li>I have been using daily for about a month, and actually I don&#x27;t have any more puffiness, but I&#x27;m still going to use it every day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much akin to putting cucumber water under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very hopeful this product will help to make some correction giving some time.</li>
            <li>It smells natural not artificial.</li>
            <li>This gel really does help with puffiness under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I layer them on top of each other when I need a boost.</li>
            <li>There has been a noticeable reduction in the dark circles in a couple weeks, I suspect with continued use I will be able to toss my collection of concealers.  </li>
            <li>I was have some issues with the skin around my eyes from an older eye product that produced puffiness &amp; lines.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if I can or cannot live without it after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I am re-ordering because it&#x27;s the first product that actually reduces my morning puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I felt like the skin around the eyes became tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>I also like that their products appear to be all natural.</li>
            <li>I can really notice a big difference in the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is more like a lotion than gel, at least the one I got.  </li>
            <li>No matter how far from my eyes</li>
            <li>One pump does go a LONG way (too much for me)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s, so don&#x27;t really use it for the lifting purposes, but the first time I put it on</li>

            <li> Best thing out there. I paired it up with the Wild Plum Eye Cream and my eye area looks fresh and bright. Definitely worth the money and it lasts a long time. I will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> Just OK.  Found another eye creme I like better from Eminence.</li>
            <li> meh. I don&#x27;t notice any difference. It&#x27;s much akin to putting cucumber water under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Good for an &amp;#34;in a hurry&amp;#34; eye treatment.  I put in on with my day cream.  Makes the puffiness go away.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because sometimes I have late nights and get dark circles underneath my eyes. Or sometimes I wake up with puffy eyes. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s, so don&#x27;t really use it for the lifting purposes, but the first time I put it on I felt my eye area tighten up. I was super impressed. Don&#x27;t know how likely I would be to keep buying it, though. We&#x27;ll see if I can or cannot live without it after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Just got this eye cream, been an Obagi user for years.  I only have it a few days and I notice the difference already in firmness around my eyes and some reduction in puffiness!  Pretty excited to see this so quick.  I&#x27;m very hopeful this product will help to make some correction giving some time.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Eminence.  I found them in a spa in Colorado and started using their products.  I have switched around quite a bit with face care products, trying to find the most natural.  I don&#x27;t use all their products, but have been very happy with eye gel (more of a cream) and their chamomile cleanser.  I also like that their products appear to be all natural.</li>
            <li> Does not feel like an eye gel but more like a cream. It&#x27;s very smooth, silky, and my skin absorbs it quickly. Unlike other eye creams that just sit on my skin I can feel this &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; firm my eyes. One pump does go a LONG way (too much for me) so I just use half a pump for both my eyes. It smells like an actual cucumber, like dirt and water but not in a gross way. It smells natural not artificial. I have violet-red under eyes from birth, not dark circles (I&#x27;m a fair skinned male) but this cream calmed my uneven tone! My eyes finally look healthy!</li>
            <li> My fiancee and I went for facials at a very nice day spa, and the esthetician recommended this product to him...at almost triple the cost! I always buy products through Amazon and when I saw this on here at this price, I was thrilled! Will buy again when we&#x27;re out!</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles forever, and have tried an abundance of products that promise results.  This Cucumber Eye Gel actually delivers.  There has been a noticeable reduction in the dark circles in a couple weeks, I suspect with continued use I will be able to toss my collection of concealers.  Not so impressed with how it works on puffiness, as I chose this for both.  But for dark circles, this is a winner!</li>
            <li> I just apply very small amount of it around the eyes. I felt like the skin around the eyes became tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this formula during the day for relief from eye strain. The cucumber is relaxing &amp; pleasant to the eyes. I was have some issues with the skin around my eyes from an older eye product that produced puffiness &amp; lines. Once I discarded that product &amp; used Eminence all those skin issues have gone away.</li>
            <li> I can really notice a big difference in the puffiness under my eyes. It has decreased dramatically. I don&#x27;t have any deep wrinkles around my eyes so nothing noticeable there.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye cream I have tried ever. I know it works great because when I ran out of it for a month I thought oh I&#x27;ll get something different but soon my puffiness and my little allergy bags under my eyes came back. I quickly ordered it andwithin a week of me using this product they started to get better. This is my third bottle and the price is so much better on Amazon then from my anesthetician love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using daily for about a month, and actually I don&#x27;t have any more puffiness, but I&#x27;m still going to use it every day!</li>
            <li> Love both the eye gel and the eye cream. I layer them on top of each other when I need a boost.</li>
            <li> I am re-ordering because it&#x27;s the first product that actually reduces my morning puffiness.  And it&#x27;s organic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The is an honest review with no hidden motives.  Think I might try their other products.</li>
            <li> This gel really does help with puffiness under the eyes.  I especially appreciate its lack of toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love Eminence products.  However, I honestly do not see a difference to my under eye circles after using this product for months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for year now, love it!</li>
            <li> This is more like a lotion than gel, at least the one I got.  No matter how far from my eyes I put it, it always seeps in and burns!</li>
            <li> Eminence is my favorite brand of face products and this gel doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
