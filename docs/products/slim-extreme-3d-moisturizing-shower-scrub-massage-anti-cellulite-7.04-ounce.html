            <li>Then next day I wasn&#x27;t happy about it after try 5 times again.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this as much as I should be but item seems to have some kind of effect when I use it.</li>
            <li>Its OK, didn&#x27;t see much of any results.</li>

            <li>I have used this particular producte twice.</li>
            <li>Due to my own negligence in consistent usage, I cannot offer a review on cumulative benefits; otherwise, I have absolutely no doubt</li>
            <li>it makes it soooo soft</li>
            <li>Or just the scrub for soft skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft after and helps diminish the look of cellulite for me.</li>
            <li>and it always arrives early.</li>
            <li>If I use this along with the Slim Extreme 3D Thermo active gel it plus the hot water of a shower it really helps to absorb the thermo gel, however I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product alone as it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>

            <li> this stuff makes my skin so soft and smooth, Then I use the 3d warming gel for cellulite and they work great together. Or just the scrub for soft skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference since I started using it. Great scrub but hasn&#x27;t helped my cellulite. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This has been working very good on my cellulite. My thighs feel alot more smooth and slimmer.</li>

            <li> Make my skin feel good and tight.</li>
            <li> I must admit, this stuff is INSANE.  I immediately see the result on my thighs and my skin feels the smoothest I have ever felt!</li>
            <li> This scrub has left my skin feeling the softest and smoothest than any other scrub that I have tried. Due to my own negligence in consistent usage, I cannot offer a review on cumulative benefits; otherwise, I have absolutely no doubt I&#x27;d see huge improvements in my skin as well as cellulite diminishment. When I do use it, my skin feels like silk and moisturizer is not even necessary. This is definitely a superior body scrub that I recommend highly and that I am glad is available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love love this Brand. Always leaves my skin so soft!!! I have used this particular producte twice. And i love it!!! I would recommend using a mit over your hand. But its amazing. YOu will feel the difference. Also, use it with the other 3D products.</li>

            <li> Evertime I order from this seller they ship the product super fast and it always arrives early. This scrub is very nice - I don&#x27;t know if it is reducing the appearance of cellulite or not, but it is definitley making my skin feel smoother. I also use the Diamond 4D anti-cellulite cream along with this.</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing in the shower.  Love the feel.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this as much as I should be but item seems to have some kind of effect when I use it. My skin feels better regardless of the slimming effect.</li>
