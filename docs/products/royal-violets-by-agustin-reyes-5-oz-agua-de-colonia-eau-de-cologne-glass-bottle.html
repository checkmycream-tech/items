            <li>Hmmm... I must be in the minority because I read the other reviews based on the \\&quot;fresh &amp; light scent\\</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is originally from Miami and he grew up on this stuff, so I was introduced to this cologne recently.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE the sweet, subtle scent.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Such a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This is a very inexpensive \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; cologne, but it does have a true, simple and clean violet scent and is long lasting without being obnoxious.</li>
            <li>A very old fashioned type of scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cologne since I was too young to put it on myself.  </li>
            <li>but I like it as an adult.  </li>

            <li>I was disappointed as I thought this would be light and lovely.  </li>
            <li>It is difficult to review a product which is so highly dependent on the individual tastes of so many of us.</li>

            <li> I use to use it on my kids when they were little, always after a bath.  </li>

            <li> Aged to a totally brown, harsh, and fairly unpleasant liquid.</li>

            <li> This is a vile smelling product.  Does nots smell anything at all like violets.  It just smell like an old cheap cologne. I would recommend Yardley April Violets if you want a good smelling, long lasting violet scent of a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL CLEAN FRESH SCENT. EVEN PUT SOME IN THE WASH FOR GREAT SMELL ON CHILDRENS CLOTHES.</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with Royal Violets by Agustin Reyes as my family used it for years. it was a staple in our house when my girls were little. I decided to buy it for my grandkids and because it is not readily available in stores here in Ga. I decided to order through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived in a timely manner and very well packaged, however; upon opening I found the product to be defective. It had a rancid smell not at all like the pleasant smell we were expecting.I did message the company and informed them the product was defective . They were very apologetic and refunded my money without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, the company acted responsibly and this issue was settled without any hassles. Very Satisfied!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect first fragrance for a baby. For me personally, it&#x27;s the fragrance of the loving, sweet and gentle tenderness mommy has for her precious bundle of joy. It&#x27;s the same fragrance. I remember as a child; the same I put on my children, 2 boys and 2 girls, which now put Royal Violets on their children, and splash some on themselves, too. Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t find the Royal Violets close to home-Southwestern PA-so, I was glad to find it on Amazon.com. the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of violets, although it seems to be one of the more difficult flower scents to reproduce.  This is a very inexpensive \\&quot;drug store\\&quot; cologne, but it does have a true, simple and clean violet scent and is long lasting without being obnoxious. Because it is so \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; you can be creative and scent your linens and wash with it as well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something other than violets working here.  It has a strange \\&quot;under smell\\&quot; that I couldn&#x27;t stand.  I put some on my arm and could hardly wash it off it was so strong.  It bugged me to death until I finally scrubbed it off.  I was disappointed as I thought this would be light and lovely.  It&#x27;s not... it&#x27;s heavy and strange.  It&#x27;s in the Goodwill bag.</li>
            <li> Always used this on my kids and still use it to spray my linens. Love it! Is a fresh, sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li> This cologne is absolutely a winner. I use it on my 5 grandkids. They all love it and ask for it! Amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using Royal Violets for years.  I use to use it on my kids when they were little, always after a bath.  Today, I use it after my showers and i absolutely love the clean, fresh smell.  I always get compliments on how fresh smelling it is.  I even had to get my bank teller a bottle because she just loved it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not big on strong perfumes, so i just use my RV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Cant&#x27;t get enough of this perfume!  Bought the spray bottle, as well.  Subtle, pretty, but clearly there.  I love it, and so do my daughters!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product it was used on me as a child and now I am able to share this with my daughter for my grandchildren. Every one who ever smells it just loves it perfect for new babies.</li>
            <li> I am a violet perfume fan so I tried this item, especially because of the price, and found that the scent was not so violet.  The first spray was of violet but quickly turned into a very old fashioned strong powdery scent that I could not wear.</li>
            <li> CUSTOMER RELATIONS WAS EXCELLENT! THIS IS MY FAVORITE SMELL FROM MIAMI WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne since I was too young to put it on myself.  My mom always put a bit of this on our hair when we were kids and as we grew we continued using it and then as we became parents there was always a bottle in the house.  Now I make sure that my grandkids get a bottle before they are born :-)  My son says it reminds him of being comforted when he would get the flu.  We used it in health and sickness.  When we were sick the scent was a comfort - a reminder that we were loved and cared for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since childhood. I love it. I have allergies so most perfumes and colognes make my sinuses burn and my nose run. Not so with Royal Violets. It&#x27;s so mild it&#x27;s considered a baby cologne. Fortunately, this means that it doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction at all. I even wear it to bed. I just LOVE the sweet, subtle scent. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Received before expected delivery, in secure, double packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up in Miami and one of my Mom&#x27;s favorite memories is putting this on my as a baby. She recently mentioned this to me 37 years later, thanks to this seller and Amazon - I&#x27;m going to make one Mama very happy this Christmas!</li>
            <li> Awesome fresh smell love it</li>
            <li> What a treat to receive this cologne.  It REALLY smells like Spring Violets! It is almost impossible to find perfume, cologne, or powder in a Violet scent as all they are is SWEET. But AGUSTIN REYES has found the secret! This cologne is just perfect!  Spring Violets!  I hope you try it and enjoy it too as I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> use it as a wearable fragrance, it is not too strong but does last more than i thought it would. that is good. will probably order it again when i use this up.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is originally from Miami and he grew up on this stuff, so I was introduced to this cologne recently. If happy had a scent, it would be this stuff. I enjoy putting a smaller amount in my hair after a shower, and even a few dabs on my pillow at night. Such a fresh scent. Definately a great buy!!</li>
            <li> Growing up my Aunt used to use this on her kids and still uses it for herself. I love how this product reminds me of my childhood.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Always had it in the house as children but I like it as an adult.  Mild and never overpowering.</li>
            <li> As every Cuban knows, our mothers used Royal Violets in our hair from the time we were born.  I used it with my children, and now with my grandchildren.  It&#x27;s hard to find it in California (vs. Miami), so I was very pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon, and at a great price.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Ok--well this is coming from a guy--so I found out that woman love the smell of this product and they particularly love splashing it on after they shower. Woman also love the smell of this product on the sheets. It gives the sheets a fresh clean smell. As for men, Well I think you will appreciate the welcoming scent this products provide not only to the ladies, but also between the sheets---</li>
            <li> Hmmm... I must be in the minority because I read the other reviews based on the \\&quot;fresh &amp; light scent\\&quot; others spoke of. For me at least &amp; in my humble opinion this smelled VERY strong, heavy &amp; old...like something an elderly person might be expected to wear. Smelled very old fashioned, very powdery &amp;  couldn&#x27;t tell if a man or woman should be wearing this &amp; unfortunately I really dislike this scent! I just gave my two dogs a bath &amp; used it as doggy cologne &amp; it smells ok on them! Gave 2 stars because the price was very reasonable &amp; you do get a huge bottle &amp; I will use it on my pups.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to review a product which is so highly dependent on the individual tastes of so many of us. This product was not to my own as it sort of reminded me of something my grandmother would have purchased at Woolworth&#x27;s. It very very potent and long enduring. Even after washing my hands several times I could not totally remove it, so try it out before you use it on your pillowcases!</li>
            <li> Our family has been using this product for years. It has not changed and remains affordable. It is just hard to find in local stores unless you live in Miami.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter and I loved Royal Violets. I grew up oversees and that was my very favorite cologne. Thanks.</li>
            <li> A very old fashioned type of scent. Cannot describe it really. Have used it before. Not a real true violet scent but nice.</li>
            <li> Aged to a totally brown, harsh, and fairly unpleasant liquid. Nothing like the scent of violets I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Super happy got exactly what I wanted and earlier than expected !!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment...love the product. Thank you</li>
            <li> it had a tiny scent of violets</li>
            <li> a special fragance that my Cuban mom always used when I was a child ..... I still love it.  I also used it for my grandchildren.</li>
            <li> My cuban grandmother used to buy this for all of her grandbabies.  She would rub just a dab in their hair.  Its a very light, clean scent and somehow manages to smell exactly like a fresh, clean baby.  My sister recently had a baby and i overheard her lameng that she didnt have any &amp;#34;baby head perfume&amp;#34; thankfully i was able to remember the real name of it, and Amazon to the rescue.</li>
            <li> I think this product has a nice light scent. I use it as more of a springtime fragrance and I also think that it smells really nice on babies. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
