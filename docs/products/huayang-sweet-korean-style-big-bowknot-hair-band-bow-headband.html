            <li>Vey cheap and pretty I am so happy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute head band but cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Just wish they would secure the material to the headband better.</li>
            <li>but the pearls fall off easily.</li>
            <li>but it looks like it might break easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute.</li>
            <li>Super cute.</li>
            <li>I received the head band a week before its due date and I just love it, it could have been better made but the product is so cute, love love love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Looks cheap, like it will soon fall apart.</li>
            <li>It is gold and pearls are free moving and dangle somewhat...</li>
            <li>but overall it looks great.</li>
            <li>The headband is super cute and worth the price.</li>
            <li>so I was able to wear it the whole day at work.</li>
            <li>It really looks cheap!</li>
            <li>Plus I genuinely feel I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It is not too tight on my head and it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>Received it really quick.</li>
            <li>and they super glued some pearls on it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as described and very pretty.</li>
            <li>overall very cute.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>But cute and comfortable enough.  </li>
            <li>Such a nice accessory.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s definitely not a high-quality headband, but it looks incredible on, and it adds a charm to whatever look you&#x27;re going for that day.</li>
            <li>really looks lovely when my curly hair is in a messy bun, doesn&#x27;t stick out too much which is great.</li>
            <li>Looked nice, but I have an American size head (large!)</li>
            <li>iT IS GEORGEous right now.</li>
            <li>but when it gets older I fear it will fade and not look so nice but only time will tell.  </li>
            <li>The pearls are pretty secured on</li>
            <li>This is pretty</li>
            <li>This headband arrived exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>They are exactly as seen on the picture.</li>
            <li>And that is exactly what this headband is.</li>
            <li>Please be aware when you purchase this.</li>
            <li>Just a dab of hot glue</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>Sometimes quality doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not going to get a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, but not something that I would wear for long hours.</li>
            <li>When it arrived (much sooner than anticipated), the pearls stood out in the headband when worn.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>look very sturdy which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the pieces of gold so much</li>
            <li>I had a problem with the ends of the headband wanting to unwrap (uhg, every cheap headband ever), but that&#x27;s a simple fix with some glue.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that they would put it together a little more sturdily than just fishing wire.</li>
            <li>less cute in person.</li>
            <li>Cute, don&#x27;t know how long they will last but also didn&#x27;t pay much</li>
            <li>It looks great in dark hair because the black headband basically disappears.</li>
            <li>It looks cute and not cheap.</li>
            <li>I love how the black of the headband appears seamless and it looks like a broach</li>
            <li>It was sad to see that for it being so beautiful that it was only held together by bascially fishing line.</li>
            <li>Only reason for four of five stars is after about a week of use the fishing wire used to string the beads to the band came lose but nothing a little super couldn&#x27;t fix!!</li>
            <li>They have like this clear robber band thing to tie all the pearl onto the head band</li>
            <li>I easily fixed it.</li>
            <li>This item arrived about a weeks early.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I hate to wear headbands at times, so very happy this one is loser!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for casual or formal occasions.</li>
            <li>It came on Chinese New Year, and I&#x27;m thankful.</li>
            <li>I wanted a headband with pearls &amp; so far, this is the only one I found in amazon.</li>
            <li>Arrived a little later than the estimated time but was worth the wait.</li>

            <li> It came on Chinese New Year, and I&#x27;m thankful.</li>
            <li> I wanted a headband with pearls &amp; so far, this is the only one I found in amazon.</li>
            <li> Arrived a little later than the estimated time but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> You can see that they&#x27;re attached by a thin clear wire if you look underneath the headband, but once you put it on, all you see are pretty pearls! ^^ would definitely recommend this headband, especially because it is not too tight like a lot of other headbands.</li>
            <li> , it also came almost a week later then expected</li>
            <li> its what i expected except that the section of beads seems much bigger in these photos than in person.  </li>
            <li> So far it has held up to everyday wear.</li>
            <li> the only slight problem is that the rings the pearls can on was open where two came off but its fixable with no real problem</li>
            <li> Can get a bit tangled with your hair, so be careful.</li>
            <li> The head band is small and the pearl are not line up equally</li>
            <li> because if I take my time it&#x27;s definitely fixable, I&#x27;m just too lazy to break out the glue &amp; fix it.</li>
            <li> The only negative factor about it is it did start falling apart after the 4 times I wore it.</li>
            <li> Delicate enough not to see the actual headband if your hair is thick.</li>
            <li> the headband came apart less than 40 mins of opening the packaging and putting it on.</li>
            <li> It looks like someone assembled it in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> IT HAS LESS PEARLS THAN WHAT IT SHOWS IN THE PICTURE ...</li>
            <li> Picture is deceiving slightly</li>
            <li> Until the black ribbon around the headband started to unravel.</li>
            <li> You can put it with any type of clothing for a little pop of cuteness.</li>
            <li> Yes it may hurt you head from pressure a little bit</li>
            <li> Looks a little cheapy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Will be giving these to my granddaughter for her 7th birthday in a few days.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a plain head band</li>
            <li> Not good material not as expected</li>
            <li> On a side note, this hairband is a bit small</li>
            <li> but they are small and you can&#x27;t see them well.  </li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not sure what will happen if that break..</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that the pearls hang and they do, but the pictures shows that.</li>
            <li> NO GOOD,</li>
            <li> and was uncomfortable and too small</li>
            <li> Not really happy with the quality but got what u pay!</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t bad for the price</li>
            <li> and when I put it on it was painful.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good quality with charming appear.</li>
            <li> I love this headband. You can put it with any type of clothing for a little pop of cuteness. Yes it may hurt you head from pressure a little bit but that&#x27;s how headbands just are so its not a big deal. And plus you won&#x27;t feel it until after wearing it for quite a couple hours</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute. and the headband fits well. It&#x27;s worth the price that&#x27;s for sure. The pearls are pretty secured on so I&#x27;m really glad that i won&#x27;t have to worry if they ever fall off. :&#x27;)</li>
            <li> I was hesitant buying this hairband coz there were no reviews on it yet. I wanted a headband with pearls &amp; so far, this is the only one I found in amazon. When it arrived (much sooner than anticipated), the pearls stood out in the headband when worn. On a side note, this hairband is a bit small but when I wore it, I&#x27;m just so glad that it&#x27;s comfy &amp; didn&#x27;t give me headache so I was able to wear it the whole day at work. This may not be the case if your head is bigger.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s as described and very pretty. The band is made of metal wrapped in a ribbon so it&#x27;s sturdy and the pearls wriggle around. Very well made.</li>
            <li> Looks a little cheapy</li>
            <li> This is pretty and I got a lot of compliments but it gave me a headache. I don&#x27;t were it anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute head band but cheaply made. I guess you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve worn it once and it&#x27;s already falling apart.</li>
            <li> I like the headband the only slight problem is that the rings the pearls can on was open where two came off but its fixable with no real problem so I give them 4 stars, it also came almost a week later then expected but I blame that on holiday traffic.</li>
            <li> the headband came apart less than 40 mins of opening the packaging and putting it on. It was sad to see that for it being so beautiful that it was only held together by bascially fishing line. I was really hoping that they would put it together a little more sturdily than just fishing wire.</li>
            <li> I think the hairpin is not as beautiful as the picture.I think if you delete the pearls it will be much better.</li>
            <li> This band is very cute I wore it to work today and got many compliments. Vey cheap and pretty I am so happy</li>
            <li> This headband arrived exactly as pictured. I wore it all day and it never dug into my head or felt uncomfortable, I would definitely recommend it if you want something affordable and stylish.</li>
            <li> Fits great and looks great with lots of cloth. Delicate enough not to see the actual headband if your hair is thick.</li>
            <li> My daughter really loved it. Received it really quick. Can get a bit tangled with your hair, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I waited a month to get this and when I put it on it was painful.  A couple of the pearls were glued to the inside of the headband.  NO GOOD, but then again - You get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> Love this! So cute and adorable! Works well, blends great into the hair, and best of all, no too tight at you wear it throughout the day. One of the reasons I hate to wear headbands at times, so very happy this one is loser!</li>
            <li> Its cute, do not get me wrong. The only negative factor about it is it did start falling apart after the 4 times I wore it. ( ps my hair was in a ponytail.) For the price, I guess its okay. Just wish they would secure the material to the headband better.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money it&#x27;s just a plain head band and they super glued some pearls on it.  It really looks cheap!</li>
            <li> this headband looks sooo cute on. The quality not the best, but it was cheap.  It looks like someone assembled it in less than a minute. But cute and comfortable enough.  Scared it may fall apart, but has not, yet.</li>
            <li> Will be giving these to my granddaughter for her 7th birthday in a few days.  I know she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> its what i expected except that the section of beads seems much bigger in these photos than in person.  maybe I have a giant head, either way, less cute in person.</li>
            <li> Awesome Headband and very Cute! :)</li>
            <li> This hair piece is so much better in person.&lt;br /&gt;It is elegant, I think this is for all ages.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and wear it a lot these days...</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IN THE PICTURE... IT HAS LESS PEARLS THAN WHAT IT SHOWS IN THE PICTURE ...</li>
            <li> Arrived a little later than the estimated time but was worth the wait. It looks great in dark hair because the black headband basically disappears. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this product and the pearls look very sturdy which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. You can see that they&#x27;re attached by a thin clear wire if you look underneath the headband, but once you put it on, all you see are pretty pearls! ^^ would definitely recommend this headband, especially because it is not too tight like a lot of other headbands. This works perfectly for short hair!</li>
            <li> I love this, it is so cute! It&#x27;s good for casual or formal occasions. Such a nice accessory.</li>
            <li> The headband is super cute and worth the price. Only reason for four of five stars is after about a week of use the fishing wire used to string the beads to the band came lose but nothing a little super couldn&#x27;t fix!!</li>
            <li> Nothing like it looks like in the picture. Would not recommend to anyone. Looks cheap, like it will soon fall apart. Pearls get caught in hair.</li>
            <li> Super cute. I liked this but after reading the reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to buy them. I gambled my luck and purchased 2, after all they where only $2 dollars... and I&#x27;m so glad I did. They are exactly as seen on the picture. Some people have complained that the pearls hang and they do, but the pictures shows that. Just take a look up closer &amp; you&#x27;ll see that.&lt;br /&gt;Also super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Cute but the pearls fall off easily. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Looked nice, but I have an American size head (large!) and was uncomfortable and too small</li>
            <li> Broke the day we got it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the pieces of gold so much but they are small and you can&#x27;t see them well.  They look find now but when it gets older I fear it will fade and not look so nice but only time will tell.  iT IS GEORGEous right now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but not something that I would wear for long hours.</li>
            <li> The glue give-way after one month use...</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about.  Cute, don&#x27;t know how long they will last but also didn&#x27;t pay much</li>
            <li> I received the head band a week before its due date and I just love it, it could have been better made but the product is so cute, love love love</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this headband I get compliments on it and people asking me where I got it! It&#x27;s a total ace! I had a problem with the ends of the headband wanting to unwrap (uhg, every cheap headband ever), but that&#x27;s a simple fix with some glue. Overall, it&#x27;s definitely not a high-quality headband, but it looks incredible on, and it adds a charm to whatever look you&#x27;re going for that day. Sometimes quality doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not going to get a great product. And that is exactly what this headband is.</li>
            <li> I love this headband! It came on Chinese New Year, and I&#x27;m thankful. It does indeed add a nice touch with whatever you wear. Great price too.</li>
            <li> The perfect vintage headband that is perfect for curly hair, a special occasion or just everyday. I am very satisfied and will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> bought one for myself and one for a friend. really looks lovely when my curly hair is in a messy bun, doesn&#x27;t stick out too much which is great. So far it has held up to everyday wear.</li>
            <li> they use fishing line type. it was a bit flimsy looking so just to make sure i glued the ends to the band. overall very cute.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with the quality but got what u pay! The head band is small and the pearl are not line up equally</li>
            <li> I wish I can give you 0 star. After one time use, the hairband fell apart. Please be aware when you purchase this.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and the like ok of the product.</li>
            <li> It is gold and pearls are free moving and dangle somewhat... Picture is deceiving slightly but i like it and it isn&#x27;t bad for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this product and never received it. I have now waited over a month for it. It might have been cute if I had been able to see it.</li>
            <li> I love the look, but it arrived damaged.  There is just one string wrapped around the headband that holds the pearls on.  One end of the string wasn&#x27;t attached, but it is a very easy fix.  Just a dab of hot glue and it is good to go.  Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Not good material not as expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but it looks like it might break easily. They have like this clear robber band thing to tie all the pearl onto the head band so i&#x27;m not sure what will happen if that break.. but overall it looks great.</li>
            <li> I love this headband!! It&#x27;s so cute and all of my friends think it&#x27;s adorable. The beading almost broke off however big I easily fixed it.</li>
            <li> This item arrived about a weeks early. It&#x27;s as pictured and described. I didn&#x27;t realize the chains connecting the beads were gold, so they are lol</li>
            <li> I love how the black of the headband appears seamless and it looks like a broach but it is a headband.  It is not too tight on my head and it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairband!!! It fits nicely on my average-sized head. It looks cute and not cheap. It was so worth it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute. I like it.</li>
            <li> Cute accessory! Shipping was within the time quoted. I used to wear this all the time. Until the black ribbon around the headband started to unravel. I decided to give it 5 stars anyway because if I take my time it&#x27;s definitely fixable, I&#x27;m just too lazy to break out the glue &amp; fix it. Plus I genuinely feel I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
