            <li>The results on the skin are great, smells good and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for healthy skin</li>
            <li>and she reports that she is very happy with it and feels her skin looks a lot better.</li>
            <li>This oil extract is also good for anti-inflammation.  </li>
            <li>It is so good for massage.</li>
            <li>This produce looks, feels, smells sooooooooooooooooooooooo good.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>It works great on skin recovery after being in the Sun as well, and as advertised it does not feel oily yet leaves a healthy glow to the skin.  </li>
            <li>It apparently is very good for stretch marks and moisture, so pregnant women may find use of this.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>This helps you digest Vitamin C better into the body, and we know Vitamin C is a good anti-aging vitamin.</li>
            <li>Colette Lovely Glow is amazing.</li>
            <li>By far, this is the best product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I use this spray after a shower and after tanning (before tanning if in a stand up tanner) and my skin looks better and feels better every day.</li>
            <li>a bit better scented</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I would be glad if I had an answer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy and love it, though so does my wife.</li>
            <li>Love the Olive + Aloe Vera Oil.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, faint citrus aroma makes using it very pleasant</li>
            <li>I hope it goes without saying, that if you like the scent of lemon, chances are you&#x27;ll enjoy Colette Lovely Glow.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully not bad for skin!)</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing, glides on nice and really is glow-y.</li>
            <li>It has such a wonderful summer light citrus scent and soaks into my skin quickly leaving it</li>
            <li>it smells so strong</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice smell and, once applied, gives my skin a subtle sheen which makes it look dewey, healthy, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>so I took a chance and ordered this for under 7 bucks with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I will continue to enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I basically just spray it on and don&#x27;t even rub it in because I can get a light coverage just with the spray applicator.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing, relaxing and a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>This oil feels substantial, goes on smoothly, and absorbs into the skin well without leaving an oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>I love that it came with a spray top and a regular top.</li>
            <li>Smells like oranges going on but that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>loved the first bottle and came back for more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>The skin is left feeling soft - not greasy - with a very nice citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>and I need to use body oils right after shower</li>
            <li>right when I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>It takes quite a bit of product to get the soft feel on  your body, and the odor is a quite strong lemony pledge kinda aroma.</li>
            <li>What I have actually found interesting is that if I apply this to my face before I go shower, I end up feeling way softer when I come out of the shower.</li>
            <li>There is so much citrus in this oil!</li>
            <li>thanks Colette whoever you are!</li>
            <li>Will definitely help keep my face soft in these winter months, and keep my skin healthy in the summer!  </li>
            <li>Apparently it helps strengthen skin and is rich in collagen.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Aside from the pledge cleaning smell this product has, it truly does soak into the skin fast and help soften it.</li>
            <li>and I am always sandal ready.  </li>
            <li>it works, really well.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The ancient Romans and Greeks have yet to be trumped, as this tried and true product truly works wonders on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert and wear sandals all the time...</li>
            <li>I read a few comments that the smell was strong, but I have to disagree.  </li>
            <li>so silky soft and glowing like those swim suit models in the beach photos.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft, maybe even heals, I use it even on my face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my heels have ever been this soft.  </li>
            <li>With just a few sprays of this moisturizing oil, it absorbs quickly into my skin and replenishes the essential oils.</li>
            <li>I keep it next to bath tub, no mess thank to spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Much thicker and stickier than other body oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>- a big issue for me as I am a migraine sufferer and odors are a major initiator.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I also use it my 2 and 4 year olds to soothe dry winter skin and after-swimming skin.</li>
            <li> so I always had dry, flakey feet.  </li>
            <li> It helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I sent this as a gift for my daughter-in-law who has very dry skin</li>
            <li> My bottle lasted months...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t try the other.  </li>
            <li> Remaining: Olive leaf extract, Aloe, Green tea leaf extract, blanco</li>
            <li> but then my skin would get less attention if everyone knew about it and used it!</li>
            <li> a hard lemon smell is not sexy</li>
            <li> so i hardly ever use it</li>
            <li> This was difficult to find.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is not the best body oil product on the market.  It takes quite a bit of product to get the soft feel on  your body, and the odor is a quite strong lemony pledge kinda aroma.</li>
            <li> Colette Lovely Glow is amazing. I recently joined a swimming class and the chlorine leaves my skin very dry. With just a few sprays of this moisturizing oil, it absorbs quickly into my skin and replenishes the essential oils. The skin is left feeling soft - not greasy - with a very nice citrus scent.  You have to try this!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!!!!!!! It has such a wonderful summer light citrus scent and soaks into my skin quickly leaving it so silky soft and glowing like those swim suit models in the beach photos. Doesn&#x27;t make you look greasy or shiny. Just a perfect glow of radiant skin. My fiance loves the way my skin feels. The winter weather has done nothing to help my skin do anything but dry out. Plus I recently started tanning so that&#x27;s adding to skin damage. I use this spray after a shower and after tanning (before tanning if in a stand up tanner) and my skin looks better and feels better every day. I would recommend this to everyone but then my skin would get less attention if everyone knew about it and used it! lol</li>
            <li> it smells so strong a hard lemon smell is not sexy so i hardly ever use it i was hoping for something a bit better scented</li>
            <li> It smells like a wonderful lemon dessert.  I hope it goes without saying, that if you like the scent of lemon, chances are you&#x27;ll enjoy Colette Lovely Glow.  I am one who loves lemon scent so I took a chance and ordered this for under 7 bucks with free shipping.  I am very glad I did.  It came with two caps, one is the pump sprayer that was on the bottle and the other was just a regular cap that allows you to pour it.  I like the pump so didn&#x27;t try the other.  It goes on nicely and isn&#x27;t sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: At the time I bought this, I wondered, as had another reviewer, if it&#x27;s tested on animals.  Since then, the product description has been updated to say \\&quot;no animal testing\\&quot; which is terrific.</li>
            <li> Smells like oranges going on but that fades quickly. Much thicker and stickier than other body oils I&#x27;ve used. On the plus side, it does make you \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;. Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Makes your skin soft, maybe even heals, I use it even on my face.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. The results on the skin are great, smells good and is not sticky. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and I need to use body oils right after shower, lotions don&#x27;t help. By far, this is the best product. I keep it next to bath tub, no mess thank to spray bottle. And the smell... I can write pages about that lemony smell. My only concern is that I don&#x27;t know if Colette is tested on animals. I would be glad if I had an answer.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for healthy skin I&#x27;ve yet to encounter.  The ancient Romans and Greeks have yet to be trumped, as this tried and true product truly works wonders on dry skin.  It works great on skin recovery after being in the Sun as well, and as advertised it does not feel oily yet leaves a healthy glow to the skin.  My wife and I will continue to enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Aside from the pledge cleaning smell this product has, it truly does soak into the skin fast and help soften it. Will definitely help keep my face soft in these winter months, and keep my skin healthy in the summer!  EDIT: What I have actually found interesting is that if I apply this to my face before I go shower, I end up feeling way softer when I come out of the shower. This is a plus because I don&#x27;t look greasy, but feel soft and smooth after the shower instead of dried out as usual!  My only concern? There is so much citrus in this oil! So, worried about what that was doing to my skin, I began to look it up.  All Listed Ingredients On Bottle:  *Citrus Reticulata: I have found this is the plant name of Mandarin and Tangerine oils. It apparently is very good for stretch marks and moisture, so pregnant women may find use of this.  *Citrus aurantium dulcis: The Scientific name of Orange extract! This helps you digest Vitamin C better into the body, and we know Vitamin C is a good anti-aging vitamin. This oil extract is also good for anti-inflammation.  *Tocopherol: This is Vitamin E. Enough said.  *Citrus medica limonum: This is a lemon, so that is where the lemon scent comes from. It fights blemishes, improve oily complexions, antiviral properties.  *Citrus paradisi-macf: This is Grapefruit Seed Extract. I have found no moisturizing elements to this seed (but I believe it has Vitamin C and E in it), but rather anti-viral and immune boosting elements.  *Citrus Maxima: This was difficult to find. It is called a Pomelo, an Asian fruit. Apparently it helps strengthen skin and is rich in collagen.  Remaining: Olive leaf extract, Aloe, Green tea leaf extract, blanco (if anyone knows what blanco does, let me know, but I think it is just a coloring agent. Hopefully not bad for skin!)</li>
            <li> WISH I COULD GET MORE!!</li>
            <li> I use this at the end of the shower. It smells refreshing, glides on nice and really is glow-y. I also use it my 2 and 4 year olds to soothe dry winter skin and after-swimming skin. I love that it came with a spray top and a regular top.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and wear sandals all the time...so I always had dry, flakey feet.  But not anymore!  I just spray this oil onto my feet and my legs right when I get out of the shower and I am always sandal ready.  I read a few comments that the smell was strong, but I have to disagree.  It just smells like orange peel and it not at all overpowering or even &#x27;girly&#x27;.  Bottom line...it works, really well.  I don&#x27;t think my heels have ever been this soft.  And, its not a chore to use...I basically just spray it on and don&#x27;t even rub it in because I can get a light coverage just with the spray applicator.  Great stuff...thanks Colette whoever you are!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame they make this product so feminine. I&#x27;m a guy and love it, though so does my wife. I&#x27;ve had all types of problems with my skin and have prescriptions. If I use this regularly I don&#x27;t need the prescription.</li>
            <li> This body oil has my stamp of approval. I&#x27;m a repeat customer--loved the first bottle and came back for more.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell and, once applied, gives my skin a subtle sheen which makes it look dewey, healthy, and beautiful. My bottle lasted months...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I sent this as a gift for my daughter-in-law who has very dry skin and she reports that she is very happy with it and feels her skin looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> Love the Olive + Aloe Vera Oil. It is so good for massage. Very soothing, relaxing and a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> This produce looks, feels, smells sooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I love it. Worth every dollar. I hope you all like it. It helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This oil feels substantial, goes on smoothly, and absorbs into the skin well without leaving an oily feeling.  Wonderful, faint citrus aroma makes using it very pleasant - a big issue for me as I am a migraine sufferer and odors are a major initiator.  I recommend it highly.</li>
