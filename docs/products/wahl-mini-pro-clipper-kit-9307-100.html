    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for travelling</li>
            <li>which it does perfectly</li>
            <li>My barber recommended this to me and the product has held up perfectly every time.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly just like i imagine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no wonder that this set is perfect.</li>
            <li>Again, you already know that this product doesn&#x27;t have them, and at this price, it&#x27;s a great deal without them.</li>
            <li>and it works great</li>
            <li>For my money, this is a great beard and mustache trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great service.</li>
            <li>I bought one (on sale) at Amazon for about $17, and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>These are of excellent quality and have a nice variety of guard sizes.</li>
            <li>Great for trimming around the hairline and for areas where the hair may be thinning.</li>
            <li>I just love it!!</li>
            <li>Working good.</li>
            <li>and I feel it does that good.</li>
            <li>Not that good as looked in the picture.</li>
            <li>The boyfriend loved it.</li>
            <li>Wahl used to be a good clipper.  </li>
            <li>It was a give, good price good product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The size and weight are nice compared to full size clippers, and the price is very good for what you get.  </li>
            <li>The Wahl Compact Clipper Kit is wonderfully compact, works well, and certainly does the job it is intended to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect beginners set and even comes with instructions on how to cut certain hair.</li>
            <li>No problem at all of any kind.</li>
            <li>When i used this clipper i can honestly say that it was the fastest way to remove body hair rather than shaving or applying a hair remover.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think these clippers deserve the -1 star I gave them.</li>
            <li>handy hair cutter system for shaved head.</li>
            <li>The drawstring travel bag was an excellent surprise, very practical.</li>
            <li>and we use these in the shop with great success - know what you are buying.</li>
            <li>Still using my old mini clippers that I bought in Walmart and they are great!</li>
            <li>Over all it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I am glad I did, because I am now satisfied with the Mini-Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall i am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li>Love the silver finished on this partiuclar clipper</li>
            <li>This trimmer is perfect for the ENTIRE body.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>Noisy, but no worse than the battery operated models and works great.  </li>
            <li>got this for my beard works good powerful yet compact</li>
            <li>With so many pieces</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to see why the Wahl P&#x27;nut is still a favorite with so many.</li>
            <li>just great .had 4 others .nothing as good as this little devil.</li>
            <li>Attachments for the Mini-Pro go on easily, remove easily, and stay on during use.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, and the length of time I&#x27;ve enjoyed it, I&#x27;m proud to say that my next trimmer will be a Wahl as well.</li>
            <li>I have a Wahl Cordless Super Pocket Pro Clipper that works awesome for trimming my face when my beard gets too long.  </li>
            <li>These small clippers are great for getting between the eyes of our schnauzer and for touching up between grooming.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for is still true today.</li>
            <li>It is only good for feet pads and ears, that is why it is a mini.  </li>
            <li>This set comes with everything that you need to cut (if you use your trimmers for a full cut), trim, and line.</li>
            <li>It trims every hair evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li>It also gets hot relatively quickly; I have to shave her face in two goes because I have to stop to let the metal cool</li>
            <li>I purchased the same clipper about 5 years ago at Walmart (still going strong) and now purchased another through Amazon with the thought that the first one surely will give out someday (maybe).</li>
            <li>so it could be too small for trimming your head, but for everything else, it is perfect and above all, the price is right.</li>
            <li>but the noise is much higher</li>
            <li>the head gets too hot to touch</li>
            <li>Had I been able to touch and feel prior to purchase</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do this often, but you can imagine how much that must hurt when it yanks hair around her eyes!</li>
            <li>the corded version has more power and the smaller size makes beard trimming easier.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many full-sized trimmers, and those, despite being larger, have much quieter motors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this clipper because I&#x27;ve had good luck with Wahl in the past, I wanted a corded model and the description specifically states MADE IN THE U.S.A.  </li>
            <li>It takes it down to a nice stubble that I can manage with a razor.  </li>
            <li>Just what he was looking for and just the right size to clean up his facial hair.</li>
            <li>They do a pretty decent job because the barber always gives me compliments.</li>
            <li>That really breaks your rhythm since you are always worried about it.  </li>
            <li>This clipper packs a punch and seems to be very reliable.</li>
            <li>The Wahl 9307-100 Mini Pro is sold for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think clippers should irritate the skin that much.</li>
            <li>And, do you really need batteries?  </li>
            <li>I only clean it and oil it when I remember -</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be the same quality of clipper that Wahl makes in full size.</li>
            <li>The only things that would make it any better would be (1) the aforementioned adjustable head, and (2) cordless.</li>
            <li>The unit I purchased from a local department store nearly 8 years ago has been a true and steady trimmer when I needed one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>His old Wahl 9307-100 still worked, but it was getting pretty old.  </li>
            <li>it goes at full power for as long as you need.</li>
            <li>huge issue that I and other users have with</li>
            <li>This is more appropriate for hair trimming rather than hair cutting.</li>
            <li>Make sure you realize how small this is</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just I would love for them to have an adjustable head for small adjustments between the comb sizes.</li>
            <li>Works really well, really light, small and compact</li>
            <li>They are not sharp enough and my little dog&#x27;s hair if very fine.</li>
            <li>Overall, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m too upset since it was so cheap, but I&#x27;d rather Have spent twice what I did for something that isn&#x27;t a headache.</li>
            <li>The noise is loud, but manageable.  </li>
            <li>Replaced an old Wahl chargeable with this plug in version.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as loud as some corded mini clippers and performs well .</li>
            <li>and they were old and rather dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a professional groomer</li>
            <li>This trimmer is so loud that I wouldn&#x27;t advise anyone to use it near his ears.</li>
            <li>and I have to break from body trimming for it to cool down</li>
            <li>The guards are very sharp, but some light sanding on the tips got rid of some edges left over from the molding process.  </li>
            <li>By Aug 2011, the new Wahl no long worked and my husband was back to using his old one.  </li>
            <li>it is small and weighs a lot less then my old one, very easy to use</li>
            <li>However,  it barely took any fur off with each stroke.  </li>
            <li>I threw it directly in the trash can and didn&#x27;t bother to send it back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now the power is starting to wane, some days it behaves as if it were young again, and on others it shows its age with inexplicably low RPM&#x27;s, cleaning and/or oiling</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t flashy, or spectacular, and like some others have mentioned, it is made in china; but it is certainly simple and reliable.</li>
            <li>All this is ok, but where my real complaint is with the motor.  </li>
            <li>This product is small and yet powerful.</li>
            <li>but I recently shaved her whole body down.</li>

            <li> All this is ok, but where my real complaint is with the motor.  </li>
            <li> This product is small and yet powerful.</li>
            <li> but I recently shaved her whole body down.</li>
            <li> It was not like the typical Wahl clipperbut was a cheap made in China replica of something you might see next to the Gingsu knives late at night on TV.</li>
            <li> It cut me head at least 3 times the first minute</li>
            <li> I do not use the Mini-Pro for anything other than beard and mustache trimming, so I cannot speak to the suitability of this unit for other tasks such as first haircuts and haircut touch-ups; other users with experiences in those areas can comment.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last long at all.</li>
            <li> The long comb it comes with is cheap and difficult to use (flimsy and is permanently bent from shipping).  </li>
            <li> give the Mini-Pro 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for minor annoyances like the stunningly cheap drawstring storage bag and the uselessly flimsy barber comb.</li>
            <li> this little trimmer is the best I have ever had,if your sick of your rechargeable running out of power like i was get this ,no more losing power halfway through your trim..will buy again if this ever breaks down.</li>
            <li> However, I would recommend these for light pet grooming maybe, not for cutting people hair.  </li>
            <li> Product is as expected.</li>
            <li> In over a year of use, it hasn&#x27;t jammed or gotten stuck once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be gifting a few of my family members with this set in the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Long cord and powerful, I trim my facial hair in under a minute which used to take minutes before and bad results too.</li>
            <li> I have been trimming my hair for 13 years now and my other trimmer gave up the ghost</li>
            <li> not much more than her back was done because I noticed it was giving her razer burn.</li>
            <li> second pair of clippers bought,but caution,do not drop on a hard floor or they will stop working.best clipper i ever bought.</li>
            <li> At least the trucker who delivered this purchase to me and the trucker who will be bringing it back to Amazon still have jobs...</li>
            <li> It struggles and slows down almost to the point of jamming.  </li>
            <li> The motor started to get less and less power until it eventually just wouldn&#x27;t cut anymore.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this problem with her previous clippers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not ever tried to use it for a haircut or even for neckline, but it does sufficiently keep a beard presentable, and mows through a mess of tangled chest hair with ease.</li>
            <li> Thank you little trimmer</li>
            <li> One doesn&#x27;t even stay clipped onto cutting head and they are all overly large for self-trimming beard, moustache around nose, around ears, etc.</li>
            <li> If you go a bit too fast it pulls hair instead if cutting.  </li>
            <li> Heavy for it&#x27;s size which means it sould be durable.</li>
            <li> I have a few and they are made in USA and basically indestructible.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something small and narrow to get around her eyes and nose easier.</li>
            <li> but then i thought why just not use it for everywhere else since it&#x27;s so small and versatile.</li>
            <li> Small cutter head and noisy in operation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is because of the trimmer or her skin,</li>
            <li> Thought I was purchasing just a small set, not edgers.</li>
            <li> It finally got to the point where repeating the same area began to become annoying to the dog, so I took him into Petco instead.  </li>
            <li> do not seem to change its mood on its slow days, and on extended uses (20-30 min continuous)</li>
            <li> Looked a long time to find trimmer/clipper that was not rechargeable as all those either the battery or the charger went bad.</li>
            <li> This is not a full size hair cutting kit.  </li>
            <li> I thought the Mini Pro would just as well and save me from always replacing batteries as it is wall powered unit, but it just annoyingly pulls at my facial hair and does little in terms of cutting.</li>
            <li> I like that part, but the attachments for depth of cut are poorly done.</li>
            <li> the poor attachment set of the Groomsman is not an issue with this Mini-Pro.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another reason not to buy this trimmer is the cord, which is so thin and flimsy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mini-Pro after a disappointing tryout of the Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman (which I also reviewed on Amazon; 1 star), deciding to give Wahl another chance.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for travelling</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in order to shave my dog for the summer. However,  it barely took any fur off with each stroke.  It finally got to the point where repeating the same area began to become annoying to the dog, so I took him into Petco instead.  Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I ordered this clipper for a replacement of a Wahl P&#x27;nut - but I must say I was dissapointed that there was not a number one clipper guide. Trimming hair very short isn&#x27;t possible (with a guard). I like the larger size but the noise is much higher and it&#x27;s not as manuverable. Over all it&#x27;s just OK. After years of use it&#x27;s easy to see why the Wahl P&#x27;nut is still a favorite with so many. You get what you pay for is still true today.</li>
            <li> Wasted so much money on battery operated trimmers that died on me within a year until my hair dresser said to just get a corded one and I did. It works like a charm. Long cord and powerful, I trim my facial hair in under a minute which used to take minutes before and bad results too. Make sure you realize how small this is so it could be too small for trimming your head, but for everything else, it is perfect and above all, the price is right.</li>
            <li> I just received mine and used it to cut my hair.  The size and weight are nice compared to full size clippers, and the price is very good for what you get.  However, I would recommend these for light pet grooming maybe, not for cutting people hair.  The noise is loud, but manageable.  The long comb it comes with is cheap and difficult to use (flimsy and is permanently bent from shipping).  The guards are very sharp, but some light sanding on the tips got rid of some edges left over from the molding process.  All this is ok, but where my real complaint is with the motor.  It struggles and slows down almost to the point of jamming.  That really breaks your rhythm since you are always worried about it.  If you go a bit too fast it pulls hair instead if cutting.  Overall, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m too upset since it was so cheap, but I&#x27;d rather Have spent twice what I did for something that isn&#x27;t a headache.</li>
            <li> Product is as expected. Working good. If I would need something like this again I would buy it again. No problem at all of any kind.</li>
            <li> Im an aspiring bodybuilder so of course having body hair is a big NO! so i decided to buy this clipper to trim my beard and maybe shape up my haircut which it does perfectly but then i thought why just not use it for everywhere else since it&#x27;s so small and versatile. When i used this clipper i can honestly say that it was the fastest way to remove body hair rather than shaving or applying a hair remover. This clipper packs a punch and seems to be very reliable.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement trimmer for my husband Sept 2010.  His old Wahl 9307-100 still worked, but it was getting pretty old.  By Aug 2011, the new Wahl no long worked and my husband was back to using his old one.  He only used it to trim the hair on his neck and around his ears.  The motor started to get less and less power until it eventually just wouldn&#x27;t cut anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipper because I&#x27;ve had good luck with Wahl in the past, I wanted a corded model and the description specifically states MADE IN THE U.S.A.  It is NOT, it is made in China.      At least the trucker who delivered this purchase to me and the trucker who will be bringing it back to Amazon still have jobs...</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think these clippers deserve the -1 star I gave them. It&#x27;s just I would love for them to have an adjustable head for small adjustments between the comb sizes. I knew that they didn&#x27;t when I bought them so I shouldn&#x27;t penalize them - but cheaper brands do have that adjustable head at the same price range.    This brings me to what the 4 stars are all about. The Wahl brand is synonymous with quality in barber shop/hair salon equipment. This product is small and yet powerful. In over a year of use, it hasn&#x27;t jammed or gotten stuck once. I only clean it and oil it when I remember - which is almost never (maybe 3 times in 18 months or so).    This thing will run forever. The only things that would make it any better would be (1) the aforementioned adjustable head, and (2) cordless. Again, you already know that this product doesn&#x27;t have them, and at this price, it&#x27;s a great deal without them.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my beard every week.  My barber recommended this to me and the product has held up perfectly every time.  Love it</li>
            <li> These small clippers are great for getting between the eyes of our schnauzer and for touching up between grooming.  Next time, however, I think I will try a cordless model.</li>
            <li> Heavy for it&#x27;s size which means it sould be durable. Small cutter head and noisy in operation. I got it to trim with and I feel it does that good.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Wahl chargeable with this plug in version. I like that part, but the attachments for depth of cut are poorly done. One doesn&#x27;t even stay clipped onto cutting head and they are all overly large for self-trimming beard, moustache around nose, around ears, etc. Why so darned big for compact unit meant for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Hey Wahl - I&#x27;m not trimming my horse here!</li>
            <li> second pair of clippers bought,but caution,do not drop on a hard floor or they will stop working.best clipper i ever bought.</li>
            <li> I have been trimming my hair for 13 years now and my other trimmer gave up the ghost so I looked and found this one and it works great it is small and weighs a lot less then my old one, very easy to use and well it saves me money but the barber has a problem.</li>
            <li> Looked a long time to find trimmer/clipper that was not rechargeable as all those either the battery or the charger went bad. Just plug this one in and away it goes at full power for as long as you need. Love it</li>
            <li> Amazason shipped an used one to me! The noise is too big. Not that good as looked in the picture.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Mini-Pro after a disappointing tryout of the Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman (which I also reviewed on Amazon; 1 star), deciding to give Wahl another chance. I am glad I did, because I am now satisfied with the Mini-Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The huge issue that I and other users have with the poor attachment set of the Groomsman is not an issue with this Mini-Pro. Attachments for the Mini-Pro go on easily, remove easily, and stay on during use. I do not use the Mini-Pro for anything other than beard and mustache trimming, so I cannot speak to the suitability of this unit for other tasks such as first haircuts and haircut touch-ups; other users with experiences in those areas can comment. For my money, this is a great beard and mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give the Mini-Pro 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for minor annoyances like the stunningly cheap drawstring storage bag and the uselessly flimsy barber comb.</li>
            <li> The Wahl Compact Clipper Kit is wonderfully compact, works well, and certainly does the job it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> This is not a full size hair cutting kit.  This is more appropriate for hair trimming rather than hair cutting.</li>
            <li> The Wahl 9307-100 Mini Pro is sold for a reasonable price. It isn&#x27;t as loud as some corded mini clippers and performs well . It does come with a plastic housing and not metal but you can&#x27;t have everything for this price. Overall i am very happy with the purchase and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer about 7 or 8 years and it has done well on beard and body hair twice a week and/or as needed. I&#x27;ve not ever tried to use it for a haircut or even for neckline, but it does sufficiently keep a beard presentable, and mows through a mess of tangled chest hair with ease. It isn&#x27;t flashy, or spectacular, and like some others have mentioned, it is made in china; but it is certainly simple and reliable. The unit I purchased from a local department store nearly 8 years ago has been a true and steady trimmer when I needed one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the power is starting to wane, some days it behaves as if it were young again, and on others it shows its age with inexplicably low RPM&#x27;s, cleaning and/or oiling do not seem to change its mood on its slow days, and on extended uses (20-30 min continuous) the head gets too hot to touch and I have to break from body trimming for it to cool down, it hasn&#x27;t always done this, only recently. For the price I paid, and the length of time I&#x27;ve enjoyed it, I&#x27;m proud to say that my next trimmer will be a Wahl as well. Thank you little trimmer</li>
            <li> contrary to the product review under built to last it is NOT made in U.S.A.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be the same quality of clipper that Wahl makes in full size. I have a few and they are made in USA and basically indestructible. It was not like the typical Wahl clipperbut was a cheap made in China replica of something you might see next to the Gingsu knives late at night on TV. Had I been able to touch and feel prior to purchase I would never have gotten these.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this yet but assuming that it will work well since ive used wahl products before. Love the silver finished on this partiuclar clipper</li>
            <li> This trimmer is perfect for the ENTIRE body.</li>
            <li> Perfectly just like i imagine</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my Chinese Crested. I was looking for something small and narrow to get around her eyes and nose easier. This does work for that. The problems that I&#x27;m having with it are that it occasionally pulls the hair out instead of trimming it. It doesn&#x27;t do this often, but you can imagine how much that must hurt when it yanks hair around her eyes! It also gets hot relatively quickly; I have to shave her face in two goes because I have to stop to let the metal cool off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if this is because of the trimmer or her skin, but I recently shaved her whole body down. Rather, I attempted to. I had to quit after not much more than her back was done because I noticed it was giving her razer burn. I really don&#x27;t think clippers should irritate the skin that much. I didn&#x27;t have this problem with her previous clippers and they were old and rather dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will not be buying these again.</li>
            <li> great service. handy hair cutter system for shaved head.</li>
            <li> This clipper is a \\&quot;mini\\&quot; it is not itended to clip an entire dog.  It is only good for feet pads and ears, that is why it is a mini.  I am a professional groomer and we use these in the shop with great success - know what you are buying.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s hair stylist recommended this product to him. We both sport beards and moustaches.  I had been trimming mine for 20 years using barber scissors until my son visited at Thanksgiving and showed me his Wahl 9307.  I bought one (on sale) at Amazon for about $17, and it does a great job.  Can&#x27;t believe I used scissors for all those years.  It trims every hair evenly and quickly. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after owning 3 mini wahl clippers. This one is not even cluse. It&#x27;s basically all plastic with crappy blades. It cut me head at least 3 times the first minute I started my haircut. I threw it directly in the trash can and didn&#x27;t bother to send it back. Still using my old mini clippers that I bought in Walmart and they are great!</li>
            <li> With stay-sharp blades, a variety of precision trimming accessories, and even a moustache comb, you too can stay looking like Tom Selleck.</li>
            <li> Hice la compra el 24 de diciembre, luego de 3 meses me informan que el paquete que contenía 3 productos se perdió, como es posible se supone que son empresas serias.</li>
            <li> Works as described, a bit unwieldy.</li>
            <li> the corded version has more power and the smaller size makes beard trimming easier.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  Noisy, but no worse than the battery operated models and works great.  And, do you really need batteries?  I never trim anything when not infront of a bathroom mirror.  I purchased the same clipper about 5 years ago at Walmart (still going strong) and now purchased another through Amazon with the thought that the first one surely will give out someday (maybe).</li>
            <li> got this for my beard works good powerful yet compact</li>
            <li> I use this shaver to shape the lines on my mustache and beard. They do a pretty decent job because the barber always gives me compliments.</li>
            <li> I have a Wahl Cordless Super Pocket Pro Clipper that works awesome for trimming my face when my beard gets too long.  It takes it down to a nice stubble that I can manage with a razor.  I thought the Mini Pro would just as well and save me from always replacing batteries as it is wall powered unit, but it just annoyingly pulls at my facial hair and does little in terms of cutting.</li>
            <li> With so many pieces it&#x27;s no wonder that this set is perfect. It&#x27;s a perfect beginners set and even comes with instructions on how to cut certain hair.</li>
            <li> Thought I was purchasing just a small set, not edgers. So cannot use for intention but found use for it any way and is working well.</li>
            <li> I just love it!! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The boyfriend loved it. Just what he was looking for and just the right size to clean up his facial hair.</li>
            <li> this little trimmer is the best I have ever had,if your sick of your rechargeable running out of power like i was get this ,no more losing power halfway through your trim..will buy again if this ever breaks down.</li>
            <li> Wahl used to be a good clipper.  I have always clipped my dogs myself.  For some reason the last couple of Wahl clippers didn&#x27;t cut the hair.  They are not sharp enough and my little dog&#x27;s hair if very fine.</li>
            <li> just great .had 4 others .nothing as good as this little devil.</li>
            <li> It was a give, good price good product.</li>
            <li> Works really well, really light, small and compact</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer set as a companion to my Andis clippers. These are of excellent quality and have a nice variety of guard sizes. Great for trimming around the hairline and for areas where the hair may be thinning. The drawstring travel bag was an excellent surprise, very practical. This set comes with everything that you need to cut (if you use your trimmers for a full cut), trim, and line. I&#x27;ll be gifting a few of my family members with this set in the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so loud that I wouldn&#x27;t advise anyone to use it near his ears. I&#x27;ve used many full-sized trimmers, and those, despite being larger, have much quieter motors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason not to buy this trimmer is the cord, which is so thin and flimsy I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last long at all.</li>
