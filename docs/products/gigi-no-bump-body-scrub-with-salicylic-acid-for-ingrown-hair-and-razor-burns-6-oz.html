            <li> It contains Shea butter, and other moisterizing agents.</li>
            <li> It has not only prevented the problem that I previously had with ingrown hair, it has helped to heal the uneven skin tone caused by previous ingrown hair scars.</li>

            <li> I have been using it for the past 2 week every day while i shower</li>
            <li> it left a weird film on my body after I used it.</li>
            <li> It stinks so bad.</li>

            <li> I like the smell and the skin is very smooth after. Definetelly this works I would definetely recomend to a friend</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping it would on the bikini area. Works great on arms and legs.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Hoping this will make a difference with the appearance of bumps from waxing. I liked the look and feel of the scrub. I followed the instructions and used the scrub within 8 hours of my wax and the area looks and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Very, very good product.  No post-waxing itching or bumps - typically associated after 10 days.  I&#x27;ll continue using this product moving forward.  (Still need to review again after 3-4 weeks for in-grown hair prevention effectiveness.)  Otherwise, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub. I had dark spots and many ingrown hairs ( I wax ). After this product I have been noticing a difference: I will continue to order it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff just made me itchy and didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 2 week every day while i shower and i have been seeing improvement in my bikini area. If this continues will continue buying it and recommending it.</li>
            <li> It smells good doesnt have like a scent but it smells clean. love it.</li>
            <li> Was absolutely terrible, actually made skin more irritated. Cam I give zero stars?</li>
            <li> Best body scrub for before and after your waxing, definitely reduces hair bumps. It contains Shea butter, and other moisterizing agents. I also use this for my legs before shaving. Keep skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is gross! It didn&#x27;t make any difference for my skin and it feels like jelly. STAY AWAY. It stinks so bad. Will NOT repurchase this item</li>
            <li> Excellent, body scrip really leaves skin soft.  No bumps or spots just great smooth skin</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily to prevent ingrown hairs from waxing my bikini area. It has not only prevented the problem that I previously had with ingrown hair, it has helped to heal the uneven skin tone caused by previous ingrown hair scars. Smells great too! I&#x27;m Hooked!!</li>
            <li> This is a good scrub.  Pleasant smell and leaves your skin feeling smooth.  Along with the other GiGi prodcuts I highly recommend it.</li>
