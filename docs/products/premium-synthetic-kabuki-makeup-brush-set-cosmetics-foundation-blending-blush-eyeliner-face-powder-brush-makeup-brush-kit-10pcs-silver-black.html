            <li>They are amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had MAC or Sigma brushes but the kabuki brushes are amazing!</li>
            <li>If they were more dense they would be perfect!</li>
            <li>Well let&#x27;s just say I was impressed when I first received these brushes, now after about 4 months of using them I am not whatsoever impressed.</li>
            <li>and you also get a good variety for the cost of one sigma brush.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for mineral makeup and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>All in all these brushes are just as good but not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used these brushes for contour and it blends soo good.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love these brushes!</li>

            <li>Love these brushes!</li>
            <li>I totally love this brush!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing.</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>the softness and how my makeup applies is amazing.</li>
            <li>They are very dense and perfect for foundation and concealer, but works well with pressed powders as well.</li>
            <li>but I knew they were going to be nice brushes.</li>
            <li>I love the makeup brushes I say if your looking for good brushes get these ones .</li>
            <li>Very strong.</li>
            <li>I just got them and like others said they had a very strong chemical smell</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and can&#x27;t wait to paint a face with them! :)</li>
            <li>For under 20 dollars, this brush set is pretty good!</li>
            <li>I look forward to ordering many more sets for friends and family that are just getting into makeup!</li>
            <li>I received 10 amazing brushes :)</li>
            <li>Foundation goes on smoothly and it is amazing because I don&#x27;t have to use my fingers any more</li>
            <li>which makes it easier, faster, and more cleaner.</li>
            <li>and after cleaning them make sure they are pointed downwards because you dont want water to seep into the handle bc majority of the handles</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>LOVE them no fall out after washing</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did NOT spend the $65 on the Sephora brushes that the sales lady was pushing on me.</li>
            <li>I love that there is a brush for each piece of make up that I use....</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many clients comment on the softness of these brushes.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE them</li>
            <li>and so glad i bought these..one thing though</li>
            <li>but the smell does go away :)</li>
            <li>I love the face brushes I used almost all of them.</li>
            <li>I give the brushes 2 thumbs up!!! :)</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed these brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall best set of brushes I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>I would compare them more closely to brushes by Coastal Scents if you have any of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handles are longer giving you more control to use lighter or heavier pressure.</li>
            <li>Fibers don&#x27;t shed, bleed or splay after many uses and washes.</li>
            <li>one&#x27;s seem to be made better, are a tad bit heavier and perform better.</li>
            <li>I am soooooooooo glad I came across these</li>
            <li>great brishes, got them super quick.</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for and these brushes are not Mac or Chanel brushes that take a lot more money and technology to make and thats why they will shed more easily or stiffen quicker.</li>
            <li>The brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li>so I have a pretty good idea of what they are.</li>
            <li>I took them to the sink to wash them with a very mild baby shampoo and TWO of the handles just fell off.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them for anyone looking for a good cosmetic brush.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>They do not shed any hairs and apply the makeup perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>These brushes are truly amazing, very similar to Sigma, but they could use a bit more density to them &amp; when I first washed them there was a good bit of fallout</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and apply makeup very nicely.</li>
            <li>They make a huge difference in how my make up looks once applied.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic brushes.</li>
            <li>They do a fantastic job and don&#x27;t shed on face or when being washed.</li>
            <li>The brushes arrived so fast and the sellers are soooooooooo nice.</li>
            <li>all of them are very useful.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazing and work as if they were high end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re being cheap on buying brushes, just spend some more money and buy Sigma brushes, Real Techniques, or Sephora brand brushes..</li>
            <li>The brushes weren&#x27;t as soft as I would liked, but over all work well and use them often</li>
            <li>Also keep in mind that it is true</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving these so far.  </li>
            <li>so far so good with these brushes seem comparable to high end makeup brushes !</li>
            <li>And I really wish this kit included a case for the brushes but the brushes are already worth more than the price</li>
            <li>I love how there are so many different brushes yet</li>
            <li>I read that others had loose handles, mine all seem very sturdy and well made I am very picky and noticed on my angled brushes the cut isnt 100% perfect but</li>
            <li>They are synthetic but that&#x27;s great as I like a slightly stiffer bristle for these tasks.</li>
            <li>I bought a single foundation kabuki from this seller and loved it</li>
            <li>and they are EXACT DUPES FOR THE SIGMA BRUSHES!</li>
            <li>I generally prefer black handled makeup brushes because they look more streamlined when stored and the handles tend to clean up more nicely</li>
            <li>I wish they labeled the brushes because honestly I don&#x27;t know the proper use of all of them.</li>
            <li>I have not owned a true brush set yet, so this is my first one.</li>
            <li>I received them right on time</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and haven&#x27;t had any shedding.</li>
            <li>and i have to say that they are pretty amazing and high quality especially for the price!!!!</li>
            <li>They are my first set of cosmetic brushes and they seem like they&#x27;ll do the trick.</li>
            <li>I have loved this set as the brushes are very comparable to my other high end brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>Honestly I reach for my other brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and provide a nice variety of sizes for different uses during makeup applications.</li>
            <li>Good if not better than the high-end name brand cosmetic brushes on the market.</li>
            <li>I do have several sigma brushes so I can make a true comparison!</li>
            <li>The only thing that I noticed was that they did have a strong chemical smell</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much more I can say about them other than they perform exactly as they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Often synthetics are super stiff but these are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I know that has nothing to do with the people who mail the stuff, but the people who package these things should be more careful.</li>
            <li>First off I would like to say that the smell of the brushes is normal.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fairly fast and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The brushes make it so much easier and give me a matte finish look..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and for people that are iffy on buying them, don&#x27;t be!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the brushes were packaged well.</li>
            <li>The handles are short (think travel size) and they are light weight.</li>
            <li>but I really could not afford them.</li>
            <li>There soft on your face they don&#x27;t leave any pieces of hair behind and they make your makeup look nice :)</li>
            <li>I would call these an absolute deal just as good as the &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; brushes if not better!</li>
            <li>These brushes aren&#x27;t quite as soft to the touch but when buffing into the face they&#x27;re softer and distribute product just right.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the way the foundation brushes apply foundation.</li>
            <li>I recommend a fluffy loose brushes for actual blending, but this set is awesome for everything else!</li>
            <li>I have much more expensive brushes in my kit but go straight to these for most of my face work.</li>
            <li>They smell strongly of paint but after washing them and letting dry there is no oder at all!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparing them to MAC - I love MAC&#x27;s eye brushes but their face brushes have always been a let down to me.</li>
            <li>I like the big brushes more than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li>They are fantastic quality for the price (I would pay this and have for a single brush of quality)</li>
            <li>I felt them and they are very soft!</li>
            <li>all the bristles are back to their original shape and the smell is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but FYI all brushes are supposed to have a chemical smell to them when they are brand new.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist, I am always in the market for makeup brushes and these were a steal!</li>
            <li>The eye brushes are a little harder to blend out with because they are dense, but they pack on color nicely.</li>
            <li>handle size&lt;br /&gt;-Surprising soft bristles for the price</li>
            <li>Brushes: They&#x27;re soft, dense, do not shed nor does the dye in the bristles fade when shampooed.</li>
            <li>and I adore them completely -</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft but durable.</li>
            <li>So soft</li>
            <li>Aside from the slight off smell (wash them &amp; it&#x27;s gone), the brushes are well made and super soft!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really find other brush sets that is decent for under 20 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall they are fantastic little brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First complaint, one of the brushes from the very start had major hair fall out</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist and use these dense kabuki style brushes for contouring, buffing out foundation, highlighting and general blending.</li>
            <li>They feel similar but they are no where near as dense.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes I find very helpful for the same in smaller areas.</li>
            <li>Bristles are not quiet as dense or as soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to get the other little brushes back to their shape, maybe then they will work better.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about purchasing this set of brushes, however i took the risk and i am extremely happy.</li>
            <li>I bought the white set a little more than a month ago and have been using them quite and bit and the black set around 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li>Also as far as the texture goes they are very soft and to keep them that way I suggest using a little bit of dish soap to kill any bacteria and olive oil to keep the brushes soft.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t have other small brushes I would totally use these more.</li>
            <li>so I figured maybe if I would wash them right ahead and dried them trying to fix the hairs a bit it would go back to its shape.</li>
            <li>The bigger brushes were in good conditions, although the other skinnier ones were packaged very poorly.</li>

            <li> They make a huge difference in how my make up looks once applied.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic brushes.</li>
            <li> They do a fantastic job and don&#x27;t shed on face or when being washed.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived so fast and the sellers are soooooooooo nice.</li>
            <li> all of them are very useful.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re amazing and work as if they were high end makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re being cheap on buying brushes, just spend some more money and buy Sigma brushes, Real Techniques, or Sephora brand brushes..</li>
            <li> The brushes weren&#x27;t as soft as I would liked, but over all work well and use them often</li>
            <li> Also keep in mind that it is true</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving these so far.  </li>
            <li> so far so good with these brushes seem comparable to high end makeup brushes !</li>
            <li> And I really wish this kit included a case for the brushes but the brushes are already worth more than the price</li>
            <li> I love how there are so many different brushes yet</li>
            <li> I read that others had loose handles, mine all seem very sturdy and well made I am very picky and noticed on my angled brushes the cut isnt 100% perfect but</li>
            <li> They are synthetic but that&#x27;s great as I like a slightly stiffer bristle for these tasks.</li>
            <li> I bought a single foundation kabuki from this seller and loved it</li>
            <li> and they are EXACT DUPES FOR THE SIGMA BRUSHES!</li>
            <li> I generally prefer black handled makeup brushes because they look more streamlined when stored and the handles tend to clean up more nicely</li>
            <li> I wish they labeled the brushes because honestly I don&#x27;t know the proper use of all of them.</li>
            <li> I have not owned a true brush set yet, so this is my first one.</li>
            <li> I received them right on time</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and haven&#x27;t had any shedding.</li>
            <li> and i have to say that they are pretty amazing and high quality especially for the price!!!!</li>
            <li> They are my first set of cosmetic brushes and they seem like they&#x27;ll do the trick.</li>
            <li> I have loved this set as the brushes are very comparable to my other high end brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Honestly I reach for my other brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and provide a nice variety of sizes for different uses during makeup applications.</li>
            <li> Good if not better than the high-end name brand cosmetic brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> I do have several sigma brushes so I can make a true comparison!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I noticed was that they did have a strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much more I can say about them other than they perform exactly as they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Often synthetics are super stiff but these are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I know that has nothing to do with the people who mail the stuff, but the people who package these things should be more careful.</li>
            <li> First off I would like to say that the smell of the brushes is normal.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fairly fast and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The brushes make it so much easier and give me a matte finish look..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and for people that are iffy on buying them, don&#x27;t be!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the brushes were packaged well.</li>
            <li> The handles are short (think travel size) and they are light weight.</li>
            <li> but I really could not afford them.</li>
            <li> There soft on your face they don&#x27;t leave any pieces of hair behind and they make your makeup look nice :)</li>
            <li> I would call these an absolute deal just as good as the &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; brushes if not better!</li>
            <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t quite as soft to the touch but when buffing into the face they&#x27;re softer and distribute product just right.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love the way the foundation brushes apply foundation.</li>
            <li> I recommend a fluffy loose brushes for actual blending, but this set is awesome for everything else!</li>
            <li> I have much more expensive brushes in my kit but go straight to these for most of my face work.</li>
            <li> They smell strongly of paint but after washing them and letting dry there is no oder at all!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparing them to MAC - I love MAC&#x27;s eye brushes but their face brushes have always been a let down to me.</li>
            <li> I like the big brushes more than the smaller ones.</li>
            <li> They are fantastic quality for the price (I would pay this and have for a single brush of quality)</li>
            <li> I felt them and they are very soft!</li>
            <li> all the bristles are back to their original shape and the smell is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but FYI all brushes are supposed to have a chemical smell to them when they are brand new.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist, I am always in the market for makeup brushes and these were a steal!</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are a little harder to blend out with because they are dense, but they pack on color nicely.</li>
            <li> handle size&lt;br /&gt;-Surprising soft bristles for the price</li>
            <li> Brushes: They&#x27;re soft, dense, do not shed nor does the dye in the bristles fade when shampooed.</li>
            <li> and I adore them completely -</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft but durable.</li>
            <li> So soft</li>
            <li> Aside from the slight off smell (wash them &amp; it&#x27;s gone), the brushes are well made and super soft!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really find other brush sets that is decent for under 20 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall they are fantastic little brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First complaint, one of the brushes from the very start had major hair fall out</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and use these dense kabuki style brushes for contouring, buffing out foundation, highlighting and general blending.</li>
            <li> They feel similar but they are no where near as dense.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes I find very helpful for the same in smaller areas.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not quiet as dense or as soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get the other little brushes back to their shape, maybe then they will work better.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing this set of brushes, however i took the risk and i am extremely happy.</li>
            <li> I bought the white set a little more than a month ago and have been using them quite and bit and the black set around 2 weeks ago</li>
            <li> Also as far as the texture goes they are very soft and to keep them that way I suggest using a little bit of dish soap to kill any bacteria and olive oil to keep the brushes soft.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have other small brushes I would totally use these more.</li>
            <li> so I figured maybe if I would wash them right ahead and dried them trying to fix the hairs a bit it would go back to its shape.</li>
            <li> The bigger brushes were in good conditions, although the other skinnier ones were packaged very poorly.</li>
            <li> The way they were packaged made the bristles of the brushes look all slanted and ugly, they all had a pretty strong smell to them</li>
            <li> (i think you should always wash your brushes first anyways), once they dried I hurried to use them and omgosh!!</li>
            <li> My second complaint is that I take very well care of my brushes and now after 4 months of having them the metal has detached from the wood handle, on 5 out 8 brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft - I mean really really soft.</li>
            <li> I am not one to write bad reviews, this is a honest review..</li>
            <li> I should have ordered these a long time go.</li>
            <li> but after the first wash no more shedding has occurred!!</li>
            <li> I now have two sets of these brushes (both the white handled and black handled sets)</li>
            <li> took off one star because there is a noticeable difference in the quality between the white handled brushes and the black handled brushes.</li>
            <li> not how I would have expected.</li>
            <li> Shipping was as expected.</li>
            <li> Since the thought of rubbing dead squirrel all over my face disgusts me beyond words, I only use synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li> I would have rather spent my money on sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> But even though they are dense and a little stiff they are also incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They came packaged in a box that was a tad bit too small for them causing some squishing of the longer handled eye brushes and they smelled funky but I allowed them to air out over night then deep shampooed them and allowed them to dry and</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, I am an extremely picky shopper and take my time to review products before I buy them.</li>
            <li> just received these in the mail the other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews compare them to MAC or Sigma</li>
            <li> I am very frugal and very skeptical of ordering anything online especially when there is no name to look up reviews for</li>
            <li> These are not worth the 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> the handles are shorter and they are about half the weight.</li>
            <li> Ive had these for a few months now</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t quite as heavy or feel as sturdy as a MAC brush and just don&#x27;t feel as well made</li>
            <li> Only con was they smelled weird, like toxins.</li>
            <li> First impression was the packaging was very bad.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when buying the brushes just because I am so picky</li>
            <li> I have purchased way worse quality brushes from target, wal-mart, and cvs and have still worked with the brushes and made them work for me</li>
            <li> (some of the other brushes in the kit have had fallout as well but not as bad)..</li>
            <li> They do have a weird smell but it goes away after washing them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong though...</li>
            <li> I always see bad reviews on makeup brushes because the smell is &amp;#34;Dreadful&amp;#34; and ya</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these, but I&#x27;m scared to try them now. :(</li>
            <li> We do pay for what we see so reserving something out of shape makes it very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The reason why I am giving it a 4 is because although the brushes came in on time they were Packard very badly.</li>
            <li> is they stink very bad like chemicals..</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I bought a single foundation kabuki from this seller and loved it so I thought I would buy a set. They are very dense and perfect for foundation and concealer, but works well with pressed powders as well. The eye brushes are a little harder to blend out with because they are dense, but they pack on color nicely. I recommend a fluffy loose brushes for actual blending, but this set is awesome for everything else! Love this!</li>
            <li> The reason why I am giving it a 4 is because although the brushes came in on time they were Packard very badly. The bigger brushes were in good conditions, although the other skinnier ones were packaged very poorly. The way they were packaged made the bristles of the brushes look all slanted and ugly, they all had a pretty strong smell to them so I figured maybe if I would wash them right ahead and dried them trying to fix the hairs a bit it would go back to its shape. It did work a bit but still not how I would have expected. Other than that I love the way the foundation brushes apply foundation. Foundation goes on smoothly and it is amazing because I don&#x27;t have to use my fingers any more which makes it easier, faster, and more cleaner. I&#x27;m still trying to get the other little brushes back to their shape, maybe then they will work better. I know that has nothing to do with the people who mail the stuff, but the people who package these things should be more careful. We do pay for what we see so reserving something out of shape makes it very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Shipping was as expected. The brushes weren&#x27;t as soft as I would liked, but over all work well and use them often</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when buying the brushes just because I am so picky but I knew they were going to be nice brushes. First off I would like to say that the smell of the brushes is normal. I always see bad reviews on makeup brushes because the smell is &amp;#34;Dreadful&amp;#34; and ya it is not the best smell but FYI all brushes are supposed to have a chemical smell to them when they are brand new. They are made with animal hair and if they don&#x27;t disenfect the product then we are putting animal hair on our faces and who knows where some of these animals have been. Paint brushes are the same way. Also as far as the texture goes they are very soft and to keep them that way I suggest using a little bit of dish soap to kill any bacteria and olive oil to keep the brushes soft. I have been a makeup artist for a while now and I have always used this cleaning method, OH!, and after cleaning them make sure they are pointed downwards because you dont want water to seep into the handle bc majority of the handles are wood and that can cause rotting and bacteria. Also keep in mind that it is true you get what you pay for and these brushes are not Mac or Chanel brushes that take a lot more money and technology to make and thats why they will shed more easily or stiffen quicker. I have purchased way worse quality brushes from target, wal-mart, and cvs and have still worked with the brushes and made them work for me just fine. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and can&#x27;t wait to paint a face with them! :)</li>
            <li> I love the makeup brushes I say if your looking for good brushes get these ones . There soft on your face they don&#x27;t leave any pieces of hair behind and they make your makeup look nice :)</li>
            <li> The brushes are pretty good. I like the big brushes more than the smaller ones. They do have a weird smell but it goes away after washing them. The only thing is if you are looking for a dupe for the sigmax brushes these aren&#x27;t it. They feel similar but they are no where near as dense. If they were more dense they would be perfect! Still a great value though.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, I am an extremely picky shopper and take my time to review products before I buy them. I was looking at the sigma brushes and came across these. These brushes are quality and don&#x27;t shed. Foundation brush blends well and you also get a good variety for the cost of one sigma brush. Shipping was fairly fast and packaged well.  You will not be disappointed. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Ive had these for a few months now and I will be re purchasing another set. They are so soft! The quality is amazing. I should have ordered these a long time go. Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> so far so good with these brushes seem comparable to high end makeup brushes ! LOVE them no fall out after washing</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft. Good if not better than the high-end name brand cosmetic brushes on the market. I would highly recommend them for anyone looking for a good cosmetic brush.</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist, I am always in the market for makeup brushes and these were a steal! They are perfect for mineral makeup and cruelty free. Since the thought of rubbing dead squirrel all over my face disgusts me beyond words, I only use synthetic brushes. Often synthetics are super stiff but these are fabulous! Perfect for applying mineral makeup or blending creams. I already ordered a second set for one of my clients. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I did NOT spend the $65 on the Sephora brushes that the sales lady was pushing on me. Instead, I found these brushes and they are AMAZING! I received them right on time and I could not be happier. They make a huge difference in how my make up looks once applied. The brushes make it so much easier and give me a matte finish look.. I love that there is a brush for each piece of make up that I use....and then some. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Just received my order in the mail. First impression was the packaging was very bad. It literally came in a plastic wrapping with nothing to cushion. I opened it and you can&#x27;t help but smell an aweful chemical smell. Very strong. I felt them and they are very soft! I took them to the sink to wash them with a very mild baby shampoo and TWO of the handles just fell off. I hadn&#x27;t even washed them yet!! Very disappointed. I would have rather spent my money on sigma brushes. I have bought them before and you get what you pay for! I wanted to like these, but I&#x27;m scared to try them now. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving these so far.  They are my first set of cosmetic brushes and they seem like they&#x27;ll do the trick.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic brushes. I plan to buy more. I am a makeup artist and use these dense kabuki style brushes for contouring, buffing out foundation, highlighting and general blending. They are amazing! The smaller brushes I find very helpful for the same in smaller areas. They are synthetic but that&#x27;s great as I like a slightly stiffer bristle for these tasks. But even though they are dense and a little stiff they are also incredibly soft. I can&#x27;t tell you how many clients comment on the softness of these brushes. I have much more expensive brushes in my kit but go straight to these for most of my face work. Love it! Buy!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing this set of brushes, however i took the risk and i am extremely happy. They&#x27;re amazing and work as if they were high end makeup brushes. They do not shed any hairs and apply the makeup perfectly fine. I would definitely re purchase if i had to.</li>
            <li> I am very frugal and very skeptical of ordering anything online especially when there is no name to look up reviews for but i decided to orser anyways and take my chances. I just got them and like others said they had a very strong chemical smell so I washed them (i think you should always wash your brushes first anyways), once they dried I hurried to use them and omgosh!! They&#x27;re the softest brushes I have ever used! I read that others had loose handles, mine all seem very sturdy and well made I am very picky and noticed on my angled brushes the cut isnt 100% perfect but the softness and how my makeup applies is amazing. I wish they labeled the brushes because honestly I don&#x27;t know the proper use of all of them. And I really wish this kit included a case for the brushes but the brushes are already worth more than the price so I can&#x27;t complain. I definitely recommend purchasing!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I have not owned a true brush set yet, so this is my first one. The brushes are super soft and apply makeup very nicely. I highly recommend this product, and for people that are iffy on buying them, don&#x27;t be! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> just received these in the mail the other day and i have to say that they are pretty amazing and high quality especially for the price!!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE them and so glad i bought these..one thing though is they stink very bad like chemicals..like what a room would smell like after painting with spray paint lol but the smell does go away :)</li>
            <li> For under 20 dollars, this brush set is pretty good! I love the face brushes I used almost all of them. The smaller brushes are alright. Honestly I reach for my other brushes. Don&#x27;t get me wrong though...If I didn&#x27;t have other small brushes I would totally use these more. You can&#x27;t really find other brush sets that is decent for under 20 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-No fall out when washing&lt;br /&gt;-Nice face brushes&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect handle size&lt;br /&gt;-Surprising soft bristles for the price</li>
            <li> These are absolutely awesome! They do a fantastic job and don&#x27;t shed on face or when being washed. I would call these an absolute deal just as good as the &amp;#34;more expensive&amp;#34; brushes if not better!</li>
            <li> These brushes are truly amazing, very similar to Sigma, but they could use a bit more density to them &amp; when I first washed them there was a good bit of fallout but after the first wash no more shedding has occurred!! All in all I give the brushes 2 thumbs up!!! :)</li>
            <li> Amazing !! These are the best brushes I have owned I ordered 2 sets already and will be ordering another.</li>
            <li> great brishes, got them super quick. Only con was they smelled weird, like toxins.</li>
            <li> Well let&#x27;s just say I was impressed when I first received these brushes, now after about 4 months of using them I am not whatsoever impressed. First complaint, one of the brushes from the very start had major hair fall out (some of the other brushes in the kit have had fallout as well but not as bad).. This was without me even using it once. My second complaint is that I take very well care of my brushes and now after 4 months of having them the metal has detached from the wood handle, on 5 out 8 brushes. I am not one to write bad reviews, this is a honest review.. If you&#x27;re being cheap on buying brushes, just spend some more money and buy Sigma brushes, Real Techniques, or Sephora brand brushes.. These are not worth the 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> Five stars for the quality compare to the price. They are totally a paid off. I was hunting for sigma kabuki brush and these are the perfect brushes when I can&#x27;t afford sigmas.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very good for the price</li>
            <li> Order these on Monday night(4/21) received them Wednesday (4/23). Aside from the slight off smell (wash them &amp; it&#x27;s gone), the brushes are well made and super soft! I&#x27;ve never had MAC or Sigma brushes but the kabuki brushes are amazing! For the price of the F80 from sigma I received 10 amazing brushes :)&lt;br /&gt;Have yet to try them, but I will update this ASAP!</li>
            <li> the  Premium Synthetic Kabuki Makeup Brush Set Cosmetics Foundation Blending... is great for makeup application. There was no dropping of bristles. They keep their shape well, and handles are solidly attached. I will purchase again if i need these type  of brushes. Great seller.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed these brushes. Shipping was fast and the brushes were packaged well. I have loved this set as the brushes are very comparable to my other high end brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I love how there are so many different brushes yet all of them are very useful. Overall best set of brushes I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> I am a makeup collector and brushes are my greatest downfall. I now have two sets of these brushes (both the white handled and black handled sets) I bought the white set a little more than a month ago and have been using them quite and bit and the black set around 2 weeks ago so I have a pretty good idea of what they are. Overall they are fantastic little brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came packaged in a box that was a tad bit too small for them causing some squishing of the longer handled eye brushes and they smelled funky but I allowed them to air out over night then deep shampooed them and allowed them to dry and all the bristles are back to their original shape and the smell is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face Brushes: They&#x27;re soft, dense, do not shed nor does the dye in the bristles fade when shampooed. The handles are short (think travel size) and they are light weight. They are fantastic quality for the price (I would pay this and have for a single brush of quality) I&#x27;ve seen other reviews compare them to MAC or Sigma but I don&#x27;t agree with that at all, I have brushes of all brands including MAC and Sigma. I would compare them more closely to brushes by Coastal Scents if you have any of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing them to Sigma - the handles are shorter and they are about half the weight. Bristles are not quiet as dense or as soft but I have always had issues with shedding with Sigma brushes and I have noticed none - not one fiber being lost with these. All in all these brushes are just as good but not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing them to MAC - I love MAC&#x27;s eye brushes but their face brushes have always been a let down to me. I find that they are prickly and never seem to distribute product evenly. These brushes aren&#x27;t quite as soft to the touch but when buffing into the face they&#x27;re softer and distribute product just right. They aren&#x27;t quite as heavy or feel as sturdy as a MAC brush and just don&#x27;t feel as well made but they do the job better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye brushes. The handles are longer giving you more control to use lighter or heavier pressure. They&#x27;re soft - I mean really really soft. Fibers don&#x27;t shed, bleed or splay after many uses and washes. They also have not stained at all.They are perfect in weight and feel as if the quality of them is 3x higher than that of the face brushes.There isn&#x27;t much more I can say about them other than they perform exactly as they&#x27;re supposed to and I adore them completely - they alone were the selling point for me to buy the second set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because there is a noticeable difference in the quality between the white handled brushes and the black handled brushes. I generally prefer black handled makeup brushes because they look more streamlined when stored and the handles tend to clean up more nicely but with these the white handled one&#x27;s seem to be made better, are a tad bit heavier and perform better. I suggest to anyone looking to buy these brushes to go with the white (even if you don&#x27;t like white handles like me)</li>
            <li> OMG these brushes are freaking awesome!  I wanted to get the ones by sigma but I really could not afford them. I took a chance and purchased these instead and they are EXACT DUPES FOR THE SIGMA BRUSHES! I do have several sigma brushes so I can make a true comparison! The brushes arrived so fast and the sellers are soooooooooo nice. The only thing that I noticed was that they did have a strong chemical smell but I washed and and it went away.  I look forward to ordering many more sets for friends and family that are just getting into makeup! I am soooooooooo glad I came across these they are truly a great deal!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  The brushes are so soft and provide a nice variety of sizes for different uses during makeup applications.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! The bristles are soft but durable. I especially love the foundation brush. Makeup goes on flawlessly. Best buy yet.</li>
            <li> I totally love this brush! So soft and it applies soo good! I used these brushes for contour and it blends soo good. Just what i was expecting. Very high quality. I&#x27;ll be buying this again. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love these!! Super fast shipping and haven&#x27;t had any shedding. They smell strongly of paint but after washing them and letting dry there is no oder at all!</li>
