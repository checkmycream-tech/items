            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good item...</li>
            <li>Its good</li>
            <li>Is it mindblowingly good...</li>
            <li>I also think sealing hair with good oil after applying this is good</li>
            <li>smells so good.</li>
            <li>it works good for my slip ends.</li>
            <li>good luck ! :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the money to buy the one I had been using for 4 months and it worked AMAZING</li>
            <li>sure why...</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about protecting split ends, but this is a nice product to use on damp hair to smooth it and avoid frizzing.</li>
            <li>my hair was so healthy</li>
            <li>This is the best Split End Protector I&#x27;ve found for my daughter - she flat irons every day and it works great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say that my experience with it has been good so far.</li>
            <li>i looked it up by chance and was excited to find amazon sold it.</li>
            <li>but on wet hair, its good.</li>
            <li>Nexus spit end line is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It had more of the essence of some old elderly woman&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>Tried it after drying my hair but it works best when hair is slightly damp then air dry or use cool dryer setting.</li>
            <li>This product is hard to find in the stores and I love it; Keeps my hair looking nice and bouncy.</li>
            <li>but if you put in on dry hair, it makes it kind of heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Ok as a basic leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others and definitely consider purchasing again for my hair.</li>
            <li>This is also great for fine or thin hair!</li>
            <li>and the only thing to bring it back to its original luster was this :)</li>
            <li>It does not smell of the essence of raspberry, I can tell u that much.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t rate this product as far as how well it had done on my hair.</li>
            <li>and it makes my twist outs SUPER soft if I use enough.</li>
            <li>This is almost exactly the same product I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>However, this product didn&#x27;t do anything as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I guess, cuz I have protein sensitive medium in diameter strands.</li>
            <li>I always use it for daily moisturizing and it makes my hair soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny bit to do the job, it doesn&#x27;t smell awful, and the price is very good compared to the  myriad of smoothing products available.</li>
            <li>Too bad, it didn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li>i barely finished this bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I lost my other spit end protector, along with over 100 worth of hair care and other products at the airport.</li>

            <li> I bought this because I lost my other spit end protector, along with over 100 worth of hair care and other products at the airport.</li>
            <li> Using small amounts of this as a detangler right after washing on still-damp hair leaves my hair soft, detangled, and lets it retain its slight curl, without being oily or leaving residue.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using it on dry hair unless your hair needs extra moisturizing, since this is the equivalent of extra-strength skin lotion designed for hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very coarse, curly, dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and this product keeps the&lt;br /&gt;frizz</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair</li>
            <li> It has been a godsend to my ends, which were always dry and breaking.</li>
            <li> I have dry, course 4b/4c kinky/curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American, and I went &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Used on wet hair.</li>
            <li> my hair has suffered in the last few years-</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> down and curls tucked away.</li>
            <li> It weighs down my hair, is greasy and does not protect my ends at all.</li>
            <li> without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I use everyday.  </li>
            <li> i put on everyday after i shower.</li>
            <li> I put this on my ends when they seem too dried out and now my hair has a healthier look.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I applied a little of the conditioner to my front hair strands and felt like my hair was kinda stiff, not soften as with garnier&#x27;s sleek and shine leave in.</li>
            <li> If you use small amounts on damp hair, the scent also fades somewhat as it dries, but not completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you prefer spray detanglers, rather than working this through your hair with a brush, you could probably thin this down with distilled water in a sprayer bottle.</li>
            <li> I just hated it, because it was strong and not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I always thought that i needed thick creamy products for my hair to moisturize it.</li>
            <li> But, I can say that this product is very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> it is one of my favorites and was so sad when i couldn&#x27;t find it at the stores.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2.5 years now. I&#x27;m African American, and I went &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; a few years ago. This product leaves my hair soft and hydrated. It has been a godsend to my ends, which were always dry and breaking. Not anymore!</li>
            <li> Used on wet hair. 2 squirts but it made my hair greasy so I stopped using after 5-6 times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a budget and this stuff was on sale at Big Lots for $2 each so I bought 3 bottles. I have dry, course 4b/4c kinky/curly hair and it makes my twist outs SUPER soft if I use enough. I wish the bottles were bigger because I use this product on all my hair not just my ends.</li>
            <li> It smells good. Ok as a basic leave-in conditioner. It did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> i love this product!!! it is one of my favorites and was so sad when i couldn&#x27;t find it at the stores. i looked it up by chance and was excited to find amazon sold it. would definitely recommend .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good item...thank you</li>
            <li> I have longer than waist-length hair that has just enough curl to it that it likes to tangle, especially after it has been washed (even with using conditioner).  Using small amounts of this as a detangler right after washing on still-damp hair leaves my hair soft, detangled, and lets it retain its slight curl, without being oily or leaving residue.  I don&#x27;t recommend using it on dry hair unless your hair needs extra moisturizing, since this is the equivalent of extra-strength skin lotion designed for hair.  One bottle lasts me for months, even with regular use.  If you use small amounts on damp hair, the scent also fades somewhat as it dries, but not completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer spray detanglers, rather than working this through your hair with a brush, you could probably thin this down with distilled water in a sprayer bottle.</li>
            <li> Its good but if you put in on dry hair, it makes it kind of heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why...but on wet hair, its good. Is it mindblowingly good...no.</li>
            <li> I had doubts about using this product because its water based, but it actually works wonders for my hair. My hair is very coarse, curly, dry and frizzy. I always thought that i needed thick creamy products for my hair to moisturize it. But this stuff detangles my hair after i wash or co wash my hair! I always use it for daily moisturizing and it makes my hair soft and moisturized! I also love the smell.This is also great for fine or thin hair!</li>
            <li> This is a product that I use everyday.  I have long curly hair and this product keeps the&lt;br /&gt;frizz down and curls tucked away.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in the stores and I love it; Keeps my hair looking nice and bouncy.</li>
            <li> PERHAPS I did not apply this correctly - don&#x27;t know. It ruined the looks of my hair before I went to work - embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about protecting split ends, but this is a nice product to use on damp hair to smooth it and avoid frizzing. You only need a tiny bit to do the job, it doesn&#x27;t smell awful, and the price is very good compared to the  myriad of smoothing products available.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product for helping reduce split ends. I have to say that my experience with it has been good so far. A little goes a long way. I also think sealing hair with good oil after applying this is good( just my opinion) give it a try n good luck ! :)</li>
            <li> my hair has suffered in the last few years- i moved to three different countries, got on a kagillion different meds etc... and the only thing to bring it back to its original luster was this :)</li>
            <li> smells so good. it works good for my slip ends. i put on everyday after i shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I lost my other spit end protector, along with over 100 worth of hair care and other products at the airport. I didn&#x27;t have the money to buy the one I had been using for 4 months and it worked AMAZING my hair was so healthy but this product by herbal essences for spit ends is just horrid. It weighs down my hair, is greasy and does not protect my ends at all. I have used it twice and it will be in the trash as soon as I am done with this review. Nexus spit end line is worth the money. Don&#x27;t use this garbage!</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to others and definitely consider purchasing again for my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as an extra leave in conditioning type of product to add to my regimen. I had hoped it would help with length retention by mending/preventing split ends. However, this product didn&#x27;t do anything as far as I can tell. I have taken to using it as shaving cream and an in the shower detangler, just to try to use up what&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that stops the &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Tried it after drying my hair but it works best when hair is slightly damp then air dry or use cool dryer setting. By next day...soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> This is almost exactly the same product I&#x27;ve been looking for. I put this on my ends when they seem too dried out and now my hair has a healthier look.</li>
            <li> i barely finished this bottle. I went back to elasta qp olive oil and mango butter. I dont think i&#x27;ll ever leave that moisturizer</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t rate this product as far as how well it had done on my hair. But, I can say that this product is very thick and creamy. You can feel the water in the formulation of this anti-humidity leave in. Now as for the smell of this stuff; that alone turned me off about it. It does not smell of the essence of raspberry, I can tell u that much. It had more of the essence of some old elderly woman&#x27;s perfume. I just hated it, because it was strong and not pleasant. Anyhow, I applied a little of the conditioner to my front hair strands and felt like my hair was kinda stiff, not soften as with garnier&#x27;s sleek and shine leave in. I guess, cuz I have protein sensitive medium in diameter strands. Too bad, it didn&#x27;t smell great. Oh well, on to the next ---&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> This is the best Split End Protector I&#x27;ve found for my daughter - she flat irons every day and it works great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used to buy this in Walmart but last time I was looking for it I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but online here so I ordered 3 so I don&#x27;t have to be be stuck without it.  Great price and free shipping!!</li>
