            <li>These strips are better than cloth strips.</li>
            <li>These are much better than the ones I had.</li>
            <li>These strips are pretty good.</li>
            <li>These are good waxing strips, worth the little money I paid for the package, and together with Veet wax worked perfect.</li>
            <li>I prefer the cloth ones as they tend to mold better to the skin and seems to be less abrasive as well, however if all you are waxing is your eyebrows and lip then these strips will work perfectly.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>I used this with Satin Smooth Tea Tree Wax and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>These were nice and seem to be of really decent quality.  </li>

            <li>love these waxing strips, not messy like muslin.</li>
            <li>These strips are just the right size.</li>
            <li>They are very large, so for her use we cut them into quarters for eyebrow, lip and chin waxing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it too much!</li>
            <li>Work well for the purpose, nice and thick sheets, easy to grab and pull.</li>
            <li>Came fast and was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>They are strong enough to pull and not tear.  </li>
            <li>They are great and so thick!</li>
            <li>INTENSELY STICKY)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she really likes them.  </li>
            <li>This is a much better deal than the 25-50 sheets they sell for almost the same price in local beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>These are easy to work with, easy to cut to preferred size and don&#x27;t leave strings behind like the muslin strips do.</li>
            <li>Only good for small areas like lip and eyes</li>
            <li>They are professional quality.  </li>

            <li> NOT cheap quality wax strips</li>
            <li> Same quality as our beauty supplier carries, but less expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually buy these and just cut into small strips to do my eyebrows..</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These will work great with the leg wax. Yes they are already a specific length but can be cut shorter if necessary.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great, I just wish they were a tad thicker, but otherwise great product. Don&#x27;t let this review keep you from buying these. They work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Work well for the purpose, nice and thick sheets, easy to grab and pull.</li>
            <li> I like the quality compared to what I have ordered before</li>
            <li> good material happy does the job!</li>
            <li> Came fast and was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it too much!</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and use these regularly. These are great. I cut some of them in thirds for facial waxing.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy a bulk muslin roll but I kept reading reviews that said some of those economy rolls are too thin.&lt;br /&gt;These worked great for me and aren&#x27;t bad in price at all. They didn&#x27;t tear or have the wax bleed thru. Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with:&lt;br /&gt;JMT Wax Warmer&lt;br /&gt;Cirepil Blue Wax&lt;br /&gt;Cirepil Ease Wax&lt;br /&gt;GiGi All Purpose Honee (***DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND, TORE OFF MY SKIN AND INTENSELY STICKY)&lt;br /&gt;Johnson&#x27;s Baby Oil w/Aloe &amp; Vit E&lt;br /&gt;JMT Wax Warmer Pots &amp; Lids&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bees Cranberry &amp; Pomegranate Sugar&lt;br /&gt;JMT Square Collars&lt;br /&gt;Wood Craft Sticks&lt;br /&gt;Smaller Popsicle Sticks (For face)&lt;br /&gt;Super Numb Anesthetic Skin Numbing Creamopsicle Sticks (For face)&lt;br /&gt;Super Numb Anesthetic Skin Numbing Cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the price and quality.</li>
            <li> seems to work as good as national brands that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> These strips are pretty good. I prefer the cloth ones as they tend to mold better to the skin and seems to be less abrasive as well, however if all you are waxing is your eyebrows and lip then these strips will work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great waxing strips. I prefer these because they&#x27;re not flimsy which makes them easier to use for self waxing.</li>
            <li> Great quality and quantity for the price</li>
            <li> I used this with Satin Smooth Tea Tree Wax and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Love these.  They are strong enough to pull and not tear.  They pick up wax residue very nicely.  This is my second time buying them and I&#x27;ll keep buying them.</li>
            <li> These strips are just as good as the name brand</li>
            <li> These strips are just the right size. Its very good quality. I have used several types of waxes and this strip pulls it off without tearing.</li>
            <li> Item is just as described!</li>
            <li> These are such a great deal and work very well. They do not leave my legs covered in fabric or fuzz like some strips do. I will be buying again when I run out!</li>
            <li> good price, good quality.</li>
            <li> These are good waxing strips, worth the little money I paid for the package, and together with Veet wax worked perfect. No complains.</li>
            <li> Only good for small areas like lip and eyes</li>
            <li> I received these today and it is definitely a great value. Compared to others you get a Big Bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already waxed with them tonight and they were awesome! Actually better than the ones I was refilling in my wax kit.</li>
            <li> You can trim them if you need to use it one smaller areas. This is a much better deal than the 25-50 sheets they sell for almost the same price in local beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Stickers to multiple types or waxes I have used. Also a little bigger than normal strips so you get great use. Also, they are thick and don&#x27;t sleep through!</li>
            <li> Great waxing strips!! I usually buy these and just cut into small strips to do my eyebrows.. I think its cheaper that way.  I have had no problem with these strips. Will be buying again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the strips themselves or if I used the wrong side of them, but they pulled more of the paper off than the wax off the body.</li>
            <li> They are great and so thick! I love them!</li>
            <li> For my  experience this it is terrible quality I don&#x27;t know why people give  so much good  reviews.  I guess you get what you pay don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Excellent quality strips.  Work great.</li>
            <li> These strips are better than cloth strips. However, you can&#x27;t go over multiple patches of wax with one strip. At max, you can use one strip for two patches of wax. I would still recommend it!</li>
            <li> These are easy to work with, easy to cut to preferred size and don&#x27;t leave strings behind like the muslin strips do.</li>
            <li> Is the best 1 I ever used please buy them if u looking for something like that üòç</li>
            <li> great item for price. NOT cheap quality wax strips</li>
            <li> Worth for money. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Works well stays together.</li>
            <li> My mother wanted these for her at home wax kit and she really likes them.  They are professional quality.  They are very large, so for her use we cut them into quarters for eyebrow, lip and chin waxing.</li>
            <li> These were nice and seem to be of really decent quality.  Although I have switched to cold sugaring and no longer need strips, if I had to buy some again I would go with these.</li>
            <li> These are not that great.</li>
            <li> I own a salon so we go through a lot of these.  Same quality as our beauty supplier carries, but less expensive.</li>
            <li> These are much better than the ones I had. They are easy to apply and remove. There is no residue left behing. I would reccommend them without reservation.</li>
            <li> Great fabric, doesn&#x27;t fray</li>
            <li> love these waxing strips, not messy like muslin.</li>
