            <li>I like this mirror and it looks great in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Wife is really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I bought this battery-powered one which works great, removed the stand and hung it on a decorative hook on the wall in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It is out of the way and attractive to look at, with its shiny chrome finish.</li>
            <li>Great travel lighted mirror.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about this mirror is that you can adjust the stand to whatever height you would like.</li>

            <li>you want to use it as supplemental lighting in an already bright location, then it should work for you.</li>

            <li>I am very satisfied with my order and the transaction that took place</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for travel and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>the lighting isn&#x27;t as good as i was hoping for, but i will keep it because its handy.</li>
            <li>The light is very bright and the reflection is fantastic!!  </li>
            <li>It is just the right size and the adjustable stand is awesome.</li>
            <li>It feels good in hands and the LED light is great.</li>
            <li>This was a great choice for me  - nice size, easy to store, good magnification.  </li>
            <li>The mirror looked good and was very nice when I opened it from the package, but when I installed the batteries it didn&#x27;t light up.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have never looked better!</li>
            <li>I love that it can stand and the fact that it lights up is a plus!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to keep in the rv, which never has a good mirror, but it ends up staying in the house!</li>
            <li>I also would not consider this the best choice for a travel mirror, being fairly large, glass, and lacking a protective case.</li>
            <li>This makeup mirror is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great, light weight handheld mirror.</li>
            <li>The great thing about this is the light.</li>
            <li>Really handy</li>
            <li>This is nice and sturdy with the stand on it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice mirror</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice mirror</li>
            <li>They deserve the 5 stars for excellent customer service and satisfaction!!&amp;#34; The mirror works really well, almost too well...</li>
            <li>It is battery operated which is nice for transport.</li>
            <li>It is nice and compact and I just stuck a push pin in the wall &amp; hang it up when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>Again, nothing came close to the nice magification for putting on makeup..</li>
            <li>Nice mirror and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s really nice otherwise.</li>
            <li>So handy.  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and excellent design.</li>
            <li>and I liked it,</li>
            <li>no need to fight over mirror when you have you own.  </li>
            <li>The magnified side works very nicely with the light.</li>
            <li>Nice mirror lights up good but turns on easily, by itself sometimes.</li>
            <li>Magnification is good and ergonomics of it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to assemble</li>
            <li>It is perfect with it&#x27;s clear image</li>
            <li>The light is really bright.  </li>
            <li>The light is not as bright as I think an LED should be.</li>
            <li>Light is not to bright.</li>
            <li>But for something to keep handy which is also positionable as a stand mirror, I doubt you&#x27;ll find anything better for the price.</li>
            <li>and it can store easily!</li>
            <li>Works beautifully and the light is just the right tone for doing makeup!</li>
            <li>, the light is nice but kind of a pain to have to lift the mirror up and turn the bottom to turn it on compared to a plug or switch.</li>
            <li>I have had the mirror for about 2 months, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product, it is perfect for old eyes, I can take it anywhere</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and the led light is BRIGHT !!!</li>
            <li>I was really happy when I opened the box because the battery-operated mirror was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I received the new one very quickly, it works great!</li>
            <li>Bright light, easy to turn off and on, stand adjusts to almost any angle.  </li>
            <li>they wrote to me: &amp;#34;we&#x27;d be happy to offer you a full refund for your original purchase.</li>
            <li>This mirror is GREAT and it looks very high end.</li>
            <li>I love most things about this mirror</li>
            <li>; light works great; good visibility even in a dimly lighted room</li>
            <li>We shopped around and went to many stores but were not satisfiy with any of them.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love that I can hang it on a wall, set it on a tabletop, or hold it by the handle (and not get fingerprints on the mirror).</li>
            <li>i like better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I could see the stitches from top</li>
            <li>I purchased the LED Lighted Makeup Mirror and have found it to be better than I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>Nice mirror - light did not work from day one.  </li>
            <li>Its a cute versatile vanity mirror .&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it,</li>
            <li>Great find on amazon, very versatile product.  </li>
            <li>Could be better designed.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the quality of this mirror.  </li>
            <li>It will fit nicely in any size suitcase.</li>
            <li>when I turn it off I have to make sure it goes almost to the turn-on-again point.</li>
            <li>For a non-electric mirror hand mirror, it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>I love the portability and functionality of the product as well as the convince to be able to store it out of sight when I want to.  </li>
            <li>love the idea....</li>
            <li>Love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Lighting is so much better than just bathroom lighting.</li>
            <li>I love using the lighted magnified side for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the service.</li>
            <li>Its ok to use if you set it on a counter</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a floxite mirror as a replacement for about $20 more and the design is so much better.</li>
            <li>This mirror works great and is very practical.  </li>
            <li>However, IMHO it needs stronger batteries, not AAA batteries,  or more than the three batteries the handle holds.</li>
            <li>Will buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li>and i love it..</li>
            <li>I wear glasses and need more magnification.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>It is even better than I hoped.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with it.</li>
            <li>i love this mirror</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>and I do love it ....</li>
            <li>OVER ALL I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>The ring of light makes it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The battery-operated light is just bright enough - it&#x27;s great that there is no cord to deal with.  </li>
            <li>It has pretty good magnification.</li>
            <li>I think the quality is on par with the price, and as long as it lasts me 4 months (the duration of my upcoming trip), I will be very happy!</li>
            <li>it has 2 sides over all it was pretty good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this mirror isn&#x27;t bright enough for me, in fairness here are the good points:&lt;br /&gt;-Light and easy to pack</li>
            <li>but overall it is a very good product.</li>
            <li>me do exactly what I need to do, and it looks so nice and elegant.</li>
            <li>It puts out better light than my plug in make up mirror.</li>
            <li>Bathroom counter is clear of clutter and it works great.</li>
            <li>i stead of 5X&lt;br /&gt;Its super stable and the light around adds a nice feature</li>
            <li>It makes it super easy for her to do her makeup anywhere in the house!</li>
            <li>and it is great for the spot I need it in, but it would have been more helpful if it were larger.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, easy to pack</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy, so it&#x27;s perfect for travel, and I love the fact that it can be handheld or used with the stand.</li>
            <li>the stand isnt so easily adjustable and also my counter height doesnt work for this size.</li>
            <li>Easy to put in luggage and does not weigh a lot.</li>
            <li>Batteries are easily changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to adjust the height.  </li>
            <li>Easy to take it out of the package and getting it working.</li>
            <li>It is portable and easy to use anywhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and comes with bubble wrap over the mirror which I can use for packing, and the stand is easy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it is easy to travel with and is battery operated so you can take it abroad and not worry about voltage issues.</li>
            <li>The legs slide up and down the handle (which houses the batteries), so the perfect angle is easy to reach.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended by me.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>So far, I am loving it!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>But looks and works fine.</li>
            <li>mirrors are fine but the lighted portion doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-works fine.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more than adequate light for you to apply makeup or asses your skin&#x27;s condition.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look like a huge piece of equipment cluttering my vanity.  </li>
            <li>Will be nice for traveling and being able to apply your makeup in those dimly lit hotel bathrooms.</li>
            <li>but there is an issue keeping the light on it</li>
            <li>Like, really bright, nearly blinding.</li>
            <li>turn/click light.</li>
            <li>If there is the slightest movement of the mirror the light goes off or on.  </li>
            <li>but it does what I want it to do.....magnify and light up.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I have a cheap mirror that is probably paid 12 bucks for that</li>
            <li>The stand works well too - it keeps the mirror available</li>
            <li>Unusable for makeup where color accuracy is important</li>
            <li>We found we had to fiddle with the switch to get the light to stay on.  </li>
            <li>I had this mirror for a month and ended up having to return it because the handle kept popping off when I would turn on the light.</li>
            <li>Not made out of cheap plastic, there is some quality here.</li>
            <li>Having the light all the way around makes a bit of a glare.  </li>
            <li>I liked the design of the mirror + legs quite well, but the lights didn&#x27;t work from the very start.</li>
            <li>I like the adjustable height, the angle and the light is sufficent.</li>
            <li>Well, I returned this item because the light feature didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t light up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;She used it as a regular mirror and was happy.</li>
            <li>Mom is even happier now with the light she didn&#x27;t know she needed.</li>
            <li>and now I hang my mirror from the light fixture or the towl bar to hold the mirror at any height</li>
            <li>But if you want to rely on it as your primary light source, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The hook at the bottom unscrews to insert the batteries and also twists to shut light on or off.</li>
            <li>The light stopped turning on after two weeks, even after changing the batteries.</li>
            <li>The mirror is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The light was a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought the light would be brighter....</li>
            <li>This mirror gives clear image and good lighting.  </li>
            <li>It looks great in the modern decor of my bathroom and is very practical.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and store just the right amount of magnification for me!</li>
            <li>Super easy and intuitive to set up -- works well at any angle.</li>
            <li>The stand is genius, slip it off quickly and easily to just hold.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to use/</li>
            <li>This is a bit larger and heavier than I wanted but is manageable and works great, and the light is plenty bright enough to see by.</li>
            <li>This mirror is the perfect size for my small vanity.  </li>
            <li>but it gives good light and the 5x mirror gets you up close and personal for plucking!&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>The light is adequate.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a mirror that could show my entire face under a bright &#x27;make-up&#x27; mirror light.</li>
            <li>This light is plenty bright enough for it.  </li>
            <li>The package got here quickly and was packed securely.</li>
            <li>There are others like it that plug in, so if you want a wire-free, clean counter- go for this one.</li>
            <li>All in all, it does a good job for me, but don&#x27;t purchase if you need extra light for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>The lights are exactly bright enough.  </li>
            <li>Good product, not too big.</li>
            <li>Good simple and portable.</li>
            <li>The stand design does make the mirror is very adjustable on a counter top (also a benefit for travel if you need to adjust depending on hotel vanity or desk).</li>
            <li>good to use if u have no access to another mirror but definitely need room lighting on.</li>
            <li>Other than that its great.</li>
            <li>I was in high hopes that it would be perfect but not worth the frustration.</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t super bright as other reviewers mentioned, but it&#x27;s good enough for me</li>
            <li>AAA batteries needed, luckily I had them sitting around.</li>
            <li>The product was received quickly and without any damage.  </li>
            <li>delivery was quick, it is well made and it was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>but they were quick to send a replacement.</li>
            <li>Researched many mirrors because I wanted particular features, and this one was within the budget and ticked off the boxes.  </li>
            <li>and you have to be sitting up high to be able to use it because it&#x27;s slanted</li>
            <li>The first worked for a month before the light stopped turning on.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the overall product.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it four stars is because the light isn&#x27;t as bright as it could be and it flickers a little bit; however, it was still a good buy</li>
            <li>Shows both a great close-up view for applying make-up as well as a normal view to check out the back view.</li>
            <li>so I decided to do my first video review!</li>
            <li>I wanted just a slight magnification along with a light, and this was perfect for the low price.</li>
            <li>Great little travel mirror</li>
            <li>Great little mirror for the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all on my counter.  </li>
            <li>Even though the whole piece is light weight, it still feels</li>
            <li>I dont even bother turning the light on anymore, really makes no difference on or off...</li>
            <li>I feel like I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>not awful, but overpriced as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I&#x27;m not returning it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>but not enough to provide any meaningful amount of light.  </li>
            <li>Kind of scary to see your skin up that close, lol.</li>
            <li>The light led ring around the mirror looked better than it actually worked.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife because she wanted a lighted mirror, I was pretty nervous because the ones I&#x27;ve seen in stores were pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I love that it runs on batteries and actually provides good light, unlike other battery operated mirrors I have tried.</li>
            <li>I would say the LED light provides the same amount of light as a full moon, but then again the moon might be brighter.  </li>
            <li>You just twist the loop on the end of the handle to turn it on and off (out of the way and very user friendly).  </li>
            <li>The LED is nice and bright but not blinding, my only gripe is the on/off switch which does sometimes flickers if after you set it down</li>
            <li>and just the right illumination on both sides.</li>
            <li>Plus if you don&#x27;t align the clamp in just the right way the mirror doesn&#x27;t sit correctly.  </li>
            <li>It hooks right into the bottom loop.  </li>
            <li>This mirror took 3 AAA batteries and lit right up.</li>
            <li>the 1x and 5x is just right for makeup application.</li>
            <li>Great little mirror does the job for me!  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror, I love the fact I can pick it up and go sit down and not have to strain my eyes when doing my eyebrows or putting on eye shadow, it has just the right amount of magnification needed for me.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and tHe mirror is fine as well as the design, but the light is nowhere near the brightness I wanted.</li>
            <li>adjust to any height and distance i require, specially i need to be very close to it</li>
            <li>Batteries are not included other then that the mirror is pretty good</li>
            <li>I wonder if the people who said it wasn&#x27;t bright enough are used to classic lighted makeup mirrors, which are certainly brighter than this is.</li>
            <li>Some times you live the light on and realize that at night.</li>
            <li>Even when you get it right, the stand is pretty unstable.  </li>
            <li>The light is very sensitive, it is on when I think it is off.</li>
            <li>but the light is very dim.</li>
            <li>Not a TON of light (my old eyes!)</li>
            <li>One side is a normal mirror and the other (back) is zoomed (perfect for when you need to pluck your eyebrows!).</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>and I love the way you can set the angle and switch from regular to magnified.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I was not because I paid for a lighted mirror which cost more than a regular mirror.</li>
            <li>This mirror is exactly what I was looking for in a makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for anything more, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is because I wish it came with a traveling bag.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for use at home, mostly magnifying for makeup, handheld for back-of-the-hair checks and for occasional travel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The magnifying power is fairly standard (haven&#x27;t used many)</li>
            <li>Looks pretty sitting on the countertop.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a daily use lighted magnification mirror, you may not be completely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>It is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The stand works perfectly for me, though I can see it slipping down a bit.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t come close to providing adequate light, especially trying to use it in a bathroom with a dim light fixture.</li>
            <li>Thought the light would be a little more brighter.</li>
            <li>I love it but just wish the light was a little brighter</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but it&#x27;s actually quite amazing and takes up little space.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect (large enough to see but small enough to fit in my drawer).</li>
            <li>The light is not super bright but definitely provides enough light</li>
            <li>This mirror is well built, simple to use, and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Since it can be switched without completely taking the legs off it is quick to convert from counter-top to hanging.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is easy to wipe down and stays clean.  </li>
            <li>so this certainly makes it easier for her to put on make-up.</li>
            <li>The light that it gives off is ok, but not very bright.</li>
            <li>When you turn the light off sometimes when you sit it down the light will come back on, causing you to have to toy with it to cut it off, and also it drains the battery which dims the light.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is fine, but the design is impractical for actual use.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Does not take up much counter space.</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Very portable and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space.</li>
            <li>I really like the mirror.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for this well designed product.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get much adjustment.  </li>
            <li>The nearest town is 20 miles away and getting there is very costly for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She needed light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted seller and within a reasonable amount of time they sent out a working replacement.</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Purchased this for travel as I found not all motels will provide a magnified make-up mirror which I absolutely have to have for these eyes.  </li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>but it is very helpful in putting on make</li>
            <li>so I can put on makeup and really see what I need to see.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that you can take it out of the stand and it can become a hand mirror.</li>
            <li>The LED light is definitely a benefit for under-lit rooms (hotels!).</li>
            <li>10x would be way too much magnification.</li>
            <li>Fairly reasonable price</li>
            <li>so I could get a view of my whole face.  </li>
            <li>The switch (which is at the bottom of the handle) is a bit sensitive and needs to be in the right spot to stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the size is not too big and not too small, perfect for daily use around the house and travel purposes.</li>
            <li>the price is way better than other inferior mirrors.</li>
            <li>Had a hard time finding a mirror of this type and was very pleased to see that you offered it.</li>
            <li>I tried two different sets of new batteries and never even got a flicker of light.</li>
            <li>It is a little smaller than I was anticipating, but the size is still good for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I also now think that the design is much nicer and modern than the other makeup mirrors available on Amazon (even my boyfriend likes how it looks in the bathroom).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent stand up mirror</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because or how dim the light actually is.</li>
            <li>And last, it eats batteries so quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a decent size mirror though, and</li>
            <li>It has all of the features that I was looking for (mainly portability &amp; removable stand).</li>
            <li>Two main gripes with this mirror:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The magnification makes the images very clear and traveling much easier also.</li>
            <li>The lights are plenty bright, it offers regular magnification on one side and 5x on the other, and it takes NORMAL sized batteries.</li>
            <li>Light not strong at all and dies out real fast.  </li>
            <li>My order arrived quickly &amp; was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this mirror to anyone looking for a bathroom/vanity mirror to do their makeup/tweeze.</li>
            <li>Previous mirror works great but is much too large, bulky and heavy for frequent travel.  </li>
            <li>For the price I was expecting a little more.</li>
            <li>This  has far exceeded my expectations!!</li>
            <li>It is still better than most other small mirrors I have tried.</li>
            <li>You have to set it down a certain way to get the light to say on.</li>
            <li>The stand provided is a spring that coils around the handle, but it&#x27;s rather top heavy</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where you also turn the LED lights on (turning the knob left or right).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than just a plain mirror, but I&#x27;m used to one of those makeup mirrors with the flourescent lights on either side and settings for day, evening, etc.</li>
            <li>So I bought new batteries and read the directions again to see if I missed anything and still it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>The white perimeter shown on the picture is where the light comes from on both the front and back side.</li>
            <li>so far it is in the box and hasn&#x27;t been used!</li>
            <li>If it ever does stop working I will order the EXACT same one.</li>
            <li>Not sure I love looking at myself in 5X mirror</li>
            <li>The way it turns on and off is not the most convenient, but it&#x27;s a small thing considering how well it meets my needs.</li>
            <li>Not good for doing your own makeup</li>
            <li>Also, it is a little unstable and falls over easily.</li>
            <li>I hope some other manufacturer gets it right because I really need a well lighted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the on-off switch at the bottom of the handle is a little temperamental - needing to be twisted back and forth until just the right spot is found for &#x27;on&#x27; and &#x27;off&#x27; but the mirror is so perfect</li>
            <li>The light is pretty dim though and I wish the mirror was a little bigger.</li>
            <li>The batteries do no last very long at all and the light gets noticeably dimmer and dimmer with each use.  </li>
            <li>The light could be a little brighter</li>
            <li>The item is clearly stated and no surprises.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exceptionally clear.  </li>
            <li>No need to place near an outlet.</li>
            <li>(so we can close up the door and my stuff disappears), so the lighting is dim in that area.  </li>
            <li>so she could do her makeup by the window for natural lighting benefits.  </li>
            <li>Once I received the mirror, I was pleasantly surprised by all the features.</li>
            <li>After a few months, the light seems to be touchy.  </li>
            <li>Even with brand new batteries the light is too dim for close critical work in a dark location.</li>
            <li>Cheap LEDs emit a greenish hue, and the Color Rendering Index (CRI) must be very low, since reds and other colors do not appear natural.  </li>
            <li>The light is not very bright even with new batteries.</li>
            <li>I needed something powerful, yet compact due to space constraints on the boat.  </li>
            <li>It has an odd color and doesn&#x27;t really help much.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to assemble - took me only a few minutes.</li>
            <li>This mirror is small and light weight.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth maybe half that.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it&#x27;s very sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I earned major points</li>
            <li>The tripod legs are extremely stable, and it is easy to turn the legs to the other side and hang the mirror with the magnified side facing out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light and small enough for travel.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering another in the near future!</li>
            <li>Great for half blind people like me..</li>
            <li>The light is kinda tricky to turn on though, it seems to take quite a few tries and sometimes my wife just gives up.</li>
            <li>Cute but mirror not bright at all!</li>
            <li>The mirror is lighted around the circumference, so it is easy to see, even in a poorly lit room.</li>
            <li>Was delivered very quickly and sturdy packaging so no risk of broken mirror.</li>
            <li>The lighting is subtle but better then any other hand held out there.</li>
            <li>Item arrived, didn&#x27;t work, sent message to seller, they replied immediately, sent out a new item right away and told me not to worry about sending the broken item back.</li>

            <li> The mirror looked good and was very nice when I opened it from the package, but when I installed the batteries it didn&#x27;t light up.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have never looked better!</li>
            <li> I love that it can stand and the fact that it lights up is a plus!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to keep in the rv, which never has a good mirror, but it ends up staying in the house!</li>
            <li> I also would not consider this the best choice for a travel mirror, being fairly large, glass, and lacking a protective case.</li>
            <li> This makeup mirror is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great, light weight handheld mirror.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this is the light.</li>
            <li> Really handy</li>
            <li> This is nice and sturdy with the stand on it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mirror</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice mirror</li>
            <li> They deserve the 5 stars for excellent customer service and satisfaction!!&amp;#34; The mirror works really well, almost too well...</li>
            <li> It is battery operated which is nice for transport.</li>
            <li> It is nice and compact and I just stuck a push pin in the wall &amp; hang it up when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> Again, nothing came close to the nice magification for putting on makeup..</li>
            <li> Nice mirror and sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s really nice otherwise.</li>
            <li> So handy.  </li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and excellent design.</li>
            <li> and I liked it,</li>
            <li> no need to fight over mirror when you have you own.  </li>
            <li> The magnified side works very nicely with the light.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror lights up good but turns on easily, by itself sometimes.</li>
            <li> Magnification is good and ergonomics of it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to assemble</li>
            <li> It is perfect with it&#x27;s clear image</li>
            <li> The light is really bright.  </li>
            <li> The light is not as bright as I think an LED should be.</li>
            <li> Light is not to bright.</li>
            <li> But for something to keep handy which is also positionable as a stand mirror, I doubt you&#x27;ll find anything better for the price.</li>
            <li> and it can store easily!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and the light is just the right tone for doing makeup!</li>
            <li> , the light is nice but kind of a pain to have to lift the mirror up and turn the bottom to turn it on compared to a plug or switch.</li>
            <li> I have had the mirror for about 2 months, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product, it is perfect for old eyes, I can take it anywhere</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and the led light is BRIGHT !!!</li>
            <li> I was really happy when I opened the box because the battery-operated mirror was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I received the new one very quickly, it works great!</li>
            <li> Bright light, easy to turn off and on, stand adjusts to almost any angle.  </li>
            <li> they wrote to me: &amp;#34;we&#x27;d be happy to offer you a full refund for your original purchase.</li>
            <li> This mirror is GREAT and it looks very high end.</li>
            <li> I love most things about this mirror</li>
            <li> ; light works great; good visibility even in a dimly lighted room</li>
            <li> We shopped around and went to many stores but were not satisfiy with any of them.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love that I can hang it on a wall, set it on a tabletop, or hold it by the handle (and not get fingerprints on the mirror).</li>
            <li> i like better.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is ok.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I could see the stitches from top</li>
            <li> I purchased the LED Lighted Makeup Mirror and have found it to be better than I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> Nice mirror - light did not work from day one.  </li>
            <li> Its a cute versatile vanity mirror .&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it,</li>
            <li> Great find on amazon, very versatile product.  </li>
            <li> Could be better designed.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the quality of this mirror.  </li>
            <li> It will fit nicely in any size suitcase.</li>
            <li> when I turn it off I have to make sure it goes almost to the turn-on-again point.</li>
            <li> For a non-electric mirror hand mirror, it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> I love the portability and functionality of the product as well as the convince to be able to store it out of sight when I want to.  </li>
            <li> love the idea....</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.  </li>
            <li> Lighting is so much better than just bathroom lighting.</li>
            <li> I love using the lighted magnified side for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the service.</li>
            <li> Its ok to use if you set it on a counter</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a floxite mirror as a replacement for about $20 more and the design is so much better.</li>
            <li> This mirror works great and is very practical.  </li>
            <li> However, IMHO it needs stronger batteries, not AAA batteries,  or more than the three batteries the handle holds.</li>
            <li> Will buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> and i love it..</li>
            <li> I wear glasses and need more magnification.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> It is even better than I hoped.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with it.</li>
            <li> i love this mirror</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> and I do love it ....</li>
            <li> OVER ALL I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> The ring of light makes it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The battery-operated light is just bright enough - it&#x27;s great that there is no cord to deal with.  </li>
            <li> It has pretty good magnification.</li>
            <li> I think the quality is on par with the price, and as long as it lasts me 4 months (the duration of my upcoming trip), I will be very happy!</li>
            <li> it has 2 sides over all it was pretty good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this mirror isn&#x27;t bright enough for me, in fairness here are the good points:&lt;br /&gt;-Light and easy to pack</li>
            <li> but overall it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> me do exactly what I need to do, and it looks so nice and elegant.</li>
            <li> It puts out better light than my plug in make up mirror.</li>
            <li> Bathroom counter is clear of clutter and it works great.</li>
            <li> i stead of 5X&lt;br /&gt;Its super stable and the light around adds a nice feature</li>
            <li> It makes it super easy for her to do her makeup anywhere in the house!</li>
            <li> and it is great for the spot I need it in, but it would have been more helpful if it were larger.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to pack</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy, so it&#x27;s perfect for travel, and I love the fact that it can be handheld or used with the stand.</li>
            <li> the stand isnt so easily adjustable and also my counter height doesnt work for this size.</li>
            <li> Easy to put in luggage and does not weigh a lot.</li>
            <li> Batteries are easily changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to adjust the height.  </li>
            <li> Easy to take it out of the package and getting it working.</li>
            <li> It is portable and easy to use anywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and comes with bubble wrap over the mirror which I can use for packing, and the stand is easy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it is easy to travel with and is battery operated so you can take it abroad and not worry about voltage issues.</li>
            <li> The legs slide up and down the handle (which houses the batteries), so the perfect angle is easy to reach.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended by me.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> So far, I am loving it!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> But looks and works fine.</li>
            <li> mirrors are fine but the lighted portion doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-works fine.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s more than adequate light for you to apply makeup or asses your skin&#x27;s condition.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look like a huge piece of equipment cluttering my vanity.  </li>
            <li> Will be nice for traveling and being able to apply your makeup in those dimly lit hotel bathrooms.</li>
            <li> but there is an issue keeping the light on it</li>
            <li> Like, really bright, nearly blinding.</li>
            <li> turn/click light.</li>
            <li> If there is the slightest movement of the mirror the light goes off or on.  </li>
            <li> but it does what I want it to do.....magnify and light up.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have a cheap mirror that is probably paid 12 bucks for that</li>
            <li> The stand works well too - it keeps the mirror available</li>
            <li> Unusable for makeup where color accuracy is important</li>
            <li> We found we had to fiddle with the switch to get the light to stay on.  </li>
            <li> I had this mirror for a month and ended up having to return it because the handle kept popping off when I would turn on the light.</li>
            <li> Not made out of cheap plastic, there is some quality here.</li>
            <li> Having the light all the way around makes a bit of a glare.  </li>
            <li> I liked the design of the mirror + legs quite well, but the lights didn&#x27;t work from the very start.</li>
            <li> I like the adjustable height, the angle and the light is sufficent.</li>
            <li> Well, I returned this item because the light feature didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t light up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;She used it as a regular mirror and was happy.</li>
            <li> Mom is even happier now with the light she didn&#x27;t know she needed.</li>
            <li> and now I hang my mirror from the light fixture or the towl bar to hold the mirror at any height</li>
            <li> But if you want to rely on it as your primary light source, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The hook at the bottom unscrews to insert the batteries and also twists to shut light on or off.</li>
            <li> The light stopped turning on after two weeks, even after changing the batteries.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The light was a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought the light would be brighter....</li>
            <li> This mirror gives clear image and good lighting.  </li>
            <li> It looks great in the modern decor of my bathroom and is very practical.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and store just the right amount of magnification for me!</li>
            <li> Super easy and intuitive to set up -- works well at any angle.</li>
            <li> The stand is genius, slip it off quickly and easily to just hold.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to use/</li>
            <li> This is a bit larger and heavier than I wanted but is manageable and works great, and the light is plenty bright enough to see by.</li>
            <li> This mirror is the perfect size for my small vanity.  </li>
            <li> but it gives good light and the 5x mirror gets you up close and personal for plucking!&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> The light is adequate.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mirror that could show my entire face under a bright &#x27;make-up&#x27; mirror light.</li>
            <li> This light is plenty bright enough for it.  </li>
            <li> The package got here quickly and was packed securely.</li>
            <li> There are others like it that plug in, so if you want a wire-free, clean counter- go for this one.</li>
            <li> All in all, it does a good job for me, but don&#x27;t purchase if you need extra light for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> The lights are exactly bright enough.  </li>
            <li> Good product, not too big.</li>
            <li> Good simple and portable.</li>
            <li> The stand design does make the mirror is very adjustable on a counter top (also a benefit for travel if you need to adjust depending on hotel vanity or desk).</li>
            <li> good to use if u have no access to another mirror but definitely need room lighting on.</li>
            <li> Other than that its great.</li>
            <li> I was in high hopes that it would be perfect but not worth the frustration.</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t super bright as other reviewers mentioned, but it&#x27;s good enough for me</li>
            <li> AAA batteries needed, luckily I had them sitting around.</li>
            <li> The product was received quickly and without any damage.  </li>
            <li> delivery was quick, it is well made and it was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> but they were quick to send a replacement.</li>
            <li> Researched many mirrors because I wanted particular features, and this one was within the budget and ticked off the boxes.  </li>
            <li> and you have to be sitting up high to be able to use it because it&#x27;s slanted</li>
            <li> The first worked for a month before the light stopped turning on.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the overall product.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars is because the light isn&#x27;t as bright as it could be and it flickers a little bit; however, it was still a good buy</li>
            <li> Shows both a great close-up view for applying make-up as well as a normal view to check out the back view.</li>
            <li> so I decided to do my first video review!</li>
            <li> I wanted just a slight magnification along with a light, and this was perfect for the low price.</li>
            <li> Great little travel mirror</li>
            <li> Great little mirror for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is light and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all on my counter.  </li>
            <li> Even though the whole piece is light weight, it still feels</li>
            <li> I dont even bother turning the light on anymore, really makes no difference on or off...</li>
            <li> I feel like I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> not awful, but overpriced as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I&#x27;m not returning it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> but not enough to provide any meaningful amount of light.  </li>
            <li> Kind of scary to see your skin up that close, lol.</li>
            <li> The light led ring around the mirror looked better than it actually worked.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she wanted a lighted mirror, I was pretty nervous because the ones I&#x27;ve seen in stores were pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I love that it runs on batteries and actually provides good light, unlike other battery operated mirrors I have tried.</li>
            <li> I would say the LED light provides the same amount of light as a full moon, but then again the moon might be brighter.  </li>
            <li> You just twist the loop on the end of the handle to turn it on and off (out of the way and very user friendly).  </li>
            <li> The LED is nice and bright but not blinding, my only gripe is the on/off switch which does sometimes flickers if after you set it down</li>
            <li> and just the right illumination on both sides.</li>
            <li> Plus if you don&#x27;t align the clamp in just the right way the mirror doesn&#x27;t sit correctly.  </li>
            <li> It hooks right into the bottom loop.  </li>
            <li> This mirror took 3 AAA batteries and lit right up.</li>
            <li> the 1x and 5x is just right for makeup application.</li>
            <li> Great little mirror does the job for me!  </li>
            <li> I love this mirror, I love the fact I can pick it up and go sit down and not have to strain my eyes when doing my eyebrows or putting on eye shadow, it has just the right amount of magnification needed for me.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and tHe mirror is fine as well as the design, but the light is nowhere near the brightness I wanted.</li>
            <li> adjust to any height and distance i require, specially i need to be very close to it</li>
            <li> Batteries are not included other then that the mirror is pretty good</li>
            <li> I wonder if the people who said it wasn&#x27;t bright enough are used to classic lighted makeup mirrors, which are certainly brighter than this is.</li>
            <li> Some times you live the light on and realize that at night.</li>
            <li> Even when you get it right, the stand is pretty unstable.  </li>
            <li> The light is very sensitive, it is on when I think it is off.</li>
            <li> but the light is very dim.</li>
            <li> Not a TON of light (my old eyes!)</li>
            <li> One side is a normal mirror and the other (back) is zoomed (perfect for when you need to pluck your eyebrows!).</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> and I love the way you can set the angle and switch from regular to magnified.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I was not because I paid for a lighted mirror which cost more than a regular mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for in a makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ask for anything more, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is because I wish it came with a traveling bag.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for use at home, mostly magnifying for makeup, handheld for back-of-the-hair checks and for occasional travel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The magnifying power is fairly standard (haven&#x27;t used many)</li>
            <li> Looks pretty sitting on the countertop.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a daily use lighted magnification mirror, you may not be completely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> It is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The stand works perfectly for me, though I can see it slipping down a bit.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t come close to providing adequate light, especially trying to use it in a bathroom with a dim light fixture.</li>
            <li> Thought the light would be a little more brighter.</li>
            <li> I love it but just wish the light was a little brighter</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but it&#x27;s actually quite amazing and takes up little space.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect (large enough to see but small enough to fit in my drawer).</li>
            <li> The light is not super bright but definitely provides enough light</li>
            <li> This mirror is well built, simple to use, and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Since it can be switched without completely taking the legs off it is quick to convert from counter-top to hanging.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is easy to wipe down and stays clean.  </li>
            <li> so this certainly makes it easier for her to put on make-up.</li>
            <li> The light that it gives off is ok, but not very bright.</li>
            <li> When you turn the light off sometimes when you sit it down the light will come back on, causing you to have to toy with it to cut it off, and also it drains the battery which dims the light.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is fine, but the design is impractical for actual use.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Does not take up much counter space.</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Very portable and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space.</li>
            <li> I really like the mirror.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for this well designed product.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get much adjustment.  </li>
            <li> The nearest town is 20 miles away and getting there is very costly for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She needed light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted seller and within a reasonable amount of time they sent out a working replacement.</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Purchased this for travel as I found not all motels will provide a magnified make-up mirror which I absolutely have to have for these eyes.  </li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> but it is very helpful in putting on make</li>
            <li> so I can put on makeup and really see what I need to see.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the fact that you can take it out of the stand and it can become a hand mirror.</li>
            <li> The LED light is definitely a benefit for under-lit rooms (hotels!).</li>
            <li> 10x would be way too much magnification.</li>
            <li> Fairly reasonable price</li>
            <li> so I could get a view of my whole face.  </li>
            <li> The switch (which is at the bottom of the handle) is a bit sensitive and needs to be in the right spot to stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the size is not too big and not too small, perfect for daily use around the house and travel purposes.</li>
            <li> the price is way better than other inferior mirrors.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding a mirror of this type and was very pleased to see that you offered it.</li>
            <li> I tried two different sets of new batteries and never even got a flicker of light.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than I was anticipating, but the size is still good for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I also now think that the design is much nicer and modern than the other makeup mirrors available on Amazon (even my boyfriend likes how it looks in the bathroom).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent stand up mirror</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because or how dim the light actually is.</li>
            <li> And last, it eats batteries so quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a decent size mirror though, and</li>
            <li> It has all of the features that I was looking for (mainly portability &amp; removable stand).</li>
            <li> Two main gripes with this mirror:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The magnification makes the images very clear and traveling much easier also.</li>
            <li> The lights are plenty bright, it offers regular magnification on one side and 5x on the other, and it takes NORMAL sized batteries.</li>
            <li> Light not strong at all and dies out real fast.  </li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly &amp; was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this mirror to anyone looking for a bathroom/vanity mirror to do their makeup/tweeze.</li>
            <li> Previous mirror works great but is much too large, bulky and heavy for frequent travel.  </li>
            <li> For the price I was expecting a little more.</li>
            <li> This  has far exceeded my expectations!!</li>
            <li> It is still better than most other small mirrors I have tried.</li>
            <li> You have to set it down a certain way to get the light to say on.</li>
            <li> The stand provided is a spring that coils around the handle, but it&#x27;s rather top heavy</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where you also turn the LED lights on (turning the knob left or right).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than just a plain mirror, but I&#x27;m used to one of those makeup mirrors with the flourescent lights on either side and settings for day, evening, etc.</li>
            <li> So I bought new batteries and read the directions again to see if I missed anything and still it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> The white perimeter shown on the picture is where the light comes from on both the front and back side.</li>
            <li> so far it is in the box and hasn&#x27;t been used!</li>
            <li> If it ever does stop working I will order the EXACT same one.</li>
            <li> Not sure I love looking at myself in 5X mirror</li>
            <li> The way it turns on and off is not the most convenient, but it&#x27;s a small thing considering how well it meets my needs.</li>
            <li> Not good for doing your own makeup</li>
            <li> Also, it is a little unstable and falls over easily.</li>
            <li> I hope some other manufacturer gets it right because I really need a well lighted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the on-off switch at the bottom of the handle is a little temperamental - needing to be twisted back and forth until just the right spot is found for &#x27;on&#x27; and &#x27;off&#x27; but the mirror is so perfect</li>
            <li> The light is pretty dim though and I wish the mirror was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> The batteries do no last very long at all and the light gets noticeably dimmer and dimmer with each use.  </li>
            <li> The light could be a little brighter</li>
            <li> The item is clearly stated and no surprises.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exceptionally clear.  </li>
            <li> No need to place near an outlet.</li>
            <li> (so we can close up the door and my stuff disappears), so the lighting is dim in that area.  </li>
            <li> so she could do her makeup by the window for natural lighting benefits.  </li>
            <li> Once I received the mirror, I was pleasantly surprised by all the features.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the light seems to be touchy.  </li>
            <li> Even with brand new batteries the light is too dim for close critical work in a dark location.</li>
            <li> Cheap LEDs emit a greenish hue, and the Color Rendering Index (CRI) must be very low, since reds and other colors do not appear natural.  </li>
            <li> The light is not very bright even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> I needed something powerful, yet compact due to space constraints on the boat.  </li>
            <li> It has an odd color and doesn&#x27;t really help much.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to assemble - took me only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This mirror is small and light weight.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth maybe half that.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it&#x27;s very sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I earned major points</li>
            <li> The tripod legs are extremely stable, and it is easy to turn the legs to the other side and hang the mirror with the magnified side facing out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light and small enough for travel.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering another in the near future!</li>
            <li> Great for half blind people like me..</li>
            <li> The light is kinda tricky to turn on though, it seems to take quite a few tries and sometimes my wife just gives up.</li>
            <li> Cute but mirror not bright at all!</li>
            <li> The mirror is lighted around the circumference, so it is easy to see, even in a poorly lit room.</li>
            <li> Was delivered very quickly and sturdy packaging so no risk of broken mirror.</li>
            <li> The lighting is subtle but better then any other hand held out there.</li>
            <li> Item arrived, didn&#x27;t work, sent message to seller, they replied immediately, sent out a new item right away and told me not to worry about sending the broken item back.</li>
            <li> While I was afraid it would be a bit small, the size has worked out to be great, and the smaller size will be a benefit when I travel.  </li>
            <li> The design is slick and tripod definitely makes it very helpful.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this and its such a shame because it looked like a very good mirror.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because I needed a lighted, magnification mirror that I could put flat on the counter to put in specialized contact lenses.  </li>
            <li> Light was not strong enough, very heavy to hold too long, and the stand angle was not adjustable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely check other &amp;#34;Pure Enrichment&amp;#34; products out in future!</li>
            <li> but the light is almost useless.  </li>
            <li> This mirror was much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> but  the underneath side had no natural lighting.  </li>
            <li> It is also smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply not bright enough to make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to carry on a trip and I am very disappointed because the light much too dim for makeup application.</li>
            <li> this works in the limited space on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I bought this mirror hoping the negative reviews about how dim the light is were wrong.</li>
            <li> First mirror came broken</li>
            <li> only down side, i wished it was 7/8</li>
            <li> If I would have kept the packaging a little longer I would have sent it back.  </li>
            <li> The on/off knob is just a little quirky,</li>
            <li> WAy too dim and hard to position for makeup</li>
            <li> Be careful when using stand...</li>
            <li> Not as lighted as I expected.</li>
            <li> First of all, the angle at which the mirror stands is pretty awkward and pretty much impossible for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not positive if the LED lights work since I haven&#x27;t put batteries in it.  </li>
            <li> Other then that it</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Extremely versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have a particularly deep vanity, so this thing has been life-altering -- no more leaning over the counter to squint into the mirror.</li>
            <li> Adjusting the mirror&#x27;s height/angle is a nuissance with how the stand is just a clamp and not a hinged design like other mirrors.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the luminosity of the led light is very low; worse than putting makeup on in a hotel room.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the cost of the item.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the $80 asking price.  </li>
            <li> I used in a dimmish room and it was too dark even with the lights on to use the mirror.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the LED ring might as well not be there.  </li>
            <li> I keep the stand on, it doesn&#x27;t get in the way when I use it as a handheld and when I set it down the mirror is upright and stays cleaner.</li>
            <li> I can sit in a comfy chair and hold the mirror with one hand and groom with the other!</li>
            <li> Also the actual mirror potion is very small.  </li>
            <li> I did however find the instructions to be somewhat confusing, so it took me a few extra moments to figure it out.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a lighted mirror with less magnification than 10x or 15x..</li>
            <li> Lastly, the on/off switch is on the bottom of the mirror&#x27;s handle, which is also weird since you have to physically pick it up to twist it to turn it on/</li>
            <li> I previously had a bulkier, plug-in model mirror that stood on my bathroom sink</li>
            <li> and I have the same make up mirror on vacation and at home, and seriously when does that happen?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not bright enough by itself.</li>
            <li> design is not suitable for my makeup application needs: it&#x27;s too small and you cant rotate or angle the actual mirror</li>
            <li> thought it might be a little unstable -</li>
            <li> (with it&#x27;s little tripod)</li>
            <li> wish it were a little brighter, but still helps with morning makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Stand could be a little wider/heavier</li>
            <li> The mirror was heavier than I was expecting, and sturdier than some other vanity mirrors I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> Little tripod legs keep it stable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i hang on the wall, but its a little heavy</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s heavy as a hand mirror.</li>
            <li> so this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She went to town and bought another set of batteries at her expense and the mirror still did not light up.</li>
            <li> This mirror is heavy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Plain packaging not</li>
            <li> but you can not easily set it in your lap to use.</li>
            <li> Looking for something that is brighter and not so hard to move up or down .</li>
            <li> Quite small and flimsy</li>
            <li> I needed a small mirror for my vanity table.</li>
            <li> so flimsy and won&#x27;t stay upright - one of the most terrible items I&#x27;ve ever purchased from amazon!</li>
            <li> I needed a small mirror I could place in my closet.  </li>
            <li> I usually trust Amazon reviews, but this mirror&#x27;s 4.5 star rating puzzles me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The face of it is way too small.</li>
            <li> Fits micely in small space.</li>
            <li> It is too small...</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of the stand in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually quiet sturdy and can be removed -</li>
            <li> The mirror is way too small.</li>
            <li> Our bathroom is not very bright</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a terrible problem with irritants in my eye, and I needed a lighted mirror to remove them but wanted one that was fairly small and light.</li>
            <li> seemed too cheap and very disappointed</li>
            <li> which can take 30 seconds to a minute each time, which gets annoying really fast.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat heavy feeling to give it that expensive feel.</li>
            <li> The LED is not bright at all.</li>
            <li> Does not appear to be broken.</li>
            <li> disappointed at that, because I disliked the item anyway.</li>
            <li> I was wary of pulling the trigger on (yet) another duff illuminated magnifying mirror, but this one did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Useless and returned.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, those reviews were correct.</li>
            <li> It is so dark in his mancave that I had a terrible time doing make up!</li>
            <li> awkward for me.</li>
            <li> The stand was just a bit awkward but after a couple of minutes I got the hang of it and it did work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mirror was a bug disappointment the stand was difficukt to put on.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when the product arrived</li>
            <li> This was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Another made in China piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> but this is annoying</li>
            <li> this is the worst!!!</li>
            <li> The height is insufficient, and it is just generally a terrible design.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product. It let&#x27;s me do exactly what I need to do, and it looks so nice and elegant.</li>
            <li> I love most things about this mirror but there is an issue keeping the light on it lit (and the batteries are good so that&#x27;s not the problem).  This was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The LEDs are very bright! Like, really bright, nearly blinding. Other than that its great.</li>
            <li> this works in the limited space on the bathroom counter. I forgot it needed batteries, but I am happy with the mirror</li>
            <li> Really handy; light works great; good visibility even in a dimly lighted room</li>
            <li> The mirror is easy to wipe down and stays clean.  The LED is nice and bright but not blinding, my only gripe is the on/off switch which does sometimes flickers if after you set it down but it always corrects after a second attempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> love it!!! thought it might be a little unstable - NOT SO! This is nice and sturdy with the stand on it. It even comes with a suction cup if you choose to hang it!! I have it sitting on my dressing table so I can check my jewelry in the morning. It&#x27;s really pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Nice turn/click light. I am impressed with the sturdiness and quality of this item. Not a TON of light (my old eyes!) but it gives good light and the 5x mirror gets you up close and personal for plucking!&lt;br /&gt;3 AAA batteries needed, luckily I had them sitting around.</li>
            <li> If there is the slightest movement of the mirror the light goes off or on.  Also the actual mirror potion is very small.  If I would have kept the packaging a little longer I would have sent it back.  Definitely not worth the cost of the item.</li>
            <li> This works great. No need to place near an outlet. Does not take up much counter space.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to return it. Light was not strong enough, very heavy to hold too long, and the stand angle was not adjustable</li>
            <li> The light is very sensitive, it is on when I think it is off. It burns through batteries. The light is not very bright even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy but it does what I want it to do.....magnify and light up.  The magnification is great.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t take up much room at all on my counter.  Well constructed.  I feel like I have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what we were looking for. We shopped around and went to many stores but were not satisfiy with any of them. It feels good in hands and the LED light is great. the size is not too big and not too small, perfect for daily use around the house and travel purposes. the price is way better than other inferior mirrors. Love it.</li>
            <li> I was wary of pulling the trigger on (yet) another duff illuminated magnifying mirror, but this one did not disappoint. It is perfect with it&#x27;s clear image -glass- and just the right illumination on both sides.The legs slide up and down the handle (which houses the batteries), so the perfect angle is easy to reach.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended by me.</li>
            <li> Great little travel mirror</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror and it is great for the spot I need it in, but it would have been more helpful if it were larger. Also, it is a little unstable and falls over easily.</li>
            <li> This mirror is so versatile and it works well. I love that I can hang it on a wall, set it on a tabletop, or hold it by the handle (and not get fingerprints on the mirror). The lights are plenty bright, it offers regular magnification on one side and 5x on the other, and it takes NORMAL sized batteries. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat what you get with this mirror! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Looking for something that is brighter and not so hard to move up or down . WAy too dim and hard to position for makeup</li>
            <li> Very portable and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of space. Works well.</li>
            <li> This mirror is well built, simple to use, and easy to hold.  The light could be a little brighter but it gets the job done.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The mirror is lighted around the circumference, so it is easy to see, even in a poorly lit room. It stands up very nicely so you don&#x27;t have to hold it while using it. The magnification is 5x and shows you everything you&#x27;d want to see (or don&#x27;t want to see). I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted !</li>
            <li> Quite small and flimsy</li>
            <li> awkward for me. not awful, but overpriced as far as I&#x27;m concerned, I&#x27;m not returning it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This vanity mirror is so beautiful and hight quality made. I needed a small mirror for my vanity table. And this mirror is just what I wanted: hand mirror and vanity mirror in one piece. The lighting is perfect as well! I&#x27;ll definitely check other &amp;#34;Pure Enrichment&amp;#34; products out in future!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only mirror I need!  The light is really bright.  I just leave the stand on it when I use it as a hand mirror, and it&#x27;s not in the way at all.  It&#x27;s also light and small enough for travel.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Good product, not too big. Daughter loves it for makeup. I like how it sits on the 3 legged stand.</li>
            <li> It lights up, enough so you can tell it&#x27;s on, but not enough to provide any meaningful amount of light.  I would say the LED light provides the same amount of light as a full moon, but then again the moon might be brighter.  Useless and returned.</li>
            <li> Granted this is a mirror and it does the trick, i was dissapointed when i received it. It&#x27;s a lot smaller then i thought it would be for the price and you have to be sitting up high to be able to use it because it&#x27;s slanted, the light is nice but kind of a pain to have to lift the mirror up and turn the bottom to turn it on compared to a plug or switch. I have a cheap mirror that is probably paid 12 bucks for that i like better. For the price I was expecting a little more. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent stand up mirror (with it&#x27;s little tripod) but it&#x27;s heavy as a hand mirror. The LED is not bright at all. It will do in a pinch. I bought it for a trip but I could have gotten something cheaper for the same performance.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mirror and I use it all the time but the light is almost useless.  It has an odd color and doesn&#x27;t really help much.  The mirror itself is a great size and I love the way you can set the angle and switch from regular to magnified.</li>
            <li> The light is so dim that it&#x27;s completely useless.</li>
            <li> This mirror just looks just like the picture the only and I love it. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it&#x27;s very sensitive. When you turn the light off sometimes when you sit it down the light will come back on, causing you to have to toy with it to cut it off, and also it drains the battery which dims the light. Other then that it it&#x27;s a nice mirror</li>
            <li> This is ok. The light is not as bright as I think an LED should be. Magnification is good and ergonomics of it is easy to use. I gave it 3 stars because or how dim the light actually is.</li>
            <li> Item arrived, didn&#x27;t work, sent message to seller, they replied immediately, sent out a new item right away and told me not to worry about sending the broken item back. I received the new one very quickly, it works great! Would purchase from this seller again. They deserve the 5 stars for excellent customer service and satisfaction!!&amp;#34; The mirror works really well, almost too well... Kind of scary to see your skin up that close, lol. I like the fact that you can hang it up or prop it up on the counter.</li>
            <li> Practical but the light is very dim. Some times you live the light on and realize that at night.</li>
            <li> This mirror was much smaller than I expected. The light is adequate. Magnification is great. I cannot see my entire face at once in this mirror. I was looking for a mirror that could show my entire face under a bright &#x27;make-up&#x27; mirror light. I&#x27;ll keep it for travel purposes, but that is all. It is battery operated which is nice for transport.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lighted mirror. The ring of light makes it very easy to use. The magnified side works very nicely with the light.</li>
            <li> Good one. Light is not to bright. Love it</li>
            <li> this is the worst!!! so flimsy and won&#x27;t stay upright - one of the most terrible items I&#x27;ve ever purchased from amazon!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  Believe it or not, this mirror is for looking at stitching on the back of a quilt while still on the machine table.  I could see the stitches from top but  the underneath side had no natural lighting.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to use this mirror handheld, but as it turns out, this is what I do!  I can sit in a comfy chair and hold the mirror with one hand and groom with the other!</li>
            <li> I purchased the LED Lighted Makeup Mirror and have found it to be better than I&#x27;d hoped.  While I was afraid it would be a bit small, the size has worked out to be great, and the smaller size will be a benefit when I travel.  The stand works well too - it keeps the mirror available but it doesn&#x27;t look like a huge piece of equipment cluttering my vanity.  Good design!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for an apartment.</li>
            <li> Cheap LEDs emit a greenish hue, and the Color Rendering Index (CRI) must be very low, since reds and other colors do not appear natural.  Unusable for makeup where color accuracy is important</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror lights up good but turns on easily, by itself sometimes.</li>
            <li> I really like the mirror.  The magnification is perfect for applying makeup/plucking eyebrows.  I use it in a vanity that we built into a cupboard (so we can close up the door and my stuff disappears), so the lighting is dim in that area.  This light is plenty bright enough for it.  I did however find the instructions to be somewhat confusing, so it took me a few extra moments to figure it out.  Thanks for this well designed product.  My eyebrows have never looked better!</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the $80 asking price.  We got it for $30 and it&#x27;s worth maybe half that.  We found we had to fiddle with the switch to get the light to stay on.  The stand provided is a spring that coils around the handle, but it&#x27;s rather top heavy so you don&#x27;t get much adjustment.  Would be helpful if the handle were made out of a heavier material.  Other than that it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for. First of all, the angle at which the mirror stands is pretty awkward and pretty much impossible for me. The light that it gives off is ok, but not very bright. And last, it eats batteries so quickly. It takes three batteries, and using it only once a day for four days left me with almost no power left. Not the best solution for travel.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror - light did not work from day one.  I had discarded all packaging so keeping it but will eventually need lights that work so this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its a cute versatile vanity mirror .&lt;br /&gt;It adjust to any height and distance i require, specially i need to be very close to it&lt;br /&gt;Only only down side, i wished it was 7/8 X i stead of 5X&lt;br /&gt;Its super stable and the light around adds a nice feature</li>
            <li> I had this mirror for a month and ended up having to return it because the handle kept popping off when I would turn on the light. I was in high hopes that it would be perfect but not worth the frustration. I ended up buying the suction cup one instead and I love it, just wish it were bigger.</li>
            <li> I received the mirror in a timely fashion.  Does not appear to be broken. I&#x27;m not positive if the LED lights work since I haven&#x27;t put batteries in it.  It is a decent size mirror though, and I like that it has a stand (in addition to being handheld). Should work well as a magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror is the perfect size for my small vanity.  The 5X magnification is great for applying makeup.  The battery-operated light is just bright enough - it&#x27;s great that there is no cord to deal with.  The tripod legs are extremely stable, and it is easy to turn the legs to the other side and hang the mirror with the magnified side facing out.  Since it can be switched without completely taking the legs off it is quick to convert from counter-top to hanging.  As noted by others, it can also be picked up and used as a hand mirror.  Extremely versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one concern:  the on-off switch at the bottom of the handle is a little temperamental - needing to be twisted back and forth until just the right spot is found for &#x27;on&#x27; and &#x27;off&#x27; but the mirror is so perfect otherwise I will hope it doesn&#x27;t become an issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my daughter, who loves doing her makeup.  She was complaining that she needed to reaarrange her room so she could do her makeup by the window for natural lighting benefits.  So we did.  AND THEN after she got this mirror with LED lighting for Christmas, she never even opens her blinds because this mirror is &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; for makeup.  Great find on amazon, very versatile product.  Not made out of cheap plastic, there is some quality here.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, easy to pack - get&#x27;s the job done.  Purchased this mirror to replace another &amp;#34;lighted travel mirror&amp;#34;.  Previous mirror works great but is much too large, bulky and heavy for frequent travel.  This one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Having the light all the way around makes a bit of a glare.  Could be better designed.  Overall does what it says.</li>
            <li> I have done a lot of research looking for a lighted mirror to use on my boyfriends house boat where I stay on weekends.  It is so dark in his mancave that I had a terrible time doing make up! I needed something powerful, yet compact due to space constraints on the boat.  This is the perfect mixture of both...I am so pleased with the quality of this mirror.  The light is very bright and the reflection is fantastic!!  It is nice and compact and I just stuck a push pin in the wall &amp; hang it up when I&#x27;m done.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  It will also be perfect for travel.  It will fit nicely in any size suitcase. This  has far exceeded my expectations!!</li>
            <li> I liked the design of the mirror + legs quite well, but the lights didn&#x27;t work from the very start. I tried two different sets of new batteries and never even got a flicker of light. Returned it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a terrible problem with irritants in my eye, and I needed a lighted mirror to remove them but wanted one that was fairly small and light. This is a bit larger and heavier than I wanted but is manageable and works great, and the light is plenty bright enough to see by. I wonder if the people who said it wasn&#x27;t bright enough are used to classic lighted makeup mirrors, which are certainly brighter than this is. The on/off knob is just a little quirky, when I turn it off I have to make sure it goes almost to the turn-on-again point. I also would not consider this the best choice for a travel mirror, being fairly large, glass, and lacking a protective case. But for something to keep handy which is also positionable as a stand mirror, I doubt you&#x27;ll find anything better for the price.</li>
            <li> For a non-electric mirror hand mirror, it&#x27;s OK.  But if you use the stand, it tends to want to tip over since the hanging hook gets in the way.  The batteries do no last very long at all and the light gets noticeably dimmer and dimmer with each use.  It has pretty good magnification.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and the light is just the right tone for doing makeup! I would definitely buy this mirror again.</li>
            <li> So far, I am loving it!  I love the portability and functionality of the product as well as the convince to be able to store it out of sight when I want to.  The product was received quickly and without any damage.  I am very satisfied with my order and the transaction that took place</li>
            <li> The package got here quickly and was packed securely. I was really happy when I opened the box because the battery-operated mirror was exactly what I was looking for. It is not too heavy, so it&#x27;s perfect for travel, and I love the fact that it can be handheld or used with the stand. I think the quality is on par with the price, and as long as it lasts me 4 months (the duration of my upcoming trip), I will be very happy!</li>
            <li> You have to use this in a very bright room.  So, I don&#x27;t get the point of the LED lights.  I used in a dimmish room and it was too dark even with the lights on to use the mirror.  I gave the mirror away to my Mom when she was visiting.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and tHe mirror is fine as well as the design, but the light is nowhere near the brightness I wanted.</li>
            <li> love the idea.... i hang it on the wall. the stand isnt so easily adjustable and also my counter height doesnt work for this size. too low, i have to lean over. so i hang on the wall, but its a little heavy and i worry it will fall.</li>
            <li> Batteries are not included other then that the mirror is pretty good it has 2 sides over all it was pretty good</li>
            <li> the lighting isn&#x27;t as good as i was hoping for, but i will keep it because its handy.</li>
            <li> I tried several sets of batteries and none of them work. It is also smaller than I expected. so far it is in the box and hasn&#x27;t been used! Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I use it in  hotel rooms with low lighting while traveling.  This mirror gives clear image and good lighting.  Easy to put in luggage and does not weigh a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror.  I needed a small mirror I could place in my closet.  While I have outlets in the closet, I didn&#x27;t want to be \\&quot;tied\\&quot; down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror is the perfect solution.  The lighting is perfect, and I can turn it off and on with a twist of the handle.  Batteries are easily changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to adjust the height.  Just squeeze the back two brackets and slide the handle up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was quick, it is well made and it was well packaged.  Easy to take it out of the package and getting it working.</li>
            <li> This is the best lighted mirror I have found. It is portable and easy to use anywhere. I love that it runs on batteries and actually provides good light, unlike other battery operated mirrors I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very nice to use. My husband loves it to shave and trim mustache.  Lighting is so much better than just bathroom lighting. Was delivered very quickly and sturdy packaging so no risk of broken mirror. Also good magnifying for plucking eybrows also.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a great hand held mirror for traveling as a makeup artist. It is wonderful for exactly what we need! The lighting is subtle but better then any other hand held out there.</li>
            <li> I have gone through two of these. The first worked for a month before the light stopped turning on.  The second one never lights up properly and, when it works, the twist to turn on feature is so touchy it sometimes turns off once set on the counter.  The second one is going back and I&#x27;ll look for something else.</li>
            <li> Great mirror! Quality product with great price!</li>
            <li> wish it were a little brighter, but still helps with morning makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, I love the fact I can pick it up and go sit down and not have to strain my eyes when doing my eyebrows or putting on eye shadow, it has just the right amount of magnification needed for me.  V.S.</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly &amp; was exactly what I expected.The size is perfect (large enough to see but small enough to fit in my drawer). I love using the lighted magnified side for eyebrows. I can get them all,</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a lighted mirror with less magnification than 10x or 15x.. After checking stores, I went online and found this lighted mirror. I purchased it immediately. I picked up 3 AAA batteries (thought I had some) and started using it. I&#x27;m extremely happy. I like the adjustable height, the angle and the light is sufficent. The magnification is excellent for putting on makeup.. Again, nothing came close to the nice magification for putting on makeup..</li>
            <li> Nice mirror and sturdy. The light is pretty dim though and I wish the mirror was a little bigger. I would be very happy with this mirror if it had cost $15, but for $30 it is just okay.</li>
            <li> Well, I returned this item because the light feature didn&#x27;t work. Didn&#x27;t even come on at all. But I can&#x27;t say I&lt;br /&gt;was disappointed at that, because I disliked the item anyway. There is no way to adjust the angle of&lt;br /&gt;the mirror, so you have to pick it up to use it, which negates the point of having it on a stand. Still&lt;br /&gt;looking for a good quality lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> Rotary twist on/off switch was intermittent in the beginning and after five uses has stopped working altogether.  Another made in China piece of crap.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This item was a Christmas gift for my mother- shipped to her.&lt;br /&gt;She lives in the middle of nowhere in the desert. The nearest town is 20 miles away and getting there is very costly for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased this item, I also purchased batteries to be shipped.&lt;br /&gt;The pkg arrived and she had it for Christmas with the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The item didn&#x27;t light up.&lt;br /&gt;She went to town and bought another set of batteries at her expense and the mirror still did not light up. She said it clicks when she turns it and the trap door doesn&#x27;t stay shut, the screw is stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used it as a regular mirror and was happy. I was not because I paid for a lighted mirror which cost more than a regular mirror. She needed light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted seller and within a reasonable amount of time they sent out a working replacement. Mom is even happier now with the light she didn&#x27;t know she needed. No problems. I was pleased with the service.</li>
            <li> Its ok to use if you set it on a counter but you can not easily set it in your lap to use.</li>
            <li> Thought the light would be a little more brighter. But looks and works fine.</li>
            <li> First mirror came broken but they were quick to send a replacement. The light is kinda tricky to turn on though, it seems to take quite a few tries and sometimes my wife just gives up. It&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s really nice otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was hoping for. The mirror is not bulky and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on my dresser. I like that the stand it detachable and you can take it off when it&#x27;s not needed or when I want to store it away. The light isn&#x27;t super bright as other reviewers mentioned, but it&#x27;s good enough for me and I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> We have a particularly deep vanity, so this thing has been life-altering -- no more leaning over the counter to squint into the mirror. Super easy and intuitive to set up -- works well at any angle. Terrific product.</li>
            <li> mirrors are fine but the lighted portion doesn&#x27;t work. Too mich hassle to send it back but this is annoying</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully and a nice size</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when the product arrived and I saw the box it came in.  But as the saying goes, you don&#x27;t judge a book by its cover.  This mirror is heavy and sturdy.  I just keep it on my dresser so it doesn&#x27;t get knocked over in the bathroom.  Stand could be a little wider/heavier but overall it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Researched many mirrors because I wanted particular features, and this one was within the budget and ticked off the boxes.  I like that I could hang it up, and the batteries (after about a year) are still lasting with regular use.  The stand was just a bit awkward but after a couple of minutes I got the hang of it and it did work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is the amount of magnification.  If you are looking for super-strong magnification, I don&#x27;t think this is for you.  I wanted just a slight magnification along with a light, and this was perfect for the low price.</li>
            <li> This mirror is GREAT and it looks very high end. I love that it can stand and the fact that it lights up is a plus! I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for in a makeup mirror. It is a little smaller than I was anticipating, but the size is still good for applying makeup. I like that the stand for the mirror is removable and can be used as a hanging mirror. All in all, this is perfect for what I needed as a makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> I love it but just wish the light was a little brighter</li>
            <li> Bright light, easy to turn off and on, stand adjusts to almost any angle.  And it ooks good on my counter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for travel and I am very pleased.  I wanted a lit mirror so that I could tweeze, as needed.  It&#x27;s compact and comes with bubble wrap over the mirror which I can use for packing, and the stand is easy and sturdy.  I also like the hook making it possible to hang from a wall.  The lighting is sufficient and so is the 5x magnification.</li>
            <li> Just got it and the switch won&#x27;t work. am sending it back and not reordering. seemed too cheap and very disappointed</li>
            <li> I usually trust Amazon reviews, but this mirror&#x27;s 4.5 star rating puzzles me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my wife as a gift and it is going back.  The mirror itself is fine, but the design is impractical for actual use.  Adjusting the mirror&#x27;s height/angle is a nuissance with how the stand is just a clamp and not a hinged design like other mirrors.  Going from magnified to unmagnified means you have to turn the clamp all the way around, which can take 30 seconds to a minute each time, which gets annoying really fast.  Plus if you don&#x27;t align the clamp in just the right way the mirror doesn&#x27;t sit correctly.  Even when you get it right, the stand is pretty unstable.  The light led ring around the mirror looked better than it actually worked.  Lastly, the on/off switch is on the bottom of the mirror&#x27;s handle, which is also weird since you have to physically pick it up to twist it to turn it on/off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a floxite mirror as a replacement for about $20 more and the design is so much better.</li>
            <li> The mirror sounded like a great idea, but it&#x27;s not. The face of it is way too small. The height is insufficient, and it is just generally a terrible design. I plan to return it as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> This makeup mirror is amazing. I honestly didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but it&#x27;s actually quite amazing and takes up little space. The mirror requires 3 AAA batteries (not included) which you install by unscrewing the bottom. That&#x27;s where you also turn the LED lights on (turning the knob left or right). One side is a normal mirror and the other (back) is zoomed (perfect for when you need to pluck your eyebrows!). The white perimeter shown on the picture is where the light comes from on both the front and back side. There&#x27;s more than adequate light for you to apply makeup or asses your skin&#x27;s condition. I also now think that the design is much nicer and modern than the other makeup mirrors available on Amazon (even my boyfriend likes how it looks in the bathroom). I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great little mirror does the job for me!  Easy to handle and store just the right amount of magnification for me!</li>
            <li> I like this mirror and it looks great in my bathroom.  It was very easy to assemble and I like that it&#x27;s adjustable.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because the light isn&#x27;t as bright as it could be and it flickers a little bit; however, it was still a good buy and it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> This mirror is small and light weight. In fact, it is easy to travel with and is battery operated so you can take it abroad and not worry about voltage issues. Over all, it is good for make-up application or shaving. There are others like it that plug in, so if you want a wire-free, clean counter- go for this one.</li>
            <li> Very nice and versitile mirror.  Plain packaging not I dicative of mirror.  Be careful when using stand...not as sturdy as using handle.</li>
            <li> Great for half blind people like me..</li>
            <li> This mirror works great and is very practical.  I used a 12 Ga solid insulatd wire and made a double ended hook and now I hang my mirror from the light fixture or the towl bar to hold the mirror at any height I please.  It hooks right into the bottom loop.  It puts out better light than my plug in make up mirror. You just twist the loop on the end of the handle to turn it on and off (out of the way and very user friendly).  The stand works well on the counter and is easly removed or adjusted.  I like a well engineered product and this is it.  Thank you to the manufacturers and the sellers.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the luminosity of the led light is very low; worse than putting makeup on in a hotel room. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The mirror looked good and was very nice when I opened it from the package, but when I installed the batteries it didn&#x27;t light up. So I thought maybe it was the batteries and they don&#x27;t work. So I bought new batteries and read the directions again to see if I missed anything and still it didn&#x27;t do anything. I was very disappointed with this and its such a shame because it looked like a very good mirror.</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;After the vendor read my review (see below) they wrote to me: &amp;#34;we&#x27;d be happy to offer you a full refund for your original purchase. In order to issue the refund, we do ask that you remove your review from Amazon.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mirror hoping the negative reviews about how dim the light is were wrong. Unfortunately, those reviews were correct. Even with brand new batteries the light is too dim for close critical work in a dark location. I returned the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept is a good. However, IMHO it needs stronger batteries, not AAA batteries,  or more than the three batteries the handle holds. I hope some other manufacturer gets it right because I really need a well lighted mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use it as supplemental lighting in an already bright location, then it should work for you. But if you want to rely on it as your primary light source, don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just not bright enough by itself.</li>
            <li> The item is clearly stated and no surprises. Very durable. LED is very bright. Somewhat heavy feeling to give it that expensive feel. Very satisfied with the overall product. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great! The magnification makes the images very clear and traveling much easier also. I will be ordering another in the near future!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she wanted a lighted mirror, I was pretty nervous because the ones I&#x27;ve seen in stores were pretty cheaply made. This mirror took 3 AAA batteries and lit right up. The hook at the bottom unscrews to insert the batteries and also twists to shut light on or off. Wife is really happy with it. Good magnification and lighting on this mirror.</li>
            <li> I previously had a bulkier, plug-in model mirror that stood on my bathroom sink counter. It took up a lot of room.  I bought this battery-powered one which works great, removed the stand and hung it on a decorative hook on the wall in the bathroom.  It is out of the way and attractive to look at, with its shiny chrome finish. Bathroom counter is clear of clutter and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!  So handy.  The stand is genius, slip it off quickly and easily to just hold.  It adjusts for your preferred angle.  The lights are exactly bright enough.  If it ever does stop working I will order the EXACT same one.</li>
            <li> Purchased this mirror for my wife as a Christmes gift. It has all of the features that I was looking for (mainly portability &amp; removable stand). It is very sturdy and excellent design. Lighting seems to be very good. Had a hard time finding a mirror of this type and was very pleased to see that you offered it. She is very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone looking for a well built, portable vanity mirror.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for travel as I found not all motels will provide a magnified make-up mirror which I absolutely have to have for these eyes.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for travel!  If you&#x27;re needing a magnified make-up mirror for travel or home this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good simple and portable. Built quality is good for price. Will buy more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Works very well and i love it.. Not sure I love looking at myself in 5X mirror but it is very helpful in putting on make</li>
            <li> My sister loves, loves, loves it! Perfect gift!</li>
            <li> Mirror too smal even for a child&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> Bought this for both of my daughters and myself for xmas to take when traveling. I got to test mine this weekend and it&#x27;s just perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> Two main gripes with this mirror:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.The design is not suitable for my makeup application needs: it&#x27;s too small and you cant rotate or angle the actual mirror so I ended up having to hold it in my hand ( which defeats the point of having a stand alone makeup mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The light stopped turning on after two weeks, even after changing the batteries.</li>
            <li> Fits micely in small space. Like the fact that it has a stand or can be hand-held as well.</li>
            <li> This is a very good mirror for traveling but it still doesnt magnify enough for me.  I wear glasses and need more magnification. It is still better than most other small mirrors I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for.  Perfect magnification and great lighting.  The way it turns on and off is not the most convenient, but it&#x27;s a small thing considering how well it meets my needs.</li>
            <li> This was a great choice for me  - nice size, easy to store, good magnification.  My only complaint would be that the LED ring might as well not be there.  It&#x27;s simply not bright enough to make much of a difference.  All in all, it does a good job for me, but don&#x27;t purchase if you need extra light for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fantastic. It was easy to assemble - took me only a few minutes. It looks great in the modern decor of my bathroom and is very practical. Shows both a great close-up view for applying make-up as well as a normal view to check out the back view. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The mirror was a bug disappointment the stand was difficukt to put on. The mirror broke after a week or so. The light was a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Cute but mirror not bright at all!</li>
            <li> arrived on time and is as described</li>
            <li> I take this everywhere. It&#x27;s very great for traveling and can easily be put together. I can&#x27;t ask for anything more, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 is because I wish it came with a traveling bag.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my girlfriend because she has to share her bathroom with a roommate. It makes it super easy for her to do her makeup anywhere in the house! She loves it and I earned major points</li>
            <li> Great travel lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> Not as lighted as I expected.</li>
            <li> It is too small...Not good for doing your own makeup</li>
            <li> Great little mirror for the bathroom. The stand works perfectly for me, though I can see it slipping down a bit.</li>
            <li> This mirror is awesome!  The light is not super bright but definitely provides enough light so I can put on makeup and really see what I need to see.  Portability means I can take it with me when I travel and I have the same make up mirror on vacation and at home, and seriously when does that happen?  Super easy to use/adjust the stand.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. It is even better than I hoped. I originally bought it to keep in the rv, which never has a good mirror, but it ends up staying in the house! It is just the right size and the adjustable stand is awesome.</li>
            <li> The mirror was heavier than I was expecting, and sturdier than some other vanity mirrors I&#x27;ve had in the past.  I like that the legs are adjustable so that you can change it to whatever angle you want.  Overall very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I just bought this mirror about 1-2 week/s ago and I liked it, so I decided to do my first video review! Once I received the mirror, I was pleasantly surprised by all the features. It is a vanity mirror, hand mirror, and it can also hang on the wall with it&#x27;s hook feature. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use the hook feature, but it is good to know that it&#x27;s there just in case. What&#x27;s great about this mirror is that you can adjust the stand to whatever height you would like. I also really like the fact that you can take it out of the stand and it can become a hand mirror. I always find myself looking for a mirror that I can use to look at the back of my hair and this is great because I will never need to search for one again! I would highly suggest this mirror to anyone looking for a bathroom/vanity mirror to do their makeup/tweeze.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror as a gift for my girlfriend. She loves it. Its sleek design and portability allows here to use it anywhere and allows her to hide it once she is done. The LED lights also are great for areas that may not have the best lighting.</li>
            <li> This is a great, light weight handheld mirror. I purchased this for use at home, mostly magnifying for makeup, handheld for back-of-the-hair checks and for occasional travel.  I was a bit skeptical of the stand in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually quiet sturdy and can be removed - I keep the stand on, it doesn&#x27;t get in the way when I use it as a handheld and when I set it down the mirror is upright and stays cleaner. The stand design does make the mirror is very adjustable on a counter top (also a benefit for travel if you need to adjust depending on hotel vanity or desk). The LED light is definitely a benefit for under-lit rooms (hotels!). Even though the whole piece is light weight, it still feels sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnifying power is fairly standard (haven&#x27;t used many) and it&#x27;s exceptionally clear.  I recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to carry on a trip and I am very disappointed because the light much too dim for makeup application. It&#x27;s better than just a plain mirror, but I&#x27;m used to one of those makeup mirrors with the flourescent lights on either side and settings for day, evening, etc. This one doesn&#x27;t come close to providing adequate light, especially trying to use it in a bathroom with a dim light fixture. I would return it, but I think I&#x27;ve waited too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this mirror isn&#x27;t bright enough for me, in fairness here are the good points:&lt;br /&gt;-Light and easy to pack especially if you save the box&lt;br /&gt;-works fine. Little tripod legs keep it stable.&lt;br /&gt;-nice magnification. the 1x and 5x is just right for makeup application. 10x would be way too much magnification.</li>
            <li> I thought the light would be brighter....not at all. I dont even bother turning the light on anymore, really makes no difference on or off... good to use if u have no access to another mirror but definitely need room lighting on.</li>
            <li> i love this mirror but I think the stand system is too shaky.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to knock over.&lt;br /&gt;The two sides to the mirror is great and clear.&lt;br /&gt;The lighting is excellent.</li>
            <li> Light not strong at all and dies out real fast.  The mirror is way too small.</li>
            <li> Perfect it you want a handheld mirror.  Have had no issues with the batteries as of yet.  Looks pretty sitting on the countertop.  Will be nice for traveling and being able to apply your makeup in those dimly lit hotel bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Well made, works well.</li>
            <li> Love it...no need to fight over mirror when you have you own.  Take it with you whrn traveling or just place on your vanity table. Fairly reasonable price</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she absolutely loved it. It feels heavy-duty. The great thing about this is the light. Our bathroom is not very bright so this certainly makes it easier for her to put on make-up. It is good for everyday use. The design is slick and tripod definitely makes it very helpful.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the light seems to be touchy.  You have to set it down a certain way to get the light to say on.</li>
            <li> I have had the mirror for about 2 months, I&#x27;m really pleased with this product, it is perfect for old eyes, I can take it anywhere and it can store easily! I  have been telling my friends about it,</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about a week ago and I do love it .... The only issue is that the off and on switch is at the bottom of the mirror ... I actually have my mirror in a big glass jar so it won&#x27;t fall over with my make up brushes ... It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and the led light is BRIGHT !!! OVER ALL I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because I needed a lighted, magnification mirror that I could put flat on the counter to put in specialized contact lenses.  For that purpose, it works (although I wish the handle was shorter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also be taking this mirror along with me when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a daily use lighted magnification mirror, you may not be completely satisfied with this product.  Using it that way, I wish it was bigger so I could get a view of my whole face.  The switch (which is at the bottom of the handle) is a bit sensitive and needs to be in the right spot to stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is satisfactory for the purpose I need it for, but in the future I&#x27;ll probably buy something else.</li>
