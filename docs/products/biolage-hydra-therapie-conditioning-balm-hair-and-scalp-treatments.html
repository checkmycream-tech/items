            <li>That shampoo and conditioner I used in your shower were so good</li>
            <li>Have always loved this product.</li>
            <li>nothing works as good and I have tried almost everything- including this purple labeled stuff that came in the mail.  </li>
            <li>If you have damaged hair or just need a good conditioner than give this a try.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I thought that this would be good for my hair</li>
            <li>Had gotten this product from my hairdresser and loved it.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a good price.  </li>
            <li>using it and its good so far&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I lived in a house with softened water, I loved this and the Biolage shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>the original conditioning balm is the best stuff ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the best products at a great price;-) and Amazon.com</li>
            <li>This is a great product: does what it says it will, smells good and my dies hair looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this conditioner for many years!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it is great.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is great and the price here is better than the salon&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Use the right amount and your damaged, colored hair will look and feel great!</li>
            <li>Love, love this!!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Okay everyone bye bye!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>This conditioning balm is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Love the texture!</li>
            <li>My hair looks like I just got out of the salon, I love this product!</li>
            <li>so I was able to use one tub of it for 6 months!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 20 years and still love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>When my hair was relaxed this did a great job conditioning and my hair never broke off and was always strong.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks amazing</li>
            <li>amazing..</li>
            <li>Amazing, miracle-working on my dry-ish hair.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product was amazing at fixing my hair.</li>
            <li>If you dont do this you won&#x27;t see that much of a miracle because the silicones will prevent the wonderful botanical extracts from fully penetrating the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>Your hair will transform to the best version it could be, and it will style much easier, too.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s now hooked also, and just ordered her own stash of Biolage from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>This is still the best Conditioning Balm out there and reasonably price.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really really nice as well.</li>
            <li>nice conditioner, works well for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of indifferent.</li>
            <li>and when I rinsed my hair wasn&#x27;t as detangled as I would have liked, probably because there are no silicones in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried plenty and nothing has given me these kind of results.  </li>
            <li>But I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Silicones make your hair feel nice, but repel moisture.</li>
            <li>THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR THE HAIR, AND IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR STRENGHENING</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>It moisturized my hair very well, which is very good because I am &amp;#34;stretching&amp;#34; my relaxer.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Honestly, there&#x27;s a part of me that wishes I hadn&#x27;t because I just love it</li>
            <li>This is by far the best conditioner my hair has ever seen!</li>
            <li>This product takes many many months before you notice any kind of buildup.  </li>
            <li>Price is Cheaper and good quality, good packing and fast for shipping.</li>
            <li>Healthy shiny hair goes a very long way in making a person look beautiful and attractive.  </li>
            <li>and I was in love.</li>
            <li>love I can get this produce w/o the salon price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad.</li>
            <li>you look at how shiney and healthy her hair is!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Nothing comes even close to the magic of Biolage.  </li>
            <li>Now THATS a magic conditioner if it can bring out latent waves in</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love price on mass quantity.</li>

            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Got this product and for some reason it had water all in the container on top of my conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using this conditioner for many many years now.  </li>
            <li>I am always satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Biolage is my favorite hair care product.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner for many reasons.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for more then that from a haircare</li>
            <li>Biologe by Matrix Conditioning Balm is the best Biolage product since they stopped making Simply Silk.  </li>
            <li>I gave her a bottle of my Aussie Moist and it worked much better.</li>
            <li>and you get more for your money.&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>My favorite leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite conditioner for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I love this product because my hair drys out in the summer sun and this product helps to keep moisture and shine to my hair</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>So-so value (I need more than the package directs),</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>stuff is incredible, leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years now.</li>
            <li>but I used to love it now</li>
            <li>It made my hair look SO much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll start using more and see if that improves its performance.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to friends, I am so pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I simply love it.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on the quality of my hair.</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite conditioner</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t ask for anything better, and I&#x27;m done searching.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant clean smell and gives my hair a smooth and silky feel.</li>
            <li>I love love this balm.</li>
            <li>I ended up using more inexpensive conditioners and while they worked okay, none ever compared to the Biolage.  </li>
            <li>It has also helped us have better control over the amount we use.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Would not buy again as it didn&#x27;t do anything more for my hair than a supermarket brand.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I get to the hair dresser for my bi-annual trim, he always rave sbaout how healthy I&#x27;ve kept my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I used this product, working mostly on my roots for 30 mins without heat.</li>
            <li>It smells ok.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not too many conditioners out there that can do for my hair what this one does.  </li>
            <li>Love this product for curly hair.</li>
            <li>(I stopped curling my hair, for example) because you find that miraculously your natural hair tendencies, when given the right kind of care, are beautiful in their own right.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent for dry hair, and a better curly hair conditioner than the line they make specifically FOR curly hair.</li>
            <li>It has a very smooth texture and easily detangles my curls in the shower.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>They sell this at walmart, walgreens, and plenty of familiar places!</li>
            <li>If yo have dry hair, this works great!  </li>
            <li>Best conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li>This Biolage conditioner is really good for fine and dry hair, I&#x27;m really happy with the results, I try to use two or three times per week.</li>
            <li>this is the best for fine hair, I have alot of fine hair, but when I use this I actually get told be people</li>
            <li>Its the same incredible versatile conditioner its always been, thank god.  </li>
            <li>healthy hair is soooo important...</li>
            <li>I LOVE MATRIX BALM also available in a tube in some salons.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I recommended it to my mother.</li>
            <li>These work really well and smell really good too.</li>
            <li>well that&#x27;s when I really started appreciating how good of a job this balm had been doing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is curly girl friendly also, which is great for moisture loving locks and those who avoid daily shampoos as your hair will not become lifeless &amp; greasy.</li>
            <li>awesome hair conditioning balm, gives extreme moisture and softness with no greasy after feel</li>
            <li>My hair is in incredible condition, very healthy, with an almost unbelievable shine factor.  </li>
            <li>this is the best product you can buy, It really works wonders my hair is soft and silky</li>
            <li>My hair was suprisingly easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>Rinses out easily when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>This will make it easy for me to stretch my relaxer touch-ups.</li>
            <li>Its only because of this duo that my hair is beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, makes hair super soft, and lasts forever, too!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for use a few times a week, you need a good clarifying shampoo to make sure the buildup doesn&#x27;t eventually flatten and dull your hair, but if not over used, it is excellent!</li>
            <li>The scent is fine for both men and women.  </li>
            <li>My hair is now so much healthier.i also love the smell!</li>
            <li>IS HUGE</li>
            <li>And my freezy ends, fabulous.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m cheap).   </li>
            <li>Also important to know that this conditioner and the shampoo are CONE free and always have been.</li>
            <li>I still, 20 years later, almost cannot believe how great these products are.  </li>
            <li>, Ive tried organic, Ive tried sulfate free, etc.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair free flowing and luscious and brings out a bonafide wave</li>
            <li>This is a great, basic hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Nice because you don&#x27;t need to use much to see results.</li>
            <li>Give the spray about 2-3months to really show amazing results</li>
            <li>Give the spray about 2-3months to really show amazing results</li>
            <li>either had to find a product to smooth them out of</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth, shiny and repairs my damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling light, shiny, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Always makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 8 months now, and when switching to another conditioner recently that&#x27;s supposed to be great on split ends;</li>
            <li>It makes hair smooth and and feel thicker.</li>
            <li>balm&#x27;s lid used to have a built-in pump, which was great, and also had the same fragrance as the shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is so silky smooth now.</li>
            <li>It looked shiny, soft, wavier and simply gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>IT IS GOOD FOR HOME OR PROFESSIONAL USE</li>
            <li>Has a good scent and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It does have a very pleasant odor, and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>It is simple a really perfect conditioner that is not too much to use every day, no matter how rich it looks.</li>
            <li>I asked her straight up, \\&quot;Hey!!!</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair and this product is great.  </li>
            <li>The scent fades quickly after showering and isn&#x27;t strong.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Every friend ive persuaded to try the original two Biolage conditioning balm and moisturizing shampoo</li>
            <li>Exactly what I used to buy for more in the salon.  </li>
            <li>This product in my experience on my hair is an inferior formula to the original-</li>
            <li>I sound like an ad, but its true.    </li>
            <li>Great for long hair.</li>
            <li>I have very, very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Its always a good idea to have another cone free shampoo and conditioner different than biolage to give your hair a break be it once a week or once every 4 months.</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>You get your hair clean, but don&#x27;t strip it of all the oils.    </li>
            <li>If youre going to start using these products please make sure to, prior to your first use of Biolage, apply a good clarifying shampoo to take off all the buildup of protein and silicones.</li>
            <li>It works great as a deep conditioner and by using less, it works great as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Believe me it is true.  </li>
            <li>Please go by this and dont even look at the price if it bothers you, its too worth it not to get I had to try 100 cheap products before this</li>
            <li>Love it so much.  </li>
            <li>Good but not up to ITS A TEN.</li>
            <li>Like all conditioners, you must WAIT before rinsing for the full effect of the product.</li>
            <li>Most do not work well for my very resistabt hair--this one never dissapoints.</li>
            <li>but I think its worth the cost for someone who can&#x27;t find a cheap conditioner that works.</li>
            <li>When I first used this stuff 20 years ago, I was in awe of the scent; it was my first experience with a high-end hair product, and I loved it (after using Suave and VO5 my whole life, this was a revelation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I purchased this, as I have used it in years past with great results.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff super fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>, I have seborrheic dermatitis in my scalp which is a mild form of psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>Does the job, but make sure you only put it on your ends and not your roots (unless you are going for that sexy, greaser look).</li>
            <li>Works well and gets rid of tangles quickly...</li>
            <li>my wife loves this stuff and it arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Color treated hair and this just was exactly what my hair wanted!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel quite as soft as with some cheaper conditioners and shampoos, but it just looked so much healthier and it styled more easily and was just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, you will stop using other add on products after a while because you realize that anything you put on your hair actually only diminishes the beautiful effects and the healthy hair these products foster.</li>
            <li>No other products keep my full wavy hair well hydrated and healthy quite like the biolage line.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>These products are like golden handcuffs in that way.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I reccomend this to anyone, it&#x27;s not TOO pricy and is SOOOO  worth it.</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS PRETTY GOOD and will work wonders for you in the long run by making your hair stronger!</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS PRETTY GOOD and will work wonders for you in the long run by making your hair stronger!</li>
            <li>I go through it pretty quickly as I have yet to find another conditioner that works as well as this conditioning balm.</li>
            <li>I go to comments on how beautiful and healthy my hair is, without fail.  </li>
            <li>Its something people really do notice, because truly healthy hair is not a common thing to see...</li>
            <li>Ever since I moved to a very dry climate (Nevada) I had been battling breakage and extremely dry hair until I started using this awesome stuff!  </li>
            <li>and my hair stays strong, style lasts, and it is soft and growing!  </li>
            <li>I have tons of huge dry bushy hair on my head and this conditioner makes it sleek and silky smooth!</li>
            <li>It made my new growth soo smooth, to the point where I dont notice the regrowth.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft, elastic and strong ...</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products and have not had much success.</li>
            <li>Like the fragrance and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Buying the larger jar available on Amazon presents a significant savings over buying the consumer tubes at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>You may even stop using the hot irons or the curling irons</li>
            <li>She grinned and admitted that she did in fact use it that day for the first time.  </li>
            <li>But to address the price factor I would recommend not buying this product online because unless you pay the same price or more then you would find in a store</li>
            <li>you really cant guarantee the quality of hair products you will buy on the net (even though my praticular order was great I will be buying this again from a local store.</li>
            <li>but it sounds promising!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, shiny, and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Since I starting using the matrix conditioning balm products, my hairdresser of 8 years told me that my hair has never been in better condition.</li>
            <li>but it works better if left on for a minimum of 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have 3c/4a curly hair that is coarse and this stuff makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more when needed.</li>
            <li>It leaves my processed hair smooth, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use it my hair feels quite soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>I saw result the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Makes my long straight dark brown hair very beautiful and shiny.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for thick course hair.  </li>
            <li>When I leave it in for more than 5 minutes it acts like a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely cannot be beat!</li>
            <li>Just ok for a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be dry no matter what shampoo I use and this product not only smells great but puts the moisture back into my hair to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>Some of the other conditioners I tried worked well on my hair, but were kind of greasy and made my skin break out.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner and its other half, Biolage Hydrating Shampoo are the very best ive ever used in all my years</li>
            <li>I have pretty healthy hair, not too oily although it can be a bit dry sometimes.</li>
            <li>For my break products I use anything I like without cones (I need my new product fix, anyway), but two I HIGHLY recommend are Mastey Traite Shampoo (cone free) and Inecto Pure Coconut Oil Conditioner (also cone free).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>By far the best product for dry hair I have tried alot of products on the market and this is the only one that gets the knots out and leaves my hair soft anf still curly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I always use but for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li>goes even more a long way!</li>
            <li>I advise anyone who is looking into buying Biolage to avoid the ULTRA version (its really easy to get them mixed up, so buyer beware)</li>
            <li>Been using this hair balm for almost a month now, it helps my super dry hair be more soft and moisture.</li>
            <li>and my hair always gets to a certain point</li>
            <li>So rare, and so effective, you really can&#x27;t go back to anything else for very long.  </li>
            <li>scent was always beautiful to me... sort of flowery,with a rich creamy undertone, medium longevity (not too strong, not too soft), but to be honest, after smelling the same scent for 20 years ive become really bored with it and wish they would make different scented version of the same formulation.  </li>
            <li>I use this on a weekly basis, although it is a little costly it does a nice job conditioning.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too heavy on my fine hair, it just helps it to feel fabulous and luxurious.</li>
            <li>Despite the shipping being a little more than usual, this was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>i expected more from this conditioner</li>
            <li>otherwise straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li>ULTRA is a newer formulation  and very sub-par.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I realized you really do get what you pay for NOT TO MENTION this 16.9oz</li>
            <li>well I hope this review helped anyone who really cares about there hair like I do, take my word on it because I&#x27;ve REALLY tried it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well I hope this review helped anyone who really cares about there hair like I do, take my word on it because I&#x27;ve REALLY tried it all.     </li>
            <li>I really feel like I stepped out of the salon with this product.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy, unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li>and this stuff works really well on it.</li>
            <li>In terms of hydration I didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Really dislike the smell of the conditioning balm.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a regular conditioner to keep my hair hassle free during the week.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>This 16.9 oz jar(?) lasts a while and the conditioner is really creamy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Today, however, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much though....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li>I like so much about this conditioner:  1.</li>
            <li>styling is much easier.  </li>
            <li>Ulta, etc) conditioner, there isn&#x27;t much to write home about.</li>
            <li>Especially the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and like to straighten it.</li>
            <li>This is one reason why your hair becomes so incredibly soft and healthy when you use this duo regularly.</li>
            <li>Soft and silky!!!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this as it got positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The town I live in now also uses a higher level of chlorine in the water supply</li>
            <li>It was also one of those products i heard raves about but didn&#x27;t like the price on, this comes in a big bottle though and is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>It was also one of those products i heard raves about but didn&#x27;t like the price on, this comes in a big bottle though and is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>As a result my hair broke off significantly and wouldn&#x27;t stop shedding AT ALL until my beautician started to deep condition my hair every week with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I just use and rinse out as any other conditioner, byt sometimes between washings a leave a dab in to brighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of very fine, tangly hair and this seems to be the only conditioner out there that actually works at taming it and helping me to comb through it all much easier.</li>
            <li>years later, I&#x27;m older and wiser (27) and am at my more natural dark blonde color and my hair is much healthier, but I still love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and it really helped my hair out quite a bit before i bought the biolage matrix conditioning balm I will highly recommend buying them together (you can at walmart)</li>
            <li>and it really helped my hair out quite a bit before i bought the biolage matrix conditioning balm I will highly recommend buying them together (you can at walmart)</li>
            <li>I think that if blow dryers,straighteners, and curling irons were avoided, these companies would lose a lot of business on products that often don&#x27;t do much and are highly over rated.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hair is as soft as silk and very very very beutiful....</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;relaxing\\&quot; effects of this product were very unexpected, and might be undesirable for people who enjoy big hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, one would think that dry brittle hair was not a problem.</li>
            <li>I love to touch it as does my boyfriend, and it doesnt weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li>I think it makes my hair look a bit more wirey and it kind of feels dirty or greasy or something.</li>
            <li>Smell is decent.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and smooth, instantly!</li>
            <li>It is great for hair that is usually frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li>I used this in high school and bought some after moving to a humid climate again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I found that the conditioner was more lightweight and made my hair a little softer.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, color-treated hair and this stuff made it feel silky soft.</li>
            <li>have been using it for a few years and have found no other that is as good at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that this conditioner doesn&#x27;t provide much slip it did seems to make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed, my hair was very tangled and my hair did not feel soft at all.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find the green one anymore.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal state.  </li>
            <li>I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have the normal effect</li>
            <li>This stuff is pricey, but definitely worth the extra pennies.</li>
            <li>Great conditioning for long thick hair</li>
            <li>After turning 50 and having, um more than several hair coloring treatments, my hair was very dry.</li>
            <li>Well I originally tried it on wet hair and just let it sit on my hair.</li>
            <li>conditioner rejuvenates my hair--I leave it on for 1/2 hour, rinse out, and it feels like I have a new head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Need to order new.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and is not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li>If you have long curly hair, you&#x27;ll need a more liberal amount (even so this stuff lasts us a long time).  </li>
            <li>it was very soft to touch.</li>
            <li>They will make the slip more noticeable immediately after washing and conditioning, but they will, inshort order, coat your hair in something akin to plastic, and actually damage your hair over time due to severely drying it out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried all kinds of hair treatments like hot oils, hair cholesterol and deep conditioners.</li>
            <li>But that could be because its pretty coarse.     </li>
            <li>this product makes my hair extremely soft!</li>
            <li>I used to use hot oil, but have found the quality of the hot oil on the market to have gone down over the years.  </li>
            <li>(especially since its hard to find cone free conditioners, and because people arent educated about cones so most of the population wanders around with subpar, dry brittle hair).  </li>
            <li>After washing my hair and applying this balm (I left it in overnight), I rinsed it out and it left my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I do have extremely fine hair though and the balm doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>even if she only uses it every two weeks as I do, her hair is *still* softer, more manageable, and a little straighter during the weeks</li>
            <li>But it is just average, nothing special.</li>
            <li>judging by  the dirt on the edges of the clear label on this tub</li>
            <li>She has very curly, coarse hair with quite a bit of gray.</li>
            <li>it was shiny and felt soft.</li>
            <li>It is not a heavy waxen type conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and alot of products</li>
            <li>Now if I pull or tug at my hair it doesn&#x27;t have any breakage and it stays soft and</li>
            <li>After washing and deep conditioning once a week with Biolage for a month straight</li>
            <li>your suppose to leave it on for at least 20 minutes, I never do... but love the feel of it on my hair....</li>
            <li>No silicone ingredients and yet completely detangles curly hair.</li>
            <li>My 25 year old daughter was complaining that her hair was getting dryer</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so manageable and shining, and soft.</li>
            <li>leaving her hair soft with natural glow.  </li>
            <li>My fiancee&#x27;s mother commented that my hair was \\&quot;soft as a baby&#x27;s\\&quot; after using this balm.</li>
            <li>Smells flowery - could bother sensitive noses.</li>
            <li>I would not say it has recovered \\&quot;its natural shine, silkiness and softness\\&quot; as the product description promises.</li>
            <li>Been using for nearly 20 yrs.  </li>
            <li>I started washing my hair with this conditioner again and after one wash it was soft again.</li>
            <li>It conditions my hair and leaves it feeling soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>and i tend to go for conditioners which are more on the thick side.</li>
            <li>apparently they almost look identical to this regular conditioning balm so before you buy anything be careful to read it and make sure you know which one your actually getting.</li>
            <li>apparently they almost look identical to this regular conditioning balm so before you buy anything be careful to read it and make sure you know which one your actually getting.</li>
            <li>I would pay almost anything for the green leaf labeled original conditioning conditioning balm --the one pictured by the seller--</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine, but probably not better than the competition.</li>
            <li>&quot; then just doing my normal shower routine and only shampooing my roots</li>
            <li>This conditioner along with the shampoo make my fine, thin hair feel and look so much fuller&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Okay everyone bye bye!se it the way i do on wet hair a little</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is very curly and often gets dry</li>
            <li>I have very course dry hair</li>
            <li>( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)</li>
            <li>Hydrasource is good- a step up from drugstore stuff -- but not great, the very next day my hair is dry again.</li>
            <li>When I stopped deep conditioning and stopped using this while my hair was natural</li>
            <li>I use this daily, even when I don&#x27;t shampoo, as a leave in and it keeps my hair really soft and looking shiney.</li>
            <li>Nope, the same thing happened, my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft and it was once again, tangled.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite hair secret.</li>
            <li>Voila smooth , shiny and manageable hair which is a blessing for someone who has thick frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>No longer creamy and thick, I&#x27;d now compare it to cheap grocery store products.</li>
            <li>It leaves my thick, rebellious, curly hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a cheap product, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I have thick long hair that&#x27;s also damaged and this is my all time favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>It works for straight fine dry hair and even very curly dry hair (think pencil thin curls).  </li>
            <li>Great for tight spirals of thick hair or my daughters thick straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and straight... delicate, and could easily turn into mousy unremarkable hair (and does every time I try using another product for more than a few days).  </li>
            <li>smooth and very little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman with natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, full, long and very soft.</li>
            <li>build-up with Biolage is far and away less than any other product ive ever used, but after a long while your hair will begin to crave a break from even this just for a day.&lt;br /&gt;Another important note:  </li>
            <li>THIS IS BIG ENOUGH TO LAST AWHILE, especially if you use it the way i do on wet hair a little goes even more a long way!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still soft and I can keep it long!</li>
            <li>I have waste length thin long hair that is fair-</li>
            <li>When I use this conditioner my hair looks much smoother, softer and is less likely to frizz.</li>
            <li>And, yes, I am slowly but surely getting rid of the damaged hair in a less traumatic way.)   </li>
            <li>Product is a little heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly, coarse, dry hair ( have it colored on a regular basis)  </li>
            <li>The whites and rogue fine patches, which conditioners often leave fluffy and shapeless, now curl like the rest of my hair.   </li>
            <li>It takes a little extra work, but makes handling and dispensing so much easier.</li>

            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> That shampoo and conditioner I used in your shower were so good</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product.</li>
            <li> nothing works as good and I have tried almost everything- including this purple labeled stuff that came in the mail.  </li>
            <li> If you have damaged hair or just need a good conditioner than give this a try.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought that this would be good for my hair</li>
            <li> Had gotten this product from my hairdresser and loved it.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a good price.  </li>
            <li> using it and its good so far&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I lived in a house with softened water, I loved this and the Biolage shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> the original conditioning balm is the best stuff ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best products at a great price;-) and Amazon.com</li>
            <li> This is a great product: does what it says it will, smells good and my dies hair looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this conditioner for many years!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is great.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great and the price here is better than the salon&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Use the right amount and your damaged, colored hair will look and feel great!</li>
            <li> Love, love this!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Okay everyone bye bye!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li> This conditioning balm is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Love the texture!</li>
            <li> My hair looks like I just got out of the salon, I love this product!</li>
            <li> so I was able to use one tub of it for 6 months!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years and still love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> When my hair was relaxed this did a great job conditioning and my hair never broke off and was always strong.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks amazing</li>
            <li> amazing..</li>
            <li> Amazing, miracle-working on my dry-ish hair.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product was amazing at fixing my hair.</li>
            <li> If you dont do this you won&#x27;t see that much of a miracle because the silicones will prevent the wonderful botanical extracts from fully penetrating the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> Your hair will transform to the best version it could be, and it will style much easier, too.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s now hooked also, and just ordered her own stash of Biolage from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> This is still the best Conditioning Balm out there and reasonably price.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really really nice as well.</li>
            <li> nice conditioner, works well for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of indifferent.</li>
            <li> and when I rinsed my hair wasn&#x27;t as detangled as I would have liked, probably because there are no silicones in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty and nothing has given me these kind of results.  </li>
            <li> But I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Silicones make your hair feel nice, but repel moisture.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR THE HAIR, AND IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR STRENGHENING</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> It moisturized my hair very well, which is very good because I am &amp;#34;stretching&amp;#34; my relaxer.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Honestly, there&#x27;s a part of me that wishes I hadn&#x27;t because I just love it</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner my hair has ever seen!</li>
            <li> This product takes many many months before you notice any kind of buildup.  </li>
            <li> Price is Cheaper and good quality, good packing and fast for shipping.</li>
            <li> Healthy shiny hair goes a very long way in making a person look beautiful and attractive.  </li>
            <li> and I was in love.</li>
            <li> love I can get this produce w/o the salon price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad.</li>
            <li> you look at how shiney and healthy her hair is!\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Nothing comes even close to the magic of Biolage.  </li>
            <li> Now THATS a magic conditioner if it can bring out latent waves in</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Love price on mass quantity.</li>
            <li> OKAY</li>
            <li> OKAY</li>
            <li> I use this and will never find anything better.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Got this product and for some reason it had water all in the container on top of my conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for many many years now.  </li>
            <li> I am always satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Biolage is my favorite hair care product.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for many reasons.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ask for more then that from a haircare</li>
            <li> Biologe by Matrix Conditioning Balm is the best Biolage product since they stopped making Simply Silk.  </li>
            <li> I gave her a bottle of my Aussie Moist and it worked much better.</li>
            <li> and you get more for your money.&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite conditioner for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I love this product because my hair drys out in the summer sun and this product helps to keep moisture and shine to my hair</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> So-so value (I need more than the package directs),</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> stuff is incredible, leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years now.</li>
            <li> but I used to love it now</li>
            <li> It made my hair look SO much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll start using more and see if that improves its performance.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to friends, I am so pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I simply love it.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments on the quality of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite conditioner</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t ask for anything better, and I&#x27;m done searching.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant clean smell and gives my hair a smooth and silky feel.</li>
            <li> I love love this balm.</li>
            <li> I ended up using more inexpensive conditioners and while they worked okay, none ever compared to the Biolage.  </li>
            <li> It has also helped us have better control over the amount we use.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again as it didn&#x27;t do anything more for my hair than a supermarket brand.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I get to the hair dresser for my bi-annual trim, he always rave sbaout how healthy I&#x27;ve kept my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I used this product, working mostly on my roots for 30 mins without heat.</li>
            <li> It smells ok.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not too many conditioners out there that can do for my hair what this one does.  </li>
            <li> Love this product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> (I stopped curling my hair, for example) because you find that miraculously your natural hair tendencies, when given the right kind of care, are beautiful in their own right.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for dry hair, and a better curly hair conditioner than the line they make specifically FOR curly hair.</li>
            <li> It has a very smooth texture and easily detangles my curls in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> They sell this at walmart, walgreens, and plenty of familiar places!</li>
            <li> If yo have dry hair, this works great!  </li>
            <li> Best conditioner for dry hair</li>
            <li> This Biolage conditioner is really good for fine and dry hair, I&#x27;m really happy with the results, I try to use two or three times per week.</li>
            <li> this is the best for fine hair, I have alot of fine hair, but when I use this I actually get told be people</li>
            <li> Its the same incredible versatile conditioner its always been, thank god.  </li>
            <li> healthy hair is soooo important...</li>
            <li> I LOVE MATRIX BALM also available in a tube in some salons.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I recommended it to my mother.</li>
            <li> These work really well and smell really good too.</li>
            <li> well that&#x27;s when I really started appreciating how good of a job this balm had been doing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is curly girl friendly also, which is great for moisture loving locks and those who avoid daily shampoos as your hair will not become lifeless &amp; greasy.</li>
            <li> awesome hair conditioning balm, gives extreme moisture and softness with no greasy after feel</li>
            <li> My hair is in incredible condition, very healthy, with an almost unbelievable shine factor.  </li>
            <li> this is the best product you can buy, It really works wonders my hair is soft and silky</li>
            <li> My hair was suprisingly easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> Rinses out easily when it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> This will make it easy for me to stretch my relaxer touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Its only because of this duo that my hair is beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, makes hair super soft, and lasts forever, too!  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for use a few times a week, you need a good clarifying shampoo to make sure the buildup doesn&#x27;t eventually flatten and dull your hair, but if not over used, it is excellent!</li>
            <li> The scent is fine for both men and women.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now so much healthier.i also love the smell!</li>
            <li> IS HUGE</li>
            <li> And my freezy ends, fabulous.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m cheap).   </li>
            <li> Also important to know that this conditioner and the shampoo are CONE free and always have been.</li>
            <li> I still, 20 years later, almost cannot believe how great these products are.  </li>
            <li> , Ive tried organic, Ive tried sulfate free, etc.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair free flowing and luscious and brings out a bonafide wave</li>
            <li> This is a great, basic hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Nice because you don&#x27;t need to use much to see results.</li>
            <li> Give the spray about 2-3months to really show amazing results</li>
            <li> Give the spray about 2-3months to really show amazing results</li>
            <li> either had to find a product to smooth them out of</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth, shiny and repairs my damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling light, shiny, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Always makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 8 months now, and when switching to another conditioner recently that&#x27;s supposed to be great on split ends;</li>
            <li> It makes hair smooth and and feel thicker.</li>
            <li> balm&#x27;s lid used to have a built-in pump, which was great, and also had the same fragrance as the shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is so silky smooth now.</li>
            <li> It looked shiny, soft, wavier and simply gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> IT IS GOOD FOR HOME OR PROFESSIONAL USE</li>
            <li> Has a good scent and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It does have a very pleasant odor, and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> It is simple a really perfect conditioner that is not too much to use every day, no matter how rich it looks.</li>
            <li> I asked her straight up, \\&quot;Hey!!!</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and this product is great.  </li>
            <li> The scent fades quickly after showering and isn&#x27;t strong.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Every friend ive persuaded to try the original two Biolage conditioning balm and moisturizing shampoo</li>
            <li> Exactly what I used to buy for more in the salon.  </li>
            <li> This product in my experience on my hair is an inferior formula to the original-</li>
            <li> I sound like an ad, but its true.    </li>
            <li> Great for long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very, very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Its always a good idea to have another cone free shampoo and conditioner different than biolage to give your hair a break be it once a week or once every 4 months.</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> You get your hair clean, but don&#x27;t strip it of all the oils.    </li>
            <li> If youre going to start using these products please make sure to, prior to your first use of Biolage, apply a good clarifying shampoo to take off all the buildup of protein and silicones.</li>
            <li> It works great as a deep conditioner and by using less, it works great as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Believe me it is true.  </li>
            <li> Please go by this and dont even look at the price if it bothers you, its too worth it not to get I had to try 100 cheap products before this</li>
            <li> Love it so much.  </li>
            <li> Good but not up to ITS A TEN.</li>
            <li> Like all conditioners, you must WAIT before rinsing for the full effect of the product.</li>
            <li> Most do not work well for my very resistabt hair--this one never dissapoints.</li>
            <li> but I think its worth the cost for someone who can&#x27;t find a cheap conditioner that works.</li>
            <li> When I first used this stuff 20 years ago, I was in awe of the scent; it was my first experience with a high-end hair product, and I loved it (after using Suave and VO5 my whole life, this was a revelation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I purchased this, as I have used it in years past with great results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff super fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> , I have seborrheic dermatitis in my scalp which is a mild form of psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, but make sure you only put it on your ends and not your roots (unless you are going for that sexy, greaser look).</li>
            <li> Works well and gets rid of tangles quickly...</li>
            <li> my wife loves this stuff and it arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Color treated hair and this just was exactly what my hair wanted!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel quite as soft as with some cheaper conditioners and shampoos, but it just looked so much healthier and it styled more easily and was just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, you will stop using other add on products after a while because you realize that anything you put on your hair actually only diminishes the beautiful effects and the healthy hair these products foster.</li>
            <li> No other products keep my full wavy hair well hydrated and healthy quite like the biolage line.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> These products are like golden handcuffs in that way.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I reccomend this to anyone, it&#x27;s not TOO pricy and is SOOOO  worth it.</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS PRETTY GOOD and will work wonders for you in the long run by making your hair stronger!</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS PRETTY GOOD and will work wonders for you in the long run by making your hair stronger!</li>
            <li> I go through it pretty quickly as I have yet to find another conditioner that works as well as this conditioning balm.</li>
            <li> I go to comments on how beautiful and healthy my hair is, without fail.  </li>
            <li> Its something people really do notice, because truly healthy hair is not a common thing to see...</li>
            <li> Ever since I moved to a very dry climate (Nevada) I had been battling breakage and extremely dry hair until I started using this awesome stuff!  </li>
            <li> and my hair stays strong, style lasts, and it is soft and growing!  </li>
            <li> I have tons of huge dry bushy hair on my head and this conditioner makes it sleek and silky smooth!</li>
            <li> It made my new growth soo smooth, to the point where I dont notice the regrowth.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft, elastic and strong ...</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products and have not had much success.</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance and the price was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Buying the larger jar available on Amazon presents a significant savings over buying the consumer tubes at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> You may even stop using the hot irons or the curling irons</li>
            <li> She grinned and admitted that she did in fact use it that day for the first time.  </li>
            <li> But to address the price factor I would recommend not buying this product online because unless you pay the same price or more then you would find in a store</li>
            <li> you really cant guarantee the quality of hair products you will buy on the net (even though my praticular order was great I will be buying this again from a local store.</li>
            <li> but it sounds promising!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, shiny, and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Since I starting using the matrix conditioning balm products, my hairdresser of 8 years told me that my hair has never been in better condition.</li>
            <li> but it works better if left on for a minimum of 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a curly hair that is coarse and this stuff makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more when needed.</li>
            <li> It leaves my processed hair smooth, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use it my hair feels quite soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> I saw result the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Makes my long straight dark brown hair very beautiful and shiny.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great for thick course hair.  </li>
            <li> When I leave it in for more than 5 minutes it acts like a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> Just ok for a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry no matter what shampoo I use and this product not only smells great but puts the moisture back into my hair to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> Some of the other conditioners I tried worked well on my hair, but were kind of greasy and made my skin break out.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner and its other half, Biolage Hydrating Shampoo are the very best ive ever used in all my years</li>
            <li> I have pretty healthy hair, not too oily although it can be a bit dry sometimes.</li>
            <li> For my break products I use anything I like without cones (I need my new product fix, anyway), but two I HIGHLY recommend are Mastey Traite Shampoo (cone free) and Inecto Pure Coconut Oil Conditioner (also cone free).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> By far the best product for dry hair I have tried alot of products on the market and this is the only one that gets the knots out and leaves my hair soft anf still curly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I always use but for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li> goes even more a long way!</li>
            <li> I advise anyone who is looking into buying Biolage to avoid the ULTRA version (its really easy to get them mixed up, so buyer beware)</li>
            <li> Been using this hair balm for almost a month now, it helps my super dry hair be more soft and moisture.</li>
            <li> and my hair always gets to a certain point</li>
            <li> So rare, and so effective, you really can&#x27;t go back to anything else for very long.  </li>
            <li> scent was always beautiful to me... sort of flowery,with a rich creamy undertone, medium longevity (not too strong, not too soft), but to be honest, after smelling the same scent for 20 years ive become really bored with it and wish they would make different scented version of the same formulation.  </li>
            <li> I use this on a weekly basis, although it is a little costly it does a nice job conditioning.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too heavy on my fine hair, it just helps it to feel fabulous and luxurious.</li>
            <li> Despite the shipping being a little more than usual, this was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> i expected more from this conditioner</li>
            <li> otherwise straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li> ULTRA is a newer formulation  and very sub-par.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I realized you really do get what you pay for NOT TO MENTION this 16.9oz</li>
            <li> well I hope this review helped anyone who really cares about there hair like I do, take my word on it because I&#x27;ve REALLY tried it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well I hope this review helped anyone who really cares about there hair like I do, take my word on it because I&#x27;ve REALLY tried it all.     </li>
            <li> I really feel like I stepped out of the salon with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li> and this stuff works really well on it.</li>
            <li> In terms of hydration I didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Really dislike the smell of the conditioning balm.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a regular conditioner to keep my hair hassle free during the week.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> This 16.9 oz jar(?) lasts a while and the conditioner is really creamy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Today, however, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much though....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
            <li> I like so much about this conditioner:  1.</li>
            <li> styling is much easier.  </li>
            <li> Ulta, etc) conditioner, there isn&#x27;t much to write home about.</li>
            <li> Especially the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and like to straighten it.</li>
            <li> This is one reason why your hair becomes so incredibly soft and healthy when you use this duo regularly.</li>
            <li> Soft and silky!!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this as it got positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The town I live in now also uses a higher level of chlorine in the water supply</li>
            <li> It was also one of those products i heard raves about but didn&#x27;t like the price on, this comes in a big bottle though and is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It was also one of those products i heard raves about but didn&#x27;t like the price on, this comes in a big bottle though and is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> As a result my hair broke off significantly and wouldn&#x27;t stop shedding AT ALL until my beautician started to deep condition my hair every week with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I just use and rinse out as any other conditioner, byt sometimes between washings a leave a dab in to brighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of very fine, tangly hair and this seems to be the only conditioner out there that actually works at taming it and helping me to comb through it all much easier.</li>
            <li> years later, I&#x27;m older and wiser (27) and am at my more natural dark blonde color and my hair is much healthier, but I still love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and it really helped my hair out quite a bit before i bought the biolage matrix conditioning balm I will highly recommend buying them together (you can at walmart)</li>
            <li> and it really helped my hair out quite a bit before i bought the biolage matrix conditioning balm I will highly recommend buying them together (you can at walmart)</li>
            <li> I think that if blow dryers,straighteners, and curling irons were avoided, these companies would lose a lot of business on products that often don&#x27;t do much and are highly over rated.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is as soft as silk and very very very beutiful....</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;relaxing\\&quot; effects of this product were very unexpected, and might be undesirable for people who enjoy big hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, one would think that dry brittle hair was not a problem.</li>
            <li> I love to touch it as does my boyfriend, and it doesnt weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> I think it makes my hair look a bit more wirey and it kind of feels dirty or greasy or something.</li>
            <li> Smell is decent.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and smooth, instantly!</li>
            <li> It is great for hair that is usually frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li> I used this in high school and bought some after moving to a humid climate again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I found that the conditioner was more lightweight and made my hair a little softer.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, color-treated hair and this stuff made it feel silky soft.</li>
            <li> have been using it for a few years and have found no other that is as good at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that this conditioner doesn&#x27;t provide much slip it did seems to make my hair soft.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed, my hair was very tangled and my hair did not feel soft at all.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find the green one anymore.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal state.  </li>
            <li> I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have the normal effect</li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey, but definitely worth the extra pennies.</li>
            <li> Great conditioning for long thick hair</li>
            <li> After turning 50 and having, um more than several hair coloring treatments, my hair was very dry.</li>
            <li> Well I originally tried it on wet hair and just let it sit on my hair.</li>
            <li> conditioner rejuvenates my hair--I leave it on for 1/2 hour, rinse out, and it feels like I have a new head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Need to order new.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and is not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li> If you have long curly hair, you&#x27;ll need a more liberal amount (even so this stuff lasts us a long time).  </li>
            <li> it was very soft to touch.</li>
            <li> They will make the slip more noticeable immediately after washing and conditioning, but they will, inshort order, coat your hair in something akin to plastic, and actually damage your hair over time due to severely drying it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried all kinds of hair treatments like hot oils, hair cholesterol and deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> But that could be because its pretty coarse.     </li>
            <li> this product makes my hair extremely soft!</li>
            <li> I used to use hot oil, but have found the quality of the hot oil on the market to have gone down over the years.  </li>
            <li> (especially since its hard to find cone free conditioners, and because people arent educated about cones so most of the population wanders around with subpar, dry brittle hair).  </li>
            <li> After washing my hair and applying this balm (I left it in overnight), I rinsed it out and it left my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I do have extremely fine hair though and the balm doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily.</li>
            <li> even if she only uses it every two weeks as I do, her hair is *still* softer, more manageable, and a little straighter during the weeks</li>
            <li> But it is just average, nothing special.</li>
            <li> judging by  the dirt on the edges of the clear label on this tub</li>
            <li> She has very curly, coarse hair with quite a bit of gray.</li>
            <li> it was shiny and felt soft.</li>
            <li> It is not a heavy waxen type conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and alot of products</li>
            <li> Now if I pull or tug at my hair it doesn&#x27;t have any breakage and it stays soft and</li>
            <li> After washing and deep conditioning once a week with Biolage for a month straight</li>
            <li> your suppose to leave it on for at least 20 minutes, I never do... but love the feel of it on my hair....</li>
            <li> No silicone ingredients and yet completely detangles curly hair.</li>
            <li> My 25 year old daughter was complaining that her hair was getting dryer</li>
            <li> It makes your hair so manageable and shining, and soft.</li>
            <li> leaving her hair soft with natural glow.  </li>
            <li> My fiancee&#x27;s mother commented that my hair was \\&quot;soft as a baby&#x27;s\\&quot; after using this balm.</li>
            <li> Smells flowery - could bother sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> I would not say it has recovered \\&quot;its natural shine, silkiness and softness\\&quot; as the product description promises.</li>
            <li> Been using for nearly 20 yrs.  </li>
            <li> I started washing my hair with this conditioner again and after one wash it was soft again.</li>
            <li> It conditions my hair and leaves it feeling soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> and i tend to go for conditioners which are more on the thick side.</li>
            <li> apparently they almost look identical to this regular conditioning balm so before you buy anything be careful to read it and make sure you know which one your actually getting.</li>
            <li> apparently they almost look identical to this regular conditioning balm so before you buy anything be careful to read it and make sure you know which one your actually getting.</li>
            <li> I would pay almost anything for the green leaf labeled original conditioning conditioning balm --the one pictured by the seller--</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine, but probably not better than the competition.</li>
            <li> &quot; then just doing my normal shower routine and only shampooing my roots</li>
            <li> This conditioner along with the shampoo make my fine, thin hair feel and look so much fuller&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Okay everyone bye bye!se it the way i do on wet hair a little</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is very curly and often gets dry</li>
            <li> I have very course dry hair</li>
            <li> ( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)</li>
            <li> Hydrasource is good- a step up from drugstore stuff -- but not great, the very next day my hair is dry again.</li>
            <li> When I stopped deep conditioning and stopped using this while my hair was natural</li>
            <li> I use this daily, even when I don&#x27;t shampoo, as a leave in and it keeps my hair really soft and looking shiney.</li>
            <li> Nope, the same thing happened, my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft and it was once again, tangled.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite hair secret.</li>
            <li> Voila smooth , shiny and manageable hair which is a blessing for someone who has thick frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> No longer creamy and thick, I&#x27;d now compare it to cheap grocery store products.</li>
            <li> It leaves my thick, rebellious, curly hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cheap product, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I have thick long hair that&#x27;s also damaged and this is my all time favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> It works for straight fine dry hair and even very curly dry hair (think pencil thin curls).  </li>
            <li> Great for tight spirals of thick hair or my daughters thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and straight... delicate, and could easily turn into mousy unremarkable hair (and does every time I try using another product for more than a few days).  </li>
            <li> smooth and very little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, full, long and very soft.</li>
            <li> build-up with Biolage is far and away less than any other product ive ever used, but after a long while your hair will begin to crave a break from even this just for a day.&lt;br /&gt;Another important note:  </li>
            <li> THIS IS BIG ENOUGH TO LAST AWHILE, especially if you use it the way i do on wet hair a little goes even more a long way!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still soft and I can keep it long!</li>
            <li> I have waste length thin long hair that is fair-</li>
            <li> When I use this conditioner my hair looks much smoother, softer and is less likely to frizz.</li>
            <li> And, yes, I am slowly but surely getting rid of the damaged hair in a less traumatic way.)   </li>
            <li> Product is a little heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly, coarse, dry hair ( have it colored on a regular basis)  </li>
            <li> The whites and rogue fine patches, which conditioners often leave fluffy and shapeless, now curl like the rest of my hair.   </li>
            <li> It takes a little extra work, but makes handling and dispensing so much easier.</li>
            <li> I love my hair an its long, thick and dark brown</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint, which is only a complaint because of how good these are that I would get sick of an otherwise nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and it leaves my once dry hair very moisturized.  </li>
            <li> For short curly and straight hair you only need a small amount to condition your entire head.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, her hair ended up even more dry after one try.</li>
            <li> I really feel like this product has repaired my dry, damaged hair after a few uses.</li>
            <li> (she is chinese and has some of the thickest long hair ive ever seen...</li>
            <li> I used to have long platinum blonde hair, and finding this stuff kept my hair from melting away.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair feeling silky soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Buy this, try it and you will see exactly what I mean.</li>
            <li> It totally quenches my dry locks.</li>
            <li> I have kept my hair short for a long time since I had such trouble with long hair when I was young.</li>
            <li> have very dry end due to naturally curly hair, and monthly highlights to cover my gray hairs,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I use this as a leave in, but it does buildup and dull hair when there&#x27;s too much.</li>
            <li> get my wrong, my hair isn&#x27;t wonderfully smooth, shiny and frizz-free when using this.  </li>
            <li> and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this stuff is heaven.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as soft as with drug store brands like Herbal</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, managable and not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It has eliminated a lot of tears when combing out long tangled curls.</li>
            <li> alittle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the conditioner I have been needing for a long time.</li>
            <li> thick, creamy, concentrated, and HIGHLY moisturizing!</li>
            <li> After a week it was back to normal and it growing in thick again.</li>
            <li> I still like it better than really cheap shampoos and conditioners, but it&#x27;s not nearly as good as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;It also used to be ultra concentrated so a little bit would go a really long way making it less expensive than it seems.</li>
            <li> I had tried to get her to use it months ago because she was losing so much hair in the shower and her hair always looked rather  dull, and dry to me.  </li>
            <li> every other* week as a deep conditioner because of the price.</li>
            <li> There are already several other glowing reasons, so I won&#x27;t drone on and on.</li>
            <li> Therefore it lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> every other day (each time I shower), with Tigi&#x27;s Urban Renewal Level 2 for shampoo and scalp conditioner.</li>
            <li> then I have to cut about 3-4inches off because of dry ends.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for years if you have dry hair</li>
            <li> I have really dry and wavy hair</li>

            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look and feel nearly as dry.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s prone to dry out.</li>
            <li> My hair continues to have dry ends even though this product claims to improve it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any one who has dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth paying the extra money.</li>
            <li> I went from dark blonde to platinum to dark brown and then back to medium auburn in about a year</li>

            <li> The combination makes that dry horse hair look tamed!</li>
            <li> I just never could bring myself to because of the price being double what I usually spend on deep conditioners in this economy.</li>
            <li> then used this as b4 my shower by putting it on my damp/wet hair (but not soaking wet) for 20 minuets (longer for me because of how dry my hair was) NOTICE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula or if it works differently with different types of water</li>

            <li> its gonna last you along time regardless if your asian or white and have thinner hair or black with thick hair</li>
            <li> The jar allows me to use as much as necessary and take it out a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> you can also leave a little in while your hair is damp for extra moiturizing.</li>
            <li> For a while now I&#x27;ve been not combing my hair when its wet to prevent breakage, just finger combing it which has helped my hair feel alot healthier and not get split ends.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair</li>
            <li> Feels like a luxurious deep conditioning treatment everyday.</li>
            <li> Keeps it from getting tangled when wet.</li>
            <li> I had to cut off my ceiling fan inorder for me to style my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I brush that conditioner and this one through my hair wide a wide toothed comb to soak it up, let it mellow while I shave my legs, and then wash it out.</li>
            <li> the jar is damaged, the condition is a big messy...</li>
            <li> I had bleached my hair a few years back</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick almost waist length curly hair, that is naturally wavy and undergoes a once a year perm.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommmend this product to ladies with thick, wavy/curly hair!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want anyone to end up with the wrong product and maybe have a different experience then they would with the normal conditioning balm.</li>

            <li> Her hair is not treated with color or any other chemicals.</li>
            <li> The improved manageability, on the other hand, is something my mom can&#x27;t stop raving about.  </li>
            <li> In my case the damage and split ends come on very quickly, due to the delicacy of my hair...</li>
            <li> I now only do the usual every two weeks</li>
            <li> I have been on a run of trying other products</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount to condition each time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because it was recommended by my hair stylist at the salon, so I assumed they were trying to sell it.</li>
            <li> It does not really weigh my hair down either which is a plus for me.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I get really tired of the smell, or get a hankering for a new product experience.  </li>
            <li> An exhausting and expensive regimen, but my hair looks soooo much better.</li>
            <li> Without it my hair is one big matted mess!!</li>
            <li> I regret not getting it sooner though because I noticed a difference on my extremely dry and totally busted pretty thick caucasian hair after just one use!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this as a deep conditioner every alternate week by leaving it on for 10 mins with a shower cap on while I get other things done and then do a final rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li> Because the ends are in such disrepair, it&#x27;s been hard trying to find products that work for me.</li>
            <li> Smooths and softens my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Conditioners can sometimes weigh down my hair at the root and this does not.  </li>
            <li> and this tames it down.  </li>
            <li> By this I mean I only see the benefits during the weeks I used it.   </li>
            <li> I use other moisturizers in between the 2 week period though like Nourish and Shine And Oyin Handmade Burnt Sugar Pomade which are the bomb!</li>
            <li> Gave up on all other conditioners years ago!</li>
            <li> It always moisturizes my hair and makes it less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I might just go back to something less expensive or try a different salon brand.</li>
            <li> Tresemme helps my split ends and gives me smoother hair than this stuff, and it&#x27;s less than half the price.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, curly/wavy, frizz prone, dry hair, so I need to use a lot of conditioner.</li>
            <li> It was a frizzy, split-endy, breaking-off mess 4 months ago.</li>
            <li> I decided to grow it out for one last mid life crisis fling, and started using Jason vitamin thin to thick shampoo along with gelatin capsules, and used the conditioning balm.</li>
            <li> Thick product that conditions my dry hair well.</li>
            <li> It handles my thick, dry hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair and this is wonder .I</li>
            <li> you just need a little of this stuff and your hair is soo silky.</li>
            <li> If you have really thick dry hair like me, this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> I received something called HYDRASOURCE with purple plant logo rather than the green leaf one pictured that I thought I was buying.</li>
            <li> As I started to grow out my blow dried, color treated hair longer</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> After I applied my leave in conditioner that has silicones and blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> your hair will feel heavy.  </li>

            <li> does* weigh down even very thick, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I spend hours online looking up reviews on different hair products, the good, the bad, and the ugly!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy loose curly dyed thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have color treated, thin hair which is very dry and tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li> The water here is harsh and dries and dull my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I usually use twice the \\&quot;recommended\\&quot; amount of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and never had this problem so it leads me to believe it was put in there</li>

            <li> she loses tons of it in the shower)  </li>
            <li> I do leave it in my hair for at least 7-10 minutes</li>
            <li> I bought it from Amazon at least 4 bottles.</li>
            <li> Goes back to the old adage, don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broken!!!!!!</li>
            <li> One friend is vietnamese and has thick rope-like strands of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> THICK and not runny like some of the comments.  </li>
            <li> ( I have semi thick 4a hair).</li>
            <li> I have thick unruly hair,  lots of frizz in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> I am currently 6 months post-relaxer, and my hair is getting very difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> Too bad they are too expensive and someone like me who use every to days its too much cost.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m not nearly as happy.</li>
            <li> Ive tried expensive, Ive tried inexpensive</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s expensive, it works miracles for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my secret!</li>
            <li> hair can be caused by a bad diet and heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a bad hair day when I&#x27;ve used this stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is my favorite hair secret. i have used it since the 80s.. or rather the recovery from the 80s.</li>
            <li> Strengthens hair that has been weakened by chemicals. Helps to restore and eliminate dryness.</li>
            <li> Use once a week and it does wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this conditioner for many years! It works so good on curly hair!</li>
            <li> I was about to return it because I already had a deep conditoner. For no sensible reason, I tried it once and I was in love. It moisturized my hair very well, which is very good because I am &amp;#34;stretching&amp;#34; my relaxer. And my freezy ends, fabulous.</li>
            <li> i expected more from this conditioner but it works just like the regular conditioner such as Pantene, Dove, Garnier etc. I don&#x27;t see any improvement of my hair condition after using it for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that I will use. It is great for hair that is usually frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried. Honestly, there&#x27;s a part of me that wishes I hadn&#x27;t because I just love it so much lol (and I&#x27;m cheap).   I have very thick, long, curly/wavy, frizz prone, dry hair, so I need to use a lot of conditioner. The ends of my hair are damaged from color treating, but it hasn&#x27;t been treated with any other chemical processes. Because the ends are in such disrepair, it&#x27;s been hard trying to find products that work for me. (I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of stuff. And, yes, I am slowly but surely getting rid of the damaged hair in a less traumatic way.)   I have not tried the shampoo or other products from this line to know how it would work as a \\&quot;system\\&quot;. I have been using this product *every other* week as a deep conditioner because of the price. I wash my hair with shampoo and deep condition once per week, 1-2 times per week I wash with conditioner only. I have not noticed Hydratherapie to have a lasting effect on my hair. By this I mean I only see the benefits during the weeks I used it.   I loved it so much that I recommended it to my mother. By contrast, she has seen lasting results. Meaning... even if she only uses it every two weeks as I do, her hair is *still* softer, more manageable, and a little straighter during the weeks she&#x27;s didn&#x27;t use it. Her hair is not treated with color or any other chemicals. She has very curly, coarse hair with quite a bit of gray. The \\&quot;relaxing\\&quot; effects of this product were very unexpected, and might be undesirable for people who enjoy big hair. So... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this conditioner to anyone with thin hair, as it *does* weigh down even very thick, dry hair. The improved manageability, on the other hand, is something my mom can&#x27;t stop raving about.  I&#x27;ve noticed complaints online about build up from the use of this product over time, but have not experienced this (nor has my mother)... maybe because I&#x27;m only using it 2-3 times per month instead of once or twice per week.</li>
            <li> love I can get this produce w/o the salon price</li>
            <li> When I got my hair done, the stylist put this on my hair and had me sit under their hairdryer. After my hair was gorgeous. it was shiny and felt soft. She recommended I buy the stuff so I did. I&#x27;m glad. I can use it at home and get the same results and it is cheaper to use it myself at home. Good stuff. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> If youre going to start using these products please make sure to, prior to your first use of Biolage, apply a good clarifying shampoo to take off all the buildup of protein and silicones. This will make a big difference in how you experience these two products starting out. If you dont do this you won&#x27;t see that much of a miracle because the silicones will prevent the wonderful botanical extracts from fully penetrating the hair shaft. Just FYI, if anyone would know if the formula has been tweaked or changed it would be me. So please rest assured NOTHING has changed (though there are the ultra versions which look very similar but THOSE CONTAIN CONES, FYI.  And I do not recommend those versions.) Its the same incredible versatile conditioner its always been, thank god.  Also important to know that this conditioner and the shampoo are CONE free and always have been. This is one reason why your hair becomes so incredibly soft and healthy when you use this duo regularly. This conditioner and its other half, Biolage Hydrating Shampoo are the very best ive ever used in all my years (I am 40)  Ive been using this pair almost exclusively for 20 years.  My hair is in incredible condition, very healthy, with an almost unbelievable shine factor.  Every hair dresser I go to comments on how beautiful and healthy my hair is, without fail.  Its common for the hair dresser to bring her co-workers over to see my hair saying \\&quot;Will you look at how shiney and healthy her hair is!\\&quot;.  Seriously. It makes my hair so soft, elastic and strong ...I love to touch it as does my boyfriend, and it doesnt weigh it down at all. Perfection. I get compliments all the time.  My hair is thin and straight... delicate, and could easily turn into mousy unremarkable hair (and does every time I try using another product for more than a few days).  Its only because of this duo that my hair is beautiful.  Believe me it is true.  I still, 20 years later, almost cannot believe how great these products are.  Sometimes I get really tired of the smell, or get a hankering for a new product experience.  Ive tried french products, italian products, etc... Ive tried expensive, Ive tried inexpensive, Ive tried organic, Ive tried sulfate free, etc.  Nothing comes even close to the magic of Biolage.  These products are like golden handcuffs in that way. So rare, and so effective, you really can&#x27;t go back to anything else for very long.  Ive even seriously considered applying to be a sales rep for this company... Are you getting the picture? This product takes many many months before you notice any kind of buildup.  Its always a good idea to have another cone free shampoo and conditioner different than biolage to give your hair a break be it once a week or once every 4 months. Doing this will keep Biolage&#x27;s effects at their maximum.  For my break products I use anything I like without cones (I need my new product fix, anyway), but two I HIGHLY recommend are Mastey Traite Shampoo (cone free) and Inecto Pure Coconut Oil Conditioner (also cone free).&lt;br /&gt;The build-up with Biolage is far and away less than any other product ive ever used, but after a long while your hair will begin to crave a break from even this just for a day.&lt;br /&gt;Another important note:  I have very, very fine, straight hair. I use this conditioner DAILY. It is not a heavy waxen type conditioner.  It is simple a really perfect conditioner that is not too much to use every day, no matter how rich it looks. And yet, it is the best conditioner to use to repair damage. It leaves my hair free flowing and luscious and brings out a bonafide wave I didnt even know I had until I started using these products years ago.  Now THATS a magic conditioner if it can bring out latent waves in otherwise straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Ive tried the ULTRA versions of these products, but unlike the originals here, the ultras contain CONES... They will make the slip more noticeable immediately after washing and conditioning, but they will, inshort order, coat your hair in something akin to plastic, and actually damage your hair over time due to severely drying it out.  In my case the damage and split ends come on very quickly, due to the delicacy of my hair... like within a week. I advise anyone who is looking into buying Biolage to avoid the ULTRA version (its really easy to get them mixed up, so buyer beware) ULTRA is a newer formulation  and very sub-par.&lt;br /&gt;Every friend ive persuaded to try the original two Biolage conditioning balm and moisturizing shampoo is now a lifer like me. One friend is vietnamese and has thick rope-like strands of hair.  Another friend has an afro.  This stuff is great for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;It would be a really terrible thing if this product duo was ever discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;Do your hair a favor and give this duo a go...  Your hair will transform to the best version it could be, and it will style much easier, too.  In fact, you will stop using other add on products after a while because you realize that anything you put on your hair actually only diminishes the beautiful effects and the healthy hair these products foster. You never realized how cooperative your hair could be. One of my friends after using it at my house commented \\&quot;Whoa... That shampoo and conditioner I used in your shower were so good I dont even need product today.  My hair looks amazing and I didnt even have to do anything but comb it!\\&quot;.  You may even stop using the hot irons or the curling irons (I stopped curling my hair, for example) because you find that miraculously your natural hair tendencies, when given the right kind of care, are beautiful in their own right.&lt;br /&gt;The scent was always beautiful to me... sort of flowery,with a rich creamy undertone, medium longevity (not too strong, not too soft), but to be honest, after smelling the same scent for 20 years ive become really bored with it and wish they would make different scented version of the same formulation.  That is my only complaint, which is only a complaint because of how good these are that I would get sick of an otherwise nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The gal I rent a room too came home from work yesterday and her hair looked totally different ... (she is chinese and has some of the thickest long hair ive ever seen... she loses tons of it in the shower)  It looked shiny, soft, wavier and simply gorgeous.  I asked her straight up, \\&quot;Hey!!! You used my shampoo and conditioner didnt you?! Youre hair looks AMAZING!\\&quot;  She grinned and admitted that she did in fact use it that day for the first time.  The difference in her hair was THAT noticeable.  I had tried to get her to use it months ago because she was losing so much hair in the shower and her hair always looked rather  dull, and dry to me.  She&#x27;s now hooked also, and just ordered her own stash of Biolage from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Good healthy hair is soooo important... Its something people really do notice, because truly healthy hair is not a common thing to see... (especially since its hard to find cone free conditioners, and because people arent educated about cones so most of the population wanders around with subpar, dry brittle hair).  Healthy shiny hair goes a very long way in making a person look beautiful and attractive.  Buy this, try it and you will see exactly what I mean.</li>
            <li> I have kept my hair short for a long time since I had such trouble with long hair when I was young. My hair is fine, one would think that dry brittle hair was not a problem. After turning 50 and having, um more than several hair coloring treatments, my hair was very dry. I decided to grow it out for one last mid life crisis fling, and started using Jason vitamin thin to thick shampoo along with gelatin capsules, and used the conditioning balm. I use it daily, and my hair grew from at my ears to middle of my back in abt six months! and with the conditioning balm, my hair went from brittle to brilliant. I love this stuff, it is great. My hair is thick, full, long and very soft. My husband goes ga ga over it.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I have really thick hair and I usually use twice the \\&quot;recommended\\&quot; amount of conditioner.  The jar allows me to use as much as necessary and take it out a little at a time.  It smells great.  It works great.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I used to buy for more in the salon.  love it.</li>
            <li> God bless the creators of Matrix Biolage Conditioning Balm! This is by far the best conditioner my hair has ever seen! There are already several other glowing reasons, so I won&#x27;t drone on and on. Just know that this conditioner is heaven for hair...thick, creamy, concentrated, and HIGHLY moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Great for tight spirals of thick hair or my daughters thick straight hair. Love price on mass quantity.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff super fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> This is a great, basic hair conditioner.  Nice because you don&#x27;t need to use much to see results.</li>
            <li> Great price and favorite conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great and the price here is better than the salon&#x27;s.  I use it with Biolage by Matrix Color Care Shampoo and my hair is in the best shape its ever been in.  It lasts forever and is an AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> Like the fragrance and the price was very reasonable.  Product is a little heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Thick product that conditions my dry hair well.</li>
            <li> Just loooooove thgis product!!!! I am going to have my bussines with this product!!! Was doing my research paper for Cosmetology college and came accros to this conditioner and it&#x27;s the best!!!!!! Hair feels like silk! Soft and silky!!! LOVE IT! Thank You</li>
            <li> I am in the process of trying to grow my hair down to my lower back and my hair always gets to a certain point then I have to cut about 3-4inches off because of dry ends. I spend hours online looking up reviews on different hair products, the good, the bad, and the ugly! For a while now I&#x27;ve been not combing my hair when its wet to prevent breakage, just finger combing it which has helped my hair feel alot healthier and not get split ends. I&#x27;ve also tried all kinds of hair treatments like hot oils, hair cholesterol and deep conditioners. BOY OH BOY DO I WISH I TRIED BIOLAGE CONDITIONING BALM SOONER!!!!! I just never could bring myself to because of the price being double what I usually spend on deep conditioners in this economy. I regret not getting it sooner though because I noticed a difference on my extremely dry and totally busted pretty thick caucasian hair after just one use!!!! I wet my hair then used this as b4 my shower by putting it on my damp/wet hair (but not soaking wet) for 20 minuets (longer for me because of how dry my hair was) NOTICE I SAID \\&quot;WAS\\&quot; then just doing my normal shower routine and only shampooing my roots ITS WORKED LIKE A CHARM sent from an angel who loves hair!!! But to address the price factor I would recommend not buying this product online because unless you pay the same price or more then you would find in a store you really cant guarantee the quality of hair products you will buy on the net (even though my praticular order was great I will be buying this again from a local store. They sell this at walmart, walgreens, and plenty of familiar places! Please go by this and dont even look at the price if it bothers you, its too worth it not to get I had to try 100 cheap products before this and I realized you really do get what you pay for NOT TO MENTION this 16.9oz IS HUGE its gonna last you along time regardless if your asian or white and have thinner hair or black with thick hair THIS IS BIG ENOUGH TO LAST AWHILE, especially if you use it the way i do on wet hair a little goes even more a long way! NOW I ALSO HAVE TO MENTION THIS SINCE IM A HAIR LOVER I WILL GIVE UP ANOTHER SECRET WONDER PRODUCT FOR THE OTHER HAIR LOVERS! CHI KERATIN MIST!!!! It was also one of those products i heard raves about but didn&#x27;t like the price on, this comes in a big bottle though and is totally worth it! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3months and I cant even see my split ends that I never trim anymore! Since I was using this and it really helped my hair out quite a bit before i bought the biolage matrix conditioning balm I will highly recommend buying them together (you can at walmart) because I know if I had both of those products sooner it would have saved my hair and my hair would be to my lower back by now where I want it to be and feeling great. Give the spray about 2-3months to really show amazing results I spray it in my hair everytime after i shower and you can also spray it on dry hair with out it feeling greasy IT SMELLS PRETTY GOOD and will work wonders for you in the long run by making your hair stronger! OKAY well I hope this review helped anyone who really cares about there hair like I do, take my word on it because I&#x27;ve REALLY tried it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, I have never tried matrix biolage ULTRA conditioning balm, or the hydrating balm apparently they almost look identical to this regular conditioning balm so before you buy anything be careful to read it and make sure you know which one your actually getting. I bet they work just as well but I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to try them for myself and I don&#x27;t want anyone to end up with the wrong product and maybe have a different experience then they would with the normal conditioning balm. Okay everyone bye bye!se it the way i do on wet hair a little goes even more a long way!

            <li> I use this and will never find anything better.  Keeps my hair silky and soft.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> Have always loved this product.</li>
            <li> This Biolage conditioner is really good for fine and dry hair, I&#x27;m really happy with the results, I try to use two or three times per week.</li>
            <li> This Item received is not what is pictured. I received something called HYDRASOURCE with purple plant logo rather than the green leaf one pictured that I thought I was buying. The seller??placed a sticker on it that says &amp;#34;Conditioning Balm&amp;#34;. I peeled it off to see beneath and it just says conditioner.&lt;br /&gt; I have waste length thin long hair that is fair- the original conditioning balm is the best stuff ever. I have not been able to find the green one anymore. I would pay almost anything for the green leaf labeled original conditioning conditioning balm --the one pictured by the seller-- nothing works as good and I have tried almost everything- including this purple labeled stuff that came in the mail.  Hydrasource is good- a step up from drugstore stuff -- but not great, the very next day my hair is dry again.This product in my experience on my hair is an inferior formula to the original- could it be why it sat on a shelf for a while?.. judging by  the dirt on the edges of the clear label on this tub I just now pulled out of the mail box.</li>
            <li> As I started to grow out my blow dried, color treated hair longer the ends were getting a bit frizzy.  I either had to find a product to smooth them out of go back to a shorter hair style.  I tried this balm and it worked great on my hair.  Some of the other conditioners I tried worked well on my hair, but were kind of greasy and made my skin break out.  This balm worked well on my hair and didn&#x27;t harm my skin so I give it an A+.</li>
            <li> This Biolage Conditioning balm is the best there is.  If you have damaged hair or just need a good conditioner than give this a try.  My daughter loves it, too!</li>
            <li> I used this in high school and bought some after moving to a humid climate again. It is wonderful...Smooths and softens my hair without weighing it down. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years if you have dry hair this is the best product you can buy, It really works wonders my hair is soft and silky you can also leave a little in while your hair is damp for extra moiturizing. By far the best product for dry hair I have tried alot of products on the market and this is the only one that gets the knots out and leaves my hair soft anf still curly I have naturally curly hair and alot of products would flatten my curl I LOVE MATRIX BALM also available in a tube in some salons.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to comment on this product. I am an African American woman with natural hair. When my hair was relaxed this did a great job conditioning and my hair never broke off and was always strong.  When I stopped deep conditioning and stopped using this while my hair was natural I noticed some breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have seborrheic dermatitis in my scalp which is a mild form of psoriasis.  I was using a medicated shampoo Loprox but was not deep conditioning afterward.  As a result my hair broke off significantly and wouldn&#x27;t stop shedding AT ALL until my beautician started to deep condition my hair every week with this conditioner.  I wear my hair in spiral curls and after I started deep conditioning within the 1st deep conditioning treatment with Biolage my shedding stopped. Now if I pull or tug at my hair it doesn&#x27;t have any breakage and it stays soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hair has grown back as well.  The Biolage restored my hair back to it&#x27;s normal state.  After washing and deep conditioning once a week with Biolage for a month straight I now only do the usual every two weeks and my hair stays strong, style lasts, and it is soft and growing!  I use other moisturizers in between the 2 week period though like Nourish and Shine And Oyin Handmade Burnt Sugar Pomade which are the bomb!</li>
            <li> This is still the best Conditioning Balm out there and reasonably price.  Corrects even damaged hair and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Got this product and for some reason it had water all in the container on top of my conditioner. Shook it up and thought it was from sitting and it still has water all in it. I have used this product in the past and never had this problem so it leads me to believe it was put in there bc it&#x27;s must have been used so that upsets me bc it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be dry no matter what shampoo I use and this product not only smells great but puts the moisture back into my hair to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it doesn&#x27;t help my problem.  I was hoping for better.</li>
            <li> this was for a friend and she LOVES this stuff</li>
            <li> The only reason why I took one star off is because it is a bit pricey in my opinion. However, it handles everything I look for: slip, botanicals, softness, shine, great smell, moisture. It handles my thick, dry hair with no problem. I have been on a run of trying other products but I think I might go back to this, because aside from the price, I have nothing to complain about. I really feel like I stepped out of the salon with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy, unmanageable hair.  I have always hated washing my hair because combing it would take me forever.  This conditioner works miracles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I always use but for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thin hair.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and it leaves my once dry hair very moisturized.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for about a week now and I don&#x27;t see any change yet.  It does have a very pleasant odor, and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.&lt;br /&gt;Buying the larger jar available on Amazon presents a significant savings over buying the consumer tubes at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Been using it for years. Have very dry hair</li>
            <li> I recommend this conditioner to everyone who will listen.  I have been using this conditioner for many many years now.  Probably over a decade.  It leaves my hair manageable and smelling great!  Also helps heal damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard of people who put this on their hair and then wrap their head with a towel and sleep like that.  I haven&#x27;t tried it - but it sounds promising!</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years!  Great for dry hair.  Only need a small amount to condition each time. Therefore it lasts a long time!  This price is great compared to Ulta!</li>
            <li> I am always satisfied with this product. It is an excellent conditioner that smells great. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR THE HAIR, AND IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR STRENGHENING THE&lt;br /&gt;HAIR. IT IS GOOD FOR HOME OR PROFESSIONAL USE</li>
            <li> This one is really same price as locally without the tax, but it saved me a trip.  THICK and not runny like some of the comments.  Happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this condioning balm for years and will not replace it with anything else.</li>
            <li> Bought this for self and as gift for friend...Works great and have been using this for years. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Biolage is my favorite hair care product. Usually coming out of the shower or bath my hair is wire like, and tangled. But not when I&#x27;m done using this stuff. It&#x27;s soft, shiny, and tangle free. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair feel silky smooth. I have really dry and wavy hair and this stuff works really well on it.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for many reasons. It is a great rinse through as well as the best leave in ever. I use this daily, even when I don&#x27;t shampoo, as a leave in and it keeps my hair really soft and looking shiney. I also like the biolage ultra hydrating balm as well and like to use that as my rinse through and this conditioner as my leave-in. Since I starting using the matrix conditioning balm products, my hairdresser of 8 years told me that my hair has never been in better condition. I can&#x27;t ask for more then that from a haircare product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick almost waist length curly hair, that is naturally wavy and undergoes a once a year perm.</li>
            <li> Biologe by Matrix Conditioning Balm is the best Biolage product since they stopped making Simply Silk.  It&#x27;s excellent for dry hair, and a better curly hair conditioner than the line they make specifically FOR curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and i tend to go for conditioners which are more on the thick side. This conditioner is thick but not too thick at the same time. It has a very smooth texture and easily detangles my curls in the shower. In terms of hydration I didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference in my hair. The smell is really really nice as well. Smells as thought you just walked out the salon! Would recommend this product to anyone with any hair type.</li>
            <li> your suppose to leave it on for at least 20 minutes, I never do... but love the feel of it on my hair....amazing..</li>
            <li> This is the best hair conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Love it so much.  No silicone ingredients and yet completely detangles curly hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought that this would be good for my hair but I didn&#x27;t like it. I found that the conditioner was more lightweight and made my hair a little softer. I&#x27;ve only used this about three times but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it or buying it again.</li>
            <li> Good but not up to ITS A TEN.</li>
            <li> Not the salon formula! And you can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> My 25 year old daughter was complaining that her hair was getting dryer so I decided to buy this for her. Unfortunately, her hair ended up even more dry after one try. I gave her a bottle of my Aussie Moist and it worked much better. I have to actually try this Matrix product myself to see what happens out of curiosity so I can&#x27;t quite condemn it yet. Aussie Moist actually works well and you get more for your money.&lt;br /&gt;Dry hair can be caused by a bad diet and heat. I avoid any form of heat on my hair like the plague. I think that if blow dryers,straighteners, and curling irons were avoided, these companies would lose a lot of business on products that often don&#x27;t do much and are highly over rated.</li>
            <li> I used to have long platinum blonde hair, and finding this stuff kept my hair from melting away. Now it&#x27;s years later, I&#x27;m older and wiser (27) and am at my more natural dark blonde color and my hair is much healthier, but I still love this stuff! It isn&#x27;t too heavy on my fine hair, it just helps it to feel fabulous and luxurious. I get complimented on my beautiful hair all the time, and I recommend it to my friends and family. Love it!</li>
            <li> Had gotten this product from my hairdresser and loved it. It makes your hair so manageable and shining, and soft.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner. My daughters hair is very curly and often gets dry so i use this to bring her hair back to life.</li>
            <li> I am currently 6 months post-relaxer, and my hair is getting very difficult to manage. I have tried so many different products and have not had much success. This product has changed the aforementioned. After washing my hair and applying this balm (I left it in overnight), I rinsed it out and it left my hair super soft. My hair was suprisingly easy to detangle. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really dislike the smell of the conditioning balm. It reminds me of an &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell. Also, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel any different than when I use my regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot but it works better if left on for a minimum of 5 minutes.  I have 3c/4a curly hair that is coarse and this stuff makes it more manageable.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave in conditioner. leaves my hair feeling silky soft without weighing it down. It&#x27;s also great for heat damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.  Smells great, makes hair super soft, and lasts forever, too!  Will definitely order more when needed.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite conditioner for over 10 years. I have tried a lot of stuff and always revert back to this conditioning balm. If you have really thick dry hair like me, this stuff works wonders! Buy the leave-in conditioning spray to use when you get out of the shower too. The combination makes that dry horse hair look tamed!</li>
            <li> I use this as a deep conditioner every alternate week by leaving it on for 10 mins with a shower cap on while I get other things done and then do a final rinse with cold water. Voila smooth , shiny and manageable hair which is a blessing for someone who has thick frizzy hair. I also use it as a regular conditioner to keep my hair hassle free during the week.</li>
            <li> No other products keep my full wavy hair well hydrated and healthy quite like the biolage line. I have been using it for years now, and I am not planning to stop!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s expensive, it works miracles for my hair. When I use it I can definitely tell the difference in softness, smoothness, and manageability. I&#x27;ve never had a bad hair day when I&#x27;ve used this stuff.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, will never turn from it! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years now and my hair never gets immune to it!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  It leaves my processed hair smooth, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> If you have shoulder length hair or longer, use daily on the ends before a final shampoo rinse.  Like all conditioners, you must WAIT before rinsing for the full effect of the product.</li>
            <li> this product My wife loves. she loves it... leaving her hair soft with natural glow.  you just need a little of this stuff and your hair is soo silky.</li>
            <li> I love this product because my hair drys out in the summer sun and this product helps to keep moisture and shine to my hair</li>
            <li> This conditioning balm is my favorite! It makes my hair so soft and shiny without weighing it down. My fiancee&#x27;s mother commented that my hair was \\&quot;soft as a baby&#x27;s\\&quot; after using this balm. I have oily hair, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy at all. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really feel like this product has repaired my dry, damaged hair after a few uses. Love the texture!</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my hair that target stuff can&#x27;t do. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this conditioner and that it worked great.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  Not worth paying the extra money.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is as soft as silk and very very very beutiful.... My have is gone with the wind.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for unruly hair. I use it as a shower (rinse out) conditioner and for deep conditioning every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and porous, so this product is a lifesaver.  Whenever I use it my hair feels quite soft and smooth.  I go through it pretty quickly as I have yet to find another conditioner that works as well as this conditioning balm. Despite the shipping being a little more than usual, this was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> love this product and use it every day!!!!</li>
            <li> awesome hair conditioning balm, gives extreme moisture and softness with no greasy after feel</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !!!  I have natural curly, coarse, dry hair ( have it colored on a regular basis)  this conditioning balm works wonders with my hair.  I do leave it in my hair for at least 7-10 minutes I think that makes a differences.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase !!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product religiously.  Without it my hair is one big matted mess!!</li>
            <li> Like a moisture bath for hair.  I use it 3 or so times a week. I condition, rinse, then condition again at the ends.  I have long hair and this stuff is heaven.  Amazon has a good price.  In the winter when the air is soooooo dry, this is my salvation.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this as it got positive reviews. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  But it is just average, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love my hair an its long, thick and dark brown so when I&#x27;m in the sun I use a UV protecting spray and this weekly and it does wonders!</li>
            <li> I am no cone, no poo. I use this as a leave in, but it does buildup and dull hair when there&#x27;s too much. Rinses out easily when it&#x27;s time. Smells flowery - could bother sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Does the job, but make sure you only put it on your ends and not your roots (unless you are going for that sexy, greaser look). This 16.9 oz jar(?) lasts a while and the conditioner is really creamy.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product.  It always moisturizes my hair and makes it less frizzy.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve used so far! I will never go back to anything else. It leaves my hair smooth, shiny and repairs my damaged hair.  My hair looks like I just got out of the salon, I love this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing, miracle-working on my dry-ish hair.  Color treated hair and this just was exactly what my hair wanted!  It feels like it did when I was 20!!!  No joke!</li>
            <li> Very good for damage haïr , and colored haïr. A good product at that price cheaper than at a box store!</li>
            <li> Very Awesome product. Most do not work well for my very resistabt hair--this one never dissapoints.</li>
            <li> I wont use any different conditioner ..this is the best for fine hair, I have alot of fine hair, but when I use this I actually get told be people you have beautiful hair..It is almost like a transformation!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have long, fine, color-treated hair and this stuff made it feel silky soft. And a little goes a long way so I was able to use one tub of it for 6 months! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Hydrates Dry Hair  Before I used this, my hair was crunchy-dry. A week&#x27;s use hydrated the crunch away. I sound like an ad, but its true.    Shine, Silkiness, Softness  I would not say it has recovered \\&quot;its natural shine, silkiness and softness\\&quot; as the product description promises. But that could be because its pretty coarse.     Curl Taming and Enhancing  This is a great frizz tamer. Don&#x27;t expect the frizz to go away entirely, but it tames enough that I often skip leave-in products. The whites and rogue fine patches, which conditioners often leave fluffy and shapeless, now curl like the rest of my hair.   Note, I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet in the humidity of summer.    Scent  The scent fades quickly after showering and isn&#x27;t strong.     Value  So-so value (I need more than the package directs), but I think its worth the cost for someone who can&#x27;t find a cheap conditioner that works.</li>
            <li> I bought it from Amazon at least 4 bottles. I like to use it and it make my hair shine.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. It&#x27;s my go to. Feels like a luxurious deep conditioning treatment everyday.</li>
            <li> I use this on a weekly basis, although it is a little costly it does a nice job conditioning. Use is sparingly</li>
            <li> Please note: I always buy this product from Ulta, and not here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is incredible, leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. I have pretty healthy hair, not too oily although it can be a bit dry sometimes. I do have extremely fine hair though and the balm doesn&#x27;t leave my hair heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years now. It works great as a deep conditioner and by using less, it works great as a leave-in conditioner. The best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I thought I notice a change in the shampoo, seemed a bit runny. Then this last conditioner was a very obvious change in the feel. No longer creamy and thick, I&#x27;d now compare it to cheap grocery store products. I still had my old container of conditioner and sure enough the ingredients are different. This WAS the only product I had ever found that worked on my hair. Guess it&#x27;s time to go back to the drawing board and try to find in new line that will work for long thick hair that is fine and tangles easily. Goes back to the old adage, don&#x27;t fix it if it ain&#x27;t broken!!!!!! ( the old formula has the last ingredient as wheat germ oil, the new one the last is amyl cinnamal)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have the normal effect</li>
            <li> using it and its good so far&lt;br /&gt;. . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. it improves my hair quality.</li>
            <li> nice conditioner, works well for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula or if it works differently with different types of water but I used to love it now I&#x27;m kind of indifferent. When I lived in a house with softened water, I loved this and the Biolage shampoo. It made my hair look SO much better. It didn&#x27;t feel quite as soft as with some cheaper conditioners and shampoos, but it just looked so much healthier and it styled more easily and was just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I moved to somewhere without softened water. The town I live in now also uses a higher level of chlorine in the water supply so those these might have effected the performance. Anyway, I didn&#x27;t use Biolage for a while because I couldn&#x27;t afford it. Now I&#x27;ve just gone back and I&#x27;m not nearly as happy. I think it makes my hair look a bit more wirey and it kind of feels dirty or greasy or something. Not nearly as soft as with drug store brands like Herbal Essences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not awful. I still like it better than really cheap shampoos and conditioners, but it&#x27;s not nearly as good as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;It also used to be ultra concentrated so a little bit would go a really long way making it less expensive than it seems. Maybe that&#x27;s changed. I think I&#x27;ll start using more and see if that improves its performance. Otherwise I might just go back to something less expensive or try a different salon brand.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to friends, I am so pleased with it. This was recommended to me by my hair dresser. I simply love it. I used to use hot oil, but have found the quality of the hot oil on the market to have gone down over the years.  I tried this product and was very impressed. This is my second jar. I have gotten many compliments on the quality of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and this product is great.  It leaves my hair feeling light, shiny, and smooth.  Conditioners can sometimes weigh down my hair at the root and this does not.  I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is overpriced. I was very excited when I purchased this, as I have used it in years past with great results. Today, however, it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me. Tresemme helps my split ends and gives me smoother hair than this stuff, and it&#x27;s less than half the price. Bah humbug.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Works well and gets rid of tangles quickly... Even after driving in a convertible for hours</li>
            <li> This is a great product for use a few times a week, you need a good clarifying shampoo to make sure the buildup doesn&#x27;t eventually flatten and dull your hair, but if not over used, it is excellent!</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner for the first time yesterday. There are things that I like and dislike about it. I like that it goes on smooth and very little goes a long way ( I have semi thick 4a hair). I left this for an hour and when I rinsed my hair wasn&#x27;t as detangled as I would have liked, probably because there are no silicones in it. Despite the fact that this conditioner doesn&#x27;t provide much slip it did seems to make my hair soft. After I applied my leave in conditioner that has silicones and blow dried my hair it was very soft to touch. This is not my favorite conditioner but I do believe it moisturized my hair like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I saw result the first time I used it. My hair is now so much healthier.i also love the smell! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This works great for me.  I&#x27;ve tried plenty and nothing has given me these kind of results.  Shine, softness, and hydrated, WITHOUT weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t ask for anything better, and I&#x27;m done searching.  It&#x27;s transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. I have tons of huge dry bushy hair on my head and this conditioner makes it sleek and silky smooth! And it smells good for days!</li>
            <li> Been using for nearly 20 yrs.  the best conditioner there is!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It leaves my thick, rebellious, curly hair smooth and manageable. I have spent a lot of money in search of products that work on my hair with disappointing results, until now.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily as my conditioner.  If yo have dry hair, this works great!  Don&#x27;t use too much though....your hair will feel heavy.  Use the right amount and your damaged, colored hair will look and feel great!</li>
            <li> Bought this product from my hair dresser the time before this. Purchased another conditioning balm when I ran out: it just wanted the same. So I came online and picked up Biolage. I really enjoy how it makes my hair feel. My hair was easier to comb out after I put the product into my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best products at a great price;-) and Amazon.com it one of the best places to buy it. Amen to that;-*</li>
            <li> Always makes my hair shiny and smooth. I switch shampoo and conditioner often, but always go back to Biolage. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> These work really well and smell really good too. Too bad they are too expensive and someone like me who use every to days its too much cost.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for my hair. I have long, extra thick, wavy hair and this allows me to run a brush through my hair when I get out of the shower. It has a pleasant clean smell and gives my hair a smooth and silky feel. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I love love this balm. Makes my long straight dark brown hair very beautiful and shiny.  Everybody gives me compliments.</li>
            <li> Item just as described! I have color treated hair that tends to get dried out.  This product wks great at restoring lost moisture.</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  No problems.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because it was recommended by my hair stylist at the salon, so I assumed they were trying to sell it. But I really liked it. Leaves my hair soft, managable and not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> My mom was a hairdresser when I was growing up.  This was her conditioner of choice. I used it for years until I moved out of state.  I ended up using more inexpensive conditioners and while they worked okay, none ever compared to the Biolage.  I finally decided to splurge and order some.  It&#x27;s still the great product I remember.  Has a good scent and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I have definitely noticed a difference in my hair since I started using it again.  It&#x27;s a thicker conditioner so it&#x27;s great for thick course hair.  Very pleased and plan to continue using it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and seller! Great product &amp; amazing service!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Great for long hair. Keeps it from getting tangled when wet.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioning balm in hopes of building up my hair product supplies in case of moving to another location, where I can&#x27;t get the bulk of my stuff. Well I originally tried it on wet hair and just let it sit on my hair. After I rinsed, my hair was very tangled and my hair did not feel soft at all. I decided to give it another chance and this time, I sat under a dryer inorder to open up my scalp, etc etc for a deep conditioning. Nope, the same thing happened, my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft and it was once again, tangled. What I did notice was a speed in drying time. I had to cut off my ceiling fan inorder for me to style my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I like so much about this conditioner:  1. The scent is fine for both men and women.  2. It works for straight fine dry hair and even very curly dry hair (think pencil thin curls).  3. For short curly and straight hair you only need a small amount to condition your entire head. If you have long curly hair, you&#x27;ll need a more liberal amount (even so this stuff lasts us a long time).  4. It has eliminated a lot of tears when combing out long tangled curls. Washing hair isn&#x27;t as stressful as it once was and styling is much easier.  5. When I leave it in for more than 5 minutes it acts like a deep conditioner.  6. If your hair is very dry and you don&#x27;t wash every day, this is great for the \\&quot;rinse\\&quot; days. You get your hair clean, but don&#x27;t strip it of all the oils.    The only thing I recommend in order to conserve: Purchase a \\&quot;squeeze bottle dispenser\\&quot; and spoon the conditioner into it. It takes a little extra work, but makes handling and dispensing so much easier. It has also helped us have better control over the amount we use.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner on the market.  Absolutely cannot be beat! I use it no matter which shampoo I&#x27;m using.  Gave up on all other conditioners years ago!</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is the price. Unfortunately, it is a bit costly in my opinion, but it&#x27;s not loaded with silicones like MOST conditioners on the market, especially those found in Salon lineups. Silicones make your hair feel nice, but repel moisture. It&#x27;s(using silicone filled conditioners/products) sort of like putting a band-aid on a broken leg.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Propylene Glycol, Myristyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Decyl Oleate, Rosemary Extract (Rosemarinus Officinalis), Goldenseal (Hydrastis Canadensis), Algae Extract, Chitosan PCA, Quaternium 79 Hydrolyzed Keratin, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Diazolidinyl Urea, Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is curly girl friendly also, which is great for moisture loving locks and those who avoid daily shampoos as your hair will not become lifeless &amp; greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this product once a week, the product does what it says.  I only use this condtioning treatment not all the products.  The products are a tad bit pricey. . . however they do an awesome job!</li>
            <li> My hair is color-treated, curly and coarse.  I need all the help I can get.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 8 months now, and when switching to another conditioner recently that&#x27;s supposed to be great on split ends; well that&#x27;s when I really started appreciating how good of a job this balm had been doing.  I came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get my wrong, my hair isn&#x27;t wonderfully smooth, shiny and frizz-free when using this.  Nothing out there is going to do that by itself on my hair, and I currently also use Argonesque Oil to help with that.  But I started using this after my hairdresser used it on me after coloring my hair and I noticed a difference with how it felt after each application.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look and feel nearly as dry.</li>
            <li> Leave this on for 30 Minutes you you&#x27;ll have a different head of hair&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry end due to naturally curly hair, and monthly highlights to cover my gray hairs,&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner rejuvenates my hair--I leave it on for 1/2 hour, rinse out, and it feels like I have a new head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It makes hair smooth and and feel thicker. I will continue to use this product,  alittle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I have to keep my hair in a bun all day and that just damages my curly hair. And being in boot camp for a couple of weeks I was not allowed to use conditioner in my hair. My hair started to break. I started washing my hair with this conditioner again and after one wash it was soft again. After a week it was back to normal and it growing in thick again. I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Just ok for a regular conditioner. Would not buy again as it didn&#x27;t do anything more for my hair than a supermarket brand.</li>
            <li> Price is Cheaper and good quality, good packing and fast for shipping.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  I have thick unruly hair,  lots of frizz in humid weather.  This product works wonders in calming my beastly tresses.</li>
            <li> For a pricey (albeit cheaper here than in salons, Ulta, etc) conditioner, there isn&#x27;t much to write home about. When I first used this stuff 20 years ago, I was in awe of the scent; it was my first experience with a high-end hair product, and I loved it (after using Suave and VO5 my whole life, this was a revelation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The balm&#x27;s lid used to have a built-in pump, which was great, and also had the same fragrance as the shampoo. Now there&#x27;s virtually no smell, and I miss it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway- it&#x27;s fine, but probably not better than the competition.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair and this is wonder .I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this stuff and it arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I have a ton of very fine, tangly hair and this seems to be the only conditioner out there that actually works at taming it and helping me to comb through it all much easier.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner for hyper-chemically damaged hair. I went from dark blonde to platinum to dark brown and then back to medium auburn in about a year and my hair was a WRECK. Since September I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair below the scalp (i.e. below my neckline) every other day (each time I shower), with Tigi&#x27;s Urban Renewal Level 2 for shampoo and scalp conditioner. I brush that conditioner and this one through my hair wide a wide toothed comb to soak it up, let it mellow while I shave my legs, and then wash it out. I then style after using a bit of Moroccan oil on my ends, B&amp;B Grooming Creme and its a 10 plus Keratin spray all over. An exhausting and expensive regimen, but my hair looks soooo much better. It was a frizzy, split-endy, breaking-off mess 4 months ago. Now it&#x27;s almost back to its pre-bleach-and-dye state, even with highlights every 3 months! Get this stuff. It&#x27;s the best conditioner out there that won&#x27;t get you greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product! It really moisturizes and repair damaged dried hair.  Love it.  The water here is harsh and dries and dull my hair.  This product gives life to every piece of hair and makes it shiny.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner; have been using it for about a year.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey, but definitely worth the extra pennies. I use this stuff on a regular basis, whether it is for regular conditioner or as a deep conditioner. I would highly recommmend this product to ladies with thick, wavy/curly hair! It totally quenches my dry locks. Whenever I get to the hair dresser for my bi-annual trim, he always rave sbaout how healthy I&#x27;ve kept my hair. This is my secret!</li>
            <li> this product makes my hair extremely soft!</li>
            <li> Been using this hair balm for almost a month now, it helps my super dry hair be more soft and moisture.</li>
            <li> Great conditioning for long thick hair that&#x27;s prone to dry out.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Smell is decent. Didn&#x27;t work any miracles. You can buy this at a drug store, so it&#x27;s not high end. I&#x27;ll use it till its gone but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Always use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioning treatment for years.  Ever since I moved to a very dry climate (Nevada) I had been battling breakage and extremely dry hair until I started using this awesome stuff!  Now, even with all the heat I use on my hair it&#x27;s still soft and I can keep it long!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It conditions my hair and leaves it feeling soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Today when I opened the package, the product totally make me disappointed. the jar is damaged, the condition is a big messy... I am trying to make a return soon.</li>
            <li> This conditioner along with the shampoo make my fine, thin hair feel and look so much fuller&lt;br /&gt;I Love it</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair at 6 weeks post and I always have difficulty stretching. I used this product, working mostly on my roots for 30 mins without heat. It made my new growth soo smooth, to the point where I dont notice the regrowth. This will make it easy for me to stretch my relaxer touch-ups. This is the best product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It smells ok. But regarding my hair, it hasn&#x27;t done a thing. My hair continues to have dry ends even though this product claims to improve it. I have frizzy loose curly dyed thin hair. Bought two of those containers since they were on sale. Waste of $$$ at the end of the day. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and smooth, instantly! Great product! I don&#x27;t bother with a regular conditioner anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the conditioner I have been needing for a long time. I would recommend this to any one who has dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m writing as a follow-up on a gift from my daughter.  excellent product !!!  I have very course dry hair and this tames it down.  Love it.  Can&#x27;t say enough what it does for my hair. My thick course dry hair feels so soft after using Biolage by Matrix Conditioning Balm.  It&#x27;s not a cheap product, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  If you have hair anything like mine, give it a try.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this product.  There&#x27;s not too many conditioners out there that can do for my hair what this one does.  Especially the cheap ones.  I don&#x27;t bother with those at all and you shouldn&#x27;t either if you have hard-to-control hair. Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be dissatisfied. Barbara Jean</li>
            <li> Love this product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years and still love it!</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair that&#x27;s also damaged and this is my all time favorite conditioner. It&#x27;s expensive but worth it and lasts long for me. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner out there!</li>
            <li> Love, love this!! Need to order new. Way cheaper than buying it at a beauty supply!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and like to straighten it. I had bleached my hair a few years back and it was like straw. This product was amazing at fixing my hair. I use it as a leave in conditioner instead and will never stop. My hair is so silky smooth now. Love it!</li>
            <li> Most of the time I just use and rinse out as any other conditioner, byt sometimes between washings a leave a dab in to brighten my hair. This is a great product: does what it says it will, smells good and my dies hair looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite conditioner.  The scent is very light and is not overwhelming at all.  I love how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have color treated, thin hair which is very dry and tends to frizz.  When I use this conditioner my hair looks much smoother, softer and is less likely to frizz. It does not really weigh my hair down either which is a plus for me.  I leave it on my hair for about 5 minutes before rinsing it out.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few years and have found no other that is as good at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> i swim everyday and have the driest hair on earth, not to mention it is very curly so it requires alot of moisture. This product helped me repair my damaged hair and left my curls intact. I reccomend this to anyone, it&#x27;s not TOO pricy and is SOOOO  worth it.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner for dry hair</li>
