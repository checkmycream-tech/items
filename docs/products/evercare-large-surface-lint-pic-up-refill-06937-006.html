            <li> Liked the concept of the product...the sheets are hard to rip off correctly though....wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Much poorer quality than those we have bought previously.  Sheets difficult to separate.  We&#x27;ll be looking for a different product.</li>
            <li> works great with cat hair</li>
            <li> have dogs !&lt;br /&gt;This is the best thing you&#x27;ve ever bought :)</li>
            <li> They work great.  Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find a lint refill that fit my large wand because the store I purchased it from isn&#x27;t carrying them anymore.  I use this for cat hair on beds, etc and love the wide reach.  The only reason this isn&#x27;t a 5 is because it&#x27;s rather difficult to peel off the used piece to reveal a fresh one.  I have figured it out but it&#x27;s still difficult at times.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I also buy their smaller versions. This one is perfect for area rugs that for some reason vacuums don&#x27;t work well on</li>
            <li> Love these things!! They pick up better than the vacuum and much quicker to use!</li>
            <li> love it, works great on the dog hair on my bedspread.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  When sweepers can&#x27;t get the job done, this will do it.  Dog hair, lint etc are gone.</li>
            <li> So glad I found these on Amazon.  Love this and haven&#x27;t been able to find the refills until now.  They&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> Picks up dog hair like nothing else!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without these giant lint rollers.</li>
            <li> I ordered, u delivered, we like&#x27;m. Great product. What else can I say, everyone needs these if they have pets.</li>
            <li> I should have a standing order, I have our he&#x27;d more then I can remember they work very well. Greatest thing since sliced Bread</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ever find these in the stores.  These are the most awesome invention ever.  It&#x27;s great to be able to lint roll the couch or bedspread in a matter of seconds.  With a toddler, two cats, and a dog in my house, I go through alot of these.  Never disappointed though!</li>
            <li> We have cats. I bought the long-handled roller and I use these to roll the king-size bed each morning after making it up, then again at bedtime if needed (depends on where the cats spent the day. The Evercare rollers are very sticky and they collect everything in the path with only a couple of passes, but they leave no residue on my fabrics). LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> I would have been better if the package and the contents didnt look like they were in a rainstorm.  i may have to order from someone else.</li>
            <li> Easiest way to  clean my floors.  Love it.</li>
