            <li>I had so finding these pillows  for a reasonable price was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Thanks for maintaining inventory on this product and excellent service.</li>
            <li>I sleep on my side, sometimes with my face aiming a bit into the pillow and yet the mask stays nicely in place.</li>
            <li>This new pilairo nasal pillow makes a incredible difference for my usage of my CPAP machine.</li>
            <li>I still love these pillows.</li>
            <li>has more leverage and tends to pull the pilairo down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stylish and sturdy frame&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats sleeping with an octopus wrapped around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For $21, Amazon saves me the hassle of having to call them and make a 30-mile trip to pick them up - and I can order as many as I want at once through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love the pilairo system.  </li>
            <li>Having my bi-PAP machine has greatly improved my energy level and sleep quality, so I am happy to pay a little more through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The Pilairo Nasal Pillow mask is hands-down the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>most comfortable mask i have had yet</li>
            <li>A bit better made than original</li>
            <li>Great price for an excellent but expensive mask.</li>
            <li>My order was fulfilled quickly and delivered 4 days before the anticipated delivery date!  </li>
            <li>Great price for a quality medical device.  </li>
            <li>Exactly fit for me.</li>
            <li>It is light weight also.  </li>
            <li>sometimes (very rarely -</li>
            <li>This is an original part not a knock off.</li>
            <li>basis, a condition that wasn&#x27;t part of my original contract -</li>
            <li>But boy was the work worth it!</li>
            <li>Great fit and saved me a considerable amount of money as retail was more than double!</li>
            <li>This is a good mask for someone that does not have high ramp time or have to have a large amount of air to use the product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great fit, and i can sleep pretty much any direction except directly on my face, with no risk of the seal breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great value for the money spent.</li>
            <li>I also have problems with using most masks because of the pressure on my skin from both the mask itself and from straps, and everything about this one is gentle on me.</li>
            <li>The delicate and cushiony Fisher &amp; Paykel Pilairo Nasal Pillows are the best choice for CPAP users who don&#x27;t want to feel or notice their nasal connection to the CPAP machine.  </li>
            <li>I have had the luxury of being able to test many different types of masks for no charge</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t settle for knock offs, this is the best long lasting CPAP nasal pillow on the market.</li>
            <li>What a nice surprise to see that they were the same.  </li>
            <li>Sleep tight, don&#x27;t let the bed bugs bite, and enjoy the comfort of this exceptional product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from full-face masks to hybrid masks (which I also loved) to other brands of nasal pillows.</li>
            <li>it works for you... excellent, but my personal discussion with ORL and sleep specialists has clearly shown that most people who require a CPAP, are on the upper third in weight and height.  </li>
            <li>AAA+ Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exact replacement.</li>
            <li>far as the vendor is concerned, a D&amp;B rating of triple \\&quot;A1\\&quot; fit their service and promptness.  </li>
            <li>Exact replacement from manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly a quality-of-life improvement having the machine and being able to order parts online to avoid the heartburn of dealing with my (former) supplier.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>I ripped my first when washing it and had to replace it.</li>
            <li>This is the first mask that hasn&#x27;t drove me nuts, it stays in place</li>
            <li>:  Light, easily cleaned, long-lasting, comfortable, and no goofy marks on my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  </li>
            <li>nothing covering your whole face, it is just so comfortable with also the one strap that just goes up and around your head and believe it or not it holds it better than that mess that you try to get into every night with the others, if you have not tried the pilairo you need to talk to your doctor about it!  </li>
            <li>It is the only one after many many tries that I could live with as I am a restless side sleeper.  </li>
            <li>I struggled with cpap use in the beginning, but this mask has made it so much easier.</li>
            <li>you are a real user (i.e. not a writer paid to spruce up blogs</li>
            <li>I thought I was purchasing a whole unit and all I received was just the nose piece.</li>
            <li>I worried about ordering this on-line thinking that the quality of this product may not be the same as my original pillows.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and it saved me from having to buy a new mask that would&#x27;ve cost me over $200.00.  </li>
            <li>I now have an extra clean one to swap out when its time to clean and air dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  &amp;#62;  this means that your main connecting tube, which is heavier,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend going through this company to purchase the pillows for your mask.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but it happens) separates from headgear if I really toss &amp; turn, but is easily popped back into place when the whistling wakes my Missus &amp; she smacks me in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great concept - Lousy engineering</li>
            <li>Love the mask and now can get this piece less than going through med company with insurance!&lt;br /&gt;Update!</li>
            <li>I am having a thought or two about creating a new well adapted product based on that ‘‘yet unpatented’’ concept...</li>
            <li>New Zealand&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, the quality of these replacement pillows are exactly the same as I was getting from my cpap supplier.</li>
            <li>They were exactly the same brand as those prescribed for me, but were delivered to me in time for my trip.</li>
            <li>These pillows are extremely soft and comfortable compared to other nasal pillows I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>For the first week I used it, I had to switch back to my old mask</li>
            <li>I was a mouth breather, but found that when using nasal pillows, I keep my mouth closed - this was confirmed with my last sleep studies.</li>
            <li>Pillow is soft and prevents leaks&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of nasal pillow, and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable, actually these are cheaper for me to buy outright here on Amazon than to pay the co-pay through my insurance and getting them from my local cpap supplier.</li>
            <li>product was a personal purchase for myself at the normal retail/list price.  </li>
            <li>This little thing just fits gently into your nasal area and just expands with the air and fits so gently.  </li>
            <li>I only recently switched to this system and am very please with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>These nasal pillows took some getting used to because I have such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The pillows are a one size fits all, and speaking as someone who is difficult to fit with a mask, these have worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced compared to the medical suppy store we purchased previously.</li>
            <li>Thin strap moves around easily, though regains elastic tension after washing.  </li>

            <li> Thin strap moves around easily, though regains elastic tension after washing.  </li>
            <li> Somebody in market research dropped the ball with this absence of adaptable hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With proper care, they last quite a long time, too.</li>
            <li> CPAP, like most medical equipment is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers.  </li>
            <li> half way though the night because of sore nostrils, but by the second week I was wearing it all night using the barrier wipes.</li>
            <li> The item was as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Feather lightweight although the few grams difference makes it a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62;  Part of this weight loss comes from a very short front tube:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I plan to order from this company again soon, as I will  be traveling and can&#x27;t get extra supplies through my usual insurance supplier.</li>
            <li> The only downside it that it is delicate.  </li>
            <li> I wrote the seller to return product and was turned down because I had already opened the box that it was shipped in.</li>
            <li> Hose has to be positioned so that nasal mask doesn&#x27;t move up or down, which breaks the seal.  </li>
            <li> &gt;  half the length (17,5 cm vs 34,5 cm) of the Swift FX</li>
            <li> it was so tight</li>
            <li> I usually get 2-3 months out of each one.</li>
            <li> way the nose connectors push up and back is accelerating the unfortunate ‘‘growing nose’’</li>
            <li> I hardly know it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> They are much much less expensive than it is for me to go through the insurance company.</li>
            <li> I created an ‘‘in-house’’ solution by cutting the strap and sewing in an elastic extension</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably because they&#x27;re afraid they won&#x27;t get my money if I lose coverage amidst the ObamaCare revolution.  </li>

            <li> Great replacement for my favorite mask.</li>
            <li> Great price for a quality medical device.  Don&#x27;t settle for knock offs, this is the best long lasting CPAP nasal pillow on the market.</li>
            <li> Great transaction! Lightning-fast shipping. Quality merchandise. AAA+ Thanks!</li>
            <li> This new pilairo nasal pillow makes a incredible difference for my usage of my CPAP machine. This little thing just fits gently into your nasal area and just expands with the air and fits so gently.  nothing covering your whole face, it is just so comfortable with also the one strap that just goes up and around your head and believe it or not it holds it better than that mess that you try to get into every night with the others, if you have not tried the pilairo you need to talk to your doctor about it!  you will be AMAZED!</li>
            <li> Love the mask and now can get this piece less than going through med company with insurance!&lt;br /&gt;Update! I still love these pillows. They are much much less expensive than it is for me to go through the insurance company. I highly recommend going through this company to purchase the pillows for your mask.&lt;br /&gt;This product was a personal purchase for myself at the normal retail/list price.  I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers.  I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with the seller or manufacturer of this product.</li>
            <li> The item was as expected.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement. A bit better made than original I think.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  A replacement for what I have been using, and fair price.</li>
            <li> The Pilairo Nasal Pillow mask is hands-down the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried everything from full-face masks to hybrid masks (which I also loved) to other brands of nasal pillows. The pillows are a one size fits all, and speaking as someone who is difficult to fit with a mask, these have worked very well for me. I also have problems with using most masks because of the pressure on my skin from both the mask itself and from straps, and everything about this one is gentle on me. I was a mouth breather, but found that when using nasal pillows, I keep my mouth closed - this was confirmed with my last sleep studies. So if you have been told that you are a mouth breather and cannot wear nasal pillows because of that, don&#x27;t just automatically accept that. You might surprise yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the quality of these replacement pillows are exactly the same as I was getting from my cpap supplier. And the price is very reasonable, actually these are cheaper for me to buy outright here on Amazon than to pay the co-pay through my insurance and getting them from my local cpap supplier. With proper care, they last quite a long time, too. I usually get 2-3 months out of each one.</li>
            <li> I worried about ordering this on-line thinking that the quality of this product may not be the same as my original pillows.  What a nice surprise to see that they were the same.  Very happy with this this order.</li>
            <li> I set patients up on cpap for my job. I have had the luxury of being able to test many different types of masks for no charge the Pilaro is the best mask I have ever worn. It seals well and stays in place. I struggled with cpap use in the beginning, but this mask has made it so much easier.</li>
            <li> The picture shown is NOT what you are buying (I knew that before I bought).  What you are getting is only the latex membrane that fits to the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the vendor is concerned, a D&amp;B rating of triple \\&quot;A1\\&quot; fit their service and promptness.  CPAP, like most medical equipment is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Yes.  They were exactly the same brand as those prescribed for me, but were delivered to me in time for my trip.</li>
            <li> Montreal, QC  2014.01.30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PILAIRO REVIEW: Great concept - Lousy engineering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been on CPAP for 16 years, last 6 with Swift FX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way the nose connectors push up and back is accelerating the unfortunate ‘‘growing nose’’ syndrome that we will all face with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the pilairo concept is perfect to counteract this phenomenon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt; •  Feather lightweight although the few grams difference makes it a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62;  Part of this weight loss comes from a very short front tube:&lt;br /&gt;  half the length (17,5 cm vs 34,5 cm) of the Swift FX&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#62;  this means that your main connecting tube, which is heavier,&lt;br /&gt;  has more leverage and tends to pull the pilairo down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; •  Pillow is soft and prevents leaks&lt;br /&gt; •  Very quiet ++  I am asleep but my girlfriend is appreciative&lt;br /&gt; •  Stylish and sturdy frame&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt; •  One size fits all head strap is a fallacy.  it was so tight It irritated my nose and upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;  I created an ‘‘in-house’’ solution by cutting the strap and sewing in an elastic extension&lt;br /&gt;  and a velcro tensor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; •  One size fits all nose connectors is another atrocity.  By the fourth incomfortable night,&lt;br /&gt;  my nose bled and I was left with bleeding then scabs on each side of my central septum&lt;br /&gt;  To think that I paid good money for this !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it works for you... excellent, but my personal discussion with ORL and sleep specialists has clearly shown that most people who require a CPAP, are on the upper third in weight and height.  Somebody in market research dropped the ball with this absence of adaptable hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•  I contacted F&amp;P and even offered to beta test their next upgrade... not even an ackowledgment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F&amp;P is sitting on a gold mine with the ‘‘pillow concept’’.  I am having a thought or two about creating a new well adapted product based on that ‘‘yet unpatented’’ concept...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a real user (i.e. not a writer paid to spruce up blogs and reviews)&lt;br /&gt;here is the person you need to send your grievances to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mr. Lewis Gradon,  Director - Product development&lt;br /&gt; Lewis.Gradon (at) fphcare.co.nz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; HQ&lt;br /&gt; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Limited&lt;br /&gt; 15 Maurice Paykel Place  East Tamaki, Auckland 2013&lt;br /&gt; PO Box 14 348  Panmure, Auckland 1741  New Zealand&lt;br /&gt; TEL +64 9 574 0100&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service !&lt;br /&gt;Miss on the second.. and you’ll lose the first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m back on Swift FX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Francois, in Montreal&lt;br /&gt;187 cm  109 kg (for the market research people...)</li>
            <li> Great price for an excellent but expensive mask. This is an original part not a knock off. Great resource to buy at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different types of nasal pillow, and this one is by far my favorite. it&#x27;s a great fit, and i can sleep pretty much any direction except directly on my face, with no risk of the seal breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is very appreciative of this mask :)</li>
            <li> GREAT nasal mask.. !!</li>
            <li> Never had a mask that worked so well.  It stays in place and seals.  You do have to position the tubing so it doesn&#x27;t blow in your face but I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent fit for existing mask. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Something happened, I don´t have it yet, but is my problem, my cousin (she will tell me what happened...)</li>
            <li> The add was miss leading. I thought I was purchasing a whole unit and all I received was just the nose piece. This piece doesn&#x27;t work with any of stuff. I wrote the seller to return product and was turned down because I had already opened the box that it was shipped in. Now how would I have known what I purchased if I never opened the shipping box. Mind you that the bag the actual product came in was never opened. So I&#x27;m out almost $30.00 for something I can&#x27;t use. Just doesn&#x27;t seem very fair to me.</li>
            <li> Exactly fit for me. Delivery lead time is also very good. Price is competitive.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I regret is not knowing this provider before.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The problem is they only last about 45 days.</li>
            <li> This is a good mask for someone that does not have high ramp time or have to have a large amount of air to use the product.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> BLUF:  I LOVE this thing.  I hardly know it&#x27;s on.  I have the Phillips System One Bi-PAP, for moderate OSA.  Sure beats sleeping with an octopus wrapped around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Light, easily cleaned, long-lasting, comfortable, and no goofy marks on my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Thin strap moves around easily, though regains elastic tension after washing.  Hose has to be positioned so that nasal mask doesn&#x27;t move up or down, which breaks the seal.  Nasal pillow sometimes (very rarely - but it happens) separates from headgear if I really toss &amp; turn, but is easily popped back into place when the whistling wakes my Missus &amp; she smacks me in the middle of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My co-pay from my regular supplier is $14 for one of these nasal pillows, and that&#x27;s if I pick it up there.  They want a credit card on file in order to ship them out on a &amp;#34;prescription refill&amp;#34; basis, a condition that wasn&#x27;t part of my original contract - but that&#x27;s probably because they&#x27;re afraid they won&#x27;t get my money if I lose coverage amidst the ObamaCare revolution.  For $21, Amazon saves me the hassle of having to call them and make a 30-mile trip to pick them up - and I can order as many as I want at once through Amazon.  Having my bi-PAP machine has greatly improved my energy level and sleep quality, so I am happy to pay a little more through Amazon.  It&#x27;s truly a quality-of-life improvement having the machine and being able to order parts online to avoid the heartburn of dealing with my (former) supplier.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> These pillows are extremely soft and comfortable compared to other nasal pillows I&#x27;ve used. I only recently switched to this system and am very please with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For travel, I needed back up to the equipment I had so finding these pillows  for a reasonable price was the perfect solution. I plan to order from this company again soon, as I will  be traveling and can&#x27;t get extra supplies through my usual insurance supplier.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great fit and saved me a considerable amount of money as retail was more than double! I now have an extra clean one to swap out when its time to clean and air dry.</li>
            <li> perfect fit an function.</li>
            <li> Sleep tight, don&#x27;t let the bed bugs bite, and enjoy the comfort of this exceptional product.  I totally forget that I am wearing and using CPAP while I sleep.  The delicate and cushiony Fisher &amp; Paykel Pilairo Nasal Pillows are the best choice for CPAP users who don&#x27;t want to feel or notice their nasal connection to the CPAP machine.  When I could no longer acquire the Fisher &amp; Paykel product from the local durable medical equipment supplier I turned to Amazon for the product that I prefer.  My order was fulfilled quickly and delivered 4 days before the anticipated delivery date!  Thanks for maintaining inventory on this product and excellent service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and the real McCoy! Very reasonably priced compared to the medical suppy store we purchased previously. Definetly the place to buy!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this Nasal Pillow for a year.  I like the comfort and flexibility.  I can wear glasses with it.  It is light weight also.  The only downside it that it is delicate.  I ripped my first when washing it and had to replace it.</li>
            <li> Fantasic price and fits perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> These nasal pillows took some getting used to because I have such sensitive skin. I had to apply barrier wipes (you can buy them on Amazon, I bought the Bard brand) for about three weeks to my nostrils until the skin toughened up. For the first week I used it, I had to switch back to my old mask half way though the night because of sore nostrils, but by the second week I was wearing it all night using the barrier wipes. But boy was the work worth it! This is the first mask that hasn&#x27;t drove me nuts, it stays in place and I can actually wear my reading glasses while using it (I tend to fall asleep in bed while reading). I sleep on my side, sometimes with my face aiming a bit into the pillow and yet the mask stays nicely in place.</li>
            <li> It was the perfect replacement part.  The price was reasonable and it saved me from having to buy a new mask that would&#x27;ve cost me over $200.00.  It was delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> It is the only one after many many tries that I could live with as I am a restless side sleeper.  I just wish they had made a smaller one for females.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly.  Love the pilairo system.  most comfortable mask i have had yet and i have been using my cpap for 6 years now.</li>
