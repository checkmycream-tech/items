            <li>Love the item i got!</li>
            <li>Has a Great scent and light texture.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Yet, it makes a nice gift for yourself.</li>
            <li>product came ahead of time, nice scent</li>
            <li>i used the cologne and smell so fresh and delicious and this hand creme is very very moisturising for the hands</li>
            <li>makes skin very smooth</li>
            <li>That would make it absolutely perfect enough for me to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whenever we run out, we get more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this but wenttooquick.</li>
            <li>I love Crabtree and evelynn</li>
            <li>i LOVE the smell..</li>
            <li>I bought this for a coworker but have tried  evelyn and crabtree before and love the luxurious feeling against my skin.</li>
            <li>We will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I also love the rosewater smell.</li>
            <li>true rose.</li>
            <li>but i thought nothing of it and was actually excited because i like the metal tubes better.</li>
            <li>Has a very pleasing and lightly scented rose fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish this line of products was parabens free.  </li>
            <li>My mother&#x27;s absolute favorite scent from her favorite company.  </li>
            <li>We no longer have a Crabtree and Evelyn store in our area and the only place I can find this product at a good price is Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It not only adds moisture but smells good also.</li>
            <li>The product itself is ok, with a light rose fragrance, but definitely not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>I probably paid too much,  but, amazon makes this go easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it absorbed so well.</li>
            <li>when this one came in i was so excited because i had been out for a whole 2 days..</li>
            <li>This hand therapy lotion, not only smells wonderful but is rich and thick and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>like very much the fact is not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>For me, it really works!</li>
            <li>hands were soft, smooth, and as good as if I&#x27;d used Vaseline overnight on them but without ay of the greasiness that comes with the petroleum heavy lotions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost through with my first tube.  </li>
            <li>Instead of buying the same thing, I&#x27;m going to try a large bottle of rose scented lotion from the same company.</li>
            <li>I read all these great reviews thinking that this product would help my extremely dry hands due to over-washing.</li>
            <li>Smells like real roses.</li>
            <li>delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Delicate and moisturising cream love the fragance and</li>
            <li>After its applied you get soft hands.</li>

            <li> After its applied you get soft hands.</li>
            <li> As usual Crabtree and Evelyn have created a moisturizing cream with a gentle scent that is not cloying.</li>
            <li> i usually buy it directly from the only evelyn and crabtree in our area but its 50 miles away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hands 50 times a day like one reviewer had mentioned so my hands can&#x27;t be nearly as dry as hers</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I found the cream to be thick but not greasy and it has helped to keep my hands soft with less cracking near the nails.</li>
            <li> not sure if the tube was extremely old or what had happened.. i even took the tube to the location i always buy from and they agreed that the smell was off.</li>
            <li> You only have to put a little on your hands and rub it in.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture and smells just like I expected.</li>
            <li> Once I get to that point, it usually takes a few days of lotioning up to get my hands looking normal again.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount and it goes a long way since it&#x27;s so pricey</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> like i said ive used this lotion everyday for the past year and never returned a tube for the smell..</li>
            <li> Probably because I wash them 50 times a day at least.  </li>
            <li> The rosewater scent is fantastic and the price wasn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave thick residue.</li>
            <li> This tube is SMALL!  </li>
            <li> I think that this lotion is just a little on the expensive side.  </li>
            <li> there was something that smelled really weird..</li>
            <li> but this one was so bad i never used it again..</li>
            <li> i was immediately disappointed..</li>

            <li> i used the cologne and smell so fresh and delicious and this hand creme is very very moisturising for the hands</li>
            <li> If I could give 5Plus stars this product would deserve it!</li>
            <li> I read all these great reviews thinking that this product would help my extremely dry hands due to over-washing. What a waste of money. I don&#x27;t wash my hands 50 times a day like one reviewer had mentioned so my hands can&#x27;t be nearly as dry as hers but how come this works for her but not me?</li>
            <li> Lovely cream....not greasy and a delightful fragrance......true rose.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about. I thought I was purchasing the cream version and got something else. But it&#x27;s nice. Just not therapeutic like it says. Smells good though.</li>
            <li> Used to be lighter/soother</li>
            <li> Wonderful hand creme. For me, it really works!</li>
            <li> Has a Great scent and light texture. Not to creamy or greasy and it absorbed so well. Doesn&#x27;t leave thick residue.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands.  Probably because I wash them 50 times a day at least.  To the point that my knuckles start developing white lines and cracks if I don&#x27;t moisturize.  Once I get to that point, it usually takes a few days of lotioning up to get my hands looking normal again.  Not with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;My hands were soft, smooth, and as good as if I&#x27;d used Vaseline overnight on them but without ay of the greasiness that comes with the petroleum heavy lotions.  This hand lotion truly delivers and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them.  The smell is wonderful as well.  I got a couple of tubes in a different &#x27;flavor&#x27; for my daughter as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this line of products was parabens free.  That would make it absolutely perfect enough for me to give it 5 stars.</li>

            <li> Love this but wenttooquick.I probably paid too much,  but, amazon makes this go easy to use. I love Crabtree and evelynn</li>
            <li> product came ahead of time, nice scent</li>
            <li> Smells like real roses. Not that chemical stuff. I use a small amount and it goes a long way since it&#x27;s so pricey</li>
            <li> Have had some medical treatment on hand. This cream has helped. It not only adds moisture but smells good also.</li>
            <li> i use this hand therapy religiously.. like 4-6 times a day. i usually buy it directly from the only evelyn and crabtree in our area but its 50 miles away. when this one came in i was so excited because i had been out for a whole 2 days.. when i opened the box i noticed it was in a tin or aluminum tube.. they stopped packaging it in that a while ago and have since went to plastic tubes. but i thought nothing of it and was actually excited because i like the metal tubes better. then i opened the tube and used the lotion..  i was immediately disappointed.. there was something that smelled really weird.. like i said ive used this lotion everyday for the past year and never returned a tube for the smell.. i LOVE the smell.. but this one was so bad i never used it again.. not sure if the tube was extremely old or what had happened.. i even took the tube to the location i always buy from and they agreed that the smell was off.</li>
            <li> makes skin very smooth</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stalking stuffer. Looks just like the picture and smells just like I expected. delivery was fast. I would order again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a coworker but have tried  evelyn and crabtree before and love the luxurious feeling against my skin. The rosewater scent is fantastic and the price wasn&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> This hand therapy lotion, not only smells wonderful but is rich and thick and absorbed quickly. No greasy residue! I use it before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s absolute favorite scent from her favorite company.  This was a perfect Christmas gift for her!</li>
            <li> Love the item i got! Perfect size to keep it with me everywhere! Delicate and moisturising cream love the fragance and like very much the fact is not sticky or greasy. After its applied you get soft hands.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use it every day on our hands. It works well and has a great fragrance. We will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I found the cream to be thick but not greasy and it has helped to keep my hands soft with less cracking near the nails.I also love the rosewater smell.</li>
