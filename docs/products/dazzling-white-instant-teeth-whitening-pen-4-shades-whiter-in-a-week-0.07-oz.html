            <li>Dis is a great product</li>
            <li>Not that great of a product.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>This product is good but made my teeth sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw good reviews from these and for the price decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>good product though</li>
            <li>Works good, just takes a couple of applications to see the effect.</li>
            <li>I  bought this because I love to have beautiful teeth .</li>
            <li>It came very quickly, was a very fair price, and seems to work well</li>

            <li>I saw amazing results .</li>
            <li>Honestly this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product though.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I was enthusiastic to use the product.</li>
            <li>My dentist says I have a &amp;#34;predisposition to yellowing teeth&amp;#34;, but he refused to whiten my teeth because the products he uses are just as effective as store bought remedies.</li>
            <li>Good price, and love that it&#x27;s an add-on item.</li>
            <li>On reccomendation from Allure magazine as one of the best whitening toothpastes, I use Ultra Brite (also at the Dollar Tree) before I put on the Dazzling White.  </li>
            <li>,she is very happy with the product so far, would reorder item when needed</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love this!</li>
            <li>Whiter teeth help make you look strong and confident!</li>
            <li>saw a bit of a difference the first use, and after a week of using it in the mornings after I brush, I can notice a great improvement.  </li>
            <li>stuff works great, convenient, quick, and cheap...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try again and be more diligent, but I don&#x27;t think that will make a difference.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after 1 tube of this, so I ordered another one just to get more of a result.  </li>
            <li>Would repurchase. :)</li>
            <li>should have gotten another one for better result...</li>
            <li>looks ok....</li>
            <li>This seems to work better than any thing else I have used I drink coffee</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love these pens I&#x27;m going to buy more today.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will better for someone else, but it didn&#x27;t at all for me.</li>
            <li>For the price it was good,I should of ordered more of them</li>
            <li>I found that the best results came from holding my mouth open for the duration of a television show and layering the product.</li>
            <li>Got it on time love it.</li>
            <li>and it became my all-time favorite products.</li>
            <li>I have never used anything to whiten my teeth, and I love coffee.</li>
            <li>Quality, reliable and innovative item.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>And its cheap!</li>
            <li>But, I felt like I needed more of the product.  </li>
            <li>I really, really love this product.</li>
            <li>Ok whiten your teeth alittle.</li>
            <li>It was very cheep as I bought it at the dollar tree but for what it is I think it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, just started to use them and will know if gel is good later.</li>
            <li>I love that I can take it anywhere with me easily as well</li>
            <li>It did ship quickly and was nicely packaged,</li>
            <li>Quick results, nice product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use this a long with an LED light to help whiten my teeth and it has been great!</li>
            <li>The application process was easy and the form is convenient.</li>
            <li>Item was easy to use and worked within three days.</li>
            <li>tube was easy to use, hold and store in my makeup bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and convenient.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply</li>
            <li>I also swish with hydrogen peroxide once per day if I can remember (one minute is fine).  </li>
            <li>because I would have rather had to just use 1 tube, but I think it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I love dazzling white.  </li>
            <li>Also used this product with the cheap dental light.  </li>
            <li>So this was an excellent supplement to my everyday teeth cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li>but what do you expect for something so cheap...</li>
            <li>I did buy it cheap</li>
            <li>Sometimes buying cheap doesnt pay off...</li>
            <li>Buy a mouth guard; they&#x27;re cheap and you can buy them at the store.</li>
            <li>so far good job</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This really made my teeth whiter and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Adding the Dazzling White pen was the kick I needed.</li>
            <li>I gave it a try and it whitened my teeth significantly</li>
            <li>After more uses from it my teeth are looking far better than they did to begin with.</li>
            <li>i love it, and people think youre an overly happy person when youre really just smiling waiting for the gel to dry</li>
            <li>Works good, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is you have to keep your lips off your teeth until it dries.</li>
            <li>does burn gum line but not bad.</li>
            <li>Hydrogen peroxide is the main ingredient in most whitening products anyway</li>
            <li>Better deal than I was able to get at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>Whitens as quickly and thoroughly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t work for me and it also finished quickly.</li>
            <li>quick care</li>
            <li>But it does work great :) especially for the cute little price</li>
            <li>For years this is all I did for whitening and people have always commented on my brite smile.  </li>
            <li>I have found that if you use a whitening toothpaste when you brush, like colgates daily whitening, and this pen, it works quite nicely.</li>
            <li>It does make my gums a bit sensitive, but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li>But for a dollar, it&#x27;s worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is worth</li>
            <li>To each their own though, maybe I wasn&#x27;t patient enough.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li>it keeps the teeth nice and white.</li>
            <li>While it may not be great for whitening heavily stained teeth all the way back to pearly whites, it&#x27;s very good at lifting moderate yellowing and maintaining my smile in between heavier bleachings with my higher strength bleach.</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Fresh!</li>
            <li>I also use it to freshen my breath, and right before I go to a meeting.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, goes just where you put it and ONLY where you put it.  </li>
            <li>; time was great, as that&#x27;s usually the difference between me using a teeth whitener, or procrastinating and avoiding it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s HARD lol.</li>
            <li>It didnt make in between my teeth white which were the spots i concentratetd most.</li>
            <li>It looks splotchy at first, but that&#x27;s just the peroxide</li>
            <li>For me it began to work the first application-</li>
            <li>I guess that means my yellowness is mostly surface stains, so if you have surface stains, definitely this might quirk for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s hilarious that people deduct because they have to keep their mouths open.</li>
            <li>I have been following instructions and even looked for more information on their website</li>
            <li>This product did work slightly, but after a certain point it did not whiten anymore, but for the price it was a good product</li>
            <li>It came super fast and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I only doing my top teeth, and they are certainly whiter.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent, I noticed results!</li>
            <li>Hoping to wake up and not see blotches, looks very trashy, exactly where this tube is going.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Just be sure, that if you&#x27;re impatient, and you twist the bottom too much, and you leave it on important things...</li>
            <li>Loved this, was surprised at how well it worked, and it did not cause irritation as other whitening products do.</li>
            <li>but it can easily be stained if you don&#x27;t use it constantly when you drink coffee, soda, tea, etc.</li>
            <li>Certainly does do as it says.</li>
            <li>portable enough for quick touch ups!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not claiming this will be the same for everybody, but I&#x27;ve had trouble with sensitivity before and was happy not to have to worry about it with this</li>
            <li>This does not work very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again even though its much cheaper.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>But the difference is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Invest in some crest whitening strips if you want real results.</li>
            <li>and she said it really didn&#x27;t make to much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It does work , it came fast as hell.</li>
            <li>You have to be very diligent with your usage of this item for it to work.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It would make your BRIGHTER, but not so much as whiter.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see much improvement.</li>
            <li>I used a whole week</li>
            <li>Only because it was so cheap why i didn&#x27;t ask for a refund.</li>
            <li>Found this at the 99 Cent Store one day not expecting much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s does, I&#x27;ve been using with the light for only one week</li>
            <li>The difference is  really noticeable.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t stay on very well...</li>
            <li>item works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>works, just not as fast as claimed.&lt;br /&gt;good price, and cheaper than dentist whitening them.</li>
            <li>I have sat holding my lips away from my teeth, which is a real time waster.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Item was shipped fast and package well.</li>
            <li>i really like this pen.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t the best, but I&#x27;ve definitely had worse tasting whitening products.</li>
            <li>I really like this product since it whitened my teeth which is pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The pen is perfect for someone who needs more help on certain teeth, and it does not have as bad a taste as other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably order some more when I run out simply for the price and convenience, and the fact that it actually works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent for the price, and I will try to update this review when I am out of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Consider ordering a few because you surprisingly use a lot especially when you notice results.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;optional\\&quot; tip for applying petroleum jelly to your lips before application should be \\&quot;highly recommended\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>It actually works pretty well!</li>
            <li>kinda reminds me of plastic, or a bitter, cheap toothpaste.</li>
            <li>messy, needs more directions</li>
            <li>Wished I could have gotten a few more uses out of it though.</li>
            <li>If you have stains and use it more often it might not last you as long.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how many uses you get out of this or how long it lasts, but mine still works after several applications.</li>
            <li>I will only use Venus White Ultra Whitening Trays in the future, never again will I use Dazzling White.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with only 1X each day treatments how quickly and dramatically it worked.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work and tasted much much worse than the popular brand version.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it because you have to keep your mouth open the whole time?!?</li>
            <li>Pretty simple brush your teeth and put this on.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Instant results and no gooey mess which turned me off to using most whitening products.  </li>
            <li>It is like trying to keep clear water on your teeth so it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I was hoping the results would be faster but at least its cheap so can&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t bother my gums, they don&#x27;t feel sensitive at all</li>
            <li>and wow can I see a difference.</li>
            <li>It has only been 4 days and her teeth are MUCH whiter.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 or 4 days and probably used it 5 or 6 times so far.</li>
            <li>but everyone really started noticing a difference after the 3rd day!</li>
            <li>doesnt really make a big difference..</li>
            <li>Need like 4 to completely whiten...</li>
            <li>So far... I like that you can paint it on and I see some change.</li>
            <li>They are very sensitive now, and the cuts are pretty wide.</li>
            <li>And no mess.</li>
            <li>But my teeth did appear less yellow and more white after one use.</li>
            <li>I started using this as soon as I got it and am pleased to say my teeth are looking better, and since I drink coffee I was afraid they were a lost cause...not the case!  </li>
            <li>Her teeth were pretty yellow, and now they are rather white.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and using the product is a bit of a pain due to the ten minutes you need to keep it on your teeth, but not let your lips touch them.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I guess it&#x27;s OK, but my final decision is that it&#x27;s not effective.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it depends on the degree of stain on your teeth to begin with, but I have found that using Colgate Optic White twice a day is at least giving me a noticeable whitening, which is more than I can say for the pen.</li>
            <li>i really kant give a proper review, but as soon as i use it regularly, i will give anotha review.</li>
            <li>At least the price was cheap</li>
            <li>They opened in ONE day, just last night, no slow gashing open.</li>
            <li>12 year old had yellow teeth</li>
            <li>Well it came in and within the first day and a half</li>
            <li>The other pen I used and after two weeks didn&#x27;t really see results.</li>
            <li>I tired try so many different things to make this work.</li>
            <li>I found this pen at Dollar Tree, just like a previous reviewer, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>It worked the first few ties, but later didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>just plain does not work - no change after one week of following instructions exactly - would not recommend for anyone</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My dentist says I have a &amp;#34;predisposition to yellowing teeth&amp;#34;, but he refused to whiten my teeth because the products he uses are just as effective as store bought remedies.</li>
            <li> Good price, and love that it&#x27;s an add-on item.</li>
            <li> On reccomendation from Allure magazine as one of the best whitening toothpastes, I use Ultra Brite (also at the Dollar Tree) before I put on the Dazzling White.  </li>
            <li> ,she is very happy with the product so far, would reorder item when needed</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this!</li>
            <li> Whiter teeth help make you look strong and confident!</li>
            <li> saw a bit of a difference the first use, and after a week of using it in the mornings after I brush, I can notice a great improvement.  </li>
            <li> stuff works great, convenient, quick, and cheap...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try again and be more diligent, but I don&#x27;t think that will make a difference.</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after 1 tube of this, so I ordered another one just to get more of a result.  </li>
            <li> Would repurchase. :)</li>
            <li> should have gotten another one for better result...</li>
            <li> looks ok....</li>
            <li> This seems to work better than any thing else I have used I drink coffee</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love these pens I&#x27;m going to buy more today.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will better for someone else, but it didn&#x27;t at all for me.</li>
            <li> For the price it was good,I should of ordered more of them</li>
            <li> I found that the best results came from holding my mouth open for the duration of a television show and layering the product.</li>
            <li> Got it on time love it.</li>
            <li> and it became my all-time favorite products.</li>
            <li> I have never used anything to whiten my teeth, and I love coffee.</li>
            <li> Quality, reliable and innovative item.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> And its cheap!</li>
            <li> But, I felt like I needed more of the product.  </li>
            <li> I really, really love this product.</li>
            <li> Ok whiten your teeth alittle.</li>
            <li> It was very cheep as I bought it at the dollar tree but for what it is I think it&#x27;s doing a great job.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, just started to use them and will know if gel is good later.</li>
            <li> I love that I can take it anywhere with me easily as well</li>
            <li> It did ship quickly and was nicely packaged,</li>
            <li> Quick results, nice product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use this a long with an LED light to help whiten my teeth and it has been great!</li>
            <li> The application process was easy and the form is convenient.</li>
            <li> Item was easy to use and worked within three days.</li>
            <li> tube was easy to use, hold and store in my makeup bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and convenient.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply</li>
            <li> I also swish with hydrogen peroxide once per day if I can remember (one minute is fine).  </li>
            <li> because I would have rather had to just use 1 tube, but I think it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I love dazzling white.  </li>
            <li> Also used this product with the cheap dental light.  </li>
            <li> So this was an excellent supplement to my everyday teeth cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li> but what do you expect for something so cheap...</li>
            <li> I did buy it cheap</li>
            <li> Sometimes buying cheap doesnt pay off...</li>
            <li> Buy a mouth guard; they&#x27;re cheap and you can buy them at the store.</li>
            <li> so far good job</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This really made my teeth whiter and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Adding the Dazzling White pen was the kick I needed.</li>
            <li> I gave it a try and it whitened my teeth significantly</li>
            <li> After more uses from it my teeth are looking far better than they did to begin with.</li>
            <li> i love it, and people think youre an overly happy person when youre really just smiling waiting for the gel to dry</li>
            <li> Works good, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is you have to keep your lips off your teeth until it dries.</li>
            <li> does burn gum line but not bad.</li>
            <li> Hydrogen peroxide is the main ingredient in most whitening products anyway</li>
            <li> Better deal than I was able to get at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> Whitens as quickly and thoroughly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me and it also finished quickly.</li>
            <li> quick care</li>
            <li> But it does work great :) especially for the cute little price</li>
            <li> For years this is all I did for whitening and people have always commented on my brite smile.  </li>
            <li> I have found that if you use a whitening toothpaste when you brush, like colgates daily whitening, and this pen, it works quite nicely.</li>
            <li> It does make my gums a bit sensitive, but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li> But for a dollar, it&#x27;s worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is worth</li>
            <li> To each their own though, maybe I wasn&#x27;t patient enough.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li> it keeps the teeth nice and white.</li>
            <li> While it may not be great for whitening heavily stained teeth all the way back to pearly whites, it&#x27;s very good at lifting moderate yellowing and maintaining my smile in between heavier bleachings with my higher strength bleach.</li>
            <li> Thanks Dr. Fresh!</li>
            <li> I also use it to freshen my breath, and right before I go to a meeting.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, goes just where you put it and ONLY where you put it.  </li>
            <li> ; time was great, as that&#x27;s usually the difference between me using a teeth whitener, or procrastinating and avoiding it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s HARD lol.</li>
            <li> It didnt make in between my teeth white which were the spots i concentratetd most.</li>
            <li> It looks splotchy at first, but that&#x27;s just the peroxide</li>
            <li> For me it began to work the first application-</li>
            <li> I guess that means my yellowness is mostly surface stains, so if you have surface stains, definitely this might quirk for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s hilarious that people deduct because they have to keep their mouths open.</li>
            <li> I have been following instructions and even looked for more information on their website</li>
            <li> This product did work slightly, but after a certain point it did not whiten anymore, but for the price it was a good product</li>
            <li> It came super fast and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I only doing my top teeth, and they are certainly whiter.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent, I noticed results!</li>
            <li> Hoping to wake up and not see blotches, looks very trashy, exactly where this tube is going.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Just be sure, that if you&#x27;re impatient, and you twist the bottom too much, and you leave it on important things...</li>
            <li> Loved this, was surprised at how well it worked, and it did not cause irritation as other whitening products do.</li>
            <li> but it can easily be stained if you don&#x27;t use it constantly when you drink coffee, soda, tea, etc.</li>
            <li> Certainly does do as it says.</li>
            <li> portable enough for quick touch ups!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not claiming this will be the same for everybody, but I&#x27;ve had trouble with sensitivity before and was happy not to have to worry about it with this</li>
            <li> This does not work very well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again even though its much cheaper.</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> But the difference is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Invest in some crest whitening strips if you want real results.</li>
            <li> and she said it really didn&#x27;t make to much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It does work , it came fast as hell.</li>
            <li> You have to be very diligent with your usage of this item for it to work.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It would make your BRIGHTER, but not so much as whiter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much improvement.</li>
            <li> I used a whole week</li>
            <li> Only because it was so cheap why i didn&#x27;t ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> Found this at the 99 Cent Store one day not expecting much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does, I&#x27;ve been using with the light for only one week</li>
            <li> The difference is  really noticeable.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay on very well...</li>
            <li> item works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> works, just not as fast as claimed.&lt;br /&gt;good price, and cheaper than dentist whitening them.</li>
            <li> I have sat holding my lips away from my teeth, which is a real time waster.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Item was shipped fast and package well.</li>
            <li> i really like this pen.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t the best, but I&#x27;ve definitely had worse tasting whitening products.</li>
            <li> I really like this product since it whitened my teeth which is pretty sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The pen is perfect for someone who needs more help on certain teeth, and it does not have as bad a taste as other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably order some more when I run out simply for the price and convenience, and the fact that it actually works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent for the price, and I will try to update this review when I am out of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Consider ordering a few because you surprisingly use a lot especially when you notice results.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;optional\\&quot; tip for applying petroleum jelly to your lips before application should be \\&quot;highly recommended\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> It actually works pretty well!</li>
            <li> kinda reminds me of plastic, or a bitter, cheap toothpaste.</li>
            <li> messy, needs more directions</li>
            <li> Wished I could have gotten a few more uses out of it though.</li>
            <li> If you have stains and use it more often it might not last you as long.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how many uses you get out of this or how long it lasts, but mine still works after several applications.</li>
            <li> I will only use Venus White Ultra Whitening Trays in the future, never again will I use Dazzling White.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with only 1X each day treatments how quickly and dramatically it worked.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work and tasted much much worse than the popular brand version.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it because you have to keep your mouth open the whole time?!?</li>
            <li> Pretty simple brush your teeth and put this on.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Instant results and no gooey mess which turned me off to using most whitening products.  </li>
            <li> It is like trying to keep clear water on your teeth so it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the results would be faster but at least its cheap so can&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t bother my gums, they don&#x27;t feel sensitive at all</li>
            <li> and wow can I see a difference.</li>
            <li> It has only been 4 days and her teeth are MUCH whiter.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 or 4 days and probably used it 5 or 6 times so far.</li>
            <li> but everyone really started noticing a difference after the 3rd day!</li>
            <li> doesnt really make a big difference..</li>
            <li> Need like 4 to completely whiten...</li>
            <li> So far... I like that you can paint it on and I see some change.</li>
            <li> They are very sensitive now, and the cuts are pretty wide.</li>
            <li> And no mess.</li>
            <li> But my teeth did appear less yellow and more white after one use.</li>
            <li> I started using this as soon as I got it and am pleased to say my teeth are looking better, and since I drink coffee I was afraid they were a lost cause...not the case!  </li>
            <li> Her teeth were pretty yellow, and now they are rather white.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and using the product is a bit of a pain due to the ten minutes you need to keep it on your teeth, but not let your lips touch them.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I guess it&#x27;s OK, but my final decision is that it&#x27;s not effective.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it depends on the degree of stain on your teeth to begin with, but I have found that using Colgate Optic White twice a day is at least giving me a noticeable whitening, which is more than I can say for the pen.</li>
            <li> i really kant give a proper review, but as soon as i use it regularly, i will give anotha review.</li>
            <li> At least the price was cheap</li>
            <li> They opened in ONE day, just last night, no slow gashing open.</li>
            <li> 12 year old had yellow teeth</li>
            <li> Well it came in and within the first day and a half</li>
            <li> The other pen I used and after two weeks didn&#x27;t really see results.</li>
            <li> I tired try so many different things to make this work.</li>
            <li> I found this pen at Dollar Tree, just like a previous reviewer, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> It worked the first few ties, but later didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> just plain does not work - no change after one week of following instructions exactly - would not recommend for anyone</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I saw my teeth whitening at least two shades</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was paying $40 something for the Crest White strips vivid and this product is just a few bucks and works</li>
            <li> I am seeing a little difference so far.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and recommended.</li>
            <li> think a long time use of this product would make a difference.</li>
            <li> I also happened across this at my local Dollar Tree, $1 not a large investment to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about this whitening pen because of the low price, but based on the reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a tad whiter, which is what I needed since I didn&#x27;t have yellow teeth before, just a little whiter for back to school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also it kinda sticks to your lips and evenafter the wait dry time it feels</li>
            <li> It allows the gel to dry and do it&#x27;s thing.</li>
            <li> Waiting on this to dry is nerve-wracking.</li>
            <li> this product will make your teeth whiten but the only down side is that you will need to endure the taste.</li>
            <li> It says to cover gums with vaseline or some form of protection, but I don&#x27;t, it only tingles a little bit.</li>
            <li> I had followed all instructions carefully, but it still cracked the enamel on my teeth.</li>
            <li> The results are what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I would use it and never really saw any results.</li>
            <li> I have several crowns and a partial, so using a tray wasted a lot of whitener.  </li>
            <li> Only down fault is remembering to do it everyday.</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth gross feeling, and does very little whitening.</li>
            <li> She is SO extremely please with the results.  </li>
            <li> The description says 5 shades whiter or some other...</li>
            <li> I have tried other brighteners that I prefer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had sensitive teeth before and found the product to make my teeth sensitive to the cold for approx 1 hour after application.</li>
            <li> It is thin, so doesn&#x27;t stay on the teeth long enough, and any whitening is taking an eternity.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the cracks though...</li>
            <li> I guess they would be average, or medium colored..</li>
            <li> I was really shocked at how white my teeth after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No eating or drinking for half and hour after applying the gel.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks I use it less often.</li>
            <li> slightly lighted my teeth.</li>
            <li> nuisance is I fold a cotton pad in half and put it under my tongue</li>
            <li> mess or &amp;#34;setting up&amp;#34</li>
            <li> LITTLE TO NO RESULTS.</li>
            <li> but i guess theres a little bit of change.</li>
            <li> touch up if I need it when I&#x27;m away from home for a few days.</li>
            <li> have nice, well cared for teeth and I am miserable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and although I bought her whitening toothpaste, I was delaying whitening products, since they are harsh on tweens.  </li>
            <li> I used this for a few days and had no sensitivity or stinging</li>
            <li> Also, when I put it on, my lips would often rub it off my teeth, so I would have to sit and hold my lips up for like 10 minutes while it dried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Just after a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re uncomfortable about leaving your mouth open for extended periods of time (the product does say that you must for at least 10 minutes), then I&#x27;d consider something different.</li>
            <li> wouldnt say 4 shades in a week, but they are lighter after a few months.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy coffee and wine drinker.</li>
            <li> Mostly a waste of money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a messy product.</li>
            <li> Truly a mess!</li>
            <li> I used this whitening pen once and my teeth, gums and lips became highly irritated.......and the painful breakout lasted a few days before healing.  </li>
            <li> not sure if  i will purchase this again .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a difference using it once a day for the past 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I was sorry that I only purchased&lt;br /&gt;one tube.  </li>
            <li> Small though</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, got no results, super frustrated.</li>
            <li> Holding my mouth open is a tad unpleasant but its preferable to spending oodles of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a really subtle difference after the use of this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these pens and on delivery the one whitening pen was broken.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long, but you look stupid.</li>
            <li> One day, while I was smiling, my dad randomly said, \\&quot;you look like Ross from that one episode of friends.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels weird and looks even weirder but it works.</li>
            <li> walking around the house grinning like a fool is difficult.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I threw the product away.  </li>
            <li> but sadly I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t experience the bad taste some reviewers commented on, and I don&#x27;t know how anyone would say its hard to use!  </li>
            <li> the hassle of trying to return, but still mad.</li>
            <li> So those that are mad about it shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> and although I&#x27;m not a smoker I didn&#x27;t realize how badly stained my teeth were.</li>
            <li> Nothing painful, just apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good product, incredible price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical about this whitening pen because of the low price, but based on the reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. While it may not be great for whitening heavily stained teeth all the way back to pearly whites, it&#x27;s very good at lifting moderate yellowing and maintaining my smile in between heavier bleachings with my higher strength bleach. The first time I used it, I saw my teeth whitening at least two shades and it&#x27;s super easy to apply. I love that I can take it anywhere with me easily as well so I can do an on the go touch up if I need it when I&#x27;m away from home for a few days. It came super fast and was packaged very well. I&#x27;ll probably order some more when I run out simply for the price and convenience, and the fact that it actually works.</li>
            <li> I USED COUPLE OF THEM BUT NO USE. MY TEETS NEVER BECOME WHITE, SO I WILL SAY ITS A WASTAGE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t make any difference to my teeth that I could see.  I&#x27;m going to try again and be more diligent, but I don&#x27;t think that will make a difference.</li>
            <li> I found this pen at Dollar Tree, just like a previous reviewer, and it works really well. On reccomendation from Allure magazine as one of the best whitening toothpastes, I use Ultra Brite (also at the Dollar Tree) before I put on the Dazzling White.  You have to hold your lips away from your teeth until the gel dries - about a minute - and then off you go about your day.  No eating or drinking for half and hour after applying the gel.  Within 3 days of twice per day application I noticed a difference. It&#x27;s been a week now and I&#x27;m very happy with the result. I also swish with hydrogen peroxide once per day if I can remember (one minute is fine).  For years this is all I did for whitening and people have always commented on my brite smile.  There is no need to spend a gazillion dollars at the dentist for whitening unless you need the results to be immediate.  Hydrogen peroxide is the main ingredient in most whitening products anyway so get yourself a bleach pen for a buck, some peroxide for a buck, and in one week have noticeably nicer teeth.  I do not experience sore gums with the bleach pen and/or hydrogen peroxide, another big plus.</li>
            <li> It didnt make in between my teeth white which were the spots i concentratetd most. It was ok. At least the price was cheap so i didnt feel ripped off for trying it. Lol</li>
            <li> This does not work very well.  Basically, you get what you pay for.  It is thin, so doesn&#x27;t stay on the teeth long enough, and any whitening is taking an eternity.  For the price, I guess it&#x27;s OK, but my final decision is that it&#x27;s not effective. Perhaps it depends on the degree of stain on your teeth to begin with, but I have found that using Colgate Optic White twice a day is at least giving me a noticeable whitening, which is more than I can say for the pen.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after 1 tube of this, so I ordered another one just to get more of a result.  Also used this product with the cheap dental light.  4 stars because I would have rather had to just use 1 tube, but I think it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it because you have to keep your mouth open the whole time?!?</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy to say that this does not work at all</li>
            <li> They claim it works after only one use but didn&#x27;t see a difference yet.... I&#x27;ll try to be patient.</li>
            <li> not sure if  i will purchase this again . I don&#x27;t like that I have&lt;br /&gt;pack a lot of grease in my mouth</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work and tasted much much worse than the popular brand version. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again even though its much cheaper.</li>
            <li> One day, while I was smiling, my dad randomly said, \\&quot;you look like Ross from that one episode of friends.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great, convenient, quick, and cheap... Prefer way over the annoying strips.</li>
            <li> messy, needs more directions</li>
            <li> The product box says it is a gel, but it comes out as a liquid, and therefore does not stick to your teeth at all.  It is like trying to keep clear water on your teeth so it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Works good, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is you have to keep your lips off your teeth until it dries. That&#x27;s HARD lol. I have noticed a difference though. For the price, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I  bought this because I love to have beautiful teeth . Well it came in and within the first day and a half I saw amazing results . I recommend using it with toothpaste and baking soda .</li>
            <li> This product has a lovely taste to it, unfortunately, it did not do anything to whiten my teeth at all.</li>
            <li> A gift for my  granddaugther, she us sixteen,she is very happy with the product so far, would reorder item when needed</li>
            <li> I started using this as soon as I got it and am pleased to say my teeth are looking better, and since I drink coffee I was afraid they were a lost cause...not the case!  Another thing in its favor:  it doesn&#x27;t bother my gums, they don&#x27;t feel sensitive at all, I&#x27;m not claiming this will be the same for everybody, but I&#x27;ve had trouble with sensitivity before and was happy not to have to worry about it with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because it finished too soon, I was hoping it would have lasted longer, but that could have been this one pen, not all of them.</li>
            <li> I put this on before I brush my teeth and it works great.  For a night out I put it on and use the hair dryer to speed up the process.  It works just as well as anything I have tried before (strips, trays) and the price is great.  The pen is perfect for someone who needs more help on certain teeth, and it does not have as bad a taste as other products.</li>
            <li> The application process was easy and the form is convenient. It did not whiten as dramatically as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> I just used this, one time for 10 minutes and was left with chalky white blotches- VERY SCAREY!&lt;br /&gt;I have nice, well cared for teeth and I am miserable. Hoping to wake up and not see blotches, looks very trashy, exactly where this tube is going.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take the risk!</li>
            <li> I really like this product since it whitened my teeth which is pretty sensitive.  (I can&#x27;t use the trays.)  After two weeks I use it less often.</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 of these pens at my local dollar tree. I have found that if you use a whitening toothpaste when you brush, like colgates daily whitening, and this pen, it works quite nicely. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I have to sit with a big toothy grin while it dries. Doesn&#x27;t take long, but you look stupid. If you wait till it dries to close your mouth, the taste is almost gone. It&#x27;s like a peroxide gel pen. I love mine! I&#x27;ve seen a difference using it once a day for the past 4 weeks and wow can I see a difference. My teeth aren&#x27;t ghost white, but I drink coffee, sodas, eat berries... But the difference is very noticeable. If the dollar tree runs out, I&#x27;ll buy it on here.</li>
            <li> I had followed all instructions carefully, but it still cracked the enamel on my teeth. It also did an un-even whitening. it did whiten a bit though. It&#x27;s not worth the cracks though...</li>
            <li> I use this a long with an LED light to help whiten my teeth and it has been great! My teeth are noticeably whiter in just one week.</li>
            <li> Honestly this stuff is amazing. I use it once or twice a week. It says to cover gums with vaseline or some form of protection, but I don&#x27;t, it only tingles a little bit. Would repurchase. :)</li>
            <li> should have gotten another one for better result...looks ok....just need to continue using it...so far good job while I used it</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;optional\\&quot; tip for applying petroleum jelly to your lips before application should be \\&quot;highly recommended\\&quot;. This product, though it whitened my teeth a shade or two, caused several cuts on the inside of my lips. They are very sensitive now, and the cuts are pretty wide. They opened in ONE day, just last night, no slow gashing open. This may not happen with everyone, but I am personally irritated by this.</li>
            <li> I found this product at my local Dollar Tree for $1. I&#x27;ve seen a really subtle difference after the use of this product. I brush with Crest 3D whitening tooth paste before I use this product. It does make my gums a bit sensitive, but it&#x27;s not awful. The taste isn&#x27;t the best, but I&#x27;ve definitely had worse tasting whitening products. It&#x27;s decent for the price, and I will try to update this review when I am out of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: does it whiten? It&#x27;s subtle. It&#x27;s not \\&quot;instant\\&quot; like the package says. But for a dollar, it&#x27;s worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do want instant, immediate results I definitely recommend the Finishing Touch whitening pen, found both on Amazon and at Walgreen&#x27;s. Your teeth will be four shades whiter after one use for around $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0080F7ZA0/ref&#x3D;mp_s_a_1_5?qid&#x3D;1378305371&amp;sr&#x3D;8-5&amp;pi&#x3D;SL75&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This seems to work better than any thing else I have used I drink coffee so it helps take the stain away</li>
            <li> Instant results and no gooey mess which turned me off to using most whitening products.  Lasts a long time and recommended.</li>
            <li> used it in like a week. burned my guns. slightly lighted my teeth. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Invest in some crest whitening strips if you want real results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  been about a week or so since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I THINK its working. Nice product though.</li>
            <li> This product my relative bought and she said it really didn&#x27;t make to much of a difference. I guess you have to keep using it</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great Seller,Would Bid On Your Products&#x27; Again.&amp;#34;.Thanks&#x27;.Five Stars.AAA+++!!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible. This product did nothing for my teeth.  They Do not even look one shade whiter from when I started.</li>
            <li> It does what it states it does. Quick results, nice product, easy to use. And no mess. Thank you for the product.</li>
            <li> It does work , it came fast as hell. also it kinda sticks to your lips and evenafter the wait dry time it feels likeyour lips are going to rub it all off. but it is worth the insaine smileyou gotta have on your face for 10 mins to get this white i  got!!</li>
            <li> Better deal than I was able to get at the local drug store.  The results are what I expected.  You have to be very diligent with your usage of this item for it to work.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I was paying $40 something for the Crest White strips vivid and this product is just a few bucks and works JUST AS WELL.  It works so great that I bought one for my daughter/husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 12 year old had yellow teeth and although I bought her whitening toothpaste, I was delaying whitening products, since they are harsh on tweens.  I used this for a few days and had no sensitivity or stinging and my teeth were getting whitened, so I allowed her to use the product.  She is SO extremely please with the results.  It has only been 4 days and her teeth are MUCH whiter.  I was surprised with only 1X each day treatments how quickly and dramatically it worked.  Her teeth were pretty yellow, and now they are rather white.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is good but made my teeth sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I think a long time use of this product would make a difference.</li>
            <li> The description says 5 shades whiter or some other... no. But it does work great :) especially for the cute little price its at, I&#x27;m really happy. Just be sure, that if you&#x27;re impatient, and you twist the bottom too much, and you leave it on important things... *shivers* it leaks every where. But that&#x27;s my fault. Thanks Dr. Fresh!</li>
            <li> I applied it as the directions stated and it did not make my teeth whiter at all.  Also, when I put it on, my lips would often rub it off my teeth, so I would have to sit and hold my lips up for like 10 minutes while it dried.</li>
            <li> Why spend $$ to whiten the BACK of your teeth?!?!? Very easy to apply, goes just where you put it and ONLY where you put it.  I have several crowns and a partial, so using a tray wasted a lot of whitener.  I use a couple of cotton rolls to hold my gums away from my teeth and just paint it on the teeth that need it, window shop (on Amazon, of course) for ten minutes then rinse. Whitens as quickly and thoroughly as advertised.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was enthusiastic to use the product. However, I have not seen a difference in my teeth colour and I use this product twice daily after I have brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> product works. thanks</li>
            <li> Pretty decent, I noticed results!</li>
            <li> Pretty simple brush your teeth and put this on. It was two cents why not. I am seeing a little difference so far. I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Loved this, was surprised at how well it worked, and it did not cause irritation as other whitening products do. My teeth are two shades whiter.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me and it also finished quickly. So my advice is to look for another alternative to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad at all. It would make your BRIGHTER, but not so much as whiter. It brightness last for about a day but it can easily be stained if you don&#x27;t use it constantly when you drink coffee, soda, tea, etc.</li>
            <li> Just after a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the color of my teeth. My dentist says I have a &amp;#34;predisposition to yellowing teeth&amp;#34;, but he refused to whiten my teeth because the products he uses are just as effective as store bought remedies. So this was an excellent supplement to my everyday teeth cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li> I purchased my whitening pen from Dollar Tree and I&#x27;m using it as boost with Colgate Optic White Enamel White toothpaste and the complementary Optic White Whiteseal rinse. Adding the Dazzling White pen was the kick I needed. Four days in using the gel pen made a world of difference and although I&#x27;m not a smoker I didn&#x27;t realize how badly stained my teeth were. One trick I&#x27;m using to keep my lips off of my teeth and minimize the saliva nuisance is I fold a cotton pad in half and put it under my tongue and I roll additional cotton pads and put those between my gums and lips both upper and lower. It feels weird and looks even weirder but it works. It allows the gel to dry and do it&#x27;s thing. I love these pens I&#x27;m going to buy more today.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see much improvement. Waiting on this to dry is nerve-wracking. To each their own though, maybe I wasn&#x27;t patient enough. It did ship quickly and was nicely packaged,</li>
            <li> This product did work slightly, but after a certain point it did not whiten anymore, but for the price it was a good product</li>
            <li> It didnt works.  I used a whole week and i did not see results.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, got no results, super frustrated. Wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of trying to return, but still mad. I guess I&#x27;ll just swish some bleach or something (jk).</li>
            <li> I also happened across this at my local Dollar Tree, $1 not a large investment to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a bit of a difference the first use, and after a week of using it in the mornings after I brush, I can notice a great improvement.  For those upset that it didn&#x27;t give them 4 shades whiter, it doesn&#x27;t claim to, just up to.... which could be 1, 2 or 3!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience the bad taste some reviewers commented on, and I don&#x27;t know how anyone would say its hard to use!  You turn the end, it fills the brush and you paint it on!  Simple Simple.&lt;br /&gt;I am headed back to Dollar Tree to stock up!</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE PRODUCT. LITTLE TO NO RESULTS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. I did not see any results whatsoever. Maybe it will better for someone else, but it didn&#x27;t at all for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed the whitening. Wished I could have gotten a few more uses out of it though. Didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted. But it lasted couple months of me using it once a week or so. If you have stains and use it more often it might not last you as long. But it is very good for the price so I would recommend</li>
            <li> I hate it. I tired try so many different things to make this work. I put it on for the time then brush my teeth with baking soda........NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!! Only because it was so cheap why i didn&#x27;t ask for a refund. Happy for those who it work for. I think the advertisement is misleading saying 4 shades whiter in 1 week cause i tried and it didnt work</li>
            <li> This whitens my teeth instantly!</li>
            <li> This really made my teeth whiter and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used this product but did not notice a difference</li>
            <li> For the price it was good,I should of ordered more of them</li>
            <li> For $3, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t yellow, but hey aren&#x27;t pearl white either. I guess they would be average, or medium colored.. I&#x27;m not a smoker or anything, but I do drink colored beverages and stuff like that..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 or 4 days and probably used it 5 or 6 times so far. My teeth haven&#x27;t become immensely whiter, but it&#x27;s enough for me to notice when I look in the mirror. It&#x27;s just a tad whiter, which is what I needed since I didn&#x27;t have yellow teeth before, just a little whiter for back to school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how many uses you get out of this or how long it lasts, but mine still works after several applications.</li>
            <li> I can totally see a difference! I only doing my top teeth, and they are certainly whiter. For the price, I&#x27;m very impressed. I found that the best results came from holding my mouth open for the duration of a television show and layering the product. It looks splotchy at first, but that&#x27;s just the peroxide and it evens out. Holding my mouth open is a tad unpleasant but its preferable to spending oodles of money. If you&#x27;re uncomfortable about leaving your mouth open for extended periods of time (the product does say that you must for at least 10 minutes), then I&#x27;d consider something different. I tried it with an LED accelerator; it didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Works great! Got it on time love it.</li>
            <li> Although the packaging was intact, when I opened the packet, there was gel all over the pen and none inside the tube.  Truly a mess!</li>
            <li> Did not use this. Product warning on back</li>
            <li> works if not a smoker prob would white up teeth with continual use. quick care...peroxide...kills bacteria. does burn gum line but not bad. I personally wouldn&#x27;t use every day.</li>
            <li> It worked the first few ties, but later didn&#x27;t. I lightened, but totally not 4 shades, as the title claimed to be.</li>
            <li> Found this at the 99 Cent Store one day not expecting much and it became my all-time favorite products. When I found it on Amazon I was elated! This product is comparable to high-end whitening strips and trays. Great find.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this whitens teeth or not because when I received it all of the goo in it had leaked out inside the sealed package.</li>
            <li> It actually works pretty well! For me it began to work the first application- but everyone really started noticing a difference after the 3rd day! I like this product, its a great price and came quickly and works!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these just to see if it works, and guess what? It&#x27;s does, I&#x27;ve been using with the light for only one week and it works perfectly. The difference is  really noticeable. Definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li> I have never used anything to whiten my teeth, and I love coffee. This of course darkened my teeth, I have been using this for a few days now and already my teeth are much whiter.</li>
            <li> I needed this item and use the features it provides.  Quality, reliable and innovative item. Would recommend the purchase of this item.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the results would be faster but at least its cheap so can&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth time I have reviewed this.  It came very quickly, was a very fair price, and seems to work well--a very good deal</li>
            <li> My favorite thing I have ever purchased. I use before I go out and I can tell the difference and so can everyone else. I absolutely love love love this!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helped my teeth or not. Couldnt tell. But I found out they have this at the dollar stores for 1$!!!!… so ya</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay on very well... doesnt really make a big difference.. but what do you expect for something so cheap...</li>
            <li> I was really shocked at how white my teeth after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I thought because the price was so low, that it not work.&lt;br /&gt;This item works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this item to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> wouldnt say 4 shades in a week, but they are lighter after a few months. works, just not as fast as claimed.&lt;br /&gt;good price, and cheaper than dentist whitening them.</li>
            <li> Consider ordering a few because you surprisingly use a lot especially when you notice results. And its cheap! highly recommend</li>
            <li> I did buy it cheap so I thought results couldn&#x27;t be that great,but I can actually see the difference in my teeth. They are truly whiter.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work like it says. I used it for 2weeks and it didn&#x27;t whiten them at all. I Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is great for in-between whitenings. I also use it to freshen my breath, and right before I go to a meeting. Whiter teeth help make you look strong and confident! Good price, and love that it&#x27;s an add-on item.</li>
            <li> walking around the house grinning like a fool is difficult.</li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth gross feeling, and does very little whitening.</li>
            <li> I saw good reviews from these and for the price decided to try it out. I would use it and never really saw any results. The taste is awful. Sometimes buying cheap doesnt pay off...</li>
            <li> this product actually works!! it keeps the teeth nice and white. portable enough for quick touch ups! and the price is good too!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference and using the product is a bit of a pain due to the ten minutes you need to keep it on your teeth, but not let your lips touch them.  I have sat holding my lips away from my teeth, which is a real time waster.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it did help whiten my teeth.  But, I felt like I needed more of the product.  I was sorry that I only purchased&lt;br /&gt;one tube.  I read on the internet that a woman used two teeth whiteners on her teeth to brighten them.  So, I used this product in&lt;br /&gt;conjunction with another whitening product.  And, it worked.  My teeth are brighter.  I will continue purchasing these items in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Because if they can lighten my middle-aged teeth, they must work.</li>
            <li> Item was easy to use and worked within three days. It&#x27;s just like a pen, you write on your teeth wait than whip it off. Only down fault is remembering to do it everyday. Item was shipped fast and package well.</li>
            <li> i really like this pen. found it at dollar tree expecting nothing to come out of it. using it twice a day with a whitening toothpaste its only been a week and my teeth are 2 shades whiter i love it, and people think youre an overly happy person when youre really just smiling waiting for the gel to dry lol</li>
            <li> Purchased one tube and it lasted approx 2 months of daily usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1 I noticed a instant improvement, approx 1 shade difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days 2 and onwards, I didn&#x27;t notice a &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; improvement like I experienced on day one. However, looking back at photos, it was definitely still working when I thought it wasn&#x27;t, by comparing the day 2 photo to the day 7, then day 20 etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had sensitive teeth before and found the product to make my teeth sensitive to the cold for approx 1 hour after application. Nothing painful, just apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a warning label on the back that states that it could cause pain to gums and lips, however I did not experience this (nor did I take the advice on the warning label, which suggests coating gums with Vaseline)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube was easy to use, hold and store in my makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No mess or &amp;#34;setting up&amp;#34; time was great, as that&#x27;s usually the difference between me using a teeth whitener, or procrastinating and avoiding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of the gel kinda reminds me of plastic, or a bitter, cheap toothpaste. Nothing overly offensive but enough to look forward to rinsing your mouth out after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase another as soon as I can, and continue to use this daily as part of my teeth cleaning regime.</li>
            <li> just plain does not work - no change after one week of following instructions exactly - would not recommend for anyone</li>
            <li> Definitely saw a difference. I&#x27;d say my teeth were close to a shade whiter after using this for a week. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really, really love this product. I gave it a try and it whitened my teeth significantly (you have to use it everyday if you really want it to work).</li>
            <li> Ok whiten your teeth alittle. Need like 4 to completely whiten... good product though .I would buy again. Small though</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t work but I guess you get what you pay for it was just a dollar anyway but whatever</li>
            <li> this product will make your teeth whiten but the only down side is that you will need to endure the taste.</li>
            <li> I used this whitening pen once and my teeth, gums and lips became highly irritated.......and the painful breakout lasted a few days before healing.  It caused the corners of my mouth to crack. Sadly, I threw the product away.  I will only use Venus White Ultra Whitening Trays in the future, never again will I use Dazzling White.</li>
            <li> Wow! I can&#x27;t believe how well this worked! I am a heavy coffee and wine drinker. I swear that my teeth lost a shade the second I applied this! I guess that means my yellowness is mostly surface stains, so if you have surface stains, definitely this might quirk for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s hilarious that people deduct because they have to keep their mouths open. Buy a mouth guard; they&#x27;re cheap and you can buy them at the store. Everyone should have one; it makes it easier.</li>
            <li> Dis is a great product but i haven&#x27;t been usin it like a should be, so i really kant give a proper review, but as soon as i use it regularly, i will give anotha review.</li>
            <li> Doesnt whiten like it says it does but i guess theres a little bit of change. Mostly a waste of money but if it works for you then hey congrats. I just wouldnt buy it again</li>
            <li> Not that great of a product. It&#x27;s runny and doesn&#x27;t help your teeth at all. It&#x27;s a messy product. Do not recommend</li>
            <li> Works good, just takes a couple of applications to see the effect.</li>
            <li> I love dazzling white.  It is easy to use and convenient. It works great. made my teeth whiter in a week. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> So far... I like that you can paint it on and I see some change. I am going to continue to use to even the tone of my teeth. Thanks. I like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for a week now and I can&#x27;t really tell a difference. I have been following instructions and even looked for more information on their website but sadly I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 days now. It does have a nasty taste but I haven&#x27;t found a product like this that doesn&#x27;t. It was very cheep as I bought it at the dollar tree but for what it is I think it&#x27;s doing a great job. I leave on for 10 minutes once a day and I already tell a difference. I use Mouthwash after 10 minutes to help get all of the solution off of my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen people complain because it burnt their lips/gums but there is a warning on the back that says that could happen. So those that are mad about it shouldn&#x27;t be. Sometimes our bodies react different to different products.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, just started to use them and will know if gel is good later.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brighteners that I prefer. It is easy to apply</li>
            <li> Certainly does do as it says. Don&#x27;t expect instant results as it gradually reduces the yellowness of your teeth. But my teeth did appear less yellow and more white after one use. After more uses from it my teeth are looking far better than they did to begin with.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these pens and on delivery the one whitening pen was broken. I couldn&#x27;t even use it. It was cracked and all of the whitening gel was spilled into the packaging. The other pen I used and after two weeks didn&#x27;t really see results. I will just stick with my Crest White strips.</li>
