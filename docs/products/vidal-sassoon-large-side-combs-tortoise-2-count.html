            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find these 15 teeth hair combs as they are shorter in the store.  </li>

            <li>, I had to have more.  </li>
            <li>Love these hair combs.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I found them, where else,at Amazon.com</li>
            <li>They arrived in good shape and they were exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>they keep breaking off, even with easy use in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plastic has no give and these break easily.</li>
            <li>Wide with a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>The color is fine and they are not flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend them for fine hair as well.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length medium to fine thickness wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I think I was having a reaction on my scalp to cheap metal hair combs, etc.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the price and the look.</li>
            <li>Well, those were the good old days.</li>
            <li>Maybe some lady can use them so I&#x27;ll pass them on to Good Will on my next trip over there.</li>
            <li>wish they were a little more flexible but were a good price.  </li>
            <li>This is a strong yet comfy large size comb.</li>
            <li>These combs are very brittle and smooth, and fall right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I wish they were just a little more heavy-duty, as they feel very light</li>
            <li>Wish they had the older kind of combs that were more flexible and less brittle.</li>
            <li>The price for the Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s were very reasonable and I would recommend buying these.</li>
            <li>These hold my hair back much better.</li>
            <li>These are so much better than the ones I have found in local stores.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, long hair which I wear up.  </li>
            <li>These are very nice combs for my thick, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>These combs aren&#x27;t very large, really.  </li>
            <li>They are nice and thick and comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>I had looked and looked for these long comba and was so pleased to find them on your site.</li>
            <li>As advertised they are large.</li>
            <li>Ordered these on large, but when packaged arrived it was medium (said so on the packet).&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>Just can&#x27;t find the large sizes in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider these the large size.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy, not as large as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to say.</li>
            <li>They lasted much longer.</li>
            <li>They are also very plastic-y and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I really like them</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve just sucked it up and spent more money to get the Grip-tuth combs I have heard rave reviews about.</li>
            <li>But, they didn&#x27;t cost much, so, I&#x27;ll keep them.</li>
            <li>Hard plastic, pokey, itchy, doesn&#x27;t go into the hair easy or come out easy.  </li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t have as much give in them as my older set.</li>
            <li>its cost was less than $3 and sending it back would most likely cost me more time and money than bothered I decided to keep the combs.</li>
            <li>Remember these combs from when I was little girl and still love them.  </li>
            <li>Looks trashy because it can&#x27;t be used properly and is kind of a waste.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t give them a 5th star since they&#x27;re not very flexible and aren&#x27;t as comfortable as my old ones.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for undos or a half up half down look.</li>
            <li>I ordered these last summer during hot humid days when I can&#x27;t do anything with my hair.</li>
            <li>These are twice as large as any I have seen sold in multiple packs.</li>
            <li>In all honesty, I have bought side combs at the 99 cent only store that lasted considerably longer than these ones (which cost 3 times as much).</li>
            <li>I gave these as a gift and as far as I know they have had no issues with them.</li>
            <li>If I put too much hair back with this one, my head seems to hurt.</li>
            <li>The comb points are pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re decent little combs, but I guess large is relative</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and for my thin hair it is the only comb with enough teeth to work with my hair.</li>
            <li>Started breaking the first time I used in my thick, curly natural hair.</li>
            <li>pretty and grab a small amount of hair and hold it or pull up and back a large piece and still holds tight.</li>

            <li> and I fear they will not last long.</li>
            <li> For me, this comb was too long and had not enough curve to the body.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting more flexibility in the plastic so that they would not break in a hot second, and unfortunately they turned out to be worse than I thought possible.</li>
            <li> The combs are flimsy indeed with sharp points that can hurt your scalp if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why are heavy-duty, large combs so hard to find?</li>
            <li> This size hair comb has became very difficult if not impossible for me to find in any of the local stores where I live.  </li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re only like 3 inches wide)</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and stay in place all day long.</li>
            <li> I used to have some Vidal Sassoon combs that had a thin profile, so the comb was not prominently visible in your hair; they were also very flexible and strong for my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Still tried to use for a while, but one day the missing tooth part snarled in my hair and was a major pain to untangle.</li>
            <li> I wore them for the first time today and 2 of the teeth on one of the combs have already broken off.</li>
            <li> I am an average height and have even a slightly above average hat size.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  Just as I thought, these combs didn&#x27;t last a few weeks....</li>
            <li> no really recommend it.</li>
            <li> These combs are as wide as I wanted them to be.  </li>
            <li> Glad I finally found these - impossible to find in the stores anymore!  </li>
            <li> I have other combs that are made of softer plastic and they stay in.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why review has to be this long.</li>
            <li> May cost less but trust me ...</li>
            <li> Wish they were a little sturdier like they used to make years ago.</li>
            <li> Get Goody instead, these are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> money wasted.</li>
            <li> I just order these because I misplaced on of my others.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> I have very hard to manage hair, not too long.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> fact, it is too small for</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find them.</li>
            <li> My problem is they won&#x27;t stay in my hair and that may be because I do not have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Has some in the past but had been unable to find in reent years.  </li>
            <li> though a bit thin.</li>
            <li> These will need bobby pins inserted behind them to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> Quite a disappointment.</li>
            <li> However, for it to stay in place it is very difficult.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible quality.</li>

            <li> Works, but not too sturdy.</li>
            <li> The combs are nice. The color is fine and they are not flimsy.  My problem is they won&#x27;t stay in my hair and that may be because I do not have thick hair.  Maybe some lady can use them so I&#x27;ll pass them on to Good Will on my next trip over there.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy, not as large as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! PERFECT FOR MOHAWK STYLES!! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> wish they were a little more flexible but were a good price.  got what i paid for.  would buy again.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say. They are the perfect size for putting your hair up and are no longer available in stores!</li>
            <li> These are twice as large as any I have seen sold in multiple packs. As advertised they are large. Nice size for an up-do or to hold a lot of hair. Sturdy too. color is attractive.</li>
            <li> Longer than most which I love and sturdy.  Would recommend them for fine hair as well.  Good price as well.</li>
            <li> Only lasted a couple of days before the teeth started breaking out. Still tried to use for a while, but one day the missing tooth part snarled in my hair and was a major pain to untangle. Wish they had the older kind of combs that were more flexible and less brittle. They lasted much longer.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally found these - impossible to find in the stores anymore!  Why???  I better stock up in case they are going out of production!</li>
            <li> Been looking for larger combs in the stores, but never found them.  So happy I did and they are very secure in my medium weight hair.</li>
            <li> I scoured Amazon to try to find larger hair combs, and these were about the largest I could find. I wish they were just a little more heavy-duty, as they feel very light and I fear they will not last long. I would be happy to pay more for a heavier duty comb, but am grateful to have found these. I wish they came in 4\\&quot; size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Just as I thought, these combs didn&#x27;t last a few weeks....they keep breaking off, even with easy use in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are heavy-duty, large combs so hard to find?</li>
            <li> I was looking for some combs to do a french twist with, but these are just regular sized. They&#x27;re decent little combs, but I guess large is relative (they&#x27;re only like 3 inches wide)</li>
            <li> Hard plastic, pokey, itchy, doesn&#x27;t go into the hair easy or come out easy.  Get Goody instead, these are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, long hair which I wear up.  These combs work wonderfully keeping my hair in place. Has some in the past but had been unable to find in reent years.  Ordered two sets.  Love them</li>
            <li> Started breaking the first time I used in my thick, curly natural hair. May cost less but trust me ... money wasted.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find these 15 teeth hair combs as they are shorter in the store.  These hold my hair back much better.</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift and as far as I know they have had no issues with them. They arrived in good shape and they were exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Had these before.  They last for years.</li>
            <li> I have medium length medium to fine thickness wavy hair.  I am an average height and have even a slightly above average hat size.  For me, this comb was too long and had not enough curve to the body.  It only catches about 70% of my hair.  Looks trashy because it can&#x27;t be used properly and is kind of a waste.</li>
            <li> Great and arrived fast</li>
            <li> I think I was having a reaction on my scalp to cheap metal hair combs, etc., so I have been searching for plastic alternatives. If I put too much hair back with this one, my head seems to hurt. I have to adjust all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set of these combs in the spring and I LOVED them, I had to have more.  This newest order came and while it claims to be the same item, it is not.  You can tell by comparing them that they are not the same.  These combs do not grip my hair at all.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These combs aren&#x27;t very large, really.  They are also very plastic-y and flimsy.  The comb points are pretty sharp.  I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used to have some Vidal Sassoon combs that had a thin profile, so the comb was not prominently visible in your hair; they were also very flexible and strong for my thick, wavy hair. They never broke, just got lost. I was trying to replace them with these combs, but they arrived already with a couple teeth already broken-off.</li>
            <li> Remember these combs from when I was little girl and still love them.  Not sure why review has to be this long.</li>
            <li> I ordered these last summer during hot humid days when I can&#x27;t do anything with my hair. Can&#x27;t beat the. For the price. I just order these because I misplaced on of my others. Good deal!</li>
            <li> I had looked and looked for these long comba and was so pleased to find them on your site. Love them!!!</li>
            <li> The plastic has no give and these break easily.</li>
            <li> This is a strong yet comfy large size comb. Wonderful for undos or a half up half down look. Enjoy the price and the look.</li>
            <li> Ordered these on large, but when packaged arrived it was medium (said so on the packet).&lt;br /&gt;Since its cost was less than $3 and sending it back would most likely cost me more time and money than bothered I decided to keep the combs. The combs are flimsy indeed with sharp points that can hurt your scalp if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Love these hair combs. Just can&#x27;t find the large sizes in stores anymore. Wish they were a little sturdier like they used to make years ago. Well, those were the good old days. They work like a charm and my hair does not fall out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider these the large size. Maybe medium. The ya re the same size as all the ones hanging at the stores. Not what I wanted</li>
            <li> These are very nice combs for my thick, shoulder length hair. They are sturdy and stay in place all day long. They work well for my french twist hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I could not use these.  They are not &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; enough for my hair.  Nice quality combs though a bit thin.</li>
            <li> pretty and grab a small amount of hair and hold it or pull up and back a large piece and still holds tight.</li>
            <li> I order the side combs, because I need it.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it is too small for me.&lt;br /&gt;But work okay.&lt;br /&gt;Just no really recommend it.</li>
            <li> These combs are as wide as I wanted them to be.  They hold my hair without traumatizing my scalp.  They are the correct weight and are just what I needed.</li>
            <li> These are perfect.  It&#x27;s hard to find them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these combs- for some reason they stopped carrying them in my local stores. It&#x27;s great to have them now. Very easy to use and for my thin hair it is the only comb with enough teeth to work with my hair.</li>
            <li> Wide with a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> These are so much better than the ones I have found in local stores. They are stronger, and a very nice size. I stocked up on them and gave a pair to my sister, as well.</li>
            <li> These combs are very brittle and smooth, and fall right out of my hair.  I have other combs that are made of softer plastic and they stay in.  These will need bobby pins inserted behind them to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> I have very hard to manage hair, not too long. However, for it to stay in place it is very difficult. This side combs do the job. I really like them, I&#x27;m glad I found them, where else,at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Quite a disappointment. I was expecting more flexibility in the plastic so that they would not break in a hot second, and unfortunately they turned out to be worse than I thought possible. In all honesty, I have bought side combs at the 99 cent only store that lasted considerably longer than these ones (which cost 3 times as much). I wore them for the first time today and 2 of the teeth on one of the combs have already broken off. And they somehow broke while just sitting in my hair....I wasn&#x27;t messing with them at all...they just broke off and fell off onto the floor. Absolutely terrible quality. I should&#x27;ve just sucked it up and spent more money to get the Grip-tuth combs I have heard rave reviews about. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting.  I thought they would be longer.  But, they didn&#x27;t cost much, so, I&#x27;ll keep them.</li>
            <li> I like these in that they hold the hair back from my face but they didn&#x27;t have as much give in them as my older set. They are acceptable and I do use them but I can&#x27;t give them a 5th star since they&#x27;re not very flexible and aren&#x27;t as comfortable as my old ones.</li>
            <li> This size hair comb has became very difficult if not impossible for me to find in any of the local stores where I live.  My order was delivered very promptly, and I think the quality of these combs are very good.  They are nice and thick and comfortable to wear.  The last brand I purchased was Goody and they were quite a bit thinner and didn&#x27;t hold my hair as well.  The price for the Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s were very reasonable and I would recommend buying these.</li>
