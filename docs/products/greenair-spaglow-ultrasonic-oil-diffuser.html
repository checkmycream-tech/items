            <li>, that was amazing!</li>
            <li>It works great and gives a glow that is not to bright to leave on when sleeping.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li>I loved this diffuser when I got it - it&#x27;s a beautiful diffuser and is more a piece of art instead of a piece of machinery.</li>
            <li>it is beautiful and decorative, without the bulky plastic look many diffusers have, and very strong.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This one fits the bill for a lower cost diffuser that looks nice in any environment.</li>
            <li>I liked the aesthetic of it, which is one of the reasons why I purchased</li>
            <li>Just the warm glow of lights rotating (or not, depending on your preference).</li>
            <li>The rotating colors add a nice ambiance.</li>
            <li>The color changing feature is nice and they are aesthetically pleasing to look at, however, I will be looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li>It is easy to load, has a nice mist and fills the room with pleasant odors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it looks good in every room</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Promptly returned, amazon is great at making things right.</li>
            <li>This diffuser looks nice, is easy to use and lasts about 6 hours.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I think the best part is how quiet it is.</li>
            <li>and it ruined the top of my dresser today even though I had a towel underneath.</li>
            <li>sure you use a plate under it.</li>
            <li>Works great.probably will be prchasing more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the changing colors and that you can stop the lights on one of the colors of your choice.</li>
            <li>Inside the dome there is a plastic piece connected to the top hole of the glass dome.</li>
            <li>However, this is more than condensation.</li>
            <li>Worked just as advertised and my wife really enjoyed the gift.  </li>
            <li>I love everything else</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it so far!</li>
            <li>And I love that You can turn off the light if you choose or you can stop at any preferred color.</li>
            <li>I did receive 2 EO with the diffuser (Lavender and Eucalyptus), but have been using my own right now.</li>
            <li>I clean it obsessively to get it to work better, and nothing works.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can choose what color of light I can leave it set on and that it is a nice, soft color.</li>
            <li>I have ordered another Brand to be able to turn light off for sleep as I need complete darkness to sleep, it works very well and puts out a good mist, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anybody who wants a very decent diffuser for a pretty fair price!</li>
            <li>The diffuser is very pretty and easy to assemble/use.  </li>
            <li>I love that the light rotates through the colors and if you like a certain color, you can keep it on that one color.</li>
            <li>I like it other than it allows water to collect on the surface you set it on from the mist, be sure to put something under it, if you like a bright light you will like this.</li>
            <li>I recently became interested in aromatherapy and wanted to purchase a beautiful diffuser that works.</li>
            <li>It seems to diffuse just the right amount!</li>
            <li>I love the simple yet elegant design.</li>
            <li>I also think that the option not to use the light is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it: the elegant shape, the &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; to press on the top, how beautiful the colors are but one can also turn off the colors if one wants to, how completely quiet it is, how it uses cool air and how long it diffuses the essential oils (about 5-6 hours).</li>
            <li>The first one I bought at Whole Foods and it cost about $20 more than Amazon.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is sooo pretty!</li>
            <li>Thus far, I love it.</li>
            <li>Lights can be turned off if you want, but what&#x27;s the fun of that?</li>
            <li>Mist is good, not intense.</li>
            <li>Its effectiveness on oil distribution is superior than other oil diffusers I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li>Can sometimes spill water if not on right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, the lights work.  </li>
            <li>And they all thanked me later :).&lt;br /&gt;Sets</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and it came with two oils.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing another one for myself ;)</li>
            <li>I love my diffuser so much that I purchased a second one for my mother.</li>
            <li>I make sure to dry out the condensation between uses and haven&#x27;t had any problems since.</li>
            <li>A huge plus for me was that I ordered it on an earlier Friday afternoon with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>it is a real standout piece.</li>
            <li>Aesthetically very pleasing to the eye.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks and glows, one thing I will say is it doesn&#x27;t produce as much vapor as the other spa glow</li>
            <li>I originally purchased for the bedroom and ended up buying a second for the living room.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this little diffuser.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is so pretty, it&#x27;s hard not to love.</li>
            <li>I will be finding a new diffuser without all the design flaws because of this.</li>
            <li>I like the glass dome, seems classy verses the majority of plastic units out there.</li>
            <li>I did have a technical issue with one of the units after a month of use, but the company&#x27;s customer service was very responsive.</li>
            <li>aside from the fact that, even though I start them at the same time every night, my one daughter&#x27;s diffuser turns itself off before I go to bed while the other daughter&#x27;s is still on when I wake up the next morning, they leak more often than not.</li>
            <li>I have only had it for a little over a day, but have ran 3 different cycles and have enjoyed every minute.</li>
            <li>I have only used my diffuser about three times so far, so I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of the unit.</li>
            <li>and it barely releases mist.  </li>
            <li>This unit does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I have only had it a week so far</li>
            <li>Should have gone with the lotus diffuser and just spent the extra money in the first place.</li>
            <li>I previously got the same brand but different model for a Christmas gift and it worked really well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I previously got the same brand but different model for a Christmas gift and it worked really well</li>
            <li> I do constantly run them, and may not give them time to dry out, maybe the problem?</li>
            <li> the controls are concealed - minor flaws in the glass globe but they do not interfere with operation</li>
            <li> It is likely that this problem was due to my error.</li>
            <li> On a single fill, it lasts a very long time and diffuses well.  </li>
            <li> a cool mood and im obsessed with glass</li>
            <li> Oh, and the button is located on the bottom, but you simply have to push down on the globe with your palm and it clicks!</li>
            <li> Also, the glass bulb is basically a hollow partial sphere that fits around a cup inside.</li>
            <li> , so I expected this one would work too.  </li>
            <li> In looking at other reviews, I see comments about condensation, which I would expect given the spherical shape of the diffuser.</li>
            <li> So when the globe is placed on the base that holds the water this plastic cover rests on the top of the water/oil reservoir and funnels the mist up and out the hole.</li>
            <li> I make sure that it is level and that the sphere is on the base and yet, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li> Tried to make it a little colder, tried it a little warmer.  </li>
            <li> I think the problem is in the round shape.</li>
            <li> pretty aesthetic means the push button is hidden on the base of the unit; you have to pick it up and insert a finger underneath to turn it on and off or to stop it on a desired color- without spilling it.</li>
            <li> Sadly to say, I want to love this diffuser but am very frustrated at the inconsistencies.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t cause leaking during use as long as the globe is placed on the base properly, but it can drip when you remove and replace the globe.</li>
            <li> You can hardly tell it is there.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before I bought it and only found one that was bad.  </li>
            <li> BUT the leaking is a big problem :(</li>
            <li> The condensation collects on the inner surface and leaks out the perimeter of the base almost every time I use it</li>
            <li> Artrived used with all tape seals previously cut, smelled like awful menthol oil from previous owner and the glass was broken.</li>
            <li> It does occasionally leak water around the base like others mentioned, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> I read the bad review, but just hoped I would get one that worked well.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this diffuser so I bought another one for my second floor bedroom.  Works perfectly. So glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have only used my diffuser about three times so far, so I can&#x27;t comment on the longevity of the unit. Thus far, I love it. No leaks, the on/off and color stay switch works well and it stays on. It seems to diffuse just the right amount!</li>
            <li> I recently became interested in aromatherapy and wanted to purchase a beautiful diffuser that works. This one fits the bill for a lower cost diffuser that looks nice in any environment. I love the simple yet elegant design. I have only had it for a little over a day, but have ran 3 different cycles and have enjoyed every minute. A huge plus for me was that I ordered it on an earlier Friday afternoon with Amazon Prime and I received it the next day, that was amazing! It shipped from Redlands, CA and came to me in San Diego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update review if anything should change. I did receive 2 EO with the diffuser (Lavender and Eucalyptus), but have been using my own right now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little diffuser. It&#x27;s easy to use and it looks good in every room (I keep mine in my yoga room). I love that the light rotates through the colors and if you like a certain color, you can keep it on that one color. I also think that the option not to use the light is pretty cool too. I think the best part is how quiet it is. You can hardly tell it is there. I recommend this product to anybody who wants a very decent diffuser for a pretty fair price!</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser so much that I purchased a second one for my mother. The blown glass is a beautiful feature. And I love that You can turn off the light if you choose or you can stop at any preferred color. Everyone comments about my diffuser it is a real standout piece.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser when I got it - it&#x27;s a beautiful diffuser and is more a piece of art instead of a piece of machinery. I liked the aesthetic of it, which is one of the reasons why I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pretty aesthetic means the push button is hidden on the base of the unit; you have to pick it up and insert a finger underneath to turn it on and off or to stop it on a desired color- without spilling it. Also, the glass bulb is basically a hollow partial sphere that fits around a cup inside. The condensation collects on the inner surface and leaks out the perimeter of the base almost every time I use it and it ruined the top of my dresser today even though I had a towel underneath. I will be finding a new diffuser without all the design flaws because of this.</li>
            <li> It is easy to load, has a nice mist and fills the room with pleasant odors. It is the prettiest diffuser I have found!</li>
            <li> I received the product as described in a timely manner. It works great and gives a glow that is not to bright to leave on when sleeping.  I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, the lights work.  Besides that it leaks water (I tried filling it below the fill line, then lower.  Used lukewarm spring water. Tried to make it a little colder, tried it a little warmer.  It always leaks.) and it barely releases mist.  I clean it obsessively to get it to work better, and nothing works.  I read reviews before I bought it and only found one that was bad.  I read the bad review, but just hoped I would get one that worked well.  I previously got the same brand but different model for a Christmas gift and it worked really well, so I expected this one would work too.  Should have gone with the lotus diffuser and just spent the extra money in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it so far! Very easy to use and it&#x27;s very quiet. I also like that it automatically shuts off once the water is out. It does occasionally leak water around the base like others mentioned, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> Aesthetically very pleasing to the eye. Can sometimes spill water if not on right so&lt;br /&gt;make sure you use a plate under it.</li>
            <li> I have recommended to my buddies for a girlfriend gift.  And they all thanked me later :).&lt;br /&gt;Sets a cool mood and im obsessed with glass so that&#x27;s A plus for me.  Its effectiveness on oil distribution is superior than other oil diffusers I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li> Artrived used with all tape seals previously cut, smelled like awful menthol oil from previous owner and the glass was broken.Promptly returned, amazon is great at making things right.</li>
            <li> water leaks out I have to keep towel under it when running. great colors!</li>
            <li> I love the way it looks and glows, one thing I will say is it doesn&#x27;t produce as much vapor as the other spa glow I used I forget the name. It makes up for it by producing vapor a lot longer though maybe 5 hours?</li>
            <li> Works great.probably will be prchasing more.</li>
            <li> I just received my second spa glow diffuser. The first one I bought at Whole Foods and it cost about $20 more than Amazon. I could have returned it, but don&#x27;t want to be without this wonderful diffuser for even one day. I love everything about it: the elegant shape, the &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; to press on the top, how beautiful the colors are but one can also turn off the colors if one wants to, how completely quiet it is, how it uses cool air and how long it diffuses the essential oils (about 5-6 hours).</li>
            <li> I like it other than it allows water to collect on the surface you set it on from the mist, be sure to put something under it, if you like a bright light you will like this. I have ordered another Brand to be able to turn light off for sleep as I need complete darkness to sleep, it works very well and puts out a good mist, easy to use. I will use this in my living area in the daylight hours.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is very pretty and easy to assemble/use.  The only problem I had after just one use is that water leaked and pooled on my wooden table, causing damage.  It is likely that this problem was due to my error.</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it every day! Easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is sooo pretty! You don&#x27;t see any controls at all. Just the warm glow of lights rotating (or not, depending on your preference). My kids are just drawn to it. Score! Oh, and the button is located on the bottom, but you simply have to push down on the globe with your palm and it clicks! Lights can be turned off if you want, but what&#x27;s the fun of that?</li>
            <li> Love it! On a single fill, it lasts a very long time and diffuses well.  I love that I can choose what color of light I can leave it set on and that it is a nice, soft color.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and it came with two oils.</li>
            <li> So beautiful.  Gives off a lot of steam, scent.</li>
            <li> I love the changing colors and that you can stop the lights on one of the colors of your choice. Mist is good, not intense. I have not timed the length of time that it runs yet. I like the glass dome, seems classy verses the majority of plastic units out there. Inside the dome there is a plastic piece connected to the top hole of the glass dome. So when the globe is placed on the base that holds the water this plastic cover rests on the top of the water/oil reservoir and funnels the mist up and out the hole. This is where water droplets collect and what can cause dripping during refilling. I believe this is going to happen with any unit, I recently purchased a Quooz Lull and water collects and drips from its cover as well. I have watched videos on Youtube prior to purchasing, in one video it is said that this unit comes with two bottles of essential oils, mine did not. It appears that there may have been a spillage in the packaging, but no oils were included. This unit does what it&#x27;s supposed to, I have only had it a week so far so if anything changes, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Bought as a gift! Will be purchasing another one for myself ;) Nice size and wonderful colors!</li>
            <li> This diffuser looks nice, is easy to use and lasts about 6 hours. The rotating colors add a nice ambiance. I originally purchased for the bedroom and ended up buying a second for the living room. I did have a technical issue with one of the units after a month of use, but the company&#x27;s customer service was very responsive. Some reviewers mention problems with leaking...I have noticed that condensation can collect inside the globe. This doesn&#x27;t cause leaking during use as long as the globe is placed on the base properly, but it can drip when you remove and replace the globe. I make sure to dry out the condensation between uses and haven&#x27;t had any problems since.</li>
            <li> Sadly to say, I want to love this diffuser but am very frustrated at the inconsistencies. I have two of them, one for each one of my daughters, and aside from the fact that, even though I start them at the same time every night, my one daughter&#x27;s diffuser turns itself off before I go to bed while the other daughter&#x27;s is still on when I wake up the next morning, they leak more often than not. In looking at other reviews, I see comments about condensation, which I would expect given the spherical shape of the diffuser. However, this is more than condensation. It&#x27;s as though the entire water supply comes out the bottom. I make sure that it is level and that the sphere is on the base and yet, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. Enough that I have to have them sitting on a plate for fear of ruining their dressers. The color changing feature is nice and they are aesthetically pleasing to look at, however, I will be looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s functional and beautiful</li>
            <li> Simple to use - like the fact the controls are concealed - minor flaws in the glass globe but they do not interfere with operation</li>
            <li> I left a message for someone to get a hold of me. This diffuser doesn&#x27;t work &amp; I would like it replaced. Thank You</li>
            <li> Worked just as advertised and my wife really enjoyed the gift.  She likes how the scents spread out and the lighting effects.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is so pretty, it&#x27;s hard not to love. I think the problem is in the round shape. It condensates on the inside of the globe and leaks onto surfaces. (I have 2, and the problem happens with both.) I do constantly run them, and may not give them time to dry out, maybe the problem? I keep a washcloth under them now. I love everything else about it- it is beautiful and decorative, without the bulky plastic look many diffusers have, and very strong. BUT the leaking is a big problem :(</li>
