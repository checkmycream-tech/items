            <li>I have very fine hair and while I can style it easily, leave-in conditioners can weigh my hair down</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast.  </li>

            <li> I used it without conditioning my hair in the shower (since this product is supposed to replace that step) and it does work okay as far as detangling, smoothing, and imparting a bit of shine without weighing hair down, but I found that I had to use quite a few sprays to cover my medium length hair and to get the softness I want, especially because my hair is colored and the ends tend to be a bit rough.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great product.  Leaves my hair soft and shiny.  Every time I use it, people comment on my hair.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell, leaves my hair feeling soft and silky and blowing in the wind. Always love this product and hopefully always will. (hair type: medium to thick, beyond shoulder length; black girl &#x3D;])</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this product works great for me.  I use this product the most and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> After searching through reviews, I found this one had pretty favorable reviews for people with fine/thin hair, so I gave it a go.

All in all, the performance of this leave in conditioner didn&#x27;t blow my socks off enough to justify what would be a monthly purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I found that if you don&#x27;t use shampoos that are very drying in the first place, this product works much better and you will not have to use as much. Switch to sulfate free and you will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a leave in spray for my very tangly hair - this isn&#x27;t it! It smells nice but as for smoothing out tangles, not so much-I guess I will keep looking!</li>
            <li> I use KMS Silk Sheen Leave-In Conditioner Spray everyday and it helps to make my hair softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product really works great and it&#x27;s reasonably priced, It takes the tangles right out of my hair and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down. Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Detangles instantly and smells pleasant. Not oily and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Excellent leave in conditioner!</li>
            <li> Great product, use it after every shampoo. Only brand that comes in easy to use spray. Cant live without it</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and flies all around when I brush it in the winter.  This product has solved this problem for me.  I use it all of the time.</li>
            <li> This is used at my house after we get after the pool and it works great as a leave in conditioner and it&#x27;s the best detangler you will ever find.,  It is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have full, straight, dry hair and I was hoping this would be my miracle cure. I have been trying to find something that will soften and condition and moisturize and (bonus) help to eliminate static. Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does detangle well but it leaves my hair slightly oily. So, I&#x27;ve been spritzing it on the ends (as opposed to all over) but it&#x27;s still not my favorite -- it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34; I will use it up but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I swim several days a week therefore I wash my hair frequently.  I find this product keeps my hair tangle free, soft and easy to manage.  Delivery was very fast.  I will order from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Product creates a different look and feel depending on how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft and tangle, frizz free.</li>
            <li> Already ordered more...</li>
            <li> This product goes in easy, lasts a long time and makes my hair smooth and soft. I&#x27;ve noticed that when I use this product it takes less time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite KMS spray conditioners!  I am always looking for good deals on this brand and this one was a good deal!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and while I can style it easily, leave-in conditioners can weigh my hair down so it looks flat.  I get the conditioning I need without the weight.  I can style without fly-away hair and maintain the professional,  yet feminine business look I like.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it a lot for a few years.  It is light in my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I even use it in my toddler&#x27;s hair too</li>
            <li> Great leave-in conditioner and de-tangler.  Be careful not to use too much or it will leave hair oily.  Otherwise works great and helps to detangle just washed hair.</li>
