            <li>I have been looking for a good exfoliate for awhile now.</li>
            <li>It felt really good rubbing it into my skin.</li>
            <li>I got a good massage in and with it and there was not burning.</li>
            <li>I have heard that sea salt scrubs are good for this</li>
            <li>It did not feel good upon my skin or did it feel like it was exfoliating my skin in any way.</li>
            <li>But I think it was a good thing..</li>
            <li>I see works good</li>
            <li>Very fine scrub!</li>
            <li>There is no question that this is a very strong scrub that will very effectively exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>been using it every night for about a week and am very, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this sea salts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for the price and even more because it works.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>However, after reading the instructions on how to use this......I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I have been using the sea salt for 4 nights now and I am absolutely in love!</li>
            <li>I use them every day in the shower and love them!</li>
            <li>love the way my skin feels after I have exfoliated it!</li>
            <li>so glad this product works!</li>
            <li>I love adovia products and this one is no exception!</li>
            <li>In the end, it did leave my skin feeling good, but I could have just as easily used the sea salt from my kitchen!</li>
            <li>That was an amazing feels since I never used salts before.</li>
            <li>This has been absolutely amazing for my skin.</li>
            <li>Again, my face felt amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li>Adovia has AMAZING products.</li>
            <li>and you are truly on the way to amazing</li>
            <li>Which is totally amazing.</li>

            <li>Fast Shipping and great follow-up service!</li>
            <li>I received this to test and give my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I have already seen a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>I mix this with is a foam cleaner and warm water on my face before scrubbing it into my skin.</li>
            <li>got this from Adovia at a promotional price in order to test it, and this is my honest opinion after using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>Thanks for another wonderful product Adovia!</li>
            <li>’s own.</li>
            <li>received a sample of this product for review purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>and I really liked that too.</li>
            <li>Although I did receive this product to review all of these opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Rinse off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I also feel that honest and informative reviews improve a product by providing insight to the company.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I was sent the item in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I was sent the item in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>All the opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li>All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>It did not hurt my skin and it gave me nice, smoothe skin where I used it.</li>
            <li>The tub is 12.3 oz, a really nice size for the price ($19)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I dipped my hands in warm water, and sprinkled some of the salts on my hand, and massaged.</li>
            <li>However, the opinions expressed are my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li>The salts are a nice exfoliator without micro beads clogging up our environment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I got this at a discounted price for my honest review*</li>
            <li>But the opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li>well i wanted to see these salts, these salts are baby fine salts like you would use in the amazing lip scrubs or body buffing salts in fancy spas and resorts!</li>
            <li>you are looking for the best exfoliating mineral salt , then I highly recommend this Adovia salt to try out.</li>
            <li>Afterward my face felt smooth and looked remarkably brighter just as the product claimed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the face wash, I use my normal L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love Adovia products and was so happy I received a sample free to try and do this review for my blog youtube and amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with the company as I have received 2 emails from them explaining the product and how it was developed.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really one for making reviews of products unless it brings a superb happiness.</li>
            <li>Loved it made my face feel solo clean</li>
            <li>Exfoliates and leaves skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great feature during the hot months when my skin is more often exposed to the elements, as well as dirt and sweat.</li>
            <li>In summary, if this product came packaged better then probably give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels better than it has in quite some time.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely product.</li>
            <li>Recently used it to exfoliate before spray tanning and ended up with the best tan yet.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>This product is okay...</li>
            <li>it does the job, but I&#x27;m used to using ones that have more of a liquid built in.</li>
            <li>I love anything that will exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li>I reached for my favorite soap and used it on my face.</li>
            <li>Even my hands got some love</li>
            <li>Honestly, I love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, so gradually add more if need to.</li>
            <li>If I feel like I need more, I pinch some off and rub it on the spot needed.</li>
            <li>So it is working, I probably need more time on my face.</li>
            <li>This product works better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting as many pimples either.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do apply a moisturizer after making it much more softer.</li>
            <li>I am able to exfoliate in the comforts of my home.  </li>
            <li>I rubbed it in for about a minute making sure to focus on my blackheads.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am quite sure it is also works as a body scrub as well.</li>
            <li>I also wish it was in a container that dispensed better.</li>
            <li>I got this product free to review to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>also today am going to mix some to make my face scrub, i love it</li>
            <li>I really love this product, I do think it does a great job at gently but efficiently exfoliating the face.</li>
            <li>What I love most is that this product is multi-tasking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite products that I&#x27;ve received from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all sorts of bath and body salts.</li>
            <li>Within 20 seconds the salt had disintegrated and I had to dip my fingers into the salt to get more to use.</li>
            <li>I ended up mixing some of the salt in with a cleanser that I have, and it worked a bit better that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>overall rating of this would be like 3.5 stars, because it does have some faults, but using it for my feet has been wonderful.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, not to many of us have the time or money to go by the spa or dermatologist office to get a microdermabrasion treatment.</li>
            <li>Then applied the moisturizer and it felt even better.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it does do some exfoliating</li>
            <li>Thankfully as many times as I have used it</li>
            <li>then this will be the most abrasive scrub/microdermabrasion you will find.</li>
            <li>I think that the Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts is the perfect solution for my acne prone, and oily complexion!</li>
            <li>After the application I did not experience itchiness, and my hands felt so smooth!</li>
            <li>I love using Adovia, and I am truly grateful for every opportunity I get to try them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s saying something because I&#x27;ve tried SO many over the years that don&#x27;t work or are too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product works even better with the rest of Adovia&#x27;s product line.</li>
            <li>and I love them all.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many exfoliating products before and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>you know I have shouted from the roof tops that Adovia is my favorite brand for 2014.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>However, my skin is noticeably better after using this product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d probably do more damage to your skin scratching it then exfoliating it.  </li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the salt in the soap, I felt like I got a deeper clean with it.</li>
            <li>I feel very clean after using this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great to exfoliate, made my skin sure soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of facial scrubs and have tried many in my search for the perfect one.</li>
            <li>I was so excited!</li>
            <li>I was so excited!</li>
            <li>If you have a cleanser that you use on a daily basis that you really love, this could be an excellent add-in for days where you want a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>The actual grain of salt is nice size and great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>, it has a very light light scent almost unnoticeable</li>
            <li>I also loved that it a large jar of salts for extended use.  </li>
            <li>I think I can safely say that when it comes to amazing quality beauty products at a reasonable price,  my favorite products are fromAdovia.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that I got oil free quality and a price that anyone could love here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that I got oil free quality and a price that anyone could love here.</li>
            <li>a product tester I was sent a complimentary jar in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and its hands down the best exfoliator I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Not harsh yet very effective</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li>Adovia has other wonderful products, like the mud soap and night renewal cream...</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product, am so happy to have found it.</li>
            <li>and it always leaves my skin feeling extremely clean and smooth!</li>
            <li>it works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using this product, my face did feel clean and well exfoliated after use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s finely milled but it really does scrub and clean your pores amazingly!</li>
            <li>The odor is SO strong.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft afterwards that I kept touching it over and over because I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it felt.</li>
            <li>This kind of grain of salt is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Normally, that would be a good thing; however, with a product like this, it made using it a bit difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hands down,  some of the best products I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure, but I think if someone snuck into my bathroom and replaced this &amp;#34;exfoliating sea salt&amp;#34; with kosher salt, I&#x27;m pretty sure I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li>Because its a fine grain salt, like table salt, cleaning it up was a job.</li>
            <li>I was fine just using the product by itself, but everyone’s face is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts were impressive immediately after the first use.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not the normal kind and will stay for a month or more.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not the normal kind and will stay for a month or more.</li>
            <li>When I opened it the product was full right to the top which is nice, you know you are getting your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Love that it didn&#x27;t melt on the mask fast so that you can exfoliate well!!</li>
            <li>But, I just got a little scoop and that&#x27;s been working great!</li>
            <li>I have noticed huge reduction in the blackheads and has helped them from reoccurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The salts come in a huge 12.3 oz jar.</li>
            <li>Great facial exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I would say give it a try, not only cause it works, the value is great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>want the product for free?</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this product since I use it daily on my face and chest.</li>
            <li>received the product for free in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>The result is a smooth, glowing complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>k i got my product for free a day ago</li>
            <li>For me exfoliation is an important part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>I enjoy writing reviews and hearing feedback about what I have written as I feel reviews helpthose</li>
            <li>I have tried every type of exfoliator, cleanser, soap, and mask that is available on the market.</li>
            <li>It is filled to the brim with the sea salt.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Simply because time after time, product after product, and expectation after expectation has been met with great ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.</li>
            <li>This is good, but not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin was really soft afterwards and looked good.</li>
            <li>A good natural germ killer and cleanser.</li>
            <li>It could be good if there is some natural olive oil that comes with it inside</li>
            <li>and I think the girls will enjoy it too on our fun in-home spa days!</li>
            <li>These salts will leave your skin radiant, smooth, and fresh!</li>
            <li>When I use it my face feels so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It worked very much like a light microderm that you can do at home, which I was very excited about.</li>
            <li>found a new product I love!</li>
            <li>First of all, this jar is HUGE!</li>
            <li>but I was excited to see it was just the salt.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li>first thing that I noticed was how much better my face felt.</li>
            <li>This product is so unique.</li>
            <li>Read all reviews and excited to try this.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with how soft and clean my skin feels after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin felt so refreshed and clean after that washing.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of frolicking in the ocean all day, showering that evening, and experiencing that clean, exfoliated facial-like feel.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that it was dry salt.</li>
            <li>I wouldn’t expect a deeper clean from a salt soap, unless of course, salt itself was added to the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>leaves face feeling clean and refreshed</li>
            <li>It leaves my pores clean.</li>
            <li>First time I used it my face felt very clean and had a tingle to it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many other Adovia products and have had good experiences</li>
            <li>For ~$11 on Prime, it&#x27;s a great deal to at least try it if you haven&#x27;t found something to really give you a good clean feeling yet.</li>
            <li>Pairing the sea salts with a cleanser left me with bright, glowing, skin.</li>
            <li>and when I read the others ingredient list, it&#x27;s full of chemicals and fillers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a full full jar, so they do not skimp on it for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>A finely ground salt used to gently exfoliate your dead skin leaving your face fresh, clean, supple, and truly your best face</li>
            <li>The direction are pretty easy to follow.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty strong -</li>
            <li>Since Adovia is 100% pure Dead Sea Salts you can use it every day, but typically is best to use twice a week.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is what makes this company so unique and fun to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is seriously one of the best exfoliating scrubs I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased plenty of more expensive face scrubs, but sea salt has worked the best for my oily skin and cystic acne.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin with such a nice smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li>Afterward, my skin feels super exfoliated, and my pores are tightened.</li>
            <li>The next three days my face just felt better all around and more radiant.</li>
            <li>I love how this is removing all the ick that is making them look older than they should at this</li>
            <li>But I would highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to have better  and softer skin.</li>
            <li>I just caution you to use it very gently and just lightly move your fingers across your skin with the scrub granules.</li>
            <li>It made my skin so smooth and radiant even when I tried it the first time.</li>
            <li>I have liked this exfoliating product more than any other I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
            <li>I have much better skin when I mix this with a normal facewash than I did when I used Proactive.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this to review and I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product.</li>
            <li>These facial salts polish your skin beautifully and naturally.</li>
            <li>Love it leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I mixed some of the salt (don&#x27;t need more than a pinch!)</li>
            <li>My skin was never acne prone, until my 20&#x27;s after I got married and started having babies!</li>
            <li>Be careful when opening it because it is filled to the top!</li>
            <li>It exfoliates just fine and does the job, but I would not pay more than $5 for this in the future.</li>
            <li>Why would I bother doing that when I can get great results from just using this exfoliating salt scrub a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great exfoliator!!!.It took off a lot of the dead skin</li>
            <li>I used this and my skin felt so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>You can feel the luxurious salts scrubbing away the layers of impurity and leaving your skin tingling fresh.</li>
            <li>The size of the grains is enough to really give your skin a good massage.</li>
            <li>The second is to mix salt with #adovia mineral cream or soap, create a lather, and wash your face with it using a circular motion, rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>The next night I tried making my own scrub with the soap</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my pores fresh and minimizes any blemishes I may get.</li>
            <li>and you can even make your own beach texturizing spray using this, coconut oil, water and essential oils.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause excess drying of my skin, helps with acne when I break out, and leaves my face soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>This was fun to use.</li>
            <li>The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and feels much more even.</li>

            <li>The salt crystals did not dissolve on my facial skin using warm water.</li>
            <li>However, I adore using this more frequently as a body scrub.</li>
            <li>it is simple and effective.</li>

            <li>I think if you were to mix this with a cream cleanser, it would make an even better exfoliator for sensitive</li>

            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>Finally, you rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin is after using it, and it stays that way.</li>
            <li>Blackbox is the best, expensive but incredibly worth it!</li>
            <li>I have always had a hard time finding a product I absolutely loved until I tried this!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I add 1/2 Tablespoon of Adovia Exfoliating Sea Salt to a clean makeup pot and cover it with Pure Argan Oil and stir.</li>
            <li>The jar was a big jar that is sure to last a long time, I was really impressed by that.</li>
            <li>This exfoliation facial sea salt makes my face feel really clean, and it gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural and great for dry skin too!Affordable</li>
            <li>Some exfoliators contain plastic beads to exfoliate and they just do not do the job right.</li>
            <li>I used mine with just water to get it to apply and had to find the right combo of water and product.</li>
            <li>addition to scrubbing the (for lack of a better term) gunk off of your face, Adovia&#x27;s special salt scrub adds minerals (it comes from the Dead Sea!), leaving your face more radiant than before.</li>
            <li>The crystals were finely grind and very soft.</li>
            <li>The entire jar is filled with, fine scrub.</li>
            <li>For those who missed it in the description as I did, it is a very fine salt only..</li>
            <li>Again it did a beautiful job and the great thing is you only need a small amount to go a long way.</li>
            <li>and this is nothing short of a great jar of facial salts.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and have searched my entire adult life for a good scrub.</li>
            <li>It has worked well for my dry skin and also had been effective on my daughters oily skin.</li>
            <li>If the container was fixed so the product doesn&#x27;t easily spill out, I would change this rating to a</li>
            <li>so I gently rubbed about one-quarter of a teaspoon mixed with honey on my face in circular motion and washed with warm water (I found this procedure on the Internet).</li>
            <li>Perfect also for those who simply need a bi-weekly pick me up treatment to revamp our skin from its weekly harsh overload of products, makeup, and environment exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just as i expected, it was PHENOMENAL!  </li>
            <li>The first is to wash your face, pat dry, and apply the salt with a circular motion on your face, rinse with warm water.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li>When I found out I was chosen to receive #Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts FREE for testing purposes, I was beside myself excited.</li>
            <li>It left my skin smooth and so clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of the Microdermabrasion Facial Salts and they are absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I actually expected it to be a salt scrub with some kind of oil or something</li>
            <li>My skin felt so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with these salts now i just use for my face, it has not left my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and the product seems to be tightening my facial skin and leaving a more revitalized look.</li>
            <li>Since using this product I noticed my face is starting to look so much better.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this facial salt scrub</li>
            <li>you can use it out of the jar or add some of the product to your favorite facial beauty wash or bar .</li>
            <li>When I first opened the container, salt spilled everywhere.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better, this seems to bring life back into my skin.</li>
            <li>My pores are looking smaller, I am really pleased.</li>
            <li>Right away I noticed how large this jar is.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not spilling everywhere when you first get it.</li>
            <li>and it really helps!</li>
            <li>interested make an informed decision before purchasing.</li>
            <li>I just used it up too fast!</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, salt went everywhere in my home.</li>
            <li>Many of the grains get stuck in between the lid and the container, so when you go to open it, salt comes out.</li>
            <li>I was amazed by how soft and smooth my face was, after I was done...</li>
            <li>Make sure that you keep your mouth closed when you rinse or you will end up with a mouth full of salt.....</li>
            <li>I really feel like I got my monies worth on this</li>
            <li>First of all, you get a lot of product.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I thought a microdermabrasion should feel like.</li>
            <li>Overall I love this</li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoyed the salts and would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first time I tried this I used the crystals by themselves on my damp face.</li>
            <li>I exfoliate first</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all these!!</li>
            <li>I followed exact directions listed on the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The softness is really noticeable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it if you are looking for an exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li>I believe that keeping the build up off of my skin plays a big part in how healthy I look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of the sea salt.hin too often</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of the sea salt.</li>
            <li>I only used it a few times but it is very nice and really feels good when using it, gets your rosey&#x27;s back in your cheeks!  </li>
            <li>found that the easiest way to use these was to mix it in with your regular cleanser or just do a quick dip of your fingertips after washing your face and do a light scrub.</li>
            <li>This time I am reviewing a very unique beauty product: Exfoliating Facial Salts.</li>
            <li>The second time I mixed it with my facial cleanser as the nice ladies at Adovia recommended and it added a nice exfoliating factor to my wash that helped scrub my pores!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First off, this is a pretty large jar, they did not skimp at all.</li>
            <li>Having tried and loved other Adovia products, I was excited to test out their Exfoliating Facial Sea</li>
            <li>These Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts are true grains of salt and give you a nice deep exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how soft and clean it made my face feel.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but be careful because it can make ur face a bit sensitive</li>
            <li>I use them once a week and my skin is positively glowing.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review, Your experience may differ.</li>
            <li>It did sting, at first, but it really removed the oil build-ups.</li>
            <li>It is a 2 month supply and pretty reasonably priced plus they offer a 100% Satisfaction</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling fresh and new</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and apply as a facial scrub.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin more.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to exfoliate your face with Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts.  </li>
            <li>I have been very lucky to have received several of Adovia&#x27;s products for review on my blog.</li>
            <li>Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts rinse off easily and don&#x27;t leave any residue at all.</li>
            <li>It is a large container.</li>
            <li>Now this did work great at exfoliating my skin in the first few seconds of use, however it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>, a TINY bit less would be great</li>
            <li>wish this had a little spoon or something with it to make dispensing easier, but that would probably lower the amount of product you get, so I&#x27;ll be happy with this current arrangement.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the ingredients as there is only dead sea salt.  </li>
            <li>Adovia dead sea minerals products are amazing.</li>
            <li>I really think this is a game changer for its multi uses and great results.</li>
            <li>Seems VERY pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li>I have tried several exfoliating products and have not ever found one that makes my skin feel as smooth as the Adovia Sea Salt.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Regardless of that I was ready to use as soon as it arrived  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My face is very oily and I get a lot of breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>but it is naturally gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>are extra important steps in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>It worked really well at reducing the blackheads that i tend to get on my nose</li>
            <li>This salt is a real  </li>
            <li>My face felt much smoother - much \\&quot;cooler\\&quot; if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>This is some real exfoliation going on here.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>you get SO much product</li>
            <li>product really does do what the description says.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s salt, so I advise you to massage your face gently as a vigorous scrub is going to irritate.</li>
            <li>I just take my wet fingertips and touch the top of the container and start to scrub.</li>
            <li>I felt as though I could use as much as I needed without the need to skimp.</li>
            <li>I have very sensative skin.</li>
            <li>This salt cleanses the skin very well.</li>
            <li>felt very abrasive.</li>
            <li>It was very scratchy.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>She did the whole spew, and then pulled the $59 a container thing on me.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE Them.</li>
            <li>I used it twice weekly, although the feel is gentle enough for more frequent use.</li>
            <li>you can either use the salt directly on wet/freshly cleansed skin or mix with your favorite facial cleanser to give it an exfoliating boost.</li>
            <li>sparkling white salts felt so pure and clean going on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels freshly washed, clean and soft enough</li>
            <li>It will last a long time, that is for sure!</li>
            <li>When I got out of the shower, my face felt so clean and smooth, as a lot of the dead skin and unsightly blemishes had been removed.</li>
            <li>Well, this is really a unique facial exfoliating salt that I have used!</li>
            <li>you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and or leave a comment.</li>
            <li>I was worried and excited at the same time.</li>
            <li>After my first and every application after my face looks brighter, and feel so soft!</li>
            <li>It felt like a whole new face!</li>
            <li>I also thought it would be good for the numerous black heads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I was done it rinsed off easily and left my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The texture is much finer than most exfoliating products I&#x27;ve used, similar to white sugar, which I like.</li>
            <li>I got a full sized sample of this Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts for review.</li>
            <li>Actually, the jar is packed so full that product spilled out when I opened it.</li>
            <li>The container I received is quite large and it is noted to last for 2 months worth of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It felt a little rough, but when I rinsed it off my skin looked and felt great.</li>
            <li>The exfoliator is not rough on my sensitive skin and it leaves a smooth soft finish once washed!</li>
            <li>Your have a new face thanks to Adovia Mineral Skin Care.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this scrub as my previous scrubs didn&#x27;t do as well as this one</li>
            <li>If one thinks the scrub can be too harsh on sensitive skin, then what I do is put it in warm water then splash on.</li>
            <li>I used the Adovia salts after my regular foaming cleanser in the morning and throughout the day, I kept noticing that it didn&#x27;t have those afternoon oilies, even after being out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts, my skin is smoother and it looks more youthful and vibrant.</li>
            <li>That was the main reason I purchased this brand.</li>
            <li>Reading through the directions, the first thing that I noticed was that you can use the Dead Sea Facial Salts on their own with just water or you can mix it with your cleanser, soap or a face mask.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>: Apply salt to a clean wet face and massage gently.</li>
            <li>but it still needs some oil natural for to easily use because it still dry</li>
            <li>the natural drying effect of the salts might be too much.</li>
            <li>It dissolves in water as with normal salt and this also takes the edge off if you can&#x27;t deal with the sharper edges.</li>
            <li>I know for sure it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>there are a few reasons why one i love making things and two</li>
            <li>This really is a top notch exfoliator and the  dead sea salts are as well.</li>
            <li>Follow with moisturizer and/or follow your normal skin regime.</li>
            <li>Mixing the concoction all up, I applied it and instead of letting it sit as you normally would, I massaged the mixture into my face.</li>
            <li>It would work for normal or combination as well.</li>
            <li>All the opinions expressed here are my own.*for normal or combination as well.</li>
            <li>I love that you can choose how much dead sea salt to use.  </li>
            <li>I then wet my face and got a pinch full of salts and gently exfoliated my face and rinsed with water.</li>
            <li>I love that it was not too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>I think it must have taken off quite a bit of dead and yucky skin (ok- ew.)</li>
            <li>I have used this every other day and have noticed fine lines getting smoother.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, make sure to only use a couple times a week</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would most definitely recommend Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts to everyone who has oily and blemish filled skin.</li>
            <li>so be careful you do get your monies worth!  </li>
            <li>For me, using the salt/crystals on their own was a bit harsh/rough for my skin, leaving my face a little red after use.</li>
            <li>My face felt softer and cleaner, and I could feel that it was clearly a new layer of skin on my face.</li>
            <li>and I consider this a new weapon in my fight for beauty.  </li>
            <li>It had a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li>After use, my skin felt very soft and looked refreshed.</li>
            <li>I got into sea salt scrubs after being gifted a sample container of a different, more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>This is my first time owning exfoliating facial sea salt</li>
            <li>My face was so soft!</li>
            <li>If you are like me and love and extremely abrasive facial scrub</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how soft my skin was already!</li>
            <li>Adovia has a really good product line that contains Dead Sea Salt as one of the active ingredients.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would most definitely recommend Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts to everyone who has oily and blemish filled skin, even for normal or combination as well.</li>
            <li>The sea salts are very fine which makes it a little messy to use the first time since the product is really packed into the container.</li>
            <li>With my sensitive skin, I can only use this about once a week (and even so, I need to take caution to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; very, very gently).</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I mixed it with my Philosophy Purity facial cleanser creating a gentle scrub .</li>
            <li>I am a lover of Adovia products, so I was pretty excited about this one since I have yet to have a complaint about anything by Adovia.</li>
            <li>… This is a large tub of ACTUAL salts are formulated to exfoliate your skin while removing oils, bacteria, and impurities.</li>
            <li>Other than that I think this product is 100% worth the purchase and will last you a long time and give you many different ways in which to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, these granules are large enough that you can gently massage them all over your face for several minutes and it you will notice a difference after you rinse.</li>
            <li>This one is clearly a hit</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin you need to mix these facial salts with a cleanser or mask to create a gentle scrub.</li>
            <li>I mix it with my Mary Kay Clear Proof Clarifying Cleansing Gel.</li>
            <li>I find that when I exfoliate prior to applying makeup (which I don&#x27;t wear often, maybe once or twice a week), my makeup looks much smoother and natural than when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even dermatology treatment won&#x27;t clear it up.</li>
            <li>Even dermatology treatment won&#x27;t clear it up.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and psoriasis and this salt scrub did not irritate my skin either.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and it has a glow.</li>
            <li>I use powder foundation and before I was noticing how old my face my looking.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea Salt went everywhere because the container was filled to the rim.</li>
            <li>The jar I received was literally filled to the rim with dead sea salt..</li>
            <li>The Adovia products I have tried so far have far passed my expectations.</li>
            <li>Be careful if you have sensitive skin, be sure your face is completely wet.</li>
            <li>Once it is thoroughly mixed, I apply the salt scrub to my face and gently massage it into my skin.</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin.)  </li>
            <li>I find that it is a bit too abrasive for my sensitive skin when I use it directly on my skin.</li>
            <li>The product comes very efficiently packaged, expect some spillage when you open it</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any sort of actual exfoliating from this product.</li>
            <li>I suggest mixing with a cream cleanser if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Even my hands stay soft for days at a time.</li>
            <li>Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say, that I have issues with adult acne.</li>
            <li>I live in the country and my hands get treated pretty rough.</li>
            <li>mixed mine with just the smallest amount of rose hip oil (very small amount)</li>
            <li>That ended up being a huge mess!</li>
            <li>This product helps remove my dead skin and keep my face clean and moisturize.</li>
            <li>My face felt refreshed and clean (dead skin removed) after use.</li>
            <li>I usually use a scrub mostly every night, but with this it is definitely a once a week use.</li>
            <li>The salt crystals are far too rough (at first) to be rubbing on your skin.  </li>
            <li>First, let me say that I had never heard of this type of product before I ran by the local mall to grab a Christmas present.</li>
            <li>Adovia sells only high quality products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time that I went to use the Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts, I was not sure if I wanted to try them out on their own or mix it with something.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with my normal face wash since it was easier for my to use that way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little harsh on my skin but nonetheless an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and I had some acne due to my hormones and it definitely helped getting rid of it.</li>
            <li>It no longer feels oily or dry, but primed and ready for me to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>You could really tell how much of the dead skin was removed.</li>
            <li>this treatment salt can help your skin be refreshed, free of excess oils, unclog pores, remove dead skin cells, remove dullness, tighten pores, stimulate facial circulation, and leave your skin feeling and looking beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this product is how SOFT it leaves my skin feeling without leaving behind any residue.</li>
            <li>My skin needs major exfoliation after.  </li>
            <li>I was just starting the get holiday stress acne on my chin, and  this Sea Salt actually helped it go away before it was anything more than just a small raised place.</li>
            <li>I was just starting the get holiday stress acne on my chin, and  this Sea Salt actually helped it go away before it was anything more than just a small raised place.</li>
            <li>If you would like to read a more detailed review go to: [...]</li>
            <li>and i surprised because i was thinking the salts would melt just like regular salt</li>
            <li>Just be careful NOT to get the salt in your eyes, it really burns.</li>
            <li>Only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>You apply them to a wet face and massage gently in circles.</li>
            <li>Would not be at all surprised if it is regular salt being sold in a fancy container as a microdermabrasion  treatment - which it is not.</li>
            <li>12.3 oz of fine grain loose Dead Sea salt.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of dry dead skin and leave face smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product and other Adovia products actually, recommended to me by my dermatologist!</li>
            <li>Therefore, when I got the chance to try out the Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts, I was rather excited because it was a completely different concept than I was used to.</li>
            <li>These are made with sea salt right from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li>I appreciated that the salts weren&#x27;t too harsh and they&#x27;re gentle enough where you could probably use the salts daily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty tricky not to make a gigantic mess.</li>
            <li>You should not scrub hard because you can really create a problem if you use too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I read in other buyers&#x27; comments that the containers were so full that they had to open the lids carefully in order not to spill the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how heavy</li>
            <li>the first few times I scooped some out...</li>
            <li>I first cleansed my face with Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Salt Mineral Bar that you can also purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li>my only issue with this product so far, and a minor one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I have tried several of them and they don&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>applied to wet skin was too dry to really massage</li>
            <li>Not only is it completely versatile, but there is enough in here to last a long time.</li>
            <li>The large amount of product inside the container means that you can use a generous amount instead of only using a little bit.</li>
            <li>That aside, the biggest issues are that it makes a huge mess and a lot of it is wasted (unintentionally of course ).</li>
            <li>, it is pure Dead Sea Salt</li>
            <li>A 100% Pure Mineral Infused Dead Sea Salt.</li>

            <li> I have been looking for a good exfoliate for awhile now.</li>
            <li> It felt really good rubbing it into my skin.</li>
            <li> I got a good massage in and with it and there was not burning.</li>
            <li> I have heard that sea salt scrubs are good for this</li>
            <li> It did not feel good upon my skin or did it feel like it was exfoliating my skin in any way.</li>
            <li> But I think it was a good thing..</li>
            <li> I see works good</li>
            <li> Very fine scrub!</li>
            <li> There is no question that this is a very strong scrub that will very effectively exfoliate your skin.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with this sea salts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the price and even more because it works.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> However, after reading the instructions on how to use this......I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have been using the sea salt for 4 nights now and I am absolutely in love!</li>
            <li> I use them every day in the shower and love them!</li>
            <li> love the way my skin feels after I have exfoliated it!</li>
            <li> so glad this product works!</li>
            <li> I love adovia products and this one is no exception!</li>
            <li> In the end, it did leave my skin feeling good, but I could have just as easily used the sea salt from my kitchen!</li>
            <li> That was an amazing feels since I never used salts before.</li>
            <li> This has been absolutely amazing for my skin.</li>
            <li> Again, my face felt amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li> Adovia has AMAZING products.</li>
            <li> and you are truly on the way to amazing</li>

            <li> I have already seen a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>

            <li> got this from Adovia at a promotional price in order to test it, and this is my honest opinion after using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> Thanks for another wonderful product Adovia!</li>
            <li> ’s own.</li>
            <li> received a sample of this product for review purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> and I really liked that too.</li>
            <li> Although I did receive this product to review all of these opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Rinse off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I also feel that honest and informative reviews improve a product by providing insight to the company.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I was sent the item in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I was sent the item in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> All the opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It did not hurt my skin and it gave me nice, smoothe skin where I used it.</li>
            <li> The tub is 12.3 oz, a really nice size for the price ($19)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I dipped my hands in warm water, and sprinkled some of the salts on my hand, and massaged.</li>
            <li> However, the opinions expressed are my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> The salts are a nice exfoliator without micro beads clogging up our environment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I got this at a discounted price for my honest review*</li>
            <li> But the opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> well i wanted to see these salts, these salts are baby fine salts like you would use in the amazing lip scrubs or body buffing salts in fancy spas and resorts!</li>
            <li> you are looking for the best exfoliating mineral salt , then I highly recommend this Adovia salt to try out.</li>
            <li> Afterward my face felt smooth and looked remarkably brighter just as the product claimed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the face wash, I use my normal L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love Adovia products and was so happy I received a sample free to try and do this review for my blog youtube and amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the company as I have received 2 emails from them explaining the product and how it was developed.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really one for making reviews of products unless it brings a superb happiness.</li>
            <li> Loved it made my face feel solo clean</li>
            <li> Exfoliates and leaves skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great feature during the hot months when my skin is more often exposed to the elements, as well as dirt and sweat.</li>
            <li> In summary, if this product came packaged better then probably give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels better than it has in quite some time.  </li>
            <li> This is a lovely product.</li>
            <li> Recently used it to exfoliate before spray tanning and ended up with the best tan yet.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> This product is okay...</li>
            <li> it does the job, but I&#x27;m used to using ones that have more of a liquid built in.</li>
            <li> I love anything that will exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> I reached for my favorite soap and used it on my face.</li>
            <li> Even my hands got some love</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, so gradually add more if need to.</li>
            <li> If I feel like I need more, I pinch some off and rub it on the spot needed.</li>
            <li> So it is working, I probably need more time on my face.</li>
            <li> This product works better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting as many pimples either.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do apply a moisturizer after making it much more softer.</li>
            <li> I am able to exfoliate in the comforts of my home.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed it in for about a minute making sure to focus on my blackheads.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am quite sure it is also works as a body scrub as well.</li>
            <li> I also wish it was in a container that dispensed better.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to review to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> also today am going to mix some to make my face scrub, i love it</li>
            <li> I really love this product, I do think it does a great job at gently but efficiently exfoliating the face.</li>
            <li> What I love most is that this product is multi-tasking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite products that I&#x27;ve received from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love all sorts of bath and body salts.</li>
            <li> Within 20 seconds the salt had disintegrated and I had to dip my fingers into the salt to get more to use.</li>
            <li> I ended up mixing some of the salt in with a cleanser that I have, and it worked a bit better that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall rating of this would be like 3.5 stars, because it does have some faults, but using it for my feet has been wonderful.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, not to many of us have the time or money to go by the spa or dermatologist office to get a microdermabrasion treatment.</li>
            <li> Then applied the moisturizer and it felt even better.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> but I am sure it does do some exfoliating</li>
            <li> Thankfully as many times as I have used it</li>
            <li> then this will be the most abrasive scrub/microdermabrasion you will find.</li>
            <li> I think that the Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts is the perfect solution for my acne prone, and oily complexion!</li>
            <li> After the application I did not experience itchiness, and my hands felt so smooth!</li>
            <li> I love using Adovia, and I am truly grateful for every opportunity I get to try them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s saying something because I&#x27;ve tried SO many over the years that don&#x27;t work or are too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product works even better with the rest of Adovia&#x27;s product line.</li>
            <li> and I love them all.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many exfoliating products before and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> you know I have shouted from the roof tops that Adovia is my favorite brand for 2014.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> However, my skin is noticeably better after using this product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d probably do more damage to your skin scratching it then exfoliating it.  </li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the salt in the soap, I felt like I got a deeper clean with it.</li>
            <li> I feel very clean after using this product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great to exfoliate, made my skin sure soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of facial scrubs and have tried many in my search for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> I was so excited!</li>
            <li> I was so excited!</li>
            <li> If you have a cleanser that you use on a daily basis that you really love, this could be an excellent add-in for days where you want a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> The actual grain of salt is nice size and great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> , it has a very light light scent almost unnoticeable</li>
            <li> I also loved that it a large jar of salts for extended use.  </li>
            <li> I think I can safely say that when it comes to amazing quality beauty products at a reasonable price,  my favorite products are fromAdovia.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that I got oil free quality and a price that anyone could love here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that I got oil free quality and a price that anyone could love here.</li>
            <li> a product tester I was sent a complimentary jar in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and its hands down the best exfoliator I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Not harsh yet very effective</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things!</li>
            <li> Adovia has other wonderful products, like the mud soap and night renewal cream...</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this product, am so happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> and it always leaves my skin feeling extremely clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> it works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product, my face did feel clean and well exfoliated after use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s finely milled but it really does scrub and clean your pores amazingly!</li>
            <li> The odor is SO strong.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft afterwards that I kept touching it over and over because I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it felt.</li>
            <li> This kind of grain of salt is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Normally, that would be a good thing; however, with a product like this, it made using it a bit difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hands down,  some of the best products I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure, but I think if someone snuck into my bathroom and replaced this &amp;#34;exfoliating sea salt&amp;#34; with kosher salt, I&#x27;m pretty sure I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li> Because its a fine grain salt, like table salt, cleaning it up was a job.</li>
            <li> I was fine just using the product by itself, but everyone’s face is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts were impressive immediately after the first use.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not the normal kind and will stay for a month or more.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not the normal kind and will stay for a month or more.</li>
            <li> When I opened it the product was full right to the top which is nice, you know you are getting your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Love that it didn&#x27;t melt on the mask fast so that you can exfoliate well!!</li>
            <li> But, I just got a little scoop and that&#x27;s been working great!</li>
            <li> I have noticed huge reduction in the blackheads and has helped them from reoccurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The salts come in a huge 12.3 oz jar.</li>
            <li> Great facial exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I would say give it a try, not only cause it works, the value is great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> want the product for free?</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this product since I use it daily on my face and chest.</li>
            <li> received the product for free in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> The result is a smooth, glowing complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> k i got my product for free a day ago</li>
            <li> For me exfoliation is an important part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I enjoy writing reviews and hearing feedback about what I have written as I feel reviews helpthose</li>
            <li> I have tried every type of exfoliator, cleanser, soap, and mask that is available on the market.</li>
            <li> It is filled to the brim with the sea salt.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Simply because time after time, product after product, and expectation after expectation has been met with great ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This is good, but not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was really soft afterwards and looked good.</li>
            <li> A good natural germ killer and cleanser.</li>
            <li> It could be good if there is some natural olive oil that comes with it inside</li>
            <li> and I think the girls will enjoy it too on our fun in-home spa days!</li>
            <li> These salts will leave your skin radiant, smooth, and fresh!</li>
            <li> When I use it my face feels so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It worked very much like a light microderm that you can do at home, which I was very excited about.</li>
            <li> found a new product I love!</li>
            <li> First of all, this jar is HUGE!</li>
            <li> but I was excited to see it was just the salt.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> first thing that I noticed was how much better my face felt.</li>
            <li> This product is so unique.</li>
            <li> Read all reviews and excited to try this.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with how soft and clean my skin feels after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin felt so refreshed and clean after that washing.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of frolicking in the ocean all day, showering that evening, and experiencing that clean, exfoliated facial-like feel.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that it was dry salt.</li>
            <li> I wouldn’t expect a deeper clean from a salt soap, unless of course, salt itself was added to the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> leaves face feeling clean and refreshed</li>
            <li> It leaves my pores clean.</li>
            <li> First time I used it my face felt very clean and had a tingle to it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many other Adovia products and have had good experiences</li>
            <li> For ~$11 on Prime, it&#x27;s a great deal to at least try it if you haven&#x27;t found something to really give you a good clean feeling yet.</li>
            <li> Pairing the sea salts with a cleanser left me with bright, glowing, skin.</li>
            <li> and when I read the others ingredient list, it&#x27;s full of chemicals and fillers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a full full jar, so they do not skimp on it for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> A finely ground salt used to gently exfoliate your dead skin leaving your face fresh, clean, supple, and truly your best face</li>
            <li> The direction are pretty easy to follow.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty strong -</li>
            <li> Since Adovia is 100% pure Dead Sea Salts you can use it every day, but typically is best to use twice a week.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is what makes this company so unique and fun to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is seriously one of the best exfoliating scrubs I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased plenty of more expensive face scrubs, but sea salt has worked the best for my oily skin and cystic acne.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin with such a nice smooth feeling.  </li>
            <li> Afterward, my skin feels super exfoliated, and my pores are tightened.</li>
            <li> The next three days my face just felt better all around and more radiant.</li>
            <li> I love how this is removing all the ick that is making them look older than they should at this</li>
            <li> But I would highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to have better  and softer skin.</li>
            <li> I just caution you to use it very gently and just lightly move your fingers across your skin with the scrub granules.</li>
            <li> It made my skin so smooth and radiant even when I tried it the first time.</li>
            <li> I have liked this exfoliating product more than any other I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
            <li> I have much better skin when I mix this with a normal facewash than I did when I used Proactive.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review and I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product.</li>
            <li> These facial salts polish your skin beautifully and naturally.</li>
            <li> Love it leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I mixed some of the salt (don&#x27;t need more than a pinch!)</li>
            <li> My skin was never acne prone, until my 20&#x27;s after I got married and started having babies!</li>
            <li> Be careful when opening it because it is filled to the top!</li>
            <li> It exfoliates just fine and does the job, but I would not pay more than $5 for this in the future.</li>
            <li> Why would I bother doing that when I can get great results from just using this exfoliating salt scrub a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great exfoliator!!!.It took off a lot of the dead skin</li>
            <li> I used this and my skin felt so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> You can feel the luxurious salts scrubbing away the layers of impurity and leaving your skin tingling fresh.</li>
            <li> The size of the grains is enough to really give your skin a good massage.</li>
            <li> The second is to mix salt with #adovia mineral cream or soap, create a lather, and wash your face with it using a circular motion, rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> The next night I tried making my own scrub with the soap</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my pores fresh and minimizes any blemishes I may get.</li>
            <li> and you can even make your own beach texturizing spray using this, coconut oil, water and essential oils.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause excess drying of my skin, helps with acne when I break out, and leaves my face soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This was fun to use.</li>
            <li> The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>

            <li> However, I adore using this more frequently as a body scrub.</li>
            <li> it is simple and effective.</li>

            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> Finally, you rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin is after using it, and it stays that way.</li>
            <li> Blackbox is the best, expensive but incredibly worth it!</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time finding a product I absolutely loved until I tried this!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I add 1/2 Tablespoon of Adovia Exfoliating Sea Salt to a clean makeup pot and cover it with Pure Argan Oil and stir.</li>
            <li> The jar was a big jar that is sure to last a long time, I was really impressed by that.</li>
            <li> This exfoliation facial sea salt makes my face feel really clean, and it gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural and great for dry skin too!Affordable</li>
            <li> Some exfoliators contain plastic beads to exfoliate and they just do not do the job right.</li>
            <li> I used mine with just water to get it to apply and had to find the right combo of water and product.</li>
            <li> addition to scrubbing the (for lack of a better term) gunk off of your face, Adovia&#x27;s special salt scrub adds minerals (it comes from the Dead Sea!), leaving your face more radiant than before.</li>
            <li> The crystals were finely grind and very soft.</li>
            <li> The entire jar is filled with, fine scrub.</li>
            <li> For those who missed it in the description as I did, it is a very fine salt only..</li>
            <li> Again it did a beautiful job and the great thing is you only need a small amount to go a long way.</li>
            <li> and this is nothing short of a great jar of facial salts.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and have searched my entire adult life for a good scrub.</li>
            <li> It has worked well for my dry skin and also had been effective on my daughters oily skin.</li>
            <li> If the container was fixed so the product doesn&#x27;t easily spill out, I would change this rating to a</li>
            <li> so I gently rubbed about one-quarter of a teaspoon mixed with honey on my face in circular motion and washed with warm water (I found this procedure on the Internet).</li>
            <li> Perfect also for those who simply need a bi-weekly pick me up treatment to revamp our skin from its weekly harsh overload of products, makeup, and environment exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just as i expected, it was PHENOMENAL!  </li>
            <li> The first is to wash your face, pat dry, and apply the salt with a circular motion on your face, rinse with warm water.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li> When I found out I was chosen to receive #Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts FREE for testing purposes, I was beside myself excited.</li>
            <li> It left my skin smooth and so clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the Microdermabrasion Facial Salts and they are absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I actually expected it to be a salt scrub with some kind of oil or something</li>
            <li> My skin felt so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with these salts now i just use for my face, it has not left my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and the product seems to be tightening my facial skin and leaving a more revitalized look.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I noticed my face is starting to look so much better.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this facial salt scrub</li>
            <li> you can use it out of the jar or add some of the product to your favorite facial beauty wash or bar .</li>
            <li> When I first opened the container, salt spilled everywhere.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better, this seems to bring life back into my skin.</li>
            <li> My pores are looking smaller, I am really pleased.</li>
            <li> Right away I noticed how large this jar is.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not spilling everywhere when you first get it.</li>
            <li> and it really helps!</li>
            <li> interested make an informed decision before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I just used it up too fast!</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, salt went everywhere in my home.</li>
            <li> Many of the grains get stuck in between the lid and the container, so when you go to open it, salt comes out.</li>
            <li> I was amazed by how soft and smooth my face was, after I was done...</li>
            <li> Make sure that you keep your mouth closed when you rinse or you will end up with a mouth full of salt.....</li>
            <li> I really feel like I got my monies worth on this</li>
            <li> First of all, you get a lot of product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I thought a microdermabrasion should feel like.</li>
            <li> Overall I love this</li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoyed the salts and would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> first time I tried this I used the crystals by themselves on my damp face.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate first</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all these!!</li>
            <li> I followed exact directions listed on the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The softness is really noticeable!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it if you are looking for an exfoliating scrub.  </li>
            <li> I believe that keeping the build up off of my skin plays a big part in how healthy I look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of the sea salt.hin too often</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of the sea salt.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times but it is very nice and really feels good when using it, gets your rosey&#x27;s back in your cheeks!  </li>
            <li> found that the easiest way to use these was to mix it in with your regular cleanser or just do a quick dip of your fingertips after washing your face and do a light scrub.</li>
            <li> This time I am reviewing a very unique beauty product: Exfoliating Facial Salts.</li>
            <li> The second time I mixed it with my facial cleanser as the nice ladies at Adovia recommended and it added a nice exfoliating factor to my wash that helped scrub my pores!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First off, this is a pretty large jar, they did not skimp at all.</li>
            <li> Having tried and loved other Adovia products, I was excited to test out their Exfoliating Facial Sea</li>
            <li> These Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts are true grains of salt and give you a nice deep exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how soft and clean it made my face feel.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but be careful because it can make ur face a bit sensitive</li>
            <li> I use them once a week and my skin is positively glowing.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review, Your experience may differ.</li>
            <li> It did sting, at first, but it really removed the oil build-ups.</li>
            <li> It is a 2 month supply and pretty reasonably priced plus they offer a 100% Satisfaction</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling fresh and new</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and apply as a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin more.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to exfoliate your face with Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts.  </li>
            <li> I have been very lucky to have received several of Adovia&#x27;s products for review on my blog.</li>
            <li> Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts rinse off easily and don&#x27;t leave any residue at all.</li>
            <li> It is a large container.</li>
            <li> Now this did work great at exfoliating my skin in the first few seconds of use, however it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> , a TINY bit less would be great</li>
            <li> wish this had a little spoon or something with it to make dispensing easier, but that would probably lower the amount of product you get, so I&#x27;ll be happy with this current arrangement.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the ingredients as there is only dead sea salt.  </li>
            <li> Adovia dead sea minerals products are amazing.</li>
            <li> I really think this is a game changer for its multi uses and great results.</li>
            <li> Seems VERY pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li> I have tried several exfoliating products and have not ever found one that makes my skin feel as smooth as the Adovia Sea Salt.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Regardless of that I was ready to use as soon as it arrived  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My face is very oily and I get a lot of breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> but it is naturally gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> are extra important steps in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> It worked really well at reducing the blackheads that i tend to get on my nose</li>
            <li> This salt is a real  </li>
            <li> My face felt much smoother - much \\&quot;cooler\\&quot; if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> This is some real exfoliation going on here.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> you get SO much product</li>
            <li> product really does do what the description says.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s salt, so I advise you to massage your face gently as a vigorous scrub is going to irritate.</li>
            <li> I just take my wet fingertips and touch the top of the container and start to scrub.</li>
            <li> I felt as though I could use as much as I needed without the need to skimp.</li>
            <li> I have very sensative skin.</li>
            <li> This salt cleanses the skin very well.</li>
            <li> felt very abrasive.</li>
            <li> It was very scratchy.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> She did the whole spew, and then pulled the $59 a container thing on me.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE Them.</li>
            <li> I used it twice weekly, although the feel is gentle enough for more frequent use.</li>
            <li> you can either use the salt directly on wet/freshly cleansed skin or mix with your favorite facial cleanser to give it an exfoliating boost.</li>
            <li> sparkling white salts felt so pure and clean going on my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels freshly washed, clean and soft enough</li>
            <li> It will last a long time, that is for sure!</li>
            <li> When I got out of the shower, my face felt so clean and smooth, as a lot of the dead skin and unsightly blemishes had been removed.</li>
            <li> Well, this is really a unique facial exfoliating salt that I have used!</li>
            <li> you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and or leave a comment.</li>
            <li> I was worried and excited at the same time.</li>
            <li> After my first and every application after my face looks brighter, and feel so soft!</li>
            <li> It felt like a whole new face!</li>
            <li> I also thought it would be good for the numerous black heads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I was done it rinsed off easily and left my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The texture is much finer than most exfoliating products I&#x27;ve used, similar to white sugar, which I like.</li>
            <li> I got a full sized sample of this Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts for review.</li>
            <li> Actually, the jar is packed so full that product spilled out when I opened it.</li>
            <li> The container I received is quite large and it is noted to last for 2 months worth of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It felt a little rough, but when I rinsed it off my skin looked and felt great.</li>
            <li> The exfoliator is not rough on my sensitive skin and it leaves a smooth soft finish once washed!</li>
            <li> Your have a new face thanks to Adovia Mineral Skin Care.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this scrub as my previous scrubs didn&#x27;t do as well as this one</li>
            <li> If one thinks the scrub can be too harsh on sensitive skin, then what I do is put it in warm water then splash on.</li>
            <li> I used the Adovia salts after my regular foaming cleanser in the morning and throughout the day, I kept noticing that it didn&#x27;t have those afternoon oilies, even after being out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts, my skin is smoother and it looks more youthful and vibrant.</li>
            <li> That was the main reason I purchased this brand.</li>
            <li> Reading through the directions, the first thing that I noticed was that you can use the Dead Sea Facial Salts on their own with just water or you can mix it with your cleanser, soap or a face mask.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> : Apply salt to a clean wet face and massage gently.</li>
            <li> but it still needs some oil natural for to easily use because it still dry</li>
            <li> the natural drying effect of the salts might be too much.</li>
            <li> It dissolves in water as with normal salt and this also takes the edge off if you can&#x27;t deal with the sharper edges.</li>
            <li> I know for sure it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> there are a few reasons why one i love making things and two</li>
            <li> This really is a top notch exfoliator and the  dead sea salts are as well.</li>
            <li> Follow with moisturizer and/or follow your normal skin regime.</li>
            <li> Mixing the concoction all up, I applied it and instead of letting it sit as you normally would, I massaged the mixture into my face.</li>
            <li> It would work for normal or combination as well.</li>
            <li> All the opinions expressed here are my own.*for normal or combination as well.</li>
            <li> I love that you can choose how much dead sea salt to use.  </li>
            <li> I then wet my face and got a pinch full of salts and gently exfoliated my face and rinsed with water.</li>
            <li> I love that it was not too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I think it must have taken off quite a bit of dead and yucky skin (ok- ew.)</li>
            <li> I have used this every other day and have noticed fine lines getting smoother.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, make sure to only use a couple times a week</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would most definitely recommend Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts to everyone who has oily and blemish filled skin.</li>
            <li> so be careful you do get your monies worth!  </li>
            <li> For me, using the salt/crystals on their own was a bit harsh/rough for my skin, leaving my face a little red after use.</li>
            <li> My face felt softer and cleaner, and I could feel that it was clearly a new layer of skin on my face.</li>
            <li> and I consider this a new weapon in my fight for beauty.  </li>
            <li> It had a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li> After use, my skin felt very soft and looked refreshed.</li>
            <li> I got into sea salt scrubs after being gifted a sample container of a different, more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> This is my first time owning exfoliating facial sea salt</li>
            <li> My face was so soft!</li>
            <li> If you are like me and love and extremely abrasive facial scrub</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how soft my skin was already!</li>
            <li> Adovia has a really good product line that contains Dead Sea Salt as one of the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would most definitely recommend Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts to everyone who has oily and blemish filled skin, even for normal or combination as well.</li>
            <li> The sea salts are very fine which makes it a little messy to use the first time since the product is really packed into the container.</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin, I can only use this about once a week (and even so, I need to take caution to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; very, very gently).</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I mixed it with my Philosophy Purity facial cleanser creating a gentle scrub .</li>
            <li> I am a lover of Adovia products, so I was pretty excited about this one since I have yet to have a complaint about anything by Adovia.</li>
            <li> … This is a large tub of ACTUAL salts are formulated to exfoliate your skin while removing oils, bacteria, and impurities.</li>
            <li> Other than that I think this product is 100% worth the purchase and will last you a long time and give you many different ways in which to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, these granules are large enough that you can gently massage them all over your face for several minutes and it you will notice a difference after you rinse.</li>
            <li> This one is clearly a hit</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin you need to mix these facial salts with a cleanser or mask to create a gentle scrub.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my Mary Kay Clear Proof Clarifying Cleansing Gel.</li>
            <li> I find that when I exfoliate prior to applying makeup (which I don&#x27;t wear often, maybe once or twice a week), my makeup looks much smoother and natural than when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even dermatology treatment won&#x27;t clear it up.</li>
            <li> Even dermatology treatment won&#x27;t clear it up.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and psoriasis and this salt scrub did not irritate my skin either.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and it has a glow.</li>
            <li> I use powder foundation and before I was noticing how old my face my looking.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea Salt went everywhere because the container was filled to the rim.</li>
            <li> The jar I received was literally filled to the rim with dead sea salt..</li>
            <li> The Adovia products I have tried so far have far passed my expectations.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have sensitive skin, be sure your face is completely wet.</li>
            <li> Once it is thoroughly mixed, I apply the salt scrub to my face and gently massage it into my skin.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin.)  </li>
            <li> I find that it is a bit too abrasive for my sensitive skin when I use it directly on my skin.</li>
            <li> The product comes very efficiently packaged, expect some spillage when you open it</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any sort of actual exfoliating from this product.</li>
            <li> I suggest mixing with a cream cleanser if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Even my hands stay soft for days at a time.</li>
            <li> Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say, that I have issues with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I live in the country and my hands get treated pretty rough.</li>
            <li> mixed mine with just the smallest amount of rose hip oil (very small amount)</li>
            <li> That ended up being a huge mess!</li>
            <li> This product helps remove my dead skin and keep my face clean and moisturize.</li>
            <li> My face felt refreshed and clean (dead skin removed) after use.</li>
            <li> I usually use a scrub mostly every night, but with this it is definitely a once a week use.</li>
            <li> The salt crystals are far too rough (at first) to be rubbing on your skin.  </li>
            <li> First, let me say that I had never heard of this type of product before I ran by the local mall to grab a Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Adovia sells only high quality products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time that I went to use the Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts, I was not sure if I wanted to try them out on their own or mix it with something.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with my normal face wash since it was easier for my to use that way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harsh on my skin but nonetheless an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and I had some acne due to my hormones and it definitely helped getting rid of it.</li>
            <li> It no longer feels oily or dry, but primed and ready for me to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> You could really tell how much of the dead skin was removed.</li>
            <li> this treatment salt can help your skin be refreshed, free of excess oils, unclog pores, remove dead skin cells, remove dullness, tighten pores, stimulate facial circulation, and leave your skin feeling and looking beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> favorite thing about this product is how SOFT it leaves my skin feeling without leaving behind any residue.</li>
            <li> My skin needs major exfoliation after.  </li>
            <li> I was just starting the get holiday stress acne on my chin, and  this Sea Salt actually helped it go away before it was anything more than just a small raised place.</li>
            <li> I was just starting the get holiday stress acne on my chin, and  this Sea Salt actually helped it go away before it was anything more than just a small raised place.</li>
            <li> If you would like to read a more detailed review go to: [...]</li>
            <li> and i surprised because i was thinking the salts would melt just like regular salt</li>
            <li> Just be careful NOT to get the salt in your eyes, it really burns.</li>
            <li> Only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> You apply them to a wet face and massage gently in circles.</li>
            <li> Would not be at all surprised if it is regular salt being sold in a fancy container as a microdermabrasion  treatment - which it is not.</li>
            <li> 12.3 oz of fine grain loose Dead Sea salt.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of dry dead skin and leave face smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product and other Adovia products actually, recommended to me by my dermatologist!</li>
            <li> Therefore, when I got the chance to try out the Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts, I was rather excited because it was a completely different concept than I was used to.</li>
            <li> These are made with sea salt right from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I appreciated that the salts weren&#x27;t too harsh and they&#x27;re gentle enough where you could probably use the salts daily.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty tricky not to make a gigantic mess.</li>
            <li> You should not scrub hard because you can really create a problem if you use too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I read in other buyers&#x27; comments that the containers were so full that they had to open the lids carefully in order not to spill the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how heavy</li>
            <li> the first few times I scooped some out...</li>
            <li> I first cleansed my face with Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Salt Mineral Bar that you can also purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> my only issue with this product so far, and a minor one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I have tried several of them and they don&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> applied to wet skin was too dry to really massage</li>
            <li> Not only is it completely versatile, but there is enough in here to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The large amount of product inside the container means that you can use a generous amount instead of only using a little bit.</li>
            <li> That aside, the biggest issues are that it makes a huge mess and a lot of it is wasted (unintentionally of course ).</li>
            <li> , it is pure Dead Sea Salt</li>
            <li> A 100% Pure Mineral Infused Dead Sea Salt.</li>
            <li> These salts from the Dead Sea impart special minerals in the skin while removing dead cells, bacteria and oils.</li>
            <li> Other commercial and homemade sugar/salt scrubs I&#x27;ve tried have either irritated my skin, dried it out too much, or left behind a kind of greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Once you get over the initial shock that when you open the jar,it really is dry salt, you can get to work with your facial(I</li>
            <li> you get a ton of this in a package and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The only drawback I can see is that I probably wouldn’t use this if you have dry skin-</li>
            <li> This has left my skin quite dry and \\&quot;bumpy\\</li>
            <li> but this tastes, looks and feels so much like common table salt that I question whether there is any difference.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and find that some products are too harsh or do nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not enough to keep me from using the salts, but I do have to be a bit careful about when and where on my face to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it on wet skin I found it to be deeply invigorating.</li>
            <li> This scrub is a bit harsh if you do have sensitive skin, as I do, you might want to add this to a soap , cleanser or a scrub.</li>
            <li> I use this product after steaming my face or after a long shower...</li>
            <li> you can mix with cleanser, masks or simply use on wet face.</li>
            <li> The container is bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> All come in larger than expected containers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure salt, so yes, you do need to moisten your face and/or mix it with a squirt of your usual face wash for it to be less harsh like any other pure salt scrubs.</li>
            <li> Unlike other exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried, Adovia scrubbed away the dullness AND prevented it from coming back during the day.</li>
            <li> but nope, this is a dry salt that you receive.</li>
            <li> It was more painful than using a different exfoliating product.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my face.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, I would be a bit hesitant to try because the products may dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, I would be a bit hesitant to try because the products may dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> My skin was not too dry after using it.  </li>
            <li> Read the write up of the product because I think it said if you have dry skin you can add oil to the salt.</li>
            <li> There is no lotion or cream and is strictly a dry salt scrub.</li>
            <li> I rinsed and patted dry.</li>
            <li> Using it this way, the scrub should last at least 2 months, if not a little longer.</li>
            <li> These Avodia salts are loose salts as in, they aren&#x27;t a paste or</li>
            <li> I only need to use this once a week, witch has never been with other scrubs!</li>
            <li> I get a small paper cup and take a little of it in the shower with me, where at the end, I gently wash my face and neck  with it, and then I use it on my hands.</li>
            <li> You can create a home microdermabrasion, or  you can mix a small scup into your cleanser for a that extra exfoliation and deep cleaning when you need it.</li>
            <li> I ended up placing mine in a different container that was mess</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little smoother after using it and I will be using this once a week as a facial scrub and callus</li>
            <li> Also if you have any open blemishes be prepared for a little burning.</li>
            <li> I tried everything I could think of to get the lid off, but after numerous, I realized I could not get the lid off without destroying it..</li>
            <li> Product is too rough on my face/ made my face rough</li>
            <li> But with this be careful</li>
            <li> and you can definitely tell that it&#x27;s working in getting rid of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I got the chance to try out the Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts.</li>
            <li> According to Adovia these facial salts:&lt;br /&gt;Improve your complexion&lt;br /&gt;Refresh and firm your skin</li>
            <li> Well, I ended up mixing it with a Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask.</li>
            <li> I grabbed a plastic cup, scooped some of the facemask into it, and then dumped some of the Dead Sea Facial Salts into it as well.</li>
            <li> I simply add in a few scoops to the water, and let my feet soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that the only ingredient is dead sea salts</li>
            <li> I use it all over, but am careful when using it on my face.  </li>
            <li> I wet my face and applied salts to my face and gave it a bit of a scrub all over.</li>
            <li> Be careful when opening up..</li>
            <li> On first try it was hard for me to get the grains onto my damp face, I added a little coconut oil to my hand and made it a little easier.</li>
            <li> I am planning to use the other products soon.</li>
            <li> other problem is that I have acne prone skin and sometimes have a zit on my face that has popped, leaving a scab.</li>
            <li> You really cannot go wrong with the Adovia Dead Sea Facial</li>
            <li> You really cannot go wrong with the Adovia Dead Sea Facial Salts.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face a few times a week, rubbing it on with a soft Konjac loofah sponge, I let it sit for a few minutes so my skin can fully absorb the minerals, and then I rinse all the dead skin cells off.</li>
            <li> Since a lot of salt scrubs are already prepared with oils and other stuff, I appreciate this one isn&#x27;t, because it allows me to use it &amp;#34;in the raw&amp;#34; or with whatever oils or other ingredients</li>
            <li> I have used other microdermabrasion at home treatments</li>
            <li> So, I prefer to mix a tiny amount into my usual cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin does not do well to fragrances due to my eczema...</li>
            <li> Due to these being made of salt, they dissolve as water mixes with them, and then it leaves a residue on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful when opening the jar.</li>
            <li> We had an especially harsh winter here in upstate New York</li>
            <li> My skin was by far not perfect, but I felt as if it visually looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that it handles both problems (dry skin on my forehead and oily skin on my chin) without missing a beat.</li>
            <li> It polishes off the dry dead skin, while also removing the oil that clogs pores and creates</li>
            <li> It gets rid of dead, dry skin and helps to unclog pores.</li>
            <li> it it wouldn&#x27;t be so messy (loose formula).</li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t personally compare, but from what I&#x27;ve heard from people that I know--it can get pretty painful .</li>
            <li> but I was not sure if the content was simple salt or dead sea salt since there was no tamper-proof sealing.</li>
            <li> I love to use exfoliating cleansers on my face, but I hate how damaging to the environment the microbeads are.</li>
            <li> These salts are rough, like taking plain sea salt and rubbing it all over your face.</li>
            <li> Clean your face and then exfoliate with this bad boy</li>
            <li> I love that there are not a host of nasty chemicals and such in this product-</li>
            <li> I am probably going to transfer the salts into a bottle of some sort so easier to dispense without making a mess.</li>
            <li> it was not full up to the neck.</li>
            <li> then I add a little water to my skin and leave it slightly dissolved on my face for 1-2 minutes and wash off.  </li>
            <li> I added a little bit of water</li>
            <li> so it went on a little bit smoother.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little bit now</li>
            <li> Not user friendly :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any additives,fillers, parabens, preservatives, or perfumes; just dead sea salt.</li>
            <li> I use the salt to exfoliate everyday, about 1/2 teaspoon.</li>
            <li> It removes the dead cell by making my face soft,smooth &amp; touchable.</li>
            <li> Plus they are usually round microbeads</li>
            <li> you skin with Dead Sea minerals&lt;</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Remove dead skin cells and pore clogging particles</li>
            <li> After a few minutes of doing this, I jumped into the shower and rinsed it all off.</li>
            <li> I could feel it working, stripping away the dead skin cells, as I applied it to my face.</li>
            <li> I used this treatment every day in the evening by putting some of the salt on my hands and slowly massaging it on to my wet face in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> I rinse with water and cleanse with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.</li>
            <li> I use these facial salts approximately once a week and the skin on my face looks so renewed.  </li>
            <li> It is 100% Dead Sea salt.</li>
            <li> (and maybe also to transfer a few tablespoons to another</li>
            <li> so wasted money.</li>
            <li> It is a bit harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few salt scrubs in the past and broke out in a rash afterwards but thankfully, I did not have that issue with this scrub.</li>
            <li> My skin was irritated for at least a half hour after using.</li>
            <li> it didnt make my face all nasty red  and distorted, i do have one complaint though the product was over full</li>
            <li> The 2 star rating is based off of the following : The item was delivered unsealed, which is a bit unsettling.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for smoothe skin, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts.</li>
            <li> My skin was never acne prone, until I turned 20 and then it was like all the acne issues teenagers usually experience, I started experiencing.</li>
            <li> Being that this is for your face, it makes sense that the salt grains are small.</li>
            <li> allergic to baby wipes, and for months I have suffered from small itchy bumps on my hands.</li>
            <li> so I usually mix it with a creamy face wash...</li>
            <li> As you may know by know, all of their products are made with minerals from the Dead Sea!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel like any exfoliating product I had used in the past.</li>
            <li> scrub is very tough, so only use it if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> However,  my skin has been dry due to the cold weather.</li>
            <li> Not good for my face, these were way too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any unnecessary friction and the acne I had flaring, calmed down</li>
            <li> However, because of the container, it did make it difficult to use without making a little bit of a mess with salt all over the place.</li>
            <li> I have used it for five days now and have hardly put a dent in the contents.</li>
            <li> I will be using this at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I mean could you imagine having to use gloves every time you have to change your babies diapers?</li>
            <li> No more useless microbeads.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the 5-star reviews left here, but I was thoroughly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, because I  had really looked forward to trying this product..</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> They do say for dry skin types, you can try mixing it with an oil base</li>
            <li> However I found trying to exfoliate with this quite difficult.</li>
            <li> The listing failed to mention it has a fragrance of Sea Breeze.</li>
            <li> And this product being for acne conditions was very irritating and it burned a lot for me.</li>
            <li> My skin was in desperate need of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the granuals may be too abrasive</li>
            <li> It would be impossible not to,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing to have acne this bad at this age.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing to have acne this bad at this age.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with something to scoop out the salts, however, that aside, it is so versatile .</li>
            <li> Just received the product and a bit disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with a scoop.</li>
            <li> Hate wasting anything</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great facial exfoliant.</li>
            <li> My face definitely feels softer after using the product. The 2 star rating is based off of the following : The item was delivered unsealed, which is a bit unsettling. That aside, the biggest issues are that it makes a huge mess and a lot of it is wasted (unintentionally of course ). I&#x27;m not really one for making reviews of products unless it brings a superb happiness. This is completely different because now I have buyer&#x27;s remorse. Hate wasting anything and it&#x27;s pretty tricky not to make a gigantic mess. In summary, if this product came packaged better then probably give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This is not what I thought it was it&#x27;s like actual sal. I need to find a way to mix it with somthing but I like i.</li>
            <li> This is a great to exfoliate, made my skin sure soft!</li>
            <li> Great consistency.  I mix with cleanser and leave on for 5-10 minutes after massaging into face.  Works great on body as well.  Nice Product.  Fast Shipping and great follow-up service!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure, but I think if someone snuck into my bathroom and replaced this &amp;#34;exfoliating sea salt&amp;#34; with kosher salt, I&#x27;m pretty sure I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. Seems VERY pricey for what it is. It exfoliates just fine and does the job, but I would not pay more than $5 for this in the future.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, because I  had really looked forward to trying this product.. I tried everything I could think of to get the lid off, but after numerous, I realized I could not get the lid off without destroying it.. Therefore, I had to return it.</li>
            <li> this feels great !! ilove to use itin the evening after being outside all day..very refreshing!!</li>
            <li> Adovia is a great product line... and this is nothing short of a great jar of facial salts. Works wonders with or without soap. If you&#x27;re looking for smoothe skin, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts.</li>
            <li> I have tried several exfoliating products and have not ever found one that makes my skin feel as smooth as the Adovia Sea Salt.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using it every night for about a week and am very, very pleased.  My skin looks and feels better than it has in quite some time.  I am 54 years old and find that some products are too harsh or do nothing at all.  I would most definitely recommend this product, am so happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE Them. This is good, but not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product and other Adovia products actually, recommended to me by my dermatologist! The exfoliator is not rough on my sensitive skin and it leaves a smooth soft finish once washed!</li>
            <li> This is a good product but be careful because it can make ur face a bit sensitive</li>
            <li> I mixed some of the salt (don&#x27;t need more than a pinch!) with my regular cleanser and massaged it onto my face. It felt a little rough, but when I rinsed it off my skin looked and felt great. I am probably going to transfer the salts into a bottle of some sort so easier to dispense without making a mess. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome product it&#x27;s doing wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> Love it! works great!</li>
            <li> I exfoliate on a regular and wanted to give this a try.  I have purchased many other Adovia products and have had good experiences and this also is a great scrub. I actually expected it to be a salt scrub with some kind of oil or something but nope, this is a dry salt that you receive. I received this to test and give my honest opinion.  I mixed mine with coconut oil and messaged it into my face and neck and then rinsed it off and blotted my face.  I just mixed the salt and oil until i got the consistency that I wanted.  My skin was really soft afterwards and looked good. I have really sensitive skin and psoriasis and this salt scrub did not irritate my skin either.  I am really happy with the ingredients as there is only dead sea salt.  It doesn&#x27;t have any additives,fillers, parabens, preservatives, or perfumes; just dead sea salt. I have tried a few salt scrubs in the past and broke out in a rash afterwards but thankfully, I did not have that issue with this scrub. I am really pleased with this scrub as my previous scrubs didn&#x27;t do as well as this one and when I read the others ingredient list, it&#x27;s full of chemicals and fillers. I am very happy I tried this one.</li>
            <li> The odor is SO strong.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely product. A good natural germ killer and cleanser. If one thinks the scrub can be too harsh on sensitive skin, then what I do is put it in warm water then splash on. Rinse with regular water. But when in doubt, see a Dr!</li>
            <li> Great amount of product--- I use it on my face and body.  Recently used it to exfoliate before spray tanning and ended up with the best tan yet.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Product is too rough on my face/ made my face rough</li>
            <li> I love the product. It leaves my skin soft and it has a glow. My skin was in desperate need of exfoliation. I am planning to use the other products soon.</li>
            <li> This product is okay...it does the job, but I&#x27;m used to using ones that have more of a liquid built in. With this product, I would recommend mixing it with either a cleanser, or an oil.  In the end, it did leave my skin feeling good, but I could have just as easily used the sea salt from my kitchen!</li>
            <li> Very nice scrub.  I only used it a few times but it is very nice and really feels good when using it, gets your rosey&#x27;s back in your cheeks!  I highly recommend.  Please realize though this is to be used with either soap or facial cleanser, it is pure Dead Sea Salt</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!. I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things! This one is clearly a hit and I will be purchasing again for myself and my daughter! I have already seen a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> I love anything that will exfoliate my skin. But with this be careful cause I was not expecting for it to just be salts, so some did go all over the place when I opened it. Regardless of that I was ready to use as soon as it arrived  I reached for my favorite soap and used it on my face. That was an amazing feels since I never used salts before. My skin felt so refreshed and clean after that washing. Even my hands got some love and i surprised because i was thinking the salts would melt just like regular salt but nope it stayed on til i rinsed it off. That night I took it in the shower with me. My skin felt so smooth and soft.  I am in love with these salts now i just use for my face, it has not left my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This product helps remove my dead skin and keep my face clean and moisturize.</li>
            <li> This exfoliation facial sea salt makes my face feel really clean, and it gives my skin a healthy glow. I mix the sea salts with honey to exfoliate my skin. Honestly, I love the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I got into sea salt scrubs after being gifted a sample container of a different, more expensive brand. It did sting, at first, but it really removed the oil build-ups. I&#x27;ve purchased plenty of more expensive face scrubs, but sea salt has worked the best for my oily skin and cystic acne. It&#x27;s pure salt, so yes, you do need to moisten your face and/or mix it with a squirt of your usual face wash for it to be less harsh like any other pure salt scrubs. You also don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, so gradually add more if need to. It dissolves in water as with normal salt and this also takes the edge off if you can&#x27;t deal with the sharper edges. I mix this with is a foam cleaner and warm water on my face before scrubbing it into my skin. If I feel like I need more, I pinch some off and rub it on the spot needed. This entire jar with daily+ usage lasted me for two months and I&#x27;m ordering my second now. For ~$11 on Prime, it&#x27;s a great deal to at least try it if you haven&#x27;t found something to really give you a good clean feeling yet.</li>
            <li> Adovia dead sea minerals products are amazing. These facial salts polish your skin beautifully and naturally. I use them once a week and my skin is positively glowing. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the Microdermabrasion Facial Salts and they are absolutely amazing! I use them with my facial cleanser 3-4 times a week and it always leaves my skin feeling extremely clean and smooth! Adovia has other wonderful products, like the mud soap and night renewal cream...I&#x27;m definitely a committed customer!</li>
            <li> This has been absolutely amazing for my skin. My face looks so different after I exfoliate with the salt. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep this pet of my regimen.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling fresh and new</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks and the product seems to be tightening my facial skin and leaving a more revitalized look. I use the salt to exfoliate everyday, about 1/2 teaspoon. I also use a vitamin c serum to compliment the treatment. The acne on my face hasn&#x27;t had a noticeable change yet. On the back of my head, along the hairline, the salt has reduced the acne and cleared some of it up. So it is working, I probably need more time on my face. I would say give it a try, not only cause it works, the value is great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be continued...........</li>
            <li> Lol did nothing for me. I read reviews and went to Sephora found a new product I love! Blackbox is the best, expensive but incredibly worth it! This does nothing compared. Didn&#x27;t notice a difference with this- want the product for free? Use table salt.</li>
            <li> This product works better than I anticipated. It worked very much like a light microderm that you can do at home, which I was very excited about. You should not scrub hard because you can really create a problem if you use too much pressure. However, these granules are large enough that you can gently massage them all over your face for several minutes and it you will notice a difference after you rinse. It would be impossible not to, I&#x27;d think.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed mine with just the smallest amount of rose hip oil (very small amount) because I wanted to get that microderm experience. You can adjust to what works for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I wish this had a little spoon or something with it to make dispensing easier, but that would probably lower the amount of product you get, so I&#x27;ll be happy with this current arrangement. It&#x27;s a full full jar, so they do not skimp on it for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I got this from Adovia at a promotional price in order to test it, and this is my honest opinion after using this product. I do recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this sea salts. I mix it with  my Adovia bar soap and apply it to my face. My face is very oily and I get a lot of breakouts. Since using this product I noticed my face is starting to look so much better. A lot of my redness is going away. I&#x27;m not getting as many pimples either. It leaves my skin with such a nice smooth feeling.  Absolutely love this!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Take years away from applying this. I have used this every other day and have noticed fine lines getting smoother. I use powder foundation and before I was noticing how old my face my looking. But after a week my face did not look caked on. It gets rid of dry dead skin and leave face smooth and glowing. I do apply a moisturizer after making it much more softer.</li>
            <li> Very fine scrub! The entire jar is filled with, fine scrub. Just mix with a creamy face wash and you are set for months! Exfoliates and leaves skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time owning exfoliating facial sea salt and I really like it.  I am able to exfoliate in the comforts of my home.  I like how it feels on my skin and you can definitely tell that it&#x27;s working in getting rid of dead skin.  It does feel like scrubbing salt on your face.  My skin feels smooth afterwards.  Just be careful if you do have sensitive skin like mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  This product was bought at a promotional price for the purpose of a product review.  This is also an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Nice but it&#x27;s just salt...</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product since I use it daily on my face and chest. It may have the salts in there but it is naturally gentle on my skin. Thanks for another wonderful product Adovia!</li>
            <li> FINALLY! This scrub is perfect for me! I have oily skin, and have searched my entire adult life for a good scrub. This scrub is great for me! There is no oils or anything else that disagrees with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is very tough, so only use it if you have oily skin. I only need to use this once a week, witch has never been with other scrubs! It reminds me of frolicking in the ocean all day, showering that evening, and experiencing that clean, exfoliated facial-like feel. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good exfoliate for awhile now. I wanted smoother softer skin on my face. I also thought it would be good for the numerous black heads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free in just a couple of days. The jar was a big jar that is sure to last a long time, I was really impressed by that. I immediately went to the bathroom to try it out. When I opened it the product was full right to the top which is nice, you know you are getting your moneys worth. The salt was course but not too course. I added a little bit of water so it went on a little bit smoother. I rubbed it in for about a minute making sure to focus on my blackheads. It had a nice subtle scent. It felt really good rubbing it into my skin. After I was done it rinsed off easily and left my skin feeling soft and refreshed. It also helped quite a bit with my blackheads which was great! I have been using it for a little bit now and I am just as happy with it. I have noticed huge reduction in the blackheads and has helped them from reoccurring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone. It has worked well for my dry skin and also had been effective on my daughters oily skin. A must try!!!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this facial salt scrub it works well and is easy to use. you get a ton of this in a package and it will last a long time. you can use it out of the jar or add some of the product to your favorite facial beauty wash or bar . I love Adovia products and was so happy I received a sample free to try and do this review for my blog youtube and amazon</li>
            <li> The large amount of product inside the container means that you can use a generous amount instead of only using a little bit. It&#x27;s easy to use and apply as a facial scrub. You can also use this product as a body scrub. The sea salts are very fine which makes it a little messy to use the first time since the product is really packed into the container. My skin felt a little smoother after using it and I will be using this once a week as a facial scrub and callus remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a full review, check out my blog: laceituplove.blogspot.com.</li>
            <li> I was sent this to review for my GlamRiver blog and I have been very impressed!  I have very oily skin so exfoliating is a must for me and this product works great.  This will be a product that I will make a purchase of in the future, you get a lot of product for the price AND it works great!  This is a WIN, WIN!!! :)</li>
            <li> Well, this is really a unique facial exfoliating salt that I have used! I used it as a mask and it works wonderful! It removes the dead cell by making my face soft,smooth &amp; touchable. I love how it feels on my skin. I am quite sure it is also works as a body scrub as well. Love that it didn&#x27;t melt on the mask fast so that you can exfoliate well!! It&#x27;s very natural and great for dry skin too!Affordable as well.  I think this salt will be lasting for  six to seven months for me...&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for the best exfoliating mineral salt , then I highly recommend this Adovia salt to try out.</li>
            <li> Love love love! I was lucky enough to receive this to review and I am in love with this product! I have acne prone skin and especially in the summer break out a lot. I used this and my skin felt so soft and smooth! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> With summer here, I like to forgo wearing a lot of heavy makeup and really let my skin shine on it’s own. That’s why not only moisturizing, but also exfoliating are extra important steps in my skincare routine. Having tried and loved other Adovia products, I was excited to test out their Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sparkling white salts felt so pure and clean going on my skin. These salts from the Dead Sea impart special minerals in the skin while removing dead cells, bacteria and oils. The result is a smooth, glowing complexion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great feature during the hot months when my skin is more often exposed to the elements, as well as dirt and sweat. You can feel the luxurious salts scrubbing away the layers of impurity and leaving your skin tingling fresh. You can also add the salts to a facial mask or cleanser for easier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of use, I definitely feel like it has shrunken and tightened my pores and improved the overall radiance of my skin. The only drawback I can see is that I probably wouldn’t use this if you have dry skin- the natural drying effect of the salts might be too much. They do say for dry skin types, you can try mixing it with an oil base so you get the best of both scrubbing and moisturizing. I plan to continue using this and I think the girls will enjoy it too on our fun in-home spa days!</li>
            <li> I love to use exfoliating cleansers on my face, but I hate how damaging to the environment the microbeads are. I am so glad there is an alternative that I don&#x27;t have to feel guilty about using. This worked great for exfoliating. I mixed it with my normal face wash since it was easier for my to use that way. It worked really well at reducing the blackheads that i tend to get on my nose and I could feel that my skin was smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have two complaints. When I first opened the container, salt spilled everywhere. I also wish it was in a container that dispensed better. Like a shaker. With this container, I either have to use a spoon to scoop it out or I have to get my fingers damp so the salt will stick to my fingers when I put them in. The problem with using damp fingers is I worry about excess moisture getting into the container and causing clumping over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem is that I have acne prone skin and sometimes have a zit on my face that has popped, leaving a scab. Exfoliating can break those scabs open a bit and when the salt gets in a sore it hurts a lot. It was more painful than using a different exfoliating product. It&#x27;s not enough to keep me from using the salts, but I do have to be a bit careful about when and where on my face to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to review to give my honest opinion. You get a lot in this jar, I must say. This salt is a real  The size of the grains is enough to really give your skin a good massage. On first try it was hard for me to get the grains onto my damp face, I added a little coconut oil to my hand and made it a little easier. I got a good massage in and with it and there was not burning. My face felt refreshed and clean (dead skin removed) after use. I will be using this at least once a week. I know for sure it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I did not realize I would be getting nothing but salt lol, was I in for a shock. However, after reading the instructions on how to use this......I LOVE IT! My skin looks so much better, this seems to bring life back into my skin. My pores are looking smaller, I am really pleased. Just be careful NOT to get the salt in your eyes, it really burns. Other than that, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> When I found out I was chosen to receive #Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts FREE for testing purposes, I was beside myself excited. We had an especially harsh winter here in upstate New York so I have been outside a lot ever since the sun has appeared. This has left my skin quite dry and \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; (you all know those sun pimples I am talking about). Not to mention the recent removal of something from my forehead which had left me overly cautious washing around the stitches. I have heard that sea salt scrubs are good for this and I have always wanted to try one. Right away I noticed how large this jar is. It will last a long time, that is for sure! As printed on the tub, there are two ways to use this product. The first is to wash your face, pat dry, and apply the salt with a circular motion on your face, rinse with warm water.  The second is to mix salt with #adovia mineral cream or soap, create a lather, and wash your face with it using a circular motion, rinse with warm water. I tried both of these versions and I must say, I like them both! After using just the salt on my face, I felt an immediate difference. My face felt much smoother - much \\&quot;cooler\\&quot; if that makes sense. It felt like a whole new face! The next night I tried making my own scrub with the soap and I really liked that too. I liked the feel of the salt in the soap, I felt like I got a deeper clean with it. Again, my face felt amazing afterwards. I have been using the sea salt for 4 nights now and I am absolutely in love! I plan to keep sea salt as a part of my skin care routine and I suggest you do the same! Trust me, your face will feel amazing!</li>
            <li> k i got my product for free a day ago and i practically dove into the package there are a few reasons why one i love making things and two well i wanted to see these salts, these salts are baby fine salts like you would use in the amazing lip scrubs or body buffing salts in fancy spas and resorts! Just what i needed for my lips i mixed a bit and made a lip scrub also today am going to mix some to make my face scrub, i love it, it has a very light light scent almost unnoticeable it didnt make my face all nasty red  and distorted, i do have one complaint though the product was over full and i went to open it and i got it all over like a cluts so be careful you do get your monies worth!  No monitory compensation was received. I was not required to write a positive review, Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine.</li>
            <li> When I received my Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts I was happy to see that it was dry salt. The actual grain of salt is nice size and great for exfoliating. Some exfoliators contain plastic beads to exfoliate and they just do not do the job right. Plus they are usually round microbeads and they just float on to of the skin not exfoliating. These Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts are true grains of salt and give you a nice deep exfoliation. I was actually expecting this to come in a cleanser but I was excited to see it was just the salt. I can use it alone or I can pair it with my cleanser. After using it on wet skin I found it to be deeply invigorating. This kind of grain of salt is exactly what I have been looking for. No more useless microbeads. This is some real exfoliation going on here. This is my new favorite product. Not only is it completely versatile, but there is enough in here to last a long time. For me exfoliation is an important part of my skin care routine. It helps keep my pores fresh and minimizes any blemishes I may get. I absolutely love this product and its hands down the best exfoliator I have ever used. Although I did receive this product to review all of these opinions are my own. This really is a top notch exfoliator and the  dead sea salts are as well. I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, I do think it does a great job at gently but efficiently exfoliating the face. What I love most is that this product is multi-tasking. I use this also as a body scrub, lip scrub and you can even make your own beach texturizing spray using this, coconut oil, water and essential oils. I didn&#x27;t like that it was almost overflowing so even though I do think it&#x27;s great you get SO much product, a TINY bit less would be great so it&#x27;s not spilling everywhere when you first get it. Other than that I think this product is 100% worth the purchase and will last you a long time and give you many different ways in which to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> My skin was never acne prone, until my 20&#x27;s after I got married and started having babies! I guess hormones are to blame but have yet to find a solution to that. I have tried every type of exfoliator, cleanser, soap, and mask. I got the chance to try out the Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts. According to Adovia these facial salts:&lt;br /&gt;Improve your complexion&lt;br /&gt;Refresh and firm your skin&lt;br /&gt;Infuse you skin with Dead Sea minerals&lt;br /&gt;Remove dead skin cells and pore clogging particles&lt;br /&gt;Eliminates bacteria and excess oil&lt;br /&gt;Stimulates facial skin circulation and tightens pores.&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Apply salt to a clean wet face and massage gently. Rinse off with warm water. Follow with moisturizer and/or follow your normal skin regime. If you have sensitive skin you need to mix these facial salts with a cleanser or mask to create a gentle scrub. An extra tip is to mix the facial salts with some olive oil. You get the exfoliating effect and skin stays moisturized and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so I use it about 2/3 times a week so it doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my face. I mix it with my Mary Kay Clear Proof Clarifying Cleansing Gel. When I use it my face feels so clean and smooth. I also use it on my neck, chest, and upper arms where I breakout with those red bumps and it really helps! Overall, I would most definitely recommend Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts to everyone who has oily and blemish filled skin, even for normal or combination as well. If you have dry skin, make sure to only use a couple times a week so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin more. Be careful when opening it because it is filled to the top! It is a 2 month supply and pretty reasonably priced plus they offer a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and or leave a comment. I enjoy writing reviews and hearing feedback about what I have written as I feel reviews helpthose interested make an informed decision before purchasing. I also feel that honest and informative reviews improve a product by providing insight to the company.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. No visible improvements in skin - I&#x27;ve only used it twice.  I&#x27;ll update if my increased usage shows improvement.</li>
            <li> My skin was never acne prone, until I turned 20 and then it was like all the acne issues teenagers usually experience, I started experiencing. I have tried every type of exfoliator, cleanser, soap, and mask that is available on the market. I have found things that work – but they seem to only work for a short period and then there are obviously the products that do not end up working at all. Therefore, when I got the chance to try out the Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts, I was rather excited because it was a completely different concept than I was used to. Reading through the directions, the first thing that I noticed was that you can use the Dead Sea Facial Salts on their own with just water or you can mix it with your cleanser, soap or a face mask. After reading the directions, I decided to open the container up to check the product out. That ended up being a huge mess! The Dead Sea Salt went everywhere because the container was filled to the rim. Normally, that would be a good thing; however, with a product like this, it made using it a bit difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time that I went to use the Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts, I was not sure if I wanted to try them out on their own or mix it with something. Well, I ended up mixing it with a Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask. I grabbed a plastic cup, scooped some of the facemask into it, and then dumped some of the Dead Sea Facial Salts into it as well. Mixing the concoction all up, I applied it and instead of letting it sit as you normally would, I massaged the mixture into my face. After a few minutes of doing this, I jumped into the shower and rinsed it all off. When I got out of the shower, my face felt so clean and smooth, as a lot of the dead skin and unsightly blemishes had been removed. My skin was by far not perfect, but I felt as if it visually looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would most definitely recommend Adovia Exfoliating Dead Sea Facial Salts to everyone who has oily and blemish filled skin. It would work for normal or combination as well. If you have dry skin, I would be a bit hesitant to try because the products may dry your skin out. You really cannot go wrong with the Adovia Dead Sea Facial Salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent the item in exchange for my honest opinion.

            <li> Adovia has a really good product line that contains Dead Sea Salt as one of the active ingredients. I&#x27;ve tried many, and was very happy with them all. Adovia recently sent me a two month supply of Exfoliating Sea Salts in a big jar! That&#x27;s all it is---Dead Sea Salt.&lt;br /&gt;This product really does do what the description says. I use it on my face a few times a week, rubbing it on with a soft Konjac loofah sponge, I let it sit for a few minutes so my skin can fully absorb the minerals, and then I rinse all the dead skin cells off. Afterward, my skin feels super exfoliated, and my pores are tightened. I&#x27;ve actually never had Microdermabrasion done, so I guess I can&#x27;t personally compare, but from what I&#x27;ve heard from people that I know--it can get pretty painful . Why would I bother doing that when I can get great results from just using this exfoliating salt scrub a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause excess drying of my skin, helps with acne when I break out, and leaves my face soft to the touch. I also like that I can use it as a body scrub if I want to as well.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend of course. It is one of my favorite products that I&#x27;ve received from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I was sent a complimentary jar in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Adovia has AMAZING products. I have tried several of them and they don&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin. These sea salts are no different. I use them every day in the shower and love them!</li>
            <li> wonderful product.  will order again an again</li>
            <li> This was fun to use. I just used it up too fast! It did not hurt my skin and it gave me nice, smoothe skin where I used it.</li>
            <li> I am a lover of Adovia products, so I was pretty excited about this one since I have yet to have a complaint about anything by Adovia. However this Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts just wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of product you get in this container is above and beyond expectations. It is filled to the brim with the sea salt. However this was quite troublesome when trying to open. When I first opened it, salt went everywhere in my home. Even I was covered in salt. Because its a fine grain salt, like table salt, cleaning it up was a job. Many of the grains get stuck in between the lid and the container, so when you go to open it, salt comes out. I ended up placing mine in a different container that was mess free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto using it. I love all sorts of bath and body salts. Being that this is for your face, it makes sense that the salt grains are small. However I found trying to exfoliate with this quite difficult. I would apply some on my finger tips, and place it on my damp face and being doing circular motions. Within 20 seconds the salt had disintegrated and I had to dip my fingers into the salt to get more to use. Now this did work great at exfoliating my skin in the first few seconds of use, however it just didn&#x27;t last. I ended up mixing some of the salt in with a cleanser that I have, and it worked a bit better that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day I did find a great use for this... adding it to my pedicure routine. I simply add in a few scoops to the water, and let my feet soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall rating of this would be like 3.5 stars, because it does have some faults, but using it for my feet has been wonderful. If the container was fixed so the product doesn&#x27;t easily spill out, I would change this rating to a 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a pretty large jar, they did not skimp at all. The jar I received was literally filled to the rim with dead sea salt.. Well worth the price! However, because of the container, it did make it difficult to use without making a little bit of a mess with salt all over the place. But, I just got a little scoop and that&#x27;s been working great! The crystals were finely grind and very soft. They had no scent or perfume to it. I like that you can choose how much you want to apply, depending on how harsh or exfoliating you want your scrub to be. The direction are pretty easy to follow. For me, using the salt/crystals on their own was a bit harsh/rough for my skin, leaving my face a little red after use. I chose to mix the salt/crystals with the lather of my soap and that was perfect! I could feel it working, stripping away the dead skin cells, as I applied it to my face. I was amazed by how soft and smooth my face was, after I was done... My skin just looked refreshed and felt great! I have even used this product on my elbows and the heals of my feet and it worked too! I believe this product does what it says and I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this to review.  All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend a week at the beach every summer.  My skin needs major exfoliation after.  I have always had a hard time finding a product I absolutely loved until I tried this!  I love that you can choose how much dead sea salt to use.  I would wash my face and put the salt on my face and rub it in a circular motion.  It was great on my face and neck.  I decided to try it on my shoulders and upper arms.  It was wonderful there as well.  My skin was not too dry after using it.  I will definitely have this on hand every summer.</li>
            <li> My review of this product is it kept up with the standard and quality that I have come to expect from Adovia. Once you get over the initial shock that when you open the jar,it really is dry salt, you can get to work with your facial(I have always used the ones that are already somewhat liquid). I used mine with just water to get it to apply and had to find the right combo of water and product. It goes on great. You scrub, rinse and voila!!!! My face felt softer and cleaner, and I could feel that it was clearly a new layer of skin on my face. It&#x27;s a great exfoliator!!!.It took off a lot of the dead skin and I consider this a new weapon in my fight for beauty.  I do have an addendum to share though. Make sure that you keep your mouth closed when you rinse or you will end up with a mouth full of salt.....lol. I&#x27;m just saying.....</li>
            <li> I recently tried this. I found that it handles both problems (dry skin on my forehead and oily skin on my chin) without missing a beat. It polishes off the dry dead skin, while also removing the oil that clogs pores and creates blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my skin feels after I have exfoliated it! It&#x27;s soft and feels much more even. It no longer feels oily or dry, but primed and ready for me to apply makeup. I find that when I exfoliate prior to applying makeup (which I don&#x27;t wear often, maybe once or twice a week), my makeup looks much smoother and natural than when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to scrubbing the (for lack of a better term) gunk off of your face, Adovia&#x27;s special salt scrub adds minerals (it comes from the Dead Sea!), leaving your face more radiant than before. I do not recommend using this every day, as your skin needs time to regenerate, but rather, using it every 3 days. Using it this way, the scrub should last at least 2 months, if not a little longer. The tub is 12.3 oz, a really nice size for the price ($19)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product to facilitate my review. My opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly! It made my skin so smooth and radiant even when I tried it the first time. It&#x27;s a great product for the price and even more because it works. I&#x27;m pregnant and I had some acne due to my hormones and it definitely helped getting rid of it. The shipping was very fast as well.

            <li> I think I can safely say that when it comes to amazing quality beauty products at a reasonable price,  my favorite products are fromAdovia.  Hands down,  some of the best products I have ever tried. (And believe me, that&#x27;s a loooooooong list!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of facial scrubs and have tried many in my search for the perfect one. Let&#x27;s face it, not to many of us have the time or money to go by the spa or dermatologist office to get a microdermabrasion treatment. I know I don&#x27;t anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as the product was in my hands, I rushed to try it and just as i expected, it was PHENOMENAL!  Clean your face and then exfoliate with this bad boy and you are truly on the way to amazing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s salt, so I advise you to massage your face gently as a vigorous scrub is going to irritate. I&#x27;ve done it every 3-4 days and my skin is brighter, softer, and feels tighter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia, I seriously love you and you really have made us &#x27;Dixie Dolls Glow&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

            <li> When I was in the Florida Keys I bought a similar product which contained Florida sea salt however it was mixed with coconut oil. My dermatologist says I have oily skin so that product just didn&#x27;t work. I searched on Amazon and found several products from Adovia and bought the sea salt scrub and moisturizer. The sea salt scrub comes as &amp;#34;sea salt&amp;#34; without oil. First time I used it my face felt very clean and had a tingle to it. Then applied the moisturizer and it felt even better. The moisturizer is for both men and women. Read the write up of the product because I think it said if you have dry skin you can add oil to the salt. I&#x27;m very impressed with the company as I have received 2 emails from them explaining the product and how it was developed. So impressed I just ordered the face and body soap and mud mask. I also ordered the mud bar soap for my partner who has psoriasis to try that. I really feel like I got my monies worth on this otherwise I would not have ordered additional products. Great service, great product. Try it!</li>
            <li> First of all, you get a lot of product. The first thing I noticed was how heavy the jar felt-  it&#x27;s over 12 ounces so it&#x27;s a great value. It says this is a 2-month supply but I suspect with my usage (3 times a week or so) it will last longer. Your mileage may vary. In fact the jar came sooo packed to the brim it spilled over a bit when I opened it and the first few times I scooped some out... my only issue with this product so far, and a minor one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that the only ingredient is dead sea salts and it&#x27;s not tested on animals. No fragrances, dyes, etc. Since a lot of salt scrubs are already prepared with oils and other stuff, I appreciate this one isn&#x27;t, because it allows me to use it &amp;#34;in the raw&amp;#34; or with whatever oils or other ingredients I know work well on my skin. The texture is much finer than most exfoliating products I&#x27;ve used, similar to white sugar, which I like. Coarse exfoliants just tear skin up. For the record, I have combination skin that&#x27;s somewhat sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this product is how SOFT it leaves my skin feeling without leaving behind any residue. Other commercial and homemade sugar/salt scrubs I&#x27;ve tried have either irritated my skin, dried it out too much, or left behind a kind of greasy residue. This doesn&#x27;t do any of that. My skin feels freshly washed, clean and soft enough I can often skip moisturizer. LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive this product for a review. The Adovia products I have tried so far have far passed my expectations. The salts come in a huge 12.3 oz jar. It says on the site that this is a two month supply, but I feel that this would last longer than that. I have used it for five days now and have hardly put a dent in the contents. The salts themselves have no smell. I used this treatment every day in the evening by putting some of the salt on my hands and slowly massaging it on to my wet face in a circular motion. The last two days I put it into another scrub that I have to try to see if it still gave me the same effects. It did! This scrub is a bit harsh if you do have sensitive skin, as I do, you might want to add this to a soap , cleanser or a scrub. I was fine just using the product by itself, but everyone’s face is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed was how much better my face felt. You could really tell how much of the dead skin was removed. My face was so soft! The next three days my face just felt better all around and more radiant. I did notice that I did not have any breakouts during the period I used this product. Which is totally amazing. In the summer time, my face is always breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a great exfoliating treatment for the face. I think this product does everything it states and is perfect for what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...leaves your skin very soft. Only used it once so far. Be careful if you have sensitive skin, be sure your face is completely wet. Best used in the shower.</li>
            <li> Cleansing every morning has become a spa like experience thanks to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I wouldn’t expect a deeper clean from a salt soap, unless of course, salt itself was added to the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding just a pinch of Adovia Exfoliating Sea Salt followto their bar cleanser strips the skin of surface oil, minimizing pores, and firming skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For radiant skin, I combine Adovia Exfoliating Sea Salts and Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I add 1/2 Tablespoon of Adovia Exfoliating Sea Salt to a clean makeup pot and cover it with Pure Argan Oil and stir. Once it is thoroughly mixed, I apply the salt scrub to my face and gently massage it into my skin. I rinse with water and cleanse with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. My face is softer and has a luminous glow.</li>
            <li> Well, it is definitely salt. I am no expert on cosmetics or facial products and have never used facial salts before but this tastes, looks and feels so much like common table salt that I question whether there is any difference. I am not convinced that I could not put table salt on my face and get the same results but I am sure it does do some exfoliating so I will still rate it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used other microdermabrasion at home treatments and I like them, but still compared them to regular face scrubs.I have never used a Salt scrub before on my face. I was worried and excited at the same time. I was worried my eyes were going to get salt in my eye and we all know what that feels like. Thankfully as many times as I have used it, that has never happened. I just take my wet fingertips and touch the top of the container and start to scrub. I use the same method for each side of my face. If you are like me and love and extremely abrasive facial scrub then this will be the most abrasive scrub/microdermabrasion you will find. There is no lotion or cream and is strictly a dry salt scrub. As with sugar scrubs this will not melt away like those. This will let you scrub to your hearts desire. I usually use a scrub mostly every night, but with this it is definitely a once a week use. This is exactly what I thought a microdermabrasion should feel like. I think I scrubbed till I was scrubbed out. Also if you have any open blemishes be prepared for a little burning. Overall I love this and it is extremely effective! I received the product for an unbiased and uncompensated review.</li>
            <li> I think that the Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts is the perfect solution for my acne prone, and oily complexion! After my first and every application after my face looks brighter, and feel so soft! I love that it’s gentle, and not abrasive on the skin. There is no scent, and it doesn’t irritate the skin. Since Adovia is 100% pure Dead Sea Salts you can use it every day, but typically is best to use twice a week. I don’t only use the Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts on my face, I like to use it on my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m allergic to baby wipes, and for months I have suffered from small itchy bumps on my hands. My hubby came up with the idea of treating myself with the Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts. I dipped my hands in warm water, and sprinkled some of the salts on my hand, and massaged. After the application I did not experience itchiness, and my hands felt so smooth! I felt such a relief! I mean could you imagine having to use gloves every time you have to change your babies diapers? I’m so glad this product works! I love using Adovia, and I am truly grateful for every opportunity I get to try them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure; I was given Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin type... I use this product after steaming my face or after a long shower... it&#x27;s pretty strong - so I usually mix it with a creamy face wash... It gets rid of dead, dry skin and helps to unclog pores. I would give it 5 stars it it wouldn&#x27;t be so messy (loose formula).</li>
            <li> I first cleansed my face with Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Salt Mineral Bar that you can also purchase on Amazon. I then wet my face and got a pinch full of salts and gently exfoliated my face and rinsed with water. Afterward my face felt smooth and looked remarkably brighter just as the product claimed. I have liked this exfoliating product more than any other I&#x27;ve tried before and that&#x27;s saying something because I&#x27;ve tried SO many over the years that don&#x27;t work or are too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works even better with the rest of Adovia&#x27;s product line. I was impressed by the size of the container of sea salts you get (2 month supply). I felt as though I could use as much as I needed without the need to skimp. Overall, I really enjoyed the salts and would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

I did not notice a difference and my face felt like it had residue left on it.  The second time I mixed it with my facial cleanser as the nice ladies at Adovia recommended and it added a nice exfoliating factor to my wash that helped scrub my pores!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMc34fb13913eb1620556eb40df8fdf662&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;.

            <li> It is so easy to exfoliate your face with Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts.  I use these facial salts approximately once a week and the skin on my face looks so renewed.  I have been using a number of Adovia products for quite a while now and I love them all.  Adovia sells only high quality products.</li>
            <li> I feel very clean after using this product.  I use it all over, but am careful when using it on my face.  The grains are quite abrasive.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product. I did not think the exfoliating worked well .</li>
            <li> I have very sensative skin. And this product being for acne conditions was very irritating and it burned a lot for me. This may not bdvtge case fur call skin  types but the exfoliation and the salt was not working for me.  I&#x27;ve used like salts  for bath soaks which work great but no scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Not good for my face, these were way too harsh.  (I have sensitive skin.)  Works well to exfoliate skin on my back and arms though.</li>
            <li> Loved it made my face feel solo clean and I will continue to buy this as I run out.</li>
            <li> The salts are a nice exfoliator without micro beads clogging up our environment. It is a large container.</li>
            <li> This has worked great for my skin. I have much better skin when I mix this with a normal facewash than I did when I used Proactive. I exfoliate first then I add a little water to my skin and leave it slightly dissolved on my face for 1-2 minutes and wash off.  One container has lasted me months and I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my Microderm abrasion sea salts. For those who missed it in the description as I did, it is a very fine salt only.. you can mix with cleanser, masks or simply use on wet face. The container is bigger than I expected. I have the the body n face collection kit and the night cream. I highly recommend all these!! All come in larger than expected containers. I rate it 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I have tried many exfoliating products before and this is my favorite. My skin was so soft afterwards that I kept touching it over and over because I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it felt. I would definitely recommend trying this!</li>
            <li> This product is so unique. I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t come with something to scoop out the salts, however, that aside, it is so versatile . The first time I used it I mixed it with my Philosophy Purity facial cleanser creating a gentle scrub . It left my skin smooth and so clean feeling. I was afraid the granuals may be too abrasive but that&#x27;s not the case at all. They felt massaging and soothing. The next time I used it I mixed it in with my shower gel because I needed to exfoliate to self tan. Again it did a beautiful job and the great thing is you only need a small amount to go a long way. I really think this is a game changer for its multi uses and great results.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review through http://www.dollardealreviews.com.&lt;br /&gt;I did not find this product to be useful. The salt crystals did not dissolve on my facial skin using warm water. I followed exact directions listed on the product. The salts were getting in my eyes, hair, and mouth. It did not feel good upon my skin or did it feel like it was exfoliating my skin in any way. I believe sea salts are meant to be used in bathing not for exfoliating the face.</li>
            <li> These facial sea salts come in a 12.3 oz jar. These are a very effective exfoliating scrub. I love that it was not too harsh on my skin. After use, my skin felt very soft and looked refreshed. I used it twice weekly, although the feel is gentle enough for more frequent use. I also loved that it a large jar of salts for extended use.  I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I got this at a discounted price for my honest review*</li>
            <li> The package arrived in time. When I opened the package I found (i) the Adovia container/bottle was not sealed and (ii) it was not full up to the neck. I read in other buyers&#x27; comments that the containers were so full that they had to open the lids carefully in order not to spill the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the sea salt only once because I want to return it. There was no direction of using it so I gently rubbed about one-quarter of a teaspoon mixed with honey on my face in circular motion and washed with warm water (I found this procedure on the Internet). My face looked fresher and felt softer than before but I was not sure if the content was simple salt or dead sea salt since there was no tamper-proof sealing. Anyone could take out its content and put simple salt back into it.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Not harsh yet very effective</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  As soon as I received it, I had to try it.  I could not believe how soft and clean it made my face feel. I also have the salt scrub and between the two I can&#x27;t believe how great my skin feels. I only wish I had this product years ago. But I would highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to have better  and softer skin. Thank you Adovia for GREAT products.</li>
            <li> If you have given me the privilege of your time you know I have shouted from the roof tops that Adovia is my favorite brand for 2014. Simply because time after time, product after product, and expectation after expectation has been met with great ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I bring you my next review from the Adovia Mineral Skin Care line.

            <li> I got a full sized sample of this Adovia Exfoliating Facial Salts for review. First of all, this jar is HUGE! 12.3 oz of fine grain loose Dead Sea salt. These are not mixed with anything. It is 100% Dead Sea salt. Actually, the jar is packed so full that product spilled out when I opened it. The concept is simple...you can either use the salt directly on wet/freshly cleansed skin or mix with your favorite facial cleanser to give it an exfoliating boost. I find that it is a bit too abrasive for my sensitive skin when I use it directly on my skin. So, I prefer to mix a tiny amount into my usual cleanser. There is no question that this is a very strong scrub that will very effectively exfoliate your skin. I just caution you to use it very gently and just lightly move your fingers across your skin with the scrub granules. With my sensitive skin, I can only use this about once a week (and even so, I need to take caution to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; very, very gently). However, I adore using this more frequently as a body scrub. Just add a bit to your shower get for a super-effective body scrub!</li>
            <li> This salt cleanses the skin very well.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect product for reducing oil and acne as well as blackheads.</li>
            <li> I have been very lucky to have received several of Adovia&#x27;s products for review on my blog. They are really a great company to work with and I adore all of their products. This salt is no exception. The container I received is quite large and it is noted to last for 2 months worth of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it as soon as I got it- I wet my face and applied salts to my face and gave it a bit of a scrub all over. I rinsed and patted dry. I was amazed at how soft my skin was already! I think it must have taken off quite a bit of dead and yucky skin (ok- ew.) But I think it was a good thing.. lol.&lt;br /&gt;The softness is really noticeable! I love that there are not a host of nasty chemicals and such in this product- it is simple and effective. I think for future use I will be adding it to a facial cleanser that I use that doesn&#x27;t exfoliate. It will be a perfect routine.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again to Adovia for another great product!</li>
            <li> oooooooh this makes you r finger swollen</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this product, my face did feel clean and well exfoliated after use.  The product comes very efficiently packaged, expect some spillage when you open it (and maybe also to transfer a few tablespoons to another container).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea salts are purported to have great health benefits&lt;br /&gt;efficient packaging - not wasteful at all!&lt;br /&gt;fine grain salts are good for facial usage&lt;br /&gt;exfoliation leaves face feeling clean and refreshed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;efficient packaging - spillage&lt;br /&gt;salts applied to wet skin was too dry to really massage - I would recommend adding olive oil to make a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it if you are looking for an exfoliating scrub.  But, you may want to look up some scrub recipes, or add olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did receive a complimentary product for evaluation and review purposes. But the opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
            <li> I love adovia products and this one is no exception! I simply add it to my nightly skin cleanser and blackheads are scrubbed away. I am very satisfied with how soft and clean my skin feels after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> This is seriously one of the best exfoliating scrubs I have ever used! It&#x27;s finely milled but it really does scrub and clean your pores amazingly! I think if you were to mix this with a cream cleanser, it would make an even better exfoliator for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOPaa0836dada9b5f39e01e4ff724325a0d&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMaa0836dada9b5f39e01e4ff724325a0d&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;.

            <li> DISCLOSURE: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts were impressive immediately after the first use. These Avodia salts are loose salts as in, they aren&#x27;t a paste or a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the easiest way to use these was to mix it in with your regular cleanser or just do a quick dip of your fingertips after washing your face and do a light scrub. Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts rinse off easily and don&#x27;t leave any residue at all. Unlike other exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried, Adovia scrubbed away the dullness AND prevented it from coming back during the day. I used the Adovia salts after my regular foaming cleanser in the morning and throughout the day, I kept noticing that it didn&#x27;t have those afternoon oilies, even after being out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts, my skin is smoother and it looks more youthful and vibrant. I appreciated that the salts weren&#x27;t too harsh and they&#x27;re gentle enough where you could probably use the salts daily.</li>
            <li> Hello folks, I am here again with a great product from Adovia. This time I am reviewing a very unique beauty product: Exfoliating Facial Salts. These are made with sea salt right from the Dead Sea. As you may know by know, all of their products are made with minerals from the Dead Sea! This is what makes this company so unique and fun to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So about these exfoliating salts… This is a large tub of ACTUAL salts are formulated to exfoliate your skin while removing oils, bacteria, and impurities. These salts will leave your skin radiant, smooth, and fresh! Your pores are unclogged and your skin is tightened from these exfoliating salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you use these salts? You simply scoop them out of with your hand (Or a spoon if you choose). You apply them to a wet face and massage gently in circles. Finally, you rinse with warm water. That’s it! Your have a new face thanks to Adovia Mineral Skin Care. You’re welcome.</li>
            <li> Read all reviews and excited to try this. Just received the product and a bit disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with a scoop. Be careful when opening up.. Not user friendly :(</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. I mix it with a gel cleanser and it exfoliates great. I leave it on for about 30 seconds before I rinse. It leaves my pores clean.</li>
            <li> These salts are rough, like taking plain sea salt and rubbing it all over your face. I actually cut my cheek. Would not be at all surprised if it is regular salt being sold in a fancy container as a microdermabrasion  treatment - which it is not.</li>
            <li> This product works. Yes it is salt and yes you need to protect it from your eyes. However, my skin is noticeably better after using this product.</li>
            <li> I like the ado via exfoliating facial sea salts but prefer the sea salt scrub.</li>
            <li> The listing failed to mention it has a fragrance of Sea Breeze. My skin does not do well to fragrances due to my eczema...so wasted money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, but irritates my skin a bit. It becomes reddish for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the 5-star reviews left here, but I was thoroughly disappointed.  As an exfoliator, it just doesn&#x27;t work.  The salt crystals are far too rough (at first) to be rubbing on your skin.  You&#x27;d probably do more damage to your skin scratching it then exfoliating it.  Due to these being made of salt, they dissolve as water mixes with them, and then it leaves a residue on the skin.  In my opinion, it felt like sludge, and it was gross.  I really didn&#x27;t notice any sort of actual exfoliating from this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harsh on my skin but nonetheless an amazing product. After using this my skin has improved drastically.</li>
            <li> Be very careful when opening the jar. It is not sealed and if you&#x27;re overzealous, you will risk spilling out the entire container. I suggest mixing with a cream cleanser if you have sensitive skin. I tried the salts without a cleanser and with a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts without a cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;Dry/combination/sensitive skin beauties do not...I repeat do not attempt to use the sea salts without a cleanser. I have sensitive/combination skin and the salts alone felt very abrasive. My skin was irritated for at least a half hour after using. It didn&#x27;t feel like any exfoliating product I had used in the past. It was very scratchy. Oily skin beauties may not have the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts with a cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;The difference was like night and day. Pairing the sea salts with a cleanser left me with bright, glowing, skin. I didn&#x27;t feel any unnecessary friction and the acne I had flaring, calmed down considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend using the Adovia Exfoliating Facial Sea Salts alone but I will recommend them for use with a cleanser. If you have a cleanser that you use on a daily basis that you really love, this could be an excellent add-in for days where you want a deeper clean. I would not recommend for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I see works good but it still needs some oil natural for to easily use because it still dry can fall out from face.  It could be good if there is some natural olive oil that comes with it inside</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me. Impressed. Great exfoliator</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I had never heard of this type of product before I ran by the local mall to grab a Christmas present. I try to avoid the stands in the walkways, but got sucked in to one that was selling sea salts almost like this one. She did the whole spew, and then pulled the $59 a container thing on me. You know, $59 for the sea salt, $59 for the matching runny Shea butter, and just another $29 each for another set to give to someone else for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the concept of the sea salt and how it made my hands feel, but it left an oily feeling. And that Shea butter had a scent that just got stronger and stronger so that I was in total disgust before I ever got home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that I could find a product similar to what they showed me at the mall here on amazon. And I did! I found Adovia brand. And the best part about the Adovia, is that it doesn&#x27;t have any oil added. So, after I use it, I don&#x27;t have that slimy feeling left on my skin. That was the main reason I purchased this brand. the second reason, was that it is usable on my face. I believe that keeping the build up off of my skin plays a big part in how healthy I look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this twice a week. I get a small paper cup and take a little of it in the shower with me, where at the end, I gently wash my face and neck  with it, and then I use it on my hands. I love how soft my skin is after using it, and it stays that way. Even my hands stay soft for days at a time. I live in the country and my hands get treated pretty rough. I love how this is removing all the ick that is making them look older than they should at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the face wash, I use my normal L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect moisturizer. On my hands, I use the Shea butter that I bought here.&lt;br /&gt;100% Unrefined Certified Grade A Shea Butter 4 oz. by AAA Shea Butter Company By AAA Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say, that I have issues with adult acne. If I stress out, or have my hands on my chin too often, I get acne that&#x27;s not the normal kind and will stay for a month or more. Even dermatology treatment won&#x27;t clear it up. I was just starting the get holiday stress acne on my chin, and  this Sea Salt actually helped it go away before it was anything more than just a small raised place. I was so excited! I&#x27;m 55 and the acne started at 38. It&#x27;s embarrassing to have acne this bad at this age. This scrub cleaned deep enough to catch it and actually make it disappear before the acne was an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My price for the two items was twenty-eight dollars. The mall items were one hundred and twenty. I&#x27;d say that I got oil free quality and a price that anyone could love here. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of the sea salt.hin too often, I get acne that&#x27;s not the normal kind and will stay for a month or more. Even dermatology treatment won&#x27;t clear it up.

            <li> It is a bit harsh for my skin. However,  my skin has been dry due to the cold weather. I&#x27;ll try it again this summer.</li>
