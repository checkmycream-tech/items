            <li>sexual noir/nice but sexual sugar is bettr</li>
            <li>Love this perfume. ..</li>
            <li>pumps~ which I love cause</li>
            <li>Five more words</li>
            <li>so I can send:-)</li>
            <li>I am completely in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells great on her, actually turns me on :-).</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and overbearing like the Sexual fresh one</li>
            <li>very much enjoy this sexy sweet fragrance over the Sexual Fresh</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy Michel Germain Fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While I think this fragrance is very nice, I wouldn&#x27;t put it in the same class of perfumes (or price) as perfumes from Dior or Chanel or Givenchy or Gucci etc.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and it smells amazing</li>
            <li>I feel the perfume is most suitable for younger girls</li>
            <li>This one has a candy, sweet scent like britney&#x27;s fantasy rather than a citrus, spicy scent like dior addict 2.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, sweet and friendly.</li>
            <li>And my mom personally thinks it smells better than sexual sugar.</li>
            <li>love this sexual sugar perfume...stays on the body....can smell it 24 hours later...</li>
            <li>Nice subtle and pleasant smell; not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>It smells even stronger than Fresh</li>
            <li>It is mature and I love the bottle shape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many experiences when I smelled something sweet and wondered what it was only to realize</li>
            <li>This perfume smells so sweet (which is what I love) and the scent seems to last for a while.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s the first note</li>
            <li>Many people complement me on the fragrance daily.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and get many compliment.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 hrs.</li>
            <li>My wife bought her first bottle on a trip to Canada.</li>
            <li>Not too overwhelming, but enough to want to keep smelling yourself!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t irritate my nose that much.</li>
            <li>It is slightly more expensive than most perfumes but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I love the sparkling shimmering pink packaging!</li>
            <li>The smell at first reminds me of Pink Sugar...but this perfume fades to a very intoxicating light scent.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and I received it within a few days.</li>
            <li>Not at all &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; but still strong enough to last all day.</li>
            <li>have new item out now..</li>
            <li>This one definitely feels more tone down.</li>
            <li>and it is not long lasting and not anywhere near worth the money it&#x27;s asking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to purchase this, I wear it so frequently that I can only purchase the large sized bottle.</li>
            <li>It really does have this delectable sugary scent to it that i just can&#x27;t get enough of.</li>
            <li>This perfume is almost exactly like Pink Sugar by Aquolina.</li>
            <li>I just randomly sniff my wrist throughout the day and kind of feel like Homer when he gets a doughnut ^_^</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Good smell, but they are going for $9.99 at Ross Stores</li>
            <li> I order everything from Amazon but I will never order another fragrance again. This was diluted with alcohol. Its appearance was lighter that the one I bought in the department store. All I smell is alcohol. I did not bother too return it as I was so upset I just trashed it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Shipping was super fast and it smells amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong and overbearing like the Sexual fresh one and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my nose either. This one has a candy, sweet scent like britney&#x27;s fantasy rather than a citrus, spicy scent like dior addict 2. This one definitely feels more tone down. If I had a bf, I would definitely get Sugar Daddy! It smells even stronger than Fresh but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t irritate my nose that much. Has really nice smell too that I would love in a man. And my mom personally thinks it smells better than sexual sugar.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this fragrance. I am a connoisseur of perfumes and have many in my collection.  While I think this fragrance is very nice, I wouldn&#x27;t put it in the same class of perfumes (or price) as perfumes from Dior or Chanel or Givenchy or Gucci etc.  This perfume is almost exactly like Pink Sugar by Aquolina. Very sweet smelling, like cotton candyish and pleasant.  But that&#x27;s the first note and after a while, there is no deeper richness to the perfume that others like the ones mentioned above would leave.  I feel the perfume is most suitable for younger girls and it is not long lasting and not anywhere near worth the money it&#x27;s asking for. Even the name was questionable to me-- not very classic.  If you want to try this-- buy Pink Sugar.  Same smell, way cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy Michel Germain Fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I very much enjoy this sexy sweet fragrance over the Sexual Fresh, however we all have beautiful taste that makes us stand out.&lt;br /&gt;I could not be disappointed with any scents by Michel Germain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now go find your sexy scent!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time!!! Oh my gosh does it make me smell SO delicious. My husband gives me so many compliments when I wear this, and so does others. The scent lasts all day long.

            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s wondeful. It stays with me all day. Many people complement me on the fragrance daily. It&#x27;s fresh, sweet and friendly.</li>
            <li> love this sexual sugar perfume...stays on the body....can smell it 24 hours later...have new item out now..sexual noir/nice but sexual sugar is bettr</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Smells wonderful!!!</li>

            <li> Love this perfume. .. Great transaction!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my girl and she was very happy with the smell&lt;br /&gt;it was pleasant to the nose and its not that pungent that you dont want to smell it&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so sweet (which is what I love) and the scent seems to last for a while. Love it!</li>
            <li> This perfume exceeded my expectations. You will smell delicious, however I recommend applying it more than once a day add it doesn&#x27;t last more than 5 hrs.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t strong I spray like 5 pumps~ which I love cause it&#x27;s a big bottle &amp; I love the smell!  I am like candy I love this!</li>
            <li> Love this! Smells very similar to Pink Sugar. I wear it everyday and always receive compliments. My new favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> My wife bought her first bottle on a trip to Canada. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Great perfume when you want to smell sweet, but not overly so. Nice subtle and pleasant smell; not overpowering at all. My husband loved it.</li>
            <li> Awesome perfume &amp; very quick delivery!!</li>
            <li> I discovered this perfume via a sample in a beauty ad.  I loved the smell.  I searched online to find this perfume.  It is slightly more expensive than most perfumes but it is worth it.  The smell at first reminds me of Pink Sugar...but this perfume fades to a very intoxicating light scent.  Not too overwhelming, but enough to want to keep smelling yourself!</li>
            <li> Gave to my wife on Christmas. Smells great on her, actually turns me on :-). Five more words so I can send:-)</li>
            <li> scent does not last!!</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with this fragrance. It really does have this delectable sugary scent to it that i just can&#x27;t get enough of.
