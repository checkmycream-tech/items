    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> .99 cent store has this so do the math...</li>
            <li> I expected it to work as well as my previous retinol cream but it didn&#x27;t so I was disappointed. My previous one that accidentally got thrown away made my skin look beautiful and have a natural glow &amp; very healthy looking each nite that I used it...this one wasn&#x27;t as good. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Because it has mineral oil in it, it only gets four stars but other than that, I love it so far:)!! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working for wrinkles but it gives me a glow :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....have also bought this for other family members. Works on all skin, from teenage acne to smoothing and making my face feel fresh......will be ordering more soon. The night cream is also wonderful...</li>
            <li> I thought it was way to in expensive to be a good item. i tried it and have to say I love it. I am very critical, not one to write a lot and I give negative reviews to a lot of junk I buy from Amazon but this one is a def winner, and so inexpensive. I use it on my neck and hands. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> The A cream is absorbed by my skin readily.  It feels nice on my skin and it&#x27;s great for dry skin.  I would and will rebuy when I need it</li>
            <li> I use this cream at night in conjunction with an AHA cream (during the day). The Nicel cream smells great, goes on lightly and smoothly, and leaves my skin soft in the morning. I don&#x27;t know if it does much more than that (it claims it&#x27;ll do some pretty nifty things), but as a basic night cream it&#x27;s good. Not sure yet if I&#x27;ll repurchase, but a little goes a long way so I won&#x27;t have to make that decision for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a while now and I really enjoy it. It feels great on my skin and is very moisturizing. It was also a good buy and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Nicel products are very inexpensive.  No frills.  But if you want a retinol creme as part of your daily routine, the Nicel creme is just the basics.  It&#x27;s just retinol creme.  Why buy  retinol creme for $400, when Nicel will work just as well.  Keep it simple!  Buy Nicel.</li>
            <li> Best $3 spent. Ever. Dollar General.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any results I was looking for. Very disappointed in this product. I&#x27;m tired of spending money on products that don&#x27;t do as adverised</li>
            <li> I was already using the nicel night cream and it was really working so i decided to look and see if nicel made a day cream and they do. There is a different formula of daycream which is vitamin e daily defense, and this is the only one I could find at my dollar store. So I looked online and ordered this one and in conjunction with the night cream, it works wonders my acne spots from the birth control I was taking are almost gone! Before i found this i tried everything for my dark spots but it didnt work. I am so happy to be gettin my skin back in shape.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  I purchased at my local grocery store for less than $4 and was so surprised at the results.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it 4 times, but can already see improvement!  Lines around my lips have diminished drastically.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found this product and would highly recommend it, for the cost there&#x27;s nothing that works better!&lt;br /&gt;Have tried a lot of creams and really, this one is the BEST I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to The Liddel Corporation for making a great produce at a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> I like the cream, I have been using it for a few months already. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or shiny. Honestly I have not noticed any improvement in my wrinkles or the appearance of my skin but I figure it doesn&#x27;t hurt to believe in the positive effect of the retinol and it is cheap compare to other product doing the same thing. Few words bout the seller, the product arrived on time and as described, I am satisfied with the service he provided and will definitely buy from him again, thank you.</li>
            <li> I used it once awhile, not everyday.</li>
            <li> I first tried Nicel creams when I saw them at Dollar Tree, and was very surprised at the quality. I ran out, DT has not had it in for a very long time so I purchased it through Amazon. It was not until after the product arrived that I learned I could buy it directly from Nicel&#x27;s website for about the same price, which I intend to do next time.</li>
            <li> not too perfume-y, not greasy, just enough for daywear. I would reccommend this for women who want something that&#x27;s not heavy.</li>
            <li> I wish I could still buy this locally!  It is a very nice face cream and it&#x27;s cheap!  No wonder I have to buy it on Amazon now. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice light moisturizer this is it!  Update 1/25/16..  I was buying this for as little as 3.99 and now it is 13.99!  Happens every time I start to like a product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll using this, it came completely unsealed and in a tapped up chap stick box. I&#x27;ll probably be returning this.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try based on reviews. Made my sensitive skin break out. Now I use pomegranate murad &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> This cream has worked like a miracle for me.  I bought this cream at Fred&#x27;s dollar store about 3 months ago for about $3.00.  I am 44 years old. I started several years ago having acne breakouts that would turn into sores on my face and take weeks/months to go away. I got a prescription for sulfur face wash from the dermatologist and have been using that for about 2 years.  It works, but I still had these breakouts every few months that took forever to go away. Recently I also began having acne right down the middle of my back that was there for months on end. I used the over the counter salicylic acid wash on my back, did not work.  I would squeeze them and stuff would come out but the sores would just scab over and never completely go away.  After 1 week of using this cream under my makeup in the morning and after I cleansed my face at night, the acne COMPLETELY went away, my face is as smooth and blemish free as it has ever been.  The skin tone has evened out.  My fine lines are smoother. The cream is not greasy under my makeup and does not make it look oily. It makes the makeup go on smoother in my opinion.  So I started thinking if it did this for my face, then I will try it on my back.  After 1 week of using this on my back twice a day, the acne is GONE and I mean skin as smooth as silk. I don&#x27;t know how such a cheap cream can do this miracle work, but it does.  I have since went to Fred&#x27;s and bought every jar on the shelf so I could mail my daughter some.  I look everytime I go in the store to buy more, but they have not restocked yet.  I guess I will have to start buying online because I intend to keep this stuff forever if I can. You just have to use it faithfully and after about a week I think you will see results.  My 20 year old daughter had bad acne and has been using the cream I sent her now about a month and she loves it too, her skin is now clear as well.</li>
            <li> Skin So Soft and Nice cream</li>
            <li> it was inexpensive, cheaper than what was in my local stores and worked quite nicely. nice and creamy and makes my face soft</li>
            <li> Love it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t cure my KP which I hoped it would, but it has definitely improved the condition of my skin otherwise. It&#x27;s soft and smooth - just have to use it everyday without a miss!</li>
            <li> very good and smooth feeling,Dr OZ says to use alleast 3 times a week or more, love it wont use another cream type She</li>
            <li> Nice price. Good product.</li>
            <li> .. I found it removed old cells &amp; left my skin feeling great &amp; healthy.  Skin looked more replenished &amp; younger.. Almost like being plumped up</li>
            <li> Great moistiurizer for around the eye area.  I don&#x27;t know about the rejuvenating effects of this product, but I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product I have been using this for over a year. Delivery by prime was spot on.</li>
            <li> this is an OK moisturizer. I don&#x27;t see any wrinkle reduction or repair to my skin at all and I have finished a full jar.the only thing this works as is a moisturizer.</li>
    </ol>
