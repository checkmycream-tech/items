            <li>product, great value.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy.</li>
            <li>This wash is great</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a great cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The face wash works very nice</li>
            <li>I no longer suffer from breakouts, but my skin is still is still oily, and I find this product is very effective in combating that problem.</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of clearasil, and it&#x27;s great to know that it still works as good now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s as it did when I was in my teens.</li>
            <li>Which is great for acne and it is also good for psoriasis plaques.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent itself is not overpowering and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It has a creamy, shimmery quality which makes it pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance and a creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to wipe off (I use a washcloth) and makes your face feel great!</li>
            <li>Good luck to all who is struggling with acne.  </li>
            <li>She loved Clearasil, and we ordered this 4-pack to replenish our stock.  </li>
            <li>good value.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good facewash but does nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li>It seems like a good value for the quality.</li>
            <li>This is a good face wash.  </li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>This is more a preventive treatment, and it works quite splendidly.</li>
            <li>As a pharmacist, I can ensure you this is a perfect first-line product for mild acne.</li>
            <li>It smells great and works even better.</li>
            <li>My face feels incredible smooth in the morning when I wash it at night...</li>
            <li>There hasn&#x27;t been a noticeable difference in the number of pimples I have, but to be fair, the product claims that it takes 4 weeks to be completely effective (and we have a maximum of four weeks to write a review for Amazon Vine products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Even if you never get acne, this product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job with keeping us oil and blemish free.</li>
            <li>It smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Feels really nice.</li>
            <li>It foams well and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It leaves skin clean without over-drying and Amazon has a great price with sub &amp; save.</li>
            <li>It is great for oily skin, but is still very gentle.  </li>
            <li>Great deal and was delivered fast!</li>
            <li>I hope you find a product that does you justice. :)</li>
            <li>I love Clearasil&#x27;s face wash.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>cleaner has an okay scent and lathers well..</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser because it removes my make up - including mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; decreasing the acne/any breakouts, though I don&#x27;t get too many</li>
            <li>Would it work better if I used it a.m.</li>
            <li>(most products use this acid to do the job).  </li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent \\&quot;salicylic acid\\&quot; wash for acne or skin prone to occasional breakouts.  </li>
            <li>If they had more stars, I would give them.  </li>
            <li>Clearasil is almost an iconic product from my adolescence.</li>
            <li>If they did, I might have benefited from that more than what I was using.</li>
            <li>I used to have a prescription facewash, but when it ran out I couldn&#x27;t afford to get more</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s A LOT better than the 7-8 I get without washing my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice clean skin, with improvement to the look tone and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>Makes it feel very clean and helped treat my acne.</li>
            <li>This seems like a pretty good creamy face wash.</li>
            <li>A good product for people with acne, but, with its gentle exfoliation, I think any skin type would benefit from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is listed in the ingredients, but it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>I used Clearasil when I was a teenager and loved it for the clean, fresh smell and the way my skin felt after washing it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important thing though is how does it work?  </li>
            <li>Good, clean, no-residue product that is exactly what a teenager needs for that window of years where you have to deal with acne.</li>
            <li>And, it washes away easily.  </li>
            <li>I have converted many friends from pricey department store brands with just one try of this good old fashioned face wash.</li>
            <li>definetely recommend this product leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshing</li>
            <li>The way it&#x27;s designed--so that the tube rests on the cap--it collects a fair amount of water in the lid, so every time I open the tube, water that has gathered in the lid falls out, and it kind of grosses me out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer for YEARS!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, leaves my face feeling clean without over-drying.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my moderately oily skin without over-drying.</li>
            <li>This is great for those people who would like to use it on their chest and back, as it won&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but you dont save any money by buying in the 4 pack you can buy them individually from the store and safe about 2 or 3 dollars</li>
            <li>This face wash is a nice, smooth soap with a light suds if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle clean.</li>
            <li>to recommend and a good option for a clear, clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 5 days straight at night, and so far have had great results.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and rinses clean, reducing redness and irritation.  </li>
            <li>so not only does it not over-dry, but the medicine is delivered to your pores even more effectively.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really special about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already a long-time user of Clearisil&#x27;s face wash acne products, such as Clearisil Ultra Acne Wash and Mask, so I thought this product would be a good choice.  </li>
            <li>do recommend getting a good facial lotion to use after this,</li>
            <li>The price is appropriate and I feel it really works at getting rid of all the miniscule grime that builds up each day in your pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad substitute if you need it.</li>
            <li>I love the squeaky clean feeling when I rinse it off, and the soft, smooth way I feel once I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>Simply the best Daily face wash out there.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using something more natural and paraben free.</li>
            <li>* Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding.</li>
            <li>* Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding.</li>
            <li>you can feel the face very clean without the over-dray using a normal soap!</li>
            <li>I like I like about this Clearasil product is that it lathers up MUCH better, and really seems to rinse cleanly on the first shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>clearasil, very refreshing feeling, love the scent very lite not loud perfume scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>My face has been clearing up so much!!</li>
            <li>Great soap for mild acne, been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li>Also has a great smell and suds up with just a little amount...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from being a great product, I was a little more then concerned and surprised by another&#x27;s review in regards to the ingredient, salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and really cleans.  </li>
            <li>Not harsh like most things out there.</li>
            <li>It even leaves my face feeling a bit tingly after being washed off, the same kind of tingly feeling you get from mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to serve any useful purpose, and it doesn&#x27;t come off, so there&#x27;s no way around</li>
            <li>Just a quarter size of soap twice a day is all you need to stay fresh.</li>
            <li>, however it often causes over-drying, which causes me more breakouts, not less.  </li>
            <li>Helps clean my face very well.</li>
            <li>I received  item as  expected, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product is fine to use.</li>
            <li>One of the things I like about the product the most is the fact that it does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had less breakouts and those that I did have before I began using the product, diminished fairly quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans skin and deep inside the pores better than anything else.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling so fresh and really does reduce acne and blackheads.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>It really works, it cleans the face skin leaving a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>my skin started looking so much clearer!</li>
            <li>The end result is my face was oil free and not dried out</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has a fresh, gentle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product works exactly like I would want it to.  </li>
            <li>I think you will like this one, it does what it promises, and after about a week of consistent use you should see clearer skin.</li>
            <li>and I wish it left me feeling more refreshed than burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CLEARASIL DAILY FACE WASH, 6.5-Ounce Tube, seemed like a safe bet to purchase.</li>
            <li>Having a teen, preteen, and one that will be a preteen, soon, I imagine we&#x27;ll have acne products in our house for a number more years.</li>
            <li>It does help heal blemishes more quickly than regular cleansers and it leaves the skin feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Clearasil Daily Clear Acne Face Wash is amazing at keeping my face moist but not oily.  </li>
            <li>Not by a long shot but compared to what it was, I feel confident I&#x27;m well on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson I learned here</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and occasional breakouts, and this face wash does not irritate my skin and leaves a fresh, clean feeling.</li>
            <li>a certain age,\\</li>
            <li>A woman who wants to remove makeup easily need only step into the shower with a tube of this.</li>
            <li>Not runny, but easy enough to spread around, although be sure to wet your face before using it.</li>
            <li>I also recommend this for both genders and it&#x27;s perfect for teens and adults, as well as those with bad acne or just want their face to feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li>but we still really like this face wash.  </li>
            <li>Shipping is fast.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Fast shipment thanks!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this only because they seem to stop selling it at Duane Reade and it is more expensive in Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;also removes makeup really well</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li>Fast forward about twenty years</li>
            <li>I use the product twice a day, which I absolutely cannot do with the truly &#x27;oil-free&#x27; salicylic cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I really like it except for the scent.</li>
            <li>Maybe the new formula works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Daily Face Wash Tube, this rich, pearly cream gently cleanses skin without over drying.</li>
            <li>Clearasil Daily Face Wash is a great option for those that like a creamy, silky option for removing oil and dirt as opposed to a slick, gel one.  </li>
            <li>but many women can relate to the fact that no matter how much you wash your face, the hormones that will surface around a certain time each month will produce a few pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife had been using Clearasil for one main reason: it did not have salicylic acid, a big no-no for pregnant women.  </li>
            <li>your looking for a decent face wash</li>
            <li>Not just mild, it&#x27;s everywhere and red!</li>
            <li>Be sure to mention any of the following: aspirin, diuretics (&#x27;water pills&#x27;), and methyl salicylate (in some muscle rubs such as BenGay).</li>
            <li>If you become pregnant while using topical salicylic acid, call your doctor.</li>
            <li>but introduce this new kind so that it wasn&#x27;t too much of a  \\&quot;shock,\\&quot; and in case if I DID react to it, I would know what was causing the [negative] reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>makes ur acne double, use clean and clear wash/cleancer</li>
            <li>Now this does seem to work as I can notice almost right away the pimple is smaller.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s thick, rich, provides full coverage of your face and neck.</li>
            <li>New formula.\\</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s the new ingredient that&#x27;s so conspicuously disclosed?  </li>
            <li>It is the NEW Clearasil face wash with 2% Salicylic Acid - YUCK.</li>
            <li>But when we&#x27;re talking about a radically different product, one that now requires a drug label because of a new active ingredient, this should be prominently displayed, both on the product listing and on the packaging, particularly when the new ingredient is one that is explicitly disallowed for mothers-to-be.  </li>
            <li>The name and the marketing make it sound like it&#x27;s going to be gentler than a regular acne specific face wash, but I found that wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li>I can say it hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin so far, which tends to be one of my biggest issues with most products.</li>
            <li>First off, they both have 2% salicylic acid, so that&#x27;s the same.  </li>
            <li>Washes clean unlike other cleansers I&#x27;ve used that leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li>As for its efficacy at reducing acne, it seems decent enough, maybe a tiny bit less effective than the Clearisil Ultra.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that salicylic acid had been added and that there was a new formula.  </li>
            <li>The reason I give it only 4 stars is that I feel it would be a more efficient cleaner with a slight amount of exfoliate to it.</li>
            <li>If you become pregnant while using topical salicylic acid, call your doctor.uscle rubs such as BenGay).</li>
            <li>I have a very active t-zone and a combination skin where my cheeks can get dry very easily.</li>
            <li>Dries your face a little, but good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>As far as the product is concerned, several of us have very oily skin</li>
            <li>It foams well and washes off clear without any residue.  </li>
            <li>this product is not the old style Clearasil Face wash with Triclosan - as is pictured and described in the product description.</li>
            <li>at least, not until I&#x27;ve been able to use it both a.m. and p.m. for some time.</li>
            <li>I personally use a face lotion every day after washing my face, but this product did not leave my face feeling like the Sahara desert like some washes are capable of doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your skin may become very irritated if you apply any of these products to the skin that you are treating with topical salicylic</li>
            <li>I mean, after all, how many times had I passed this product on store shelves and discounted it?  </li>
            <li>So, maybe because I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;religiously\\&quot; wash my face both morning and evening - due to my schedule and where I was/what I was doing, I didn&#x27;t always have access to this - is why I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much to wash your entire face and it also works well on a shower loofah on your shoulders and back.  </li>
            <li>Having had more than the usual troubles with acne in my teenage years, some sort of Clearasil product was always in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>I used this daily when I was in high school</li>
            <li>It goes in creamy unless you get it wet first before applying to you face.  </li>
            <li>This particular cleanser works very well at getting fairly thick makeup off your face gently.  </li>
            <li>I barely notice it, and it doesn&#x27;t linger once I&#x27;ve rinsed it</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the mixed reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li>The acid is in the product as a cleansing agent, and anyone that has either teenage related breakout problems, or adult onset problems needs the acid as a cleanser to clear the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used it several times but don&#x27;t expect to see major changes in my skin b/c</li>
            <li>It does dry out my skin a bit, but not near as severely as other face washes, and I like the creamy consistency of it as well as the mild scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never sure how to rate products like this, mostly because it&#x27;s difficult to determine whether the claims that it will reduce breakouts are true unless you&#x27;ve been using it for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will still have dry spots and it will not get rid of you ever getting a pimple completely.</li>
            <li>It rinses off easily with no greasy feeling, or residue left behind.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I no longer suffer from breakouts, but my skin is still is still oily, and I find this product is very effective in combating that problem.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of clearasil, and it&#x27;s great to know that it still works as good now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s as it did when I was in my teens.</li>
            <li> Which is great for acne and it is also good for psoriasis plaques.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent itself is not overpowering and pleasant.</li>
            <li> It has a creamy, shimmery quality which makes it pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fragrance and a creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to wipe off (I use a washcloth) and makes your face feel great!</li>
            <li> Good luck to all who is struggling with acne.  </li>
            <li> She loved Clearasil, and we ordered this 4-pack to replenish our stock.  </li>
            <li> good value.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good facewash but does nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good value for the quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good face wash.  </li>
            <li> A good product.</li>
            <li> This is more a preventive treatment, and it works quite splendidly.</li>
            <li> As a pharmacist, I can ensure you this is a perfect first-line product for mild acne.</li>
            <li> It smells great and works even better.</li>
            <li> My face feels incredible smooth in the morning when I wash it at night...</li>
            <li> There hasn&#x27;t been a noticeable difference in the number of pimples I have, but to be fair, the product claims that it takes 4 weeks to be completely effective (and we have a maximum of four weeks to write a review for Amazon Vine products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Even if you never get acne, this product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> and it does a great job with keeping us oil and blemish free.</li>
            <li> It smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Feels really nice.</li>
            <li> It foams well and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> It leaves skin clean without over-drying and Amazon has a great price with sub &amp; save.</li>
            <li> It is great for oily skin, but is still very gentle.  </li>
            <li> Great deal and was delivered fast!</li>
            <li> I hope you find a product that does you justice. :)</li>
            <li> I love Clearasil&#x27;s face wash.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> cleaner has an okay scent and lathers well..</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser because it removes my make up - including mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; decreasing the acne/any breakouts, though I don&#x27;t get too many</li>
            <li> Would it work better if I used it a.m.</li>
            <li> (most products use this acid to do the job).  </li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent \\&quot;salicylic acid\\&quot; wash for acne or skin prone to occasional breakouts.  </li>
            <li> If they had more stars, I would give them.  </li>
            <li> Clearasil is almost an iconic product from my adolescence.</li>
            <li> If they did, I might have benefited from that more than what I was using.</li>
            <li> I used to have a prescription facewash, but when it ran out I couldn&#x27;t afford to get more</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s A LOT better than the 7-8 I get without washing my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice clean skin, with improvement to the look tone and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes it feel very clean and helped treat my acne.</li>
            <li> This seems like a pretty good creamy face wash.</li>
            <li> A good product for people with acne, but, with its gentle exfoliation, I think any skin type would benefit from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is listed in the ingredients, but it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> I used Clearasil when I was a teenager and loved it for the clean, fresh smell and the way my skin felt after washing it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important thing though is how does it work?  </li>
            <li> Good, clean, no-residue product that is exactly what a teenager needs for that window of years where you have to deal with acne.</li>
            <li> And, it washes away easily.  </li>
            <li> I have converted many friends from pricey department store brands with just one try of this good old fashioned face wash.</li>
            <li> definetely recommend this product leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshing</li>
            <li> The way it&#x27;s designed--so that the tube rests on the cap--it collects a fair amount of water in the lid, so every time I open the tube, water that has gathered in the lid falls out, and it kind of grosses me out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer for YEARS!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, leaves my face feeling clean without over-drying.  </li>
            <li> Works great on my moderately oily skin without over-drying.</li>
            <li> This is great for those people who would like to use it on their chest and back, as it won&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but you dont save any money by buying in the 4 pack you can buy them individually from the store and safe about 2 or 3 dollars</li>
            <li> This face wash is a nice, smooth soap with a light suds if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle clean.</li>
            <li> to recommend and a good option for a clear, clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 5 days straight at night, and so far have had great results.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and rinses clean, reducing redness and irritation.  </li>
            <li> so not only does it not over-dry, but the medicine is delivered to your pores even more effectively.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really special about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a long-time user of Clearisil&#x27;s face wash acne products, such as Clearisil Ultra Acne Wash and Mask, so I thought this product would be a good choice.  </li>
            <li> do recommend getting a good facial lotion to use after this,</li>
            <li> The price is appropriate and I feel it really works at getting rid of all the miniscule grime that builds up each day in your pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad substitute if you need it.</li>
            <li> I love the squeaky clean feeling when I rinse it off, and the soft, smooth way I feel once I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Simply the best Daily face wash out there.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using something more natural and paraben free.</li>
            <li> * Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding.</li>
            <li> * Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding.</li>
            <li> you can feel the face very clean without the over-dray using a normal soap!</li>
            <li> I like I like about this Clearasil product is that it lathers up MUCH better, and really seems to rinse cleanly on the first shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> clearasil, very refreshing feeling, love the scent very lite not loud perfume scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> My face has been clearing up so much!!</li>
            <li> Great soap for mild acne, been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Also has a great smell and suds up with just a little amount...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from being a great product, I was a little more then concerned and surprised by another&#x27;s review in regards to the ingredient, salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and really cleans.  </li>
            <li> Not harsh like most things out there.</li>
            <li> It even leaves my face feeling a bit tingly after being washed off, the same kind of tingly feeling you get from mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to serve any useful purpose, and it doesn&#x27;t come off, so there&#x27;s no way around</li>
            <li> Just a quarter size of soap twice a day is all you need to stay fresh.</li>
            <li> , however it often causes over-drying, which causes me more breakouts, not less.  </li>
            <li> Helps clean my face very well.</li>
            <li> I received  item as  expected, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product is fine to use.</li>
            <li> One of the things I like about the product the most is the fact that it does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had less breakouts and those that I did have before I began using the product, diminished fairly quick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans skin and deep inside the pores better than anything else.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling so fresh and really does reduce acne and blackheads.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> It really works, it cleans the face skin leaving a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> my skin started looking so much clearer!</li>
            <li> The end result is my face was oil free and not dried out</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a fresh, gentle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product works exactly like I would want it to.  </li>
            <li> I think you will like this one, it does what it promises, and after about a week of consistent use you should see clearer skin.</li>
            <li> and I wish it left me feeling more refreshed than burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CLEARASIL DAILY FACE WASH, 6.5-Ounce Tube, seemed like a safe bet to purchase.</li>
            <li> Having a teen, preteen, and one that will be a preteen, soon, I imagine we&#x27;ll have acne products in our house for a number more years.</li>
            <li> It does help heal blemishes more quickly than regular cleansers and it leaves the skin feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Clearasil Daily Clear Acne Face Wash is amazing at keeping my face moist but not oily.  </li>
            <li> Not by a long shot but compared to what it was, I feel confident I&#x27;m well on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson I learned here</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and occasional breakouts, and this face wash does not irritate my skin and leaves a fresh, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> a certain age,\\</li>
            <li> A woman who wants to remove makeup easily need only step into the shower with a tube of this.</li>
            <li> Not runny, but easy enough to spread around, although be sure to wet your face before using it.</li>
            <li> I also recommend this for both genders and it&#x27;s perfect for teens and adults, as well as those with bad acne or just want their face to feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
            <li> but we still really like this face wash.  </li>
            <li> Shipping is fast.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Fast shipment thanks!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this only because they seem to stop selling it at Duane Reade and it is more expensive in Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;also removes makeup really well</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li> Fast forward about twenty years</li>
            <li> I use the product twice a day, which I absolutely cannot do with the truly &#x27;oil-free&#x27; salicylic cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I really like it except for the scent.</li>
            <li> Maybe the new formula works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Daily Face Wash Tube, this rich, pearly cream gently cleanses skin without over drying.</li>
            <li> Clearasil Daily Face Wash is a great option for those that like a creamy, silky option for removing oil and dirt as opposed to a slick, gel one.  </li>
            <li> but many women can relate to the fact that no matter how much you wash your face, the hormones that will surface around a certain time each month will produce a few pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife had been using Clearasil for one main reason: it did not have salicylic acid, a big no-no for pregnant women.  </li>
            <li> your looking for a decent face wash</li>
            <li> Not just mild, it&#x27;s everywhere and red!</li>
            <li> Be sure to mention any of the following: aspirin, diuretics (&#x27;water pills&#x27;), and methyl salicylate (in some muscle rubs such as BenGay).</li>
            <li> If you become pregnant while using topical salicylic acid, call your doctor.</li>
            <li> but introduce this new kind so that it wasn&#x27;t too much of a  \\&quot;shock,\\&quot; and in case if I DID react to it, I would know what was causing the [negative] reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> makes ur acne double, use clean and clear wash/cleancer</li>
            <li> Now this does seem to work as I can notice almost right away the pimple is smaller.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s thick, rich, provides full coverage of your face and neck.</li>
            <li> New formula.\\</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the new ingredient that&#x27;s so conspicuously disclosed?  </li>
            <li> It is the NEW Clearasil face wash with 2% Salicylic Acid - YUCK.</li>
            <li> But when we&#x27;re talking about a radically different product, one that now requires a drug label because of a new active ingredient, this should be prominently displayed, both on the product listing and on the packaging, particularly when the new ingredient is one that is explicitly disallowed for mothers-to-be.  </li>
            <li> The name and the marketing make it sound like it&#x27;s going to be gentler than a regular acne specific face wash, but I found that wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li> I can say it hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin so far, which tends to be one of my biggest issues with most products.</li>
            <li> First off, they both have 2% salicylic acid, so that&#x27;s the same.  </li>
            <li> Washes clean unlike other cleansers I&#x27;ve used that leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> As for its efficacy at reducing acne, it seems decent enough, maybe a tiny bit less effective than the Clearisil Ultra.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that salicylic acid had been added and that there was a new formula.  </li>
            <li> The reason I give it only 4 stars is that I feel it would be a more efficient cleaner with a slight amount of exfoliate to it.</li>
            <li> If you become pregnant while using topical salicylic acid, call your doctor.uscle rubs such as BenGay).</li>
            <li> I have a very active t-zone and a combination skin where my cheeks can get dry very easily.</li>
            <li> Dries your face a little, but good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> As far as the product is concerned, several of us have very oily skin</li>
            <li> It foams well and washes off clear without any residue.  </li>
            <li> this product is not the old style Clearasil Face wash with Triclosan - as is pictured and described in the product description.</li>
            <li> at least, not until I&#x27;ve been able to use it both a.m. and p.m. for some time.</li>
            <li> I personally use a face lotion every day after washing my face, but this product did not leave my face feeling like the Sahara desert like some washes are capable of doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your skin may become very irritated if you apply any of these products to the skin that you are treating with topical salicylic</li>
            <li> I mean, after all, how many times had I passed this product on store shelves and discounted it?  </li>
            <li> So, maybe because I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;religiously\\&quot; wash my face both morning and evening - due to my schedule and where I was/what I was doing, I didn&#x27;t always have access to this - is why I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much to wash your entire face and it also works well on a shower loofah on your shoulders and back.  </li>
            <li> Having had more than the usual troubles with acne in my teenage years, some sort of Clearasil product was always in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> I used this daily when I was in high school</li>
            <li> It goes in creamy unless you get it wet first before applying to you face.  </li>
            <li> This particular cleanser works very well at getting fairly thick makeup off your face gently.  </li>
            <li> I barely notice it, and it doesn&#x27;t linger once I&#x27;ve rinsed it</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the mixed reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li> The acid is in the product as a cleansing agent, and anyone that has either teenage related breakout problems, or adult onset problems needs the acid as a cleanser to clear the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used it several times but don&#x27;t expect to see major changes in my skin b/c</li>
            <li> It does dry out my skin a bit, but not near as severely as other face washes, and I like the creamy consistency of it as well as the mild scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never sure how to rate products like this, mostly because it&#x27;s difficult to determine whether the claims that it will reduce breakouts are true unless you&#x27;ve been using it for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will still have dry spots and it will not get rid of you ever getting a pimple completely.</li>
            <li> It rinses off easily with no greasy feeling, or residue left behind.</li>
            <li> * Do not apply any of the following products to the skin that you are treating with topical salicylic acid unless your doctor tells you that you should: abrasive soaps or cleansers; skin care products that contain alcohol; other medications that are applied to the skin such as benzoyl peroxide (BenzaClin, BenzaMycin, others), resorcinol (RA Lotion), sulfur (Cuticura, Finac, others), and tretinoin (Retin-A, Renova, others); or medicated cosmetics.</li>
            <li> A smidge goes a long way, so this tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Use the product in a very limited quantity and occasionally.</li>
            <li> The products I normally use as face wash in the shower are typically $6-8 per bottle/tube, and it seems to me as though this one works as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Received just as expected, this is my 4th time ordering and the only product I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent countless dollars looking for a product that would clear up my blemished skin, even the monthly shipments of a heavily advertised brand on television - to no avail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it just helps control and maintain, not clear up.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it will initially make your acne worse because it draws out spots that would have appeared eventually any way.</li>
            <li> The one thing I didn&#x27;t like is that my face looked very pale, which is unusual with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxy clears up my acne and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  </li>
            <li> This still will dry your skin a bit.</li>
            <li> as sometimes it leaves me dry.</li>
            <li> Thus far, I usually use it a.m. or p.m. in combination with another face wash, only &#x60;cause I want(ed) to finish up the other stuff</li>
            <li> I am a preteen girl who has gone through puberty really quickly, and during that process, have gotten a horrible face full of acne!</li>
            <li> is just because it&#x27;s an \\&quot;old\\&quot; product and not high dollar,</li>
            <li> I mean, I think it HELPS control breakouts, acne [in general], and the like, but I didn&#x27;t notice it seemed to improve my overall complexion - in regards to eliminating or \\&quot;severely\\</li>
            <li> Use everyday twice a day, to help you maintain visibly clearer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using topical salicylic acid:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But not always, which is curious.</li>
            <li> I have had a history of horrible acne as a teenager and that got better as I got older</li>
            <li> Albeit, it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry it as much as previous face wash that I have tried.</li>
            <li> It does burn a little if you leave it on too long</li>
            <li> I like how you only need a very little bit to lather up well.</li>
            <li> The difference here is that this is in a tube instead of a pump and the TEXTURE is what separates it from other options.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this does seem to work but to me, it&#x27;s like every other face wash</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever understand why the government allows for consumers health to be in jeopardy, allowing such things to be marketed when they are clearly not safe and or come with unfavorable side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to salicylic acid or any other medications.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also gotten a bit in my eyes a couple of times, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to burn as badly as other products when that</li>
            <li> I use an exfoliation mask in combination with this cleaner to remove dry, dead skin about once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products like this, and I&#x27;d say this one is average.</li>
            <li> I personally have always used salicylic acid products and have never had a problem with them, however, I would advise that if you have a negative reaction to the acid you may want to look into another</li>
            <li> My pores are definitely less clogged after a couple weeks of using this.  </li>
            <li> If you cannot get a hold of this exact product and want to mimic its effects, try massaging your face with olive oil or cold cream and then using one of the truly &#x27;oil-free&#x27; salicylic acid cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I did a little research myself, confirming my apprehension.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather unpleasant, and I can&#x27;t figure out why it&#x27;s so much harsher than the other product from them...  </li>
            <li> This is the nicest acne cleanser I have ever tried and I have tried quite a few of them.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think it would actually mean 85% less pimples in 4 weeks as it advertises.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this at my home for a while and usually pay $7 per tube.</li>
            <li> This is because this contains the usual salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> Usually the acne treatments and sometimes the cleansers.  </li>
            <li> You should know that children and teenagers who have chicken pox or the flu should not use topical salicylic acid unless they have been told to do so by a doctor because there is a risk that they may develop Reye&#x27;s syndrome (a serious condition in which fat builds up on the brain, liver, and other body</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used Clearasil when I was a teenager and loved it for the clean, fresh smell and the way my skin felt after washing it.  Now that I have pre-teen children, I just knew they needed it too.  I was surprised to see that salicylic acid had been added and that there was a new formula.  I have used it several times but don&#x27;t expect to see major changes in my skin b/c I don&#x27;t get breakouts or have acne at my age.  The kids have used it and remarked that they&#x27;ve noticed a cleaner feel in their skin.</li>
            <li> Dried out my face and actually made my acne worst.  Used it once a day each day.  I know it works for some people, but it did not work well for me at all.  If this does not help your acne, as it didn&#x27;t help mine, you can try Oxy Maximum Face Wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Oxy-Maximum-Action-Advanced-Ounce/dp/B00B118D6A/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1421196013&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;oxy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxy clears up my acne and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  Good luck to all who is struggling with acne.  I hope you find a product that does you justice. :)</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. It cleans skin and deep inside the pores better than anything else. A woman who wants to remove makeup easily need only step into the shower with a tube of this. If you want the cleanest body, face, toes, scalp, private areas, ear canals etc., than you have ever had, this kills all odor causing bacteria, removes ear wax, deodorant residue etc., like nothing else. Even if you never get acne, this product is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> My wife had been using Clearasil for one main reason: it did not have salicylic acid, a big no-no for pregnant women.  She loved Clearasil, and we ordered this 4-pack to replenish our stock.  But when we got it, it says in teeny, tiny, microscopic letters, \\&quot;Psst!  New formula.\\&quot;  What&#x27;s the new ingredient that&#x27;s so conspicuously disclosed?  Salicylic acid.  Thankfully, she checked the ingredients list before applying the product.  Amazon&#x27;s description at this time is using the outdated ingredient list.  Yes, there is a disclaimer that the contents may change at any time without warning.  But when we&#x27;re talking about a radically different product, one that now requires a drug label because of a new active ingredient, this should be prominently displayed, both on the product listing and on the packaging, particularly when the new ingredient is one that is explicitly disallowed for mothers-to-be.  Maybe the new formula works pretty well.  Unfortunately, we&#x27;re going to have to wait a few months to find out.</li>
            <li> I love Clearasil&#x27;s face wash.  I used this daily when I was in high school but for some reason I stopped.  That was over 10 years ago.  I recently bought some because I wanted a creamy cleanser.  This is the best face wash ever!  It is smooth and really cleans.  My water proof eyeliner and mascara is removed with ease. And, it washes away easily.  I have very sensitive skin and this product is fine to use. I will continue to buy Clearasil&#x27;s creamy face wash from hear on out!</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both in our 30&#x27;s but we still really like this face wash.  It leaves skin clean without over-drying and Amazon has a great price with sub &amp; save.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this at my home for a while and usually pay $7 per tube. Finding 4 at this price was a steal and we&#x27;re quite happy. As far as the product is concerned, several of us have very oily skin and it does a great job with keeping us oil and blemish free.</li>
            <li> Simply the best Daily face wash out there. Not harsh like most things out there. None of those stupid micro scrubber thingys that rip your face off.. Works wonderfully and I love it</li>
            <li> This has been a product that I&#x27;ve used for years now. I&#x27;ve never had an extremely bad acne problem, but I always needed a wash. As a pharmacist, I can ensure you this is a perfect first-line product for mild acne.</li>
            <li> Its a great face cleaner.  I like to buy in bulk.  Shipping is fast.  THANKS</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I have EVER used -- almost 15 years now!  Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, leaves my face feeling clean without over-drying.  I have converted many friends from pricey department store brands with just one try of this good old fashioned face wash.</li>
            <li> Being a lady \\&quot;of a certain age,\\&quot; I don&#x27;t have problems with pesky pubescent pimples, but I do have bothersome blackheads.  This face wash helped me say \\&quot;Bye-bye blackheads.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it at night, before applying my evening moisturizer, and within two weeks my blackheads were noticeably reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner has an okay scent and lathers well..</li>
            <li> Received just as expected, this is my 4th time ordering and the only product I use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;The face wash works very nice you can feel the face very clean without the over-dray using a normal soap!</li>
            <li> Use the product in a very limited quantity and occasionally. I would recommend using something more natural and paraben free.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser because it removes my make up - including mascara.  It is great for oily skin, but is still very gentle.  You can&#x27;t beat the value of this bundle, either.</li>
            <li> Been using Clearasil since i been 14.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.  It leaves your skin feeling so fresh and really does reduce acne and blackheads.  I was happy to find this only because they seem to stop selling it at Duane Reade and it is more expensive in Walgreens.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It claims on the bottle that &amp;#34;85% of users claim fewer acne after 4 weeks&amp;#34;. Well, I must be in the 15% because my face is breaking out horribly and feels very dry.</li>
            <li> Great soap for mild acne, been using it for a few years now. Also has a great smell and suds up with just a little amount...</li>
            <li> Thanks!  I received  item as  expected, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product they should never discontinue it</li>
            <li> good value. makes your faces feel refreshed</li>
            <li> WARNING - this product is not the old style Clearasil Face wash with Triclosan - as is pictured and described in the product description. It is the NEW Clearasil face wash with 2% Salicylic Acid - YUCK.</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin type, I&#x27;ve used it for years and never had any problems with acne. Great deal and was delivered fast!</li>
            <li> Showed up on time and excellent condition. Use this soap for miltary field use. Holds up with the bags getting thrown around</li>
            <li> I am from Brazil. I bought one of this when I was on vacation in USA. It really works, it cleans the face skin leaving a fresh feeling. The smell is very good too. I´m using for about a 2 years and I think that I will never change to another product. Excelent!</li>
            <li> I really like it. I just wash my face with it and moisturize with my Mabeylline BB Cream. I also use the Acne ++ Marks: Mask &amp;&amp; Face Wash in conjunction and they both are terrific.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a long-time user of Clearisil&#x27;s face wash acne products, such as Clearisil Ultra Acne Wash and Mask, so I thought this product would be a good choice.  The name and the marketing make it sound like it&#x27;s going to be gentler than a regular acne specific face wash, but I found that wasn&#x27;t the case.  First off, they both have 2% salicylic acid, so that&#x27;s the same.  What isn&#x27;t the same, however, is the effect.  Unlike the Clearisil Ultra, this face wash burns when applied.  It even leaves my face feeling a bit tingly after being washed off, the same kind of tingly feeling you get from mouthwash.  It&#x27;s rather unpleasant, and I can&#x27;t figure out why it&#x27;s so much harsher than the other product from them...  As for its efficacy at reducing acne, it seems decent enough, maybe a tiny bit less effective than the Clearisil Ultra.  Either way, I think I&#x27;ll stick with the product that&#x27;s nicer on my face.</li>
            <li> Works great on my moderately oily skin without over-drying. Washes clean unlike other cleansers I&#x27;ve used that leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> So, maybe because I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;religiously\\&quot; wash my face both morning and evening - due to my schedule and where I was/what I was doing, I didn&#x27;t always have access to this - is why I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference. I mean, I think it HELPS control breakouts, acne [in general], and the like, but I didn&#x27;t notice it seemed to improve my overall complexion - in regards to eliminating or \\&quot;severely\\&quot; decreasing the acne/any breakouts, though I don&#x27;t get too many breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t NOT recommend this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t promote it...at least, not until I&#x27;ve been able to use it both a.m. and p.m. for some time. Thus far, I usually use it a.m. or p.m. in combination with another face wash, only &#x60;cause I want(ed) to finish up the other stuff \\&quot;first,\\&quot; but introduce this new kind so that it wasn&#x27;t too much of a  \\&quot;shock,\\&quot; and in case if I DID react to it, I would know what was causing the [negative] reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...does it work? Sort of...for me, at least. Would it work better if I used it a.m. AND p.m. for the 4 weeks it recommends? Maybe...but something tells me no. I think (and this is just me personally) it just helps control and maintain, not clear up.</li>
            <li> clearasil, very refreshing feeling, love the scent very lite not loud perfume scent&lt;br /&gt;would definetely recommend this product leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshing&lt;br /&gt;also removes makeup really well</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of clearasil, and it&#x27;s great to know that it still works as good now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s as it did when I was in my teens. I love the squeaky clean feeling when I rinse it off, and the soft, smooth way I feel once I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> makes ur acne double, use clean and clear wash/cleancer</li>
            <li> Ever since the birth of my last child, it&#x27;s like my face has went back to my teenage years, as relates to pimples (of course!).  I&#x27;ve spent countless dollars looking for a product that would clear up my blemished skin, even the monthly shipments of a heavily advertised brand on television - to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when only a week into using the [[ASIN:B001U0OQN6 Clearasil Daily Face Wash]] my skin started looking so much clearer! I mean, after all, how many times had I passed this product on store shelves and discounted it?  Too may to count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is my skin perfect?  Not by a long shot but compared to what it was, I feel confident I&#x27;m well on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lesson I learned here is just because it&#x27;s an \\&quot;old\\&quot; product and not high dollar, doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work.  There&#x27;s a reason brands like this stick around and I wish I thought about that before.</li>
            <li> Clearasil Daily Face Wash is a great option for those that like a creamy, silky option for removing oil and dirt as opposed to a slick, gel one.  The product here is your standard salycic acid-based option for removing the nasties on your face (most products use this acid to do the job).  The difference here is that this is in a tube instead of a pump and the TEXTURE is what separates it from other options.  No beads, not watery mixture, instead this is a silky cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing though is how does it work?  The end result is my face was oil free and not dried out so it was on the ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to recommend and a good option for a clear, clean complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products like this, and I&#x27;d say this one is average. Be aware that it will initially make your acne worse because it draws out spots that would have appeared eventually any way. It does help heal blemishes more quickly than regular cleansers and it leaves the skin feeling very soft and moisturized. The one thing I didn&#x27;t like is that my face looked very pale, which is unusual with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a competing product similar to this for about 5 years now. (in an Orange tube)&lt;br /&gt;What I like I like about this Clearasil product is that it lathers up MUCH better, and really seems to rinse cleanly on the first shot.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a fresh, gentle scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the effect seems the same.  Nice clean skin, with improvement to the look tone and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash. It&#x27;s very gentle, and leaves my skin feeling clean without drying it out. I like the consistency of it. Not runny, but easy enough to spread around, although be sure to wet your face before using it. A smidge goes a long way, so this tube will last a long time. This is great for those people who would like to use it on their chest and back, as it won&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. It rinses off easily with no greasy feeling, or residue left behind. After using it for a week, my skin feels softer and smoother. A good product for people with acne, but, with its gentle exfoliation, I think any skin type would benefit from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is listed in the ingredients, but it&#x27;s very light. I barely notice it, and it doesn&#x27;t linger once I&#x27;ve rinsed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like is the cap. It&#x27;s slanted, making it a bit awkward for left-handed people. Why it&#x27;s like that is beyond me. It doesn&#x27;t seem to serve any useful purpose, and it doesn&#x27;t come off, so there&#x27;s no way around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, great value. Cap notwithstanding, I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I got this face wash because of the salicylic acid. Which is great for acne and it is also good for psoriasis plaques. That is why i use it.  I have both acne and psoriasis so this product is a 2 for 1 for me and i love it. It smells nice.  My husband loves it too. He uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the mixed reviews of this product.  The clearasil brand has been around forever, and I have never had a problem with it.  This product is advertised as a simple face wash with 2% Salicylic acid.  The acid is in the product as a cleansing agent, and anyone that has either teenage related breakout problems, or adult onset problems needs the acid as a cleanser to clear the skin.  I personally have always used salicylic acid products and have never had a problem with them, however, I would advise that if you have a negative reaction to the acid you may want to look into another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works exactly like I would want it to.  It foams well and washes off clear without any residue.  One of the things I like about the product the most is the fact that it does not dry out your skin.  I personally use a face lotion every day after washing my face, but this product did not leave my face feeling like the Sahara desert like some washes are capable of doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a decent face wash I think you will like this one, it does what it promises, and after about a week of consistent use you should see clearer skin.</li>
            <li> My son uses this, and it is just as advertised. Good, clean, no-residue product that is exactly what a teenager needs for that window of years where you have to deal with acne. Noticeable improvement on my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clearasil products since I was a teenager and was usually impressed with the results. Fast forward about twenty years and I still have the occassional breakout hear and there. So I decided to give the Clearasil face wash a chance. Well I like the way my face feels after using this product but I have to say after 3 weeks of using it, I still have breakouts. So for me it&#x27;s a good facewash but does nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> This seems like a pretty good creamy face wash. Nothing really special about it. It seems like a good value for the quality. Feels really nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy. These go for over 8 dollars here in NYC so getting 4 for like 15 is a steal. My son battles acne constantly and this has salycilic acid in it to fight acne. It smells great and works even better. Take advantage of this before the prices go up. Just a quarter size of soap twice a day is all you need to stay fresh.</li>
            <li> I am a preteen girl who has gone through puberty really quickly, and during that process, have gotten a horrible face full of acne! Not just mild, it&#x27;s everywhere and red! I have been usin this wash for about 1 week or so, and I see a big difference! My face feels incredible smooth in the morning when I wash it at night... And the redness has gone away a lot! My face has been clearing up so much!! I don&#x27;t recommend buying this online because of the price. I bought it at my local Ocean State Job Lot for about $4.00 . But I would DEFIANTLY recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> This wash is great - it&#x27;s thick, rich, provides full coverage of your face and neck. I&#x27;ve used it for 5 days straight at night, and so far have had great results. I&#x27;ve had less breakouts and those that I did have before I began using the product, diminished fairly quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to wipe off (I use a washcloth) and makes your face feel great!</li>
            <li> Been using this for YEARS!  I don&#x27;t get crazy break-outs or anything like that.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a great cleanser. Dries your face a little, but good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This face wash is the only wash that I can use on my face.  I have had oily/combination/dry - you name it from my teen years on up.  Clearasil Daily Clear Acne Face Wash is amazing at keeping my face moist but not oily.  My son has also started using this for teenage acne and within one or two washes we saw a noticeable difference!  I hope they NEVER stop making this!  (I&#x27;m 36 - so a 20 year user of this product!)</li>
            <li> Helps clean my face very well. Makes it feel very clean and helped treat my acne. I also use it on my chest and back.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but you dont save any money by buying in the 4 pack you can buy them individually from the store and safe about 2 or 3 dollars</li>
            <li> I love this product! It takes off my long-wearing make-up without any effort. I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer for YEARS!</li>
            <li> I have a very active t-zone and a combination skin where my cheeks can get dry very easily. I have tried probably every brand of face wash. I did used to use Clearasil as a teenager and decided to try it again. Now this does seem to work as I can notice almost right away the pimple is smaller. However, I don&#x27;t think it would actually mean 85% less pimples in 4 weeks as it advertises. This still will dry your skin a bit. Albeit, it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry it as much as previous face wash that I have tried. This is because this contains the usual salicylic acid. I have had a history of horrible acne as a teenager and that got better as I got older and my hormones leveled off but many women can relate to the fact that no matter how much you wash your face, the hormones that will surface around a certain time each month will produce a few pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent itself is not overpowering and pleasant. It does burn a little if you leave it on too long and I wish it left me feeling more refreshed than burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this does seem to work but to me, it&#x27;s like every other face wash I&#x27;ve tried. You will still have dry spots and it will not get rid of you ever getting a pimple completely.</li>
            <li> This is a good face wash.  It foams well and smells nice.  I notice that for me salicylic acid face washes help to prevent break outs.  This one works well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent \\&quot;salicylic acid\\&quot; wash for acne or skin prone to occasional breakouts.  Cleans well and rinses clean, reducing redness and irritation.  I use this face wash daily as an integral part of my skin care to prevent occasional break-outs.</li>
            <li> CLEARASIL DAILY FACE WASH, 6.5-Ounce Tube, seemed like a safe bet to purchase. After all, Clearasil products have been around for some time, proving to do what they claim. Having a teen, preteen, and one that will be a preteen, soon, I imagine we&#x27;ll have acne products in our house for a number more years. CLEARASIL being one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being a great product, I was a little more then concerned and surprised by another&#x27;s review in regards to the ingredient, salicylic acid. I did a little research myself, confirming my apprehension. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever understand why the government allows for consumers health to be in jeopardy, allowing such things to be marketed when they are clearly not safe and or come with unfavorable side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description:&lt;br /&gt;Clearasil Daily Face Wash Tube, this rich, pearly cream gently cleanses skin without over drying.

            <li> If they had more stars, I would give them.  This is the nicest acne cleanser I have ever tried and I have tried quite a few of them.  I like salicylic acid in the cleanser because it is a very good medicine for acne, however it often causes over-drying, which causes me more breakouts, not less.  This cleanser is a cream cleanser so not only does it not over-dry, but the medicine is delivered to your pores even more effectively.  My skin is dry-ish, but not over-dry, just the way I like it.  I use the product twice a day, which I absolutely cannot do with the truly &#x27;oil-free&#x27; salicylic cleansers.  This one does say &#x27;oil-free&#x27; on the front but it has stearic acid in it, which is hydrogenated palm oil (a hard, waxy substance often used in moisturizing lotions and even candles). It has a creamy, shimmery quality which makes it pleasant to use.  If you cannot get a hold of this exact product and want to mimic its effects, try massaging your face with olive oil or cold cream and then using one of the truly &#x27;oil-free&#x27; salicylic acid cleansers.  It&#x27;s not a bad substitute if you need it.</li>
            <li> Clearasil is almost an iconic product from my adolescence. Having had more than the usual troubles with acne in my teenage years, some sort of Clearasil product was always in my bathroom cabinet. I don&#x27;t remember if they marketed a Daily Face Wash back in the &#x27;70s when my skin was an oily maze of blackheads and pimples. If they did, I might have benefited from that more than what I was using. This is more a preventive treatment, and it works quite splendidly. I no longer suffer from breakouts, but my skin is still is still oily, and I find this product is very effective in combating that problem. It&#x27;s especially effective before bedtime and in the morning. It dries the skin, but not to the extent that you then need a moisturizer to counter its effects. A good product.</li>
            <li> I am in my twenties, and I STILL break out like a teen. I used to have a prescription facewash, but when it ran out I couldn&#x27;t afford to get more and my face was SUFFERING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I found this Clearasil wash. Is it perfect? No. If I got one or two zits when using my prescription, then I get two or three using this. But that&#x27;s A LOT better than the 7-8 I get without washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend getting a good facial lotion to use after this, as sometimes it leaves me dry. But not always, which is curious. Maybe that&#x27;s just my skin. I&#x27;m a freak-o-nature or something.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and occasional breakouts, and this face wash does not irritate my skin and leaves a fresh, clean feeling. The reason I give it only 4 stars is that I feel it would be a more efficient cleaner with a slight amount of exfoliate to it. I use an exfoliation mask in combination with this cleaner to remove dry, dead skin about once a week. This face wash is a nice, smooth soap with a light suds if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never sure how to rate products like this, mostly because it&#x27;s difficult to determine whether the claims that it will reduce breakouts are true unless you&#x27;ve been using it for several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this once a day, every day, for three weeks (in the morning while I shower). There hasn&#x27;t been a noticeable difference in the number of pimples I have, but to be fair, the product claims that it takes 4 weeks to be completely effective (and we have a maximum of four weeks to write a review for Amazon Vine products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do like the product, especially for the price at around $4 per tube. The products I normally use as face wash in the shower are typically $6-8 per bottle/tube, and it seems to me as though this one works as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried. It does dry out my skin a bit, but not near as severely as other face washes, and I like the creamy consistency of it as well as the mild scent. I&#x27;ve also gotten a bit in my eyes a couple of times, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to burn as badly as other products when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint at this point is minor, and perhaps a bit silly. I have all of my shower products on a caddy that hangs from the shower head, so the tube of this face wash gets dripped on. The way it&#x27;s designed--so that the tube rests on the cap--it collects a fair amount of water in the lid, so every time I open the tube, water that has gathered in the lid falls out, and it kind of grosses me out.</li>
            <li> I can say it hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin so far, which tends to be one of my biggest issues with most products. It doesn&#x27;t get all of my make-up off in one wash, but I wear semi-heavy foundation since I have imperfections, so maybe no cleanser could get it all (unless if sheer coverage). But no biggie anyway because I just rinse &amp; repeat to ensure that my face truly gets cleansed as well. And it seems to have already minimized a breakout I had earlier in the week.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Clearasil facial products.  Usually the acne treatments and sometimes the cleansers.  This particular cleanser works very well at getting fairly thick makeup off your face gently.  It has a pleasant fragrance and a creamy consistency.  You don&#x27;t need very much to wash your entire face and it also works well on a shower loofah on your shoulders and back.  I sometimes use it with a Buff Puff for extra scrubbing power.</li>
            <li> I like how you only need a very little bit to lather up well. It goes in creamy unless you get it wet first before applying to you face.  My pores are definitely less clogged after a couple weeks of using this.  I really like it except for the scent. I prefer unscented products.</li>
            <li> Clearasil is one of the best face wash products on the market and this face wash is no exception. The price is appropriate and I feel it really works at getting rid of all the miniscule grime that builds up each day in your pores. I also recommend this for both genders and it&#x27;s perfect for teens and adults, as well as those with bad acne or just want their face to feel fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
