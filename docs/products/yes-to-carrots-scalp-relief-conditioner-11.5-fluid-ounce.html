            <li>Yes to Carrots has a great product line!</li>
            <li>My skin clears up, and my hair looks great without flakes!</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair feel awesome.</li>
            <li>I also reviewed the shampoo, but I am so impressed with this product combination!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>Works great, smells AWESOME.</li>
            <li>and I see an incredible difference in my scalp and hair condition.</li>
            <li>and I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner I have used honestly.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t something that I consider pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best detanglers I have ever used--it has a lot of slip and is easy to get through my hair.</li>
            <li>not giving up just yet , it feels good smells good, but my problem is still there.</li>
            <li>Happy I was able to find this online for my husband.</li>
            <li>I have been using YesTo Carrots shampoo and conditioner for 3 mos and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>i sure hope not!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product!  </li>
            <li>My scalp is regulated and my hair feels amazingly hydrated.</li>
            <li>nice tea tree conditioner</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own with unmedicated shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love how both the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair clean, shiny and smelling great.</li>
            <li>This has been the most effective product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>He likes this brand the best out of all dandruff shampoos and, of course, they now no longer carry it in stores near us.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using shampoo for the most part.</li>
            <li>I have a habit of never buying the same shampoo twice in a row because I always felt that my hair responded best when I switched it up each time...</li>
            <li>Love the yes to carrots line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I use this to co-wash and it leaves my hair frizz free without making it oily!</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle, and was fairly pleased with how it made my hair feel and the ingredients are great.</li>
            <li>Works better than tea tree oil for me, and doesn&#x27;t have that smell.  </li>
            <li>I used Avalon for a while in a period after I ran out of this, before I could get more...</li>
            <li>but it was ok in the end:</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I have had dandruff most of my life.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>just okay conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>and it feels so healthy even.</li>
            <li>I have colored hair and a perm, when I use this, my hair looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it did it in a much more quality way.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and also the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with itchy or irritated scalp most of my life (but no dandruff).  </li>
            <li>Good smell, leaves hair feeling clean and not overly drying, free of petroleum, no SLS,</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product!</li>
            <li>Beautiful curls with no wet look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is strong.</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing, it smells GREAT compared to T Gel and other medicated shampoos, so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the carrot aroma as well.</li>
            <li>, it has a light tea tree medicinal smell, but once your hair dries, the smell goes away.</li>
            <li>I also tried this conditioner because a couple of people mentioned that it helps smooth the hair out.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t fit the bill on what I was paying for it.</li>
            <li>Very fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product because of dandruff and it definetely helped towards relieving some of it.</li>
            <li>The best thing is, after a couple of uses, it actually started to clear up my scalp</li>
            <li>As a lady with chronic scalp issues this is by far the best daily conditioner I have found.</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>Her hair is thicker and wavier and mine is thinner and more straight</li>
            <li>BUT, my scalp is much healthier, so the product does what it says for sure.</li>
            <li>These have helped the breaking out on my scalp tremendously and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling coated and waxy.</li>
            <li>helped my itchy head after the first use!</li>
            <li>I stopped using most strongly chemical shampoos several years ago.</li>
            <li>First of all, the &amp;#34;nice clean smell&amp;#34; that people have referred to just smells like my dogs shampoo to me.</li>
            <li>This conditioner would probably work well on most hair types that just need light to moderate conditioning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went hunting for a product which would get rid of the problem a bit more naturally, and this makes a really nice daily cowash.</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>This has no perfume and has a small amount of tea tree oil along with a lot of great scalp nourishing ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works really well!</li>
            <li>Just a tip if itâ€™s not moisturizing enough for you, you could do what I do and add a more moisturizing conditioner on the length if</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so shiny, smooth and felt so soft.</li>
            <li>I used this conditioner right after using the shampoo and it didn&#x27;t do much to return moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li>as soon as I got a new bottle my hair started recovering after the very first shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fresh baked cookies or anything, but it&#x27;s kind of nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of my main priorities for using conditioner soft manageable smooth</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner, and it definitely helps make my hair much more shiny than with any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like canned carrots cooking on a stove with a slight lemon cleaner undertone.</li>
            <li>It detangles very well.</li>
            <li>I think the combination of the dandruff-fighting ingredients in this gentle, moisturizing conditioner is what makes it work so well for me.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and works wonders for my scalp.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>The itching of my scalp is severely reduced for which I am very thankful.</li>
            <li>It really helps my itchy scalp and I can feel the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; sensation when I am using it.</li>
            <li>really just the feel of it.</li>
            <li>Also the scent is unusual but it is growing on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My whole family has been using Yes products for a while now.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to like this</li>
            <li>but I purchased this conditioner because I heard it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not instantly, but by the time I&#x27;m about 1/2 through the bottle, it&#x27;s significantly better or completely resolved.</li>
            <li>Overall one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used, and I will keep using it unless something comes along in the same price range that doesn&#x27;t give the same dry feeling after heat styling.</li>
            <li>If you use the shampoo and have ethnic hair that is a 3 or 4 in curl pattern, make sure to do a pre-poo (oil up your hair before you use the shampoo) to avoid your hair being stripped of its natural oils as the shampoo feels like a clarifying shampoo because it left my hair aqueaky clean to the point of being dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>It gives me an extra full day before my hair gets oily.</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and looking very shiny!</li>
            <li>bottle wasn&#x27;t full when I got it either, it took about five &#x27;air squeezes&#x27; to actually get product to come out.</li>
            <li>New fav product!</li>
            <li>Love this!,tingles the scalp like Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo but half the the price..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a catch-22 because my hair is dry and loves co-washing (washing with a light conditioner instead of a shampoo), but my scalp gets this stubborn greasy buildup.</li>
            <li>I gave up after two uses and gave it to my husband (he&#x27;s not as particular as I am).</li>
            <li>but it was highly recommended to me.</li>
            <li>So I did a little research and found there weren&#x27;t many at all.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to see a little more improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did make my hair soft, but didn&#x27;t really affect the frizziness.</li>
            <li>Love that it is 95% natural (although it does have a few nasties in there)</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The symptoms are diminishing every day, and mostly now after about a month I have smaller white flakes and occasional itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li>unique thing about this conditioner is that is has some of the most effective ingredients usually found in dandruff shampoos (salicylic acid and tea tree), but in a gentle conditioner base.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY shampoo that really does what it says it will do for your scalp.</li>
            <li>The conditioner works well, but has a different smell that I don&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li>The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 star rating is that it really didn&#x27;t seem to soothe my scalp.</li>
            <li>If you are just looking for a good-smelling, natural Conditioner then buy this.  </li>
            <li>I realize it isn&#x27;t all natural, but for me it worked: http://www.amazon.com/Head-Shoulders-Minute-Moisturizer-Treatment/dp/B00FIZGN2Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_41?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422134138&amp;sr&#x3D;1-41&amp;keywords&#x3D;dandruff+head+and+shoulders.</li>
            <li>my kinky/curly hair comes out incredibly soft, and defined.</li>
            <li>So soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I also got an undertone of the &#x27;old person smell&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really sensitive to smell though, so maybe these things aren&#x27;t justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as the way my hair looks, there is no frizz at all, but the volume and shine of my hair has also been lost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am highly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>product contains most of the natural ingredients thought to help for serious dandruff.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s decent as a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>For more than 2 years I have suffered with little to no success from other (pretty much all) over-the-counter products and prescription products .</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>It will have the wet crunchy look when it first dries, but just scrunch it up a bit</li>
            <li>It soothes my scalp, no scary ingredients, and my hair is soft, shiny and less tangled.</li>
            <li>I generally like the Yes line of products.  </li>
            <li>the only thing that has ever gotten rid of my dandruff was Clear for Men, shampoo</li>
            <li>It has a very thick and rich consistency and the first time I used it I realized it is conditioning enough to be used as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft but didn&#x27;t fix or minimise the dry scalp problem that I have</li>
            <li>I could never leave dandruff shampoos on my scalp long enough for the medicine to soak in and work because it would dry out my hair and scalp so much.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s partially related to a new job where the air is very dry and partially related to another product</li>

            <li> Overall one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used, and I will keep using it unless something comes along in the same price range that doesn&#x27;t give the same dry feeling after heat styling.</li>
            <li> If you use the shampoo and have ethnic hair that is a 3 or 4 in curl pattern, make sure to do a pre-poo (oil up your hair before you use the shampoo) to avoid your hair being stripped of its natural oils as the shampoo feels like a clarifying shampoo because it left my hair aqueaky clean to the point of being dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> It gives me an extra full day before my hair gets oily.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and looking very shiny!</li>
            <li> bottle wasn&#x27;t full when I got it either, it took about five &#x27;air squeezes&#x27; to actually get product to come out.</li>
            <li> New fav product!</li>
            <li> Love this!,tingles the scalp like Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo but half the the price..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a catch-22 because my hair is dry and loves co-washing (washing with a light conditioner instead of a shampoo), but my scalp gets this stubborn greasy buildup.</li>
            <li> I gave up after two uses and gave it to my husband (he&#x27;s not as particular as I am).</li>
            <li> but it was highly recommended to me.</li>
            <li> So I did a little research and found there weren&#x27;t many at all.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see a little more improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did make my hair soft, but didn&#x27;t really affect the frizziness.</li>
            <li> Love that it is 95% natural (although it does have a few nasties in there)</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The symptoms are diminishing every day, and mostly now after about a month I have smaller white flakes and occasional itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> unique thing about this conditioner is that is has some of the most effective ingredients usually found in dandruff shampoos (salicylic acid and tea tree), but in a gentle conditioner base.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY shampoo that really does what it says it will do for your scalp.</li>
            <li> The conditioner works well, but has a different smell that I don&#x27;t really care for.</li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 star rating is that it really didn&#x27;t seem to soothe my scalp.</li>
            <li> If you are just looking for a good-smelling, natural Conditioner then buy this.  </li>
            <li> I realize it isn&#x27;t all natural, but for me it worked: http://www.amazon.com/Head-Shoulders-Minute-Moisturizer-Treatment/dp/B00FIZGN2Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_41?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422134138&amp;sr&#x3D;1-41&amp;keywords&#x3D;dandruff+head+and+shoulders.</li>
            <li> my kinky/curly hair comes out incredibly soft, and defined.</li>
            <li> So soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I also got an undertone of the &#x27;old person smell&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sensitive to smell though, so maybe these things aren&#x27;t justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as the way my hair looks, there is no frizz at all, but the volume and shine of my hair has also been lost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am highly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes.  </li>
            <li> product contains most of the natural ingredients thought to help for serious dandruff.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s decent as a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> For more than 2 years I have suffered with little to no success from other (pretty much all) over-the-counter products and prescription products .</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> It will have the wet crunchy look when it first dries, but just scrunch it up a bit</li>
            <li> It soothes my scalp, no scary ingredients, and my hair is soft, shiny and less tangled.</li>
            <li> I generally like the Yes line of products.  </li>
            <li> the only thing that has ever gotten rid of my dandruff was Clear for Men, shampoo</li>
            <li> It has a very thick and rich consistency and the first time I used it I realized it is conditioning enough to be used as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft but didn&#x27;t fix or minimise the dry scalp problem that I have</li>
            <li> I could never leave dandruff shampoos on my scalp long enough for the medicine to soak in and work because it would dry out my hair and scalp so much.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s partially related to a new job where the air is very dry and partially related to another product</li>
            <li> It really smells like raw carrots</li>
            <li> The only shampoo and conditioner that actually relieves my teenage son&#x27;s dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that my hair is left feeling a bit dry and hay like after heat styling.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad but not great.</li>
            <li> It leaves it soft, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of smelling like a hippy, but it&#x27;s pretty subtle once your hair dries.</li>
            <li> I also gave it a try and as a conditioner it leaves hair frizzy and not soft.</li>
            <li> This conditioner helped but did not completely alleviate my dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> only con is that my local stores don&#x27;t carry it and the shampoo comes in a two pack on amazon for $7 while this product conditioner costs a little over $5 per bottle.</li>
            <li> It really helps to calm down my scalp when cold, dry weather hits.</li>
            <li> , I believe it does help with a dry scalp condition and</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and it&#x27;s even on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, frizzy, and tends towards breakage and damage.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and this says it is for dry hair</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, dry scalp or dandruff try co washing with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It does work well treating dry scalp with dandruff</li>
            <li> For me, it did nothing for my dry flakey scalp.  </li>
            <li> This product along with the shampoo does get rid of dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> The consistency isn&#x27;t runny as other conditioners are.</li>
            <li> I like this product, provides relief for scalp due to psoriasis, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this didn&#x27;t get rid of my intense scalp itch, which seems to be going away on</li>
            <li> But recently I&#x27;ve had some serious itchy scalp issues...</li>
            <li> The itching is less and my hair loss is a lot less.  </li>
            <li> I had stubborn waxy scalp buildup and flakes--seborrheic dermatitis, combined with delicate, dry wavy hair.</li>
            <li> yes marketing strategies leave little to be desired.</li>
            <li> I usually wash it once every other day, but couldn&#x27;t do that with this</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this conditioner after reading the reviews, but after two days I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste it here.</li>
            <li> My scalp tends to be a bit itchy from taking hair growth vitamins and from heavy use of hair gels.</li>
            <li> n worse after an entire bottle.  </li>
            <li> (Usually a cheaper conditioner, to save money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that after using this product for several weeks I didn&#x27;t notice a reduction in itchiness.</li>
            <li> Im not sure, but</li>
            <li> No better</li>
            <li> Money is hard earned.</li>
            <li> I have dry, damaged hair, very thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I mean he scratches until lit hurts.</li>
            <li> I have a flaky, dry scalp and it drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> i like the &amp;#34;hope&amp;#34; of this shampoo, but it made my dandruff worse actually :(</li>
            <li> It has a very thick consistency which makes it stay in my hair while I was my body.</li>
            <li> but she was not happy with the state</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to buy this but will be experimenting with ways to thin it without reducing the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The conditioner works well (some natural conditioners are terrible) and I have no scalp issues.</li>
            <li> being said, this product is soooo extremely thick that it is very difficult to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have scalp issues, and have been unable to use anything</li>
            <li> sad.  </li>
            <li> I have very tough dandruff and this conditioner eases the itchiness and dryness.</li>
            <li> The tea tree scent isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Crap products with a bunch of promises that result in nothingness.</li>
            <li> No frizz or anything, so it&#x27;s not too terrible,</li>

            <li> The only shampoo and conditioner that actually relieves my teenage son&#x27;s dry scalp. I mean he scratches until lit hurts. This stuff works really well!</li>
            <li> yes marketing strategies leave little to be desired. Crap products with a bunch of promises that result in nothingness. Money is hard earned. Don&#x27;t waste it here.</li>
            <li> I have very tough dandruff and this conditioner eases the itchiness and dryness. I really enjoy the carrot aroma as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever bought.The consistency isn&#x27;t runny as other conditioners are. It has a very thick consistency which makes it stay in my hair while I was my body. It detangles very well. I would buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li> Yes to Carrots has a great product line! My skin clears up, and my hair looks great without flakes!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, I believe it does help with a dry scalp condition and the price is right.</li>
            <li> nice tea tree conditioner</li>
            <li> Love this!,tingles the scalp like Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo but half the the price.. New fav product! Shampoo too!</li>
            <li> I had stubborn waxy scalp buildup and flakes--seborrheic dermatitis, combined with delicate, dry wavy hair. It&#x27;s a catch-22 because my hair is dry and loves co-washing (washing with a light conditioner instead of a shampoo), but my scalp gets this stubborn greasy buildup. Even the harshest shampoos (Nizoral, Head and Shoulders, T/Sal) wouldn&#x27;t remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unique thing about this conditioner is that is has some of the most effective ingredients usually found in dandruff shampoos (salicylic acid and tea tree), but in a gentle conditioner base. I co-wash with it, massaging it into my scalp and leaving it to soak while I take the rest of my shower (about 10 minutes). This is one of the best detanglers I have ever used--it has a lot of slip and is easy to get through my hair. It leaves it soft, but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. The best thing is, after a couple of uses, it actually started to clear up my scalp issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was literally the only thing that worked for me! I think the combination of the dandruff-fighting ingredients in this gentle, moisturizing conditioner is what makes it work so well for me. I could never leave dandruff shampoos on my scalp long enough for the medicine to soak in and work because it would dry out my hair and scalp so much. Then, my scalp would get irritated and over-produce oil in response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, what I do now is massage this into my scalp and apply a different conditioner to my length, and let it all soak for about 10 minutes while I shower. (Usually a cheaper conditioner, to save money. But thatâ€™s just my preference.) This conditioner would probably work well on most hair types that just need light to moderate conditioning. Just a tip if itâ€™s not moisturizing enough for you, you could do what I do and add a more moisturizing conditioner on the length if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has a light tea tree medicinal smell, but once your hair dries, the smell goes away. I havenâ€™t tried the shampoo that goes with this yet, because I donâ€™t need to shampoo that often now that I have this conditioner!</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so shiny, smooth and felt so soft. Sadly, this didn&#x27;t get rid of my intense scalp itch, which seems to be going away on it&#x27;s own with unmedicated shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.  I generally like the Yes line of products.  However, this did not help my hair situation.  I felt like my hair was being stripped or something.  I gave up after two uses and gave it to my husband (he&#x27;s not as particular as I am).</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product! I have dry skin, and it&#x27;s even on my scalp. So I was so hopeful for this to provide some relief for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong. It&#x27;s tea tree, which to me almost smells like a type of appliance cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did make my hair soft, but didn&#x27;t really affect the frizziness. I also felt like. I had to wash my hair daily when using this conditioner. It seemed to make my hair get greasy faster. I usually wash it once every other day, but couldn&#x27;t do that with this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t help my flakiness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using shampoo for the most part. I also put some coconut oil on my scalp once a week, and this routine has helped with the flakiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for me, but could totally work for someone else. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it unless you need it for your scalp. The smell isn&#x27;t something that I consider pleasant. I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle. I purchased.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, frizzy, and tends towards breakage and damage. I stopped using most strongly chemical shampoos several years ago. But recently I&#x27;ve had some serious itchy scalp issues... I think it&#x27;s partially related to a new job where the air is very dry and partially related to another product my hair didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went hunting for a product which would get rid of the problem a bit more naturally, and this makes a really nice daily cowash. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo once or twice a week. I had scaly looking white flakes with an occasional yellowish tinge, and a constantly itchy scalp. The symptoms are diminishing every day, and mostly now after about a month I have smaller white flakes and occasional itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains most of the natural ingredients thought to help for serious dandruff. Salicylic Acid, lemon, and tea tree oil. It also does not smell like dog shampoo. It smells kind of like canned carrots cooking on a stove with a slight lemon cleaner undertone. It&#x27;s not fresh baked cookies or anything, but it&#x27;s kind of nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that my local stores don&#x27;t carry it and the shampoo comes in a two pack on amazon for $7 while this product conditioner costs a little over $5 per bottle. That seems out of whack.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and this says it is for dry hair but it was highly recommended to me. So I decided to give it a try and I am really happy with it. It gives me an extra full day before my hair gets oily. It also makes my hair feel awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that after using this product for several weeks I didn&#x27;t notice a reduction in itchiness. I gave it two stars because I like the company and it&#x27;s decent as a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY shampoo that really does what it says it will do for your scalp. I have a flaky, dry scalp and it drives me crazy. It&#x27;s not instantly, but by the time I&#x27;m about 1/2 through the bottle, it&#x27;s significantly better or completely resolved. I have a habit of never buying the same shampoo twice in a row because I always felt that my hair responded best when I switched it up each time...but every time I go back to something else, my scalp annoyances start again. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be switching to anything else again.</li>
            <li> Love the yes to carrots line. Very hydrating and works wonders for my scalp. I definitely see a decrease in dandruff. The tea tree scent isn&#x27;t too bad. I&#x27;m not a fan of smelling like a hippy, but it&#x27;s pretty subtle once your hair dries.</li>
            <li> I like this product, provides relief for scalp due to psoriasis, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought and Tried both the shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s okay. If you use the shampoo and have ethnic hair that is a 3 or 4 in curl pattern, make sure to do a pre-poo (oil up your hair before you use the shampoo) to avoid your hair being stripped of its natural oils as the shampoo feels like a clarifying shampoo because it left my hair aqueaky clean to the point of being dry and frizzy. I used this conditioner right after using the shampoo and it didn&#x27;t do much to return moisture to my hair. My scalp felt relief for a week though. My scalp tends to be a bit itchy from taking hair growth vitamins and from heavy use of hair gels. I also tried this conditioner because a couple of people mentioned that it helps smooth the hair out. I didn&#x27;t get this effect from this shampoo or the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. As a lady with chronic scalp issues this is by far the best daily conditioner I have found. My scalp is regulated and my hair feels amazingly hydrated. It always sells out in my local stores so I bought four bottles to stock up.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, wavy hair. I use this to co-wash and it leaves my hair frizz free without making it oily!</li>
            <li> I started reacting to every shampoo and conditioner and breaking out on my scalp. Not dandruff, but actual pimples. I tried lots of different things, but I think I was reacting to all the junk that&#x27;s in regular shampoos and conditioners. Then genius hit me. I wondered if there were any shampoos or conditioners with salicylic acid in them? After all, that&#x27;s what you use on your face when it breaks out, right? So I did a little research and found there weren&#x27;t many at all. Selsun Blue Naturals is the only one I could find that was sold in stores besides this. However, Selsun doesn&#x27;t have a conditioner so it was out. I took a chance and ordered these on Amazon, but I&#x27;ve since found a Target nearby that sells them. These have helped the breaking out on my scalp tremendously and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling coated and waxy. Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I also reviewed the shampoo, but I am so impressed with this product combination! I have scalp issues, and have been unable to use anything but T Gel for years. The conditioner works well (some natural conditioners are terrible) and I have no scalp issues. Although it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing, it smells GREAT compared to T Gel and other medicated shampoos, so I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it says it will. The itching of my scalp is severely reduced for which I am very thankful. The conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and looking very shiny!</li>
            <li> This product has been such a relief.  I have been using YesTo Carrots shampoo and conditioner for 3 mos and LOVE it! After about a month my persistent scalp problem has finally been resolved.  For more than 2 years I have suffered with little to no success from other (pretty much all) over-the-counter products and prescription products .</li>
            <li> This conditioner helped but did not completely alleviate my dry itchy scalp. I used the whole bottle, and was fairly pleased with how it made my hair feel and the ingredients are great. It just didn&#x27;t fit the bill on what I was paying for it.</li>
            <li> It really helps my itchy scalp and I can feel the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; sensation when I am using it. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works better than tea tree oil for me, and doesn&#x27;t have that smell.  I used Avalon for a while in a period after I ran out of this, before I could get more... but it was ok in the end: as soon as I got a new bottle my hair started recovering after the very first shower.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner, and it definitely helps make my hair much more shiny than with any other I&#x27;ve tried. The only issue is that my hair is left feeling a bit dry and hay like after heat styling. No frizz or anything, so it&#x27;s not too terrible, really just the feel of it. Overall one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used, and I will keep using it unless something comes along in the same price range that doesn&#x27;t give the same dry feeling after heat styling.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair, dry scalp or dandruff try co washing with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> helped my itchy head after the first use!</li>
            <li> i like the &amp;#34;hope&amp;#34; of this shampoo, but it made my dandruff worse actually :( sad.  the only thing that has ever gotten rid of my dandruff was Clear for Men, shampoo</li>
            <li> It seems to get the job done and without using lots of chemicals. I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel. However, I think the lemon in it is actually lightening my hair in spots! Im not sure, but i sure hope not!</li>
            <li> Dont know if this actually works for the scalp as I ordered it for my mom and she returned it to me after one use. She has very sensitive skin so I was hoping this would help her but she was not happy with the state her hair was in after use. I also gave it a try and as a conditioner it leaves hair frizzy and not soft. Her hair is thicker and wavier and mine is thinner and more straight so we both have different hair types and same result. That&#x27;s one of my main priorities for using conditioner soft manageable smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however recommend the (regular) Yes to Carrots Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff most of my life.  This has been the most effective product I have ever used.  I have even used prescription products that did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this product is soooo extremely thick that it is very difficult to get out of the bottle.  Also the scent is unusual but it is growing on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this but will be experimenting with ways to thin it without reducing the effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The conditioner works well, but has a different smell that I don&#x27;t really care for. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It soothes my scalp, no scary ingredients, and my hair is soft, shiny and less tangled. Plus, it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li> Happy I was able to find this online for my husband. He likes this brand the best out of all dandruff shampoos and, of course, they now no longer carry it in stores near us.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft but didn&#x27;t fix or minimise the dry scalp problem that I have</li>
            <li> just okay conditioner.  nothing special</li>
            <li> My whole family has been using Yes products for a while now.  Love how both the shampoo and conditioner leave my hair clean, shiny and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to like this and it&#x27;s shampoo but all I feel is blah would I use it. It does work well treating dry scalp with dandruff but my hair is so lifeless after using. I&#x27;m a big fan of the \\&quot;Yes To..\\&quot; brand but I will not buy this product again. If you&#x27;re looking for something for dandruff and don&#x27;t want to use head and shoulders, I recommend using Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree line.</li>
            <li> Love this. Love that it is 95% natural (although it does have a few nasties in there) Works great, smells AWESOME. Very fresh smelling. It really smells like raw carrots and I love that. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 5 star rating is that it really didn&#x27;t seem to soothe my scalp.</li>
            <li> If you are just looking for a good-smelling, natural Conditioner then buy this.  For me, it did nothing for my dry flakey scalp.  No better n worse after an entire bottle.  I would up buying some of this, and after about 5 applications, am definitely seeing a change.  I realize it isn&#x27;t all natural, but for me it worked: http://www.amazon.com/Head-Shoulders-Minute-Moisturizer-Treatment/dp/B00FIZGN2Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_41?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422134138&amp;sr&#x3D;1-41&amp;keywords&#x3D;dandruff+head+and+shoulders.</li>
            <li> Pros: Good smell, leaves hair feeling clean and not overly drying, free of petroleum, no SLS, no Parabens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None</li>
            <li> Im still hopeful that it will do its job. not giving up just yet , it feels good smells good, but my problem is still there. only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have scalp issues but I purchased this conditioner because I heard it is very moisturizing. It has a very thick and rich consistency and the first time I used it I realized it is conditioning enough to be used as a deep conditioner. When I slather this conditioner on and put a plastic cap on for ~30 minutes my kinky/curly hair comes out incredibly soft, and defined. There is no frizz and it feels so healthy even. I am currently in need of a trim and this was just what I needed while my hair appointment is approaching and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Best conditioner I have used honestly.</li>
            <li> It really helps to calm down my scalp when cold, dry weather hits.</li>
            <li> This product along with the shampoo does get rid of dry scalp.  The smell is not bad but not great. After washing, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I have dry, damaged hair, very thin hair.  This conditioner is a miracle worker.  I use it when I bathe and then also as a leave in conditioner.  I have colored hair and a perm, when I use this, my hair looks healthy.  It will have the wet crunchy look when it first dries, but just scrunch it up a bit and it&#x27;s perfect.  Beautiful curls with no wet look.  So soft and shiny.  This also helps with my Candida rash on my head.  The itching is less and my hair loss is a lot less.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months and I see an incredible difference in my scalp and hair condition.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this conditioner after reading the reviews, but after two days I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. First of all, the &amp;#34;nice clean smell&amp;#34; that people have referred to just smells like my dogs shampoo to me. I also got an undertone of the &#x27;old person smell&#x27;. I&#x27;m really sensitive to smell though, so maybe these things aren&#x27;t justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the way my hair looks, there is no frizz at all, but the volume and shine of my hair has also been lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle wasn&#x27;t full when I got it either, it took about five &#x27;air squeezes&#x27; to actually get product to come out. BUT, my scalp is much healthier, so the product does what it says for sure. I just wish it did it in a much more quality way.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product because of dandruff and it definetely helped towards relieving some of it. I was hoping to see a little more improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product!  I love this conditioner and also the shampoo.  I have suffered with itchy or irritated scalp most of my life (but no dandruff).  I am highly sensitive to chemicals and perfumes.  This has no perfume and has a small amount of tea tree oil along with a lot of great scalp nourishing ingredients.  My scalp does not itch anymore and I get compliments all the time on my shiny hair.</li>
