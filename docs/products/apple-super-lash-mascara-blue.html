            <li> This range of mascara is all black, not colored! The product is called Apple Super Lash Mascara- Blue, so I assumed it would be blue inside. It&#x27;s a decent black mascara. Certainly not blue!!! Beware.</li>
            <li> The blue mascara I was looking for was the color of the tube.. When I put it on its NAVY..  It also flakes and have&lt;br /&gt;put it on over and over to keep on... Hard to wash off also.. Disappointed really</li>
            <li> I use this mascara maybe 12 years ago every day, I love the color is so blue, sometimes I use black or purple. Is the best mascara.</li>
