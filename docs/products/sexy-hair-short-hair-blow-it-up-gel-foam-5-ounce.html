            <li>This works pretty good on my hair</li>
            <li>It gives my hair such wonderful volume, I could just use a pinch of hair spray and my hair would be fine.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the real product.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for products to make styling my hair easy in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have fine, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It does add volume to hair and makes fine hair appear fuller</li>

            <li>I have very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>It is the first thing that has ever given my fine hair some texture and weight.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for short, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>you for quick delivery and still having the product</li>
            <li>This product is great for adding shine to the hair without heavy buildup.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to say I&#x27;ve tried at least eight of the Short Sexy Hair products; never because I&#x27;m dissatisfied with them, but rather because I like to try didn&#x27;t looks with my hair and try what works best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this gel foam (also known as mousse) is by far my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that i have used that gives me a full look and keeps my style all day.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, flat hair.</li>
            <li>The perfect product to add volume and texture to thin, fine short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>If you have fine, limp hair this product works wonderfully and will give you the effect of having full, thick hair.</li>
            <li>I had a can of Short Sexy Hair gel/foam in my cabinet</li>
            <li>I ordered the sexy short hair blow up gel that has a lady on the front of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Product works very well!</li>
            <li>This is the most terrific product ever!  </li>
            <li>The first one I had lasted forever, well, almost forever.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, and usually wants to stay pretty flat without this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use it on wet and dry hair and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I have very short, baby fine, straight hair....</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it gives my short, fine hair the body it needs without any stiffness.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like the texture of my hair when I use it.</li>
            <li>if you are thinking about the HealthySexyHair Beach Spray, it smells like Heaven but is very yucky feeling.</li>
            <li>I am very  upset about</li>
            <li>This product was wonderful for my short thin hair making it feel full with lots of extra hold and body.</li>
            <li>I unfortunately do not have lush think hair but rather fine hair that wants to fall flat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about $7 more at my local salon, so I&#x27;m pretty stoked Amazon offers it for a better deal because my hair sucks without it!</li>
            <li>She says she could not find it in stores where she normally purchsed it.</li>
            <li>It give fullness for the mod piecey styles or for regular styling as well.</li>
            <li>The product itself does its job, but dispenser doesn&#x27;t work properly : you can not get as much foam, as you need</li>
            <li>Wow was this a speedy delivery....</li>
            <li>I am believe the product is OLD.  </li>
            <li>i have short hair and these products really help.  </li>
            <li>Love it but could not fine it in my local stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>I went from long hair to a super short cut</li>
            <li>On a more serious note a little goes a long way and it makes styling my hair sooo easy!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for very long time already but the manufacturer stopped production of this exact item.</li>
            <li>I can blow dry it just a bit and wear it really spiky (with a bit of hair spray).</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my long hair has gotten thinner and has no body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only gel that is not too heavy which will help me manage my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I normally wash my hair at night, put this product in, and blow dry.</li>
            <li>am surprised nobody mentioned the dispenser problem, because it&#x27;s my second container with the same defective dispenser.</li>
            <li>but I have to just use a  little bit or my hair gets weighted down as it is baby fine.</li>
            <li>Amazon as usual has it and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I have very short, fine, thin hair that doesn&#x27;t have any body.</li>

            <li> Amazon as usual has it and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I have very short, fine, thin hair that doesn&#x27;t have any body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, however, very difficult to find in stores and a little pricey for the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Would have helped with how flat and lifeless it was (thus why I cut it so short).</li>
            <li> I actually wish I knew about this product when I had long hair.</li>
            <li> A tiny dollop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my hair when it was both short and long</li>
            <li> Mousses, volumizers, other products simply make my hair fall flat.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and poker straight.  </li>
            <li> Super Duper - hard find - all their products should be in all stoes!!</li>
            <li> This was no different to any other mousse that I have used.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> Work it through damp hair, blow dry and style.</li>
            <li> sparingly on towel-dried hair, then blow dry.</li>
            <li> Can also be used on dry hair to define and hold.</li>
            <li> I have it in a pixie-esque cut with flat side bangs and messy in the back.</li>
            <li> It does seem to help add a little volume but does make your hair very dry, even using a tiny bit</li>
            <li> I tried using as little as possible but it didn&#x27;t change the effect.</li>
            <li> This has a soft hold, so hair doesn&#x27;t look hard or wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying for a messy bob look but the texturizer products don&#x27;t give me enough volume.</li>
            <li> SO worth the price (some might think too expensive)</li>
            <li> It left my hair flat, dull, and sticky.</li>
            <li> You do need to use a blow dryer since it seems to be heat activated and keep in mind a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I forget the exact name of the vendor, but it included Fragrance in the name.  </li>
            <li> Or I can blow dry out all the way for a poofie/ fluffy look.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin  and needs volumizer that is not heavy.</li>
            <li> Once my hair is just damp, I put this on, flip my hair upside down and finish drying.</li>
            <li> my hair is still a little straw like, stiff and dry looking.</li>
            <li> I only need a very SMALL amount of this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy of a product and will just weigh it down.</li>
            <li> My hair feels heavy and sticky.</li>
            <li> Lots of product is wasted.  </li>
            <li> (in my humble opinion).  </li>
            <li> even the way it squirts out is messy.</li>
            <li> For people with thin long hair, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed and have only used it a few times, I will probably end up throwing it out or giving it away.</li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve used in the past gives my hair the volume I&#x27;m looking for except for this product.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses this and has a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, in fact, I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
            <li> I use this product, but it is very hard to find in the stores, so I ordered it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I got approximately 3 weeks of use from one bottle</li>

            <li> I went from long hair to a super short cut and I was looking for products to make styling my hair easy in the morning. I bought this gel and another bottle from the same brand and I love them. I just slide this stuff through my hair and style. It holds throughout the day while my hair doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s movement. Washes off easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for short, straight hair.  It give fullness for the mod piecey styles or for regular styling as well.</li>
            <li> Had my hair cut really short and no gels or foams I had would make it cooperate like I wanted it.  I had a can of Short Sexy Hair gel/foam in my cabinet I bought but not used.  I tried it and it worked perfectly.  No really stiff and certainly not sticky like you get from some gels.  Love it but could not fine it in my local stores anymore.  Had to order it online at Amazon! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It is great on short hair!</li>
            <li> I used it before and was very pleased but could not find it in retail stores anymore.My hair is thin  and needs volumizer that is not heavy. It does the job!</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best volumizing foam I&#x27;ve ever used. Beats Paul Mitchell for sure. It&#x27;s about $7 more at my local salon, so I&#x27;m pretty stoked Amazon offers it for a better deal because my hair sucks without it! I have a lot of hair, but it&#x27;s very fine, and usually wants to stay pretty flat without this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product was wonderful for my short thin hair making it feel full with lots of extra hold and body.</li>
            <li> I use this product, but it is very hard to find in the stores, so I ordered it through Amazon.  Unfortunately, I forget the exact name of the vendor, but it included Fragrance in the name.  I ordered three but one of the canisters did not work.</li>
            <li> The product itself does its job, but dispenser doesn&#x27;t work properly : you can not get as much foam, as you need, it keeps pouring.&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised nobody mentioned the dispenser problem, because it&#x27;s my second container with the same defective dispenser.</li>
            <li> This product is great for adding shine to the hair without heavy buildup.  I got approximately 3 weeks of use from one bottle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they are not going to make this any more. It is a great product. It works great on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered five and received three with no explanation for the shortage.  I think the product is a knock off.  Not as good as the real product.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and has a hard time finding it in stores. Amazon as usual has it and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Wow was this a speedy delivery....like 3 days and it was at my house. I absolutely love this product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works well as a gel and a mousse,  I use it on wet and dry hair and it works great.  I really liked the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the sexy short hair blow up gel that has a lady on the front of the bottle. Some how I got this product. My hair feels heavy and sticky. I would not recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This was no different to any other mousse that I have used. You only need a tiny bit or else your hair is like straw! It does seem to help add a little volume but does make your hair very dry, even using a tiny bit my hair is still a little straw like, stiff and dry looking. I was not impressed and have only used it a few times, I will probably end up throwing it out or giving it away.</li>
            <li> Best for fine hair.  Works great</li>
            <li> Directions are to shake well before using.  However, it still comes out runny before it foams.  Lots of product is wasted.  What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I have very short, baby fine, straight hair.... I do like this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. I&#x27;m trying for a messy bob look but the texturizer products don&#x27;t give me enough volume. Once my hair is just damp, I put this on, flip my hair upside down and finish drying. This has a soft hold, so hair doesn&#x27;t look hard or wet. I use SSH Shatter to add a bit more hold and to texturize as needed.</li>
            <li> Product works very well!</li>
            <li> I am believe the product is OLD.  The products comes out of the can, but it does not change from &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; to FOAM...it just sits in my hand. I looked for a date on the can, but could not find one.  I have used this products for the last 2 years, so I know it changes into a light-airy foam once you put some in your hand.  Sorry I purchased 6 cans...never again !!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best volume and feel for my baby fine hair. I can blow dry it just a bit and wear it really spiky (with a bit of hair spray). Or I can blow dry out all the way for a poofie/ fluffy look.</li>
            <li> Great product -- volume and hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say I&#x27;ve tried at least eight of the Short Sexy Hair products; never because I&#x27;m dissatisfied with them, but rather because I like to try didn&#x27;t looks with my hair and try what works best. I&#x27;ve found that this gel foam (also known as mousse) is by far my favorite hair product. I have very fine, flat hair. I have it in a pixie-esque cut with flat side bangs and messy in the back. I normally wash my hair at night, put this product in, and blow dry. It gives my hair such wonderful volume, I could just use a pinch of hair spray and my hair would be fine. Even after sleeping on it, all I need to do is run my fingers through it and the volume pops back. If I put this product in without blow drying right after, it still gives me great texture, even if the volume isn&#x27;t as great. I actually wish I knew about this product when I had long hair. Would have helped with how flat and lifeless it was (thus why I cut it so short).</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair. It is razor cut very short. Mousses, volumizers, other products simply make my hair fall flat. This is the most terrific product ever!  Hard to find, in fact, I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. Ordered 3 more. A tiny dollop goes a long way. The first one I had lasted forever, well, almost forever.  This product is absolutely necessary to make my hairstyle work&#x27;</li>
            <li> i have short hair and these products really help.  It gives volume and its priced jsut right, better than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I like product for my hair and gives good body with fullness.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and poker straight.  Nothing I&#x27;ve used in the past gives my hair the volume I&#x27;m looking for except for this product.  It&#x27;s great, however, very difficult to find in stores and a little pricey for the size of the bottle.  I love this product and will continue to use it.  I wish it were in more stores.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and I have tried EVERY volumizing product.  This one is GREAT.  All day body and good hold.  I will be using this from now on.  You only need to use a little so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> Does a great job giving body and keeping the curls in</li>
            <li> I have used this on my hair when it was both short and long and it&#x27;s the best volume/body product out there (in my humble opinion).  I have fine, color treated hair.  Mousses leave my hair sticky and nasty.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the recommendation of a stylist.  It does add volume to hair and makes fine hair appear fuller but I don&#x27;t really like the texture of my hair when I use it. I will finish the container but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Lov it !! does my hair some GOOD! On a more serious note a little goes a long way and it makes styling my hair sooo easy!</li>
            <li> This works pretty good on my hair but I have to just use a  little bit or my hair gets weighted down as it is baby fine.</li>
            <li> This item was ordered for my wife. She says she could not find it in stores where she normally purchsed it. I found it ordered it for her she says she loves the product. Was thrilled I found it for her. She says thanks and that you are awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product, been using it since it came out. I have fine, curly hair and this works the best. I&#x27;ve tried numerous products but this works the best for me. Love it!</li>
            <li> Since using these products (I also use blow out and the layered hair spray Both BigSexyHair products) and since I started using them I get SO many compliments! Love love love love and SO worth the price (some might think too expensive) but I love great makeup and great hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI if you are thinking about the HealthySexyHair Beach Spray, it smells like Heaven but is very yucky feeling.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not one thing I like about this product, even the way it squirts out is messy.</li>
            <li> I swear this stuff must be magic.  It is the first thing that has ever given my fine hair some texture and weight.  I love it.  You do need to use a blow dryer since it seems to be heat activated and keep in mind a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my long hair has gotten thinner and has no body.&lt;br /&gt;So I use BLOW IT UP GEL, on the hair on crown of my hair and a miracle occurs!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it gives my short, fine hair the body it needs without any stiffness.  It also holds my style without the need for hair spray.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite product of mine. I am gray-haired and my hair is fine. It gives me the extra volume and thickness to my hair that I desire.</li>
            <li> I have very short, fine, thin hair that doesn&#x27;t have any body. I only need a very SMALL amount of this. Work it through damp hair, blow dry and style. Oodles of volume and body, and my hair looks thicker. I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect styling product for my hair!</li>
            <li> I have short gray hair &amp; Blow It Up Gel Foam is the best thing I have found to give it body &amp; &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34;! I always buy two or three at a time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only gel that is not too heavy which will help me manage my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for very long time already but the manufacturer stopped production of this exact item.I am very  upset about it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for quick delivery and still having the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before but could no longer get it a local salons.  The order arrived on schedule and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, I love it, It has a good hold for short hair. Buying on line is cheaper than buying in the store.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin.  The product does a good job of making it look thicker and holds hair well. My sisters both use it and like it also.</li>
            <li> Super Duper - hard find - all their products should be in all stoes!!</li>
            <li> As much as I loved the smell, texture, and gel to foam magic... It left my hair flat, dull, and sticky. I tried using as little as possible but it didn&#x27;t change the effect. For people with thin long hair, don&#x27;t buy this. It&#x27;s too heavy of a product and will just weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately do not have lush think hair but rather fine hair that wants to fall flat. This is the first product that i have used that gives me a full look and keeps my style all day. I will never use anything else ever again. If you have fine, limp hair this product works wonderfully and will give you the effect of having full, thick hair.</li>
            <li> The perfect product to add volume and texture to thin, fine short hair.&lt;br /&gt;Use sparingly on towel-dried hair, then blow dry. Can also be used on dry hair to define and hold.</li>
