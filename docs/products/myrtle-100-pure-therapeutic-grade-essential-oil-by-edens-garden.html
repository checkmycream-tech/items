            <li>Great quality and value.</li>
            <li>great product would order again</li>
            <li>just as advertised very nice just as described don&#x27;t make me write a bunch of stuff I don&#x27;t have time</li>
            <li>Myrtle also works for respiratory problems but is more relaxing and therefore ideal to help with nighttime congestion.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Love these oils!  </li>
            <li>even though the smell is not out-of-this-world wonderful, and really isn&#x27;t even enjoyable, is rather a turn-off, i have returned to adding myrtle to the cpap humidifier water once again because adding it has again helped my nose in a noticeable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>This is my mother&#x27;s name; I love the oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the quality of this oil.</li>
            <li>I love love love Myrtle.</li>
            <li>love their products.</li>
            <li>Great Product, I will purchase more of  EG&#x27;s products in the future!</li>
            <li>The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous.</li>
            <li>This essential oil has a wonderful fragrance which I find very soothing.  </li>
            <li>that was absolutely exquisite when used in the cpap humidifier as part of the vapor that blows directly into my nose all night long.  </li>
            <li>I love the essential oils because you can utitilize them in so many ways.</li>
            <li>(it is not recommended to use essential oils in a cpap humidifier, but i do it anyway because myrtle is very gentle and is particularly good for mucous membranes.  </li>
            <li>For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Very healing for my thyroid</li>
            <li>the scent this time around is perhaps a little bit milder than this bottle, but is Nowhere Near as sweet as the original purchase in 2010 that was pure heaven to go to sleep with!  </li>
            <li>all - nothing natural really seems to work</li>
            <li>i am not in any way trying to get others to use ANY essential oil in their cpap humidifier water, i just really like experimenting, and this experiment turned out good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;update: i reordered some wild green myrtle from the place i originally purchased it from as referenced above.  </li>
            <li>This 10ml is a decent size bottle compared to other places I have purchased before.</li>

            <li> This 10ml is a decent size bottle compared to other places I have purchased before.</li>
            <li> I suffer with bad allergies - mainly in Spring - but actually most of the year and I battle to sleep at night because of them.  </li>
            <li> usually smell is not even a factor for me, but the differences in smell between Sandalwoods, Roses, and Myrtles really matters to me.  </li>
            <li> however, it is wild green myrtle essential oil purchased somewhere else</li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> just an FYI, this myrtle is not distinguished as red or green.  </li>
            <li> Every time I lie down, my nose closes up.  </li>
            <li> i will keep this bottle of myrtle for other uses, and purchase another bottle of the green myrtle i had previously used with the cpap.  </li>
            <li> I typically use them to annoint candles.</li>
            <li> I put a little on a tissue and it helps me sleep.  </li>
            <li> and I refuse hard drugs -</li>

            <li> This is my mother&#x27;s name; I love the oil. I placed a drop on my finger and applied it to my sore gums and it took the pain away!</li>
            <li> Love these oils!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Best in quality, benefit, and cost. The 100% therapeutic grades as well as the Synergy Blends are fabulous. For the price you pay is well worth every penny in beneficial results.</li>
            <li> My go to source for essential oils. Always happy with their products</li>
            <li> I suffer with bad allergies - mainly in Spring - but actually most of the year and I battle to sleep at night because of them.  Every time I lie down, my nose closes up.  I used to put eucalyptus oil on my pillow but then I learnt it was a stimulant.  Myrtle also works for respiratory problems but is more relaxing and therefore ideal to help with nighttime congestion.  I put a little on a tissue and it helps me sleep.  It isn&#x27;t a cure all - nothing natural really seems to work and I refuse hard drugs - but it helps.</li>
            <li> just as advertised very nice just as described don&#x27;t make me write a bunch of stuff I don&#x27;t have time</li>

            <li> I love the essential oils because you can utitilize them in so many ways. I typically use them to annoint candles. This 10ml is a decent size bottle compared to other places I have purchased before. Will continue to order from Eden&#x27;s Garden</li>
            <li> one of the great oils .</li>
            <li> I love love love Myrtle. It&#x27;s a perfect oil for meditating !! It&#x27;s a sedative and nervine. Gives you a feeling of being &amp;#34;in tune&amp;#34; with your body and spirit . I put it on my body with a carrier oil or in the diffuser. It also increases your libido tremendously lol.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Product as expected.</li>
            <li> love their products. great price.</li>
            <li> Great quality and value. Very healing for my thyroid</li>
            <li> just an FYI, this myrtle is not distinguished as red or green.  my nose tolerates it in the humidifier of my cpap machine.  however, it is wild green myrtle essential oil purchased somewhere else that was absolutely exquisite when used in the cpap humidifier as part of the vapor that blows directly into my nose all night long.  i will keep this bottle of myrtle for other uses, and purchase another bottle of the green myrtle i had previously used with the cpap.  (it is not recommended to use essential oils in a cpap humidifier, but i do it anyway because myrtle is very gentle and is particularly good for mucous membranes.  i am not in any way trying to get others to use ANY essential oil in their cpap humidifier water, i just really like experimenting, and this experiment turned out good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: i reordered some wild green myrtle from the place i originally purchased it from as referenced above.  the scent this time around is perhaps a little bit milder than this bottle, but is Nowhere Near as sweet as the original purchase in 2010 that was pure heaven to go to sleep with!  i am wondering now if the time of year affects the strength, tone and/or sweetness of the myrtle.  usually smell is not even a factor for me, but the differences in smell between Sandalwoods, Roses, and Myrtles really matters to me.  even though the smell is not out-of-this-world wonderful, and really isn&#x27;t even enjoyable, is rather a turn-off, i have returned to adding myrtle to the cpap humidifier water once again because adding it has again helped my nose in a noticeable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will anyone with info about myrtles please give me the heads up?</li>
            <li> great product would order again</li>
