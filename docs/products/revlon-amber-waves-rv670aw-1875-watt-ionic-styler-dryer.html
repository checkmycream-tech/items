            <li>good fan for its cheap price.</li>
            <li>Will easily buy it again!</li>
            <li>Its a good blow dryer and it gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>Its okay for the price, but if you want to buy a hairdryer for its attachments, dont buy this one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and I imagine that would make it more prone to overheating.</li>
            <li>I take mine to the gym and many women ask me about this style of dryer who have curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Medium speed is OK.  </li>
            <li>If I would have been able to find replacement combs this would have gotten 4 or 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this dryer in 2012, it worked great, it dryed the hair fast, but today 10/19/12</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love the control I get with this bow dryer.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, wavy hair that easily tangles and the wide-tooth comb</li>
            <li>Overall all however, very good dryer.</li>
            <li>This is a good product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I like this stye of dryer because I have curly hair and it works best to dry and smooth my hair with the attached styling brush.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad idea to have one in &#x27;reserve&#x27; too!  </li>
            <li>do use it more now as my hair is longer, but not always for full blowouts.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so you would think it would go thru it.</li>
            <li>:) but its well worth the ending results.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised and am very pleased with this dryer.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, easy to work with and has the right amount of power for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would have liked to know is more information about the brush attachment.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair and it locks in the shine.</li>
            <li>I like that it has three speeds and a cool air button.  </li>
            <li>I love my new styler.  </li>
            <li>The attachments are strong, yet I don&#x27;t wear heat styles much.</li>
            <li>It does a terrific job and so easy to use--very light weight and easy to pack when traveling...</li>
            <li>The ions make the air smell funny!</li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The price was just right for me.</li>
            <li>A more grippy handle would be nice since styling hair usually involves from greasy or slippy product like dimethicone heat protectant goo.</li>
            <li>different settings allows for cooler drying and cord rotates comfortably for easy handling.</li>
            <li>The price difference was negligible, but I thought it would be nice to have a gold one after using a silver one for so long.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer not only stayed the course until my hair was dry, it also gave me the extension I was looking for in order to braid my hair more easily and made it feel smooth!</li>
            <li>I deal with these blow dryers all the time, I clean them regularly and remove the excess hair, but this one is just cheap.</li>
            <li>The product is self is terrific, it works stunningly.</li>
            <li>This was the first dryer I bought in years, maybe in forever.</li>
            <li>I think that this might cause issues for people who are left handed as the vent will spend most of the time against your hair</li>
            <li>Seems self evident</li>
            <li>My last unit was one from Sharper Image, and cost 3x more than this one, and did not perform as well.    </li>
            <li>But in fact the brush attachment is really only good for longer hair, as it is too big.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my old one broke because this was a  MAJOR upgrade!</li>
            <li>As I was just thinking to myself how great of a blow dryer this was (for AA coarse, kinky hair), I sat the blow dryer down, while it was still turned on, on the vented side.</li>
            <li>I bought a new one right away.</li>
            <li>(1)short out while I&#x27;m blow drying my hair or (2)do not blow out my hair very well leaving a lot of kink in there.</li>
            <li>The dryer works very well, but the handle is not \\&quot;user friendly\\</li>
            <li>You can blowdry to make it straight or make the ends curl inwards or outwards by changing the attachments.</li>
            <li>The brush is very flimsy and does not go thru your hair very well.</li>
            <li>I would avoid it if you really want to use the brush attachment.</li>
            <li>this hair dryer works very well.</li>
            <li>It straightens it well but not bone straight.</li>
            <li>You are better off trying one of the other brands of this style dryer.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was surprised at the amount of bristles in the sink.  </li>
            <li>This one has FAR surpassed any blow dryer that I&#x27;ve EVER used!</li>
            <li>I have been using this exact style of blow dryer made by a different company for years</li>
            <li>I love it and use it everyday!</li>
            <li>I use it for partial and full blowouts.</li>
            <li>On the normal loud side as far as dryers go.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you keep your hand and hair off the air vent or the dryer will overheat in short time and shut itself off till it cools down.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in October and by the end of December it completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>Then after two months, it died completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hairdryers with brush attachments for 20 years to straighten my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair with a 3c-4a texture.</li>
            <li>Wire near where it goes into the handle SHORTED out.  </li>
            <li>Spend an extra few bucks and get a better one.</li>
            <li>I know guy&#x27;s use this product in an alternate way than most girl&#x27;s do, we burn them out less often!    </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the bristles come out very easily.  </li>
            <li>Save so much time as I don&#x27;t have to flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great dryer, however, it is impossible to find replacement combs if one breaks.  </li>
            <li>I managed to get my hair as straight as I would get it with a mid range flat iron with this dryer alone</li>
            <li>It gets wider towards the top (too wide for my small hands) and I often accidentally switch the dryer off while I&#x27;m holding it.</li>
            <li>My old dryer&#x27;s motor had finally burned out and the store where I purchased it no longer carried it, so I turned my search efforts to Amazon.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it the motor had this really high pitch whine to it, sounded like it was working way too hard to do</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never gotten this straight with any other product.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it get her hair straight.</li>
            <li>I am so against the time consumption that goes in to doing my hair that I stopped getting chemical relaxers 5 years ago and went natural (and for those who are in to it, my hair type is type 3c/4a and about mid back length when stretched).  </li>

            <li> I always keep an extra one on hand, but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I managed to get the flat iron through as well without it reverting to a puff.  </li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> My old ones just shut down when over heated.</li>
            <li> A forever blower that will last so very long.</li>
            <li> The ion feature makes your hair dry faster, in my case about 50% faster than the non-ion units that have a similar design over 30 years or so.     </li>
            <li> I tend to hold it different ways while I&#x27;m using it to dry all of my hair.</li>
            <li> This unit holds up well as long as you take care of it.  </li>
            <li> The sideways design also helps me to dry my hair faster.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer died when it felt like it mid-blow dry after maybe about a month.</li>
            <li> You have to divide damp hair into sections and dry each section until completely dry and works</li>
            <li> Do you remember the \\&quot;Dry Guy\\&quot; line?  </li>
            <li> It takes me about 30 minutes to get my hair completely dry.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, kinky hair and blow dryers typically either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and have ethnic hair and this blow dryer is comprable to me using a flat iron on my hair!</li>
            <li> when I turned it on it litereally blew a hole through the cord, flames and sparks flew out, I got shocked and an electrical burn on my hand, this product needs a better cord.</li>
            <li> The brush attachment is not exactly as it is depicted in the picture.</li>
            <li> and u can&#x27;t purchase any replacement combs anywhere which pretty maks the dryer useless for me.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing from the other company from now on.</li>
            <li> The actual body of the dryer is a little wide so it can be awkward at first to hold, but you find a way to hold it that suits your hand.   </li>
            <li> Sometimes to just dry slightly damp hair after I&#x27;ve taken down a twist-out.</li>
            <li> Okay, I hate blow dryers</li>
            <li> The combs are very very sharp and hurt your scalp if you run it over your scalp by mistake.</li>
            <li> I only notice a subtle difference with the ions, but every bit of smoothing helps.</li>
            <li> By the second use, this sound had gotten so bad I was afraid it might actually catch on fire</li>
            <li> Dries in little time and medium setting</li>
            <li> CRAZY FAST shipping.</li>
            <li> Silly me thought all blow dryers were created equal!</li>
            <li> This process usually takes forever and it ends up as a puffball within an hour.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how they can fix that,</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and have tried other model types.</li>
            <li> the handel is hard to grip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always leery about hair products and tools because it can be hard to find things that work for my type of hair.</li>

            <li> Silly me thought all blow dryers were created equal! This one has FAR surpassed any blow dryer that I&#x27;ve EVER used! I&#x27;m black and have ethnic hair and this blow dryer is comprable to me using a flat iron on my hair! It&#x27;s never gotten this straight with any other product.  The ions make the air smell funny! :) but its well worth the ending results. I&#x27;m glad my old one broke because this was a  MAJOR upgrade! It&#x27;s perfect in every way!</li>
            <li> I bought this in October and by the end of December it completely stopped working. While it lasts it does its job well but only getting two months out of a product is unacceptable. In November it began overheating and would shut itself off, by the end of December it would not turn on at all. You are better off trying one of the other brands of this style dryer.</li>
            <li> The dryer is okay, its easy to hold, great looking. But the attachments are really no good. The combs are very very sharp and hurt your scalp if you run it over your scalp by mistake. The brush attachment is losing all its bristles already (and I have used it only once till now.)    Its okay for the price, but if you want to buy a hairdryer for its attachments, dont buy this one.</li>
            <li> I love my new styler.  It has alot of power and alot of features.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the attachments.  I thought they would be smaller, for my shorter hair.  But in fact the brush attachment is really only good for longer hair, as it is too big.</li>
            <li> I had it for about 4 years.  As I was just thinking to myself how great of a blow dryer this was (for AA coarse, kinky hair), I sat the blow dryer down, while it was still turned on, on the vented side. I bought a new one right away.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer. I have very thick hair and have tried other model types. This one straightens and controls frizz. Its a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> CRAZY FAST shipping. Wonderfully packaged and new condition! The product is self is terrific, it works stunningly. I had never used a Revlon dryer for my hair before. The only thing I would have liked to know is more information about the brush attachment. The brush attachment is not exactly as it is depicted in the picture. the bristles are not as close together, or as thick as it looks in the picture. Either way it works great.</li>
            <li> good fan for its cheap price. I need smth to make my hair stright. This helps.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, kinky hair and blow dryers typically either (1)short out while I&#x27;m blow drying my hair or (2)do not blow out my hair very well leaving a lot of kink in there. That said, I was skeptical of how well this product would work for women like me. This blow dryer not only stayed the course until my hair was dry, it also gave me the extension I was looking for in order to braid my hair more easily and made it feel smooth! The sideways design also helps me to dry my hair faster. I only used the wide toothed comb and thus far it has held up. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The dryer works very well, but the handle is not \\&quot;user friendly\\&quot;  It is difficult to hold and I have pressed the buttons without meaning to while drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair and it locks in the shine. I always keep an extra one on hand, but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer died when it felt like it mid-blow dry after maybe about a month. Then after two months, it died completely. I deal with these blow dryers all the time, I clean them regularly and remove the excess hair, but this one is just cheap. Spend an extra few bucks and get a better one. Trust me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Its a good blow dryer and it gets very hot.  The only reason I gave this product a 3 star is the handle is a bit big and it slips out of my hands when Im blow drying my daughtesers hair.  With the oils and product I need to put in her hair prior to  blow drying the handel is hard to grip. Other than that it get her hair straight.</li>
            <li> and u can&#x27;t purchase any replacement combs anywhere which pretty maks the dryer useless for me. i need the thick tooth comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hairdryers with brush attachments for 20 years to straighten my naturally curly hair. I only notice a subtle difference with the ions, but every bit of smoothing helps. I find the base to be awkward to hold, though.  It gets wider towards the top (too wide for my small hands) and I often accidentally switch the dryer off while I&#x27;m holding it.</li>
            <li> This was the first dryer I bought in years, maybe in forever. I have natural hair with a 3c-4a texture. I use it for partial and full blowouts. The attachments are strong, yet I don&#x27;t wear heat styles much. So I use this about 1-4 times a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use it more now as my hair is longer, but not always for full blowouts. Sometimes to just dry slightly damp hair after I&#x27;ve taken down a twist-out. A more grippy handle would be nice since styling hair usually involves from greasy or slippy product like dimethicone heat protectant goo.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the bristles come out very easily.  The first time I used it I was surprised at the amount of bristles in the sink.  Otherwise, easy to work with and has the right amount of power for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, I hate blow dryers and I hate straightening my hair because it is thick and long and takes forever.  I am so against the time consumption that goes in to doing my hair that I stopped getting chemical relaxers 5 years ago and went natural (and for those who are in to it, my hair type is type 3c/4a and about mid back length when stretched).  1 to 2 times/year I have to straighten my hair to trim my ends.  This process usually takes forever and it ends up as a puffball within an hour.  I managed to get my hair as straight as I would get it with a mid range flat iron with this dryer alone and it only took about 20 minutes.  I managed to get the flat iron through as well without it reverting to a puff.  At no point did it overheat and shut off.  I was quite happy.    The only issue the dryer might have though is the location of the vent.  I think that this might cause issues for people who are left handed as the vent will spend most of the time against your hair and I imagine that would make it more prone to overheating.</li>
            <li> I have use this dryer for like 20 years.  You have to divide damp hair into sections and dry each section until completely dry and works&lt;br /&gt;perfectly</li>
            <li> I like this stye of dryer because I have curly hair and it works best to dry and smooth my hair with the attached styling brush.  I take mine to the gym and many women ask me about this style of dryer who have curly hair.  The actual body of the dryer is a little wide so it can be awkward at first to hold, but you find a way to hold it that suits your hand.   I like that it has three speeds and a cool air button.  On the normal loud side as far as dryers go.  This unit holds up well as long as you take care of it.  Make sure you keep your hand and hair off the air vent or the dryer will overheat in short time and shut itself off till it cools down.  Seems self evident but I read people do it.  Great dryer for the price and gets the job done well.  Nice looking too.  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Had this style of hair dryer for years, this one for about 18 months.  Wire near where it goes into the handle SHORTED out.  Never wrapped cord or hung it. Just sparked and that was it, the GFI never kick in or off.  The thing still had power going to it.  Would not recomend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Item lost high&#x3D;speed within a month.  Medium speed is OK.  I would not buy another Revlon styler. [Revlon Amber Waves RV670AW 1875W Ionic Styler Dryer]</li>
            <li> No problems with it...different settings allows for cooler drying and cord rotates comfortably for easy handling. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I could review this item but it has not arrived yet. I will let you know when I have tested it.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer, however, it is impossible to find replacement combs if one breaks.  If I would have been able to find replacement combs this would have gotten 4 or 5 stars.  But, since I can&#x27;t find any, I can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exact style of blow dryer made by a different company for years and I loved it. I have very fine, wavy hair that easily tangles and the wide-tooth comb blow dryer attachment works beautifully. My old dryer&#x27;s motor had finally burned out and the store where I purchased it no longer carried it, so I turned my search efforts to Amazon. I found the one I wanted to replace, and I found this one which is a different color and a buck cheaper. The price difference was negligible, but I thought it would be nice to have a gold one after using a silver one for so long. I wish I didn&#x27;t do this. The first time I used it the motor had this really high pitch whine to it, sounded like it was working way too hard to do it&#x27;s job. By the second use, this sound had gotten so bad I was afraid it might actually catch on fire so I threw it away. Please, don&#x27;t waste your money on this horrible product. I will be purchasing from the other company from now on.</li>
            <li> It meet with my needs.I would recommend it. The price was just right for me. I would order it again for a gift.</li>
            <li> it and very great hair dryer had it once before until my daughter blow it out so really its and replacement love it</li>
            <li> This review is for the guy&#x27;s who were 1st &#x27;empowered&#x27; to use a hair dryer back in the 70&#x27;s!    Do you remember the \\&quot;Dry Guy\\&quot; line?  I sure do!   How I miss that yellow ( or sometimes red) powerhouse!     Over the year&#x27;s things have improved, and this is a sensational unit.    The ion feature makes your hair dry faster, in my case about 50% faster than the non-ion units that have a similar design over 30 years or so.     My last unit was one from Sharper Image, and cost 3x more than this one, and did not perform as well.    The only reason this is not 5 star is that you are not offered a way to buy an extra brush attachment.  I know guy&#x27;s use this product in an alternate way than most girl&#x27;s do, we burn them out less often!    This is a bargain!  Not a bad idea to have one in &#x27;reserve&#x27; too!  This product is great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer in 2012, it worked great, it dryed the hair fast, but today 10/19/12 when I turned it on it litereally blew a hole through the cord, flames and sparks flew out, I got shocked and an electrical burn on my hand, this product needs a better cord.</li>
            <li> This is a good product at a reasonable price.  I  bought it as a gift for my daughter and she like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the revlon hair dryer.  It does a terrific job and so easy to use--very light weight and easy to pack when traveling...</li>
            <li> A forever blower that will last so very long. My old ones just shut down when over heated. This one keeps on going</li>
            <li> I love this product. Save so much time as I don&#x27;t have to flat iron my hair. You can blowdry to make it straight or make the ends curl inwards or outwards by changing the attachments.</li>
            <li> Good product. Versatile and handy. Dries in little time and medium setting should&lt;br /&gt;Take care of any hair type without drying it out</li>
            <li> This was a great product. I love it and use it everyday! My last one survived several years and this replacement is the excat same! Will easily buy it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this to try a different brand as they always burn out after about 9 months. This one didn&#x27;t last that long. I just can&#x27;t keep hair from getting inside and one tiny strand almost sets it on fire. Not sure how they can fix that, but I can&#x27;t open it enough to get the stray hairs out so I can&#x27;t use it anymore. I&#x27;ve had it maybe 3 months.</li>
            <li> The brush is very flimsy and does not go thru your hair very well. I have fine hair, so you would think it would go thru it. Nope.. I would avoid it if you really want to use the brush attachment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always leery about hair products and tools because it can be hard to find things that work for my type of hair. I am African American with curly/thick hair and this hair dryer works very well. I was very surprised and am very pleased with this dryer. My only issue is that I often turn the dryer off while I&#x27;m using it because of the location of the power switch, but that could be because of the way I&#x27;m holding it. I tend to hold it different ways while I&#x27;m using it to dry all of my hair. Overall all however, very good dryer.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and I love the control I get with this bow dryer. It takes me about 30 minutes to get my hair completely dry. It straightens it well but not bone straight. No heat damage for me so I can still wear a curly fro.</li>
