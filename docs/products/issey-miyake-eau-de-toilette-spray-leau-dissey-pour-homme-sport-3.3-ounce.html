            <li>It is not a cloyingly sweet as Issey Miyake&#x27;s l&#x27;Eau d&#x27;Issey and more like a combination of Givenchy&#x27;s Insens&amp;eacute; Ultramarine with the original Eau d&#x27;Issey.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes  First class!</li>

            <li>Strong sweet grapefruit opening followed by</li>
            <li>And most important of all of course, my girlfriend loves it ;)</li>

            <li>Super fresh and crisp citrusy clean magic!</li>
            <li>Lasts longer than the original Issey Miyake Pour Homme.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Pretty much love anything Issey Miyake makes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several sport colognes and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Super surprised this was a gift pack and such a great value!  </li>
            <li>overall its good cologne</li>
            <li>Good day, I am writing because of the following perfume applying with you I get</li>
            <li>Top notes are very exiting</li>
            <li>/&gt;Issey Miyake could very well have charmed their way into my top 5 colognes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh with a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>My nephew loved it and even parted it out and was able to give the other two items as gifts to his friends!</li>
            <li>Always a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets the scent is amazing</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast!!</li>
            <li>This L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey eau de toilette is perfect choice for men who are physically active, masculine and well groomed.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance however I am not pretty sure it is original.  </li>
            <li>Issey Miyake SPORT was exactly what I wanted, clean fresh smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>Great for a everyday scent.</li>
            <li>I tend to like the fresh smelling ones, and this has the smell of bergamot/citrus and also has something else in it that gives it a sporty smell, so you don&#x27;t walk around smelling like a lemon.  </li>
            <li>Am really loving this fragrance will definitely buy it again and for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice scent for daily wear!  </li>
            <li>think it smells very close to the original Issey Miyake</li>
            <li>like good for daily work or sport times, the essence lost pretty fast though like 4 hours before stop sensing it</li>
            <li>right....</li>
            <li>very very Thank you</li>
            <li>, I really like the issey miyake colognes and this is another one to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last on my skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize that when I first ordered</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Believe it or not I like this little better than the original.</li>
            <li>unfortunately i heard so many good things about this cologne that caused my expectations to be really high, exceeding the quality of the cologne.</li>
            <li>It is fresh with citrus notes and masculine.</li>
            <li>For Summer I also like Aqua Di Gio, Versace ph, D&amp;G Light Blue and YSL L&#x27;Homme.</li>
            <li>Please, be fast delivery&lt;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear cologne very often</li>
            <li>so much so that might even repel bugs if you ever wore it in a dense tropical jungle.  </li>
            <li>it does smell really</li>
            <li>very Lemon</li>
            <li>Smells generic, and familiar.</li>
            <li>This is a soft fragrance,  stays pretty close to the skin.</li>
            <li>The package was fine, I have only used it once thus far</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Citrus notes smoothly drifting to sandal wood and peppery after tones provide signature smell that you will be remembered by.</li>
            <li>but this is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new and came across this in either Details or GQ,</li>
            <li>I go back and forth between this, Azzaro Chrome Sport, and F by Ferragamo Free time (with the blue band around the bottle).  </li>
            <li>Just bought this and not sure if it&#x27;s 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>The exact product I ordered with the same scent and quality cologne.</li>
            <li>This fragrance interested us when it came as a \\&quot;scratch and sniff\\&quot; in the local paper.</li>
            <li>This was a much appreciated present and lasted for nearly a year!</li>
            <li>The bottle is large and will last for a while too.</li>
            <li>well and has a classy smell to it.</li>
            <li>Its not to loud</li>
            <li>, I lost $ 40 on the product and only pay practically per box , I really want to know how we could do to fix my situation ... waiting for your prompt response ...</li>
            <li>Not too young or too old.  </li>
            <li>Pleansantly surprised.</li>
            <li>OK first the estimated delivery was wrong.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I have no regrets with this buy.</li>
            <li>I have gotten compliments from other people but then some do not care for it that much.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scent for daily wear!  </li>
            <li> think it smells very close to the original Issey Miyake</li>
            <li> like good for daily work or sport times, the essence lost pretty fast though like 4 hours before stop sensing it</li>
            <li> right....</li>
            <li> very very Thank you</li>
            <li> , I really like the issey miyake colognes and this is another one to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last on my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that when I first ordered</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not I like this little better than the original.</li>
            <li> unfortunately i heard so many good things about this cologne that caused my expectations to be really high, exceeding the quality of the cologne.</li>
            <li> It is fresh with citrus notes and masculine.</li>
            <li> For Summer I also like Aqua Di Gio, Versace ph, D&amp;G Light Blue and YSL L&#x27;Homme.</li>
            <li> Please, be fast delivery&lt;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear cologne very often</li>
            <li> so much so that might even repel bugs if you ever wore it in a dense tropical jungle.  </li>
            <li> it does smell really</li>
            <li> very Lemon</li>
            <li> Smells generic, and familiar.</li>
            <li> This is a soft fragrance,  stays pretty close to the skin.</li>
            <li> The package was fine, I have only used it once thus far</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Citrus notes smoothly drifting to sandal wood and peppery after tones provide signature smell that you will be remembered by.</li>
            <li> but this is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and came across this in either Details or GQ,</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between this, Azzaro Chrome Sport, and F by Ferragamo Free time (with the blue band around the bottle).  </li>
            <li> Just bought this and not sure if it&#x27;s 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> The exact product I ordered with the same scent and quality cologne.</li>
            <li> This fragrance interested us when it came as a \\&quot;scratch and sniff\\&quot; in the local paper.</li>
            <li> This was a much appreciated present and lasted for nearly a year!</li>
            <li> The bottle is large and will last for a while too.</li>
            <li> well and has a classy smell to it.</li>
            <li> Its not to loud</li>
            <li> , I lost $ 40 on the product and only pay practically per box , I really want to know how we could do to fix my situation ... waiting for your prompt response ...</li>
            <li> Not too young or too old.  </li>
            <li> Pleansantly surprised.</li>
            <li> OK first the estimated delivery was wrong.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I have no regrets with this buy.</li>
            <li> I have gotten compliments from other people but then some do not care for it that much.</li>
            <li> most of Eau de Toilette i had bought left an disgusting odor at the end, but not this one, it is fresh all the time</li>
            <li> is everything I expected THE SELLER WAS VERY SAME eficas</li>
            <li> I mean the smells goes away to fast</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different, have been wearing the Polo Sport blue bottle for the past year or two.  </li>
            <li> it doenst last, just for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Then the bottle came missing about a third of it.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the other Issey Miyake</li>
            <li> I smelled 15 or so other scents, including Gucci and dolce and gabbana, and I picked this over all of those.</li>
            <li> Not very unique smell</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t stick on me.</li>
            <li> fragrances(turn sour on my skin)</li>
            <li> Purchased this on Black Friday sale...</li>
            <li> This does not smell like any of the previous two I have bought.</li>
            <li> After half a day the smell seems to be gone, even my wife can&#x27;t tell if I used fragrance or not.</li>
            <li> product is watered down or just does not leave fragrance for a little while.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is not over powering - just a few squirts will do it.</li>
            <li> Scent not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> a relatively consistent cedar, lemongrass/citrol base-</li>
            <li> real game queisiera know how we would do since it was for a gift that obviously could not deliver</li>
            <li> This product has a signature scent that will just increase anyone&#x27;s game.</li>
            <li> NOT A HAPPY EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li> Not too pungent, very subtle.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE IS A FAKE.  </li>
            <li> it out, guys, can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Can be worn in almost any setting, but if out on the town looking for a scent to draw attention this may be the one time this scent fails.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>

            <li> This is one of my favorites!  I tend to like the fresh smelling ones, and this has the smell of bergamot/citrus and also has something else in it that gives it a sporty smell, so you don&#x27;t walk around smelling like a lemon.  I go back and forth between this, Azzaro Chrome Sport, and F by Ferragamo Free time (with the blue band around the bottle).  Out of about 20 choices, these are my three favorites.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Delivery was super fast!!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Strong Scent, has lasted over 24hrs.</li>
            <li> Just bought this and not sure if it&#x27;s 100% authentic. Smells generic, and familiar. Maybe someone could comment on the legitimacy of this purchase and make me feel better...</li>
            <li> Purchased this on Black Friday sale...and I have no regrets the scent is amazing, I really like the issey miyake colognes and this is another one to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> The exact product I ordered with the same scent and quality cologne.</li>
            <li> i like it. unfortunately i heard so many good things about this cologne that caused my expectations to be really high, exceeding the quality of the cologne. overall its good cologne - you wont like it if you have shiny 20 inch spinners on your car :) its too &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; for you</li>
            <li> I have tried several sport colognes and this is by far the best. It is fresh with citrus notes and masculine. It lasts 8 plus hours, projects well and has a classy smell to it. I am not a fan of the other Issey Miyake fragrances(turn sour on my skin) but this is one of my new favorites. How is smells on you will be quite different than spraying a paper card. For Summer I also like Aqua Di Gio, Versace ph, D&amp;G Light Blue and YSL L&#x27;Homme.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this I get a compliment. Its not to loud neither is it to sutitle. Great price, comes well packaged and delivery was on time. I have no regrets with this buy.</li>
            <li> Please, be fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;very very very Thank you</li>
            <li> Best purchase. Scent not overwhelming. I so not use products like this, in over ten years. Ladies like it too.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and he loves it</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t stick on me. You know how colognes are, sometimes they don&#x27;t get along with your skin and after 10 minutes after you put them on, it doesn&#x27;t look like you ever did. Again, smells great and I recommend. It just didn&#x27;t stick on my skin.</li>
            <li> Best Issey Miyake product...&lt;br /&gt;I love this parfum !!! For me is the best one of the world. The smell is fantastic...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this great cologne. It has a super fresh scent that is pleasant to most noses for sure. Will purchase anytime</li>
            <li> I love it this parfum but the fragrance I received was not like I bought on another place my box was wrinkled when I received my product</li>
            <li> Good day, I am writing because of the following perfume applying with you I get real game queisiera know how we would do since it was for a gift that obviously could not deliver, I lost $ 40 on the product and only pay practically per box , I really want to know how we could do to fix my situation ... waiting for your prompt response ... I cordially dismissal</li>
            <li> its a very nice cologne, its recommended</li>
            <li> I did not pick this one out, it was one that my girlfriend wanted to get for me. It is a good fragrance and my girlfriend loves to smell it on me so that is a definite plus. I think this one is a hit or miss with most people. I have gotten compliments from other people but then some do not care for it that much. I like it...it is a stronger and bolder fragrance which I think is good for me.</li>
            <li> The package was fine, I have only used it once thus far but so far so good. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product has a signature scent that will just increase anyone&#x27;s game. The quality and value for money is just second to non.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like any of the previous two I have bought. THIS ONE IS A FAKE.  it doenst last, just for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this bottle of cologne.  Nice, light, fresh scent, perfect for summer.  Not too young or too old.  I wanted to try something different, have been wearing the Polo Sport blue bottle for the past year or two.  Seems to last for a while, maybe a bit longer than the Polo scent.  The bottle is large and will last for a while too.</li>
            <li> most of Eau de Toilette i had bought left an disgusting odor at the end, but not this one, it is fresh all the time</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s favorite. He works out a lot and he needed something light but pleasant. This is the one for him</li>
            <li> Issey Miyake SPORT was exactly what I wanted, clean fresh smelling cologne. Not too pungent, very subtle. This will last me for a while.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last on my skin. After half a day the smell seems to be gone, even my wife can&#x27;t tell if I used fragrance or not.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!!!!! I bought it for my girlfriend and she said I did a good job. High five very nice.</li>
            <li> Top notes are very exiting but after that it started to smell like polo sport!  Not very unique smell if you&#x27;re looking for one but otherwise a good buy!</li>
            <li> Got it on time. It&#x27;s a birthday gift for my brother. Thanks for the excellent and quick service. Issey Miyake EDT is one of the best.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> My boyfriend smells so good everytime he wears this cologne</li>
            <li> This L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey eau de toilette is perfect choice for men who are physically active, masculine and well groomed. Citrus notes smoothly drifting to sandal wood and peppery after tones provide signature smell that you will be remembered by.</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume, very decent and mild, i liked it very much, it is my second purchase, ok ok ok ok</li>
            <li> muy buen producto, en perfectas condiciones, igual a lo que promocionaban, enviado en el tiempo previsto,sin alteraciones en el paquete</li>
            <li> ISSEY remains the boss of colognes. Love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear cologne very often and I&#x27;m rather picky as one might expect.  I have the regular Issey Miyake and noticed a friend of mine had this. I liked the smell so bought it for myself.</li>
            <li> This purchase included a gift box with body shampoo and after-shave balm. Didn&#x27;t realize that when I first ordered but it&#x27;s a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways - this is a great scent! Pleansantly surprised. Very clean, not too strong and it seems to be holding up quite well (applied it at 8:30am and it&#x27;s currently 2:04pm...right....about......now. So I can still smell it and that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a scale of 1 - 10 for how strong I think the scent is I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a solid 5. Stronger than I&#x27;m used to but not in Guido territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issey Miyake could very well have charmed their way into my top 5 colognes. Nice one.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes. Definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love this scent. Super fresh and crisp citrusy clean magic!</li>
            <li> Comes in a gigantic bottle. My husband loves the size and the smell. He won&#x27;t run out of it any time soon.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be one of my top 3 favorite colognes. It&#x27;s light and fresh with a hint of citrus. It&#x27;s a wonderful aroma that you will get complimented on.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good fragrance and the best came earlier than expected</li>
            <li> Great scent! This was a much appreciated present and lasted for nearly a year! Scent is refreshing and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> Strong sweet grapefruit opening followed by a relatively consistent cedar, lemongrass/citrol base- so much so that might even repel bugs if you ever wore it in a dense tropical jungle.  Exudes a sense of technicality and class. Lasts longer than the original Issey Miyake Pour Homme. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought it without knowing what it&#x27;s gonna smell like. Knowing it was a sport edition just assume that it must smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;to my surprise it does smell really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells very close to the original Issey Miyake which I love.&lt;br /&gt;another one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> Am really loving this fragrance will definitely buy it again and for the price OMG :)</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my boyfriend. I love it when he wears this... it smells wonderful on him.</li>
            <li> What more can you say? The scent is not over powering - just a few squirts will do it. When she gets close and smells my neck her eyes light up and say &amp;#34;Issey Miyake?!&amp;#34; and then she stays close :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it out, guys, can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> This fragrance interested us when it came as a \\&quot;scratch and sniff\\&quot; in the local paper. Product received is even nicer with a hint of citrus. A good choice for here in Florida!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells fantastic. I smelled 15 or so other scents, including Gucci and dolce and gabbana, and I picked this over all of those.</li>
            <li> This is a very original, fresh smelling cologne. It is not a cloyingly sweet as Issey Miyake&#x27;s l&#x27;Eau d&#x27;Issey and more like a combination of Givenchy&#x27;s Insens&amp;eacute; Ultramarine with the original Eau d&#x27;Issey. Definitely a summertime favourite.</li>
            <li> Smell awesome! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragance for people that like the citric smells, and its a really huge bottle, I recommend the seller and the product</li>
            <li> the best produts for issey miyake y and price excellent</li>
            <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
            <li> Great smell.received item in two days. This is a soft fragrance,  stays pretty close to the skin. Great for a everyday scent. Can be worn in almost any setting, but if out on the town looking for a scent to draw attention this may be the one time this scent fails.</li>
            <li> the ultimate in fragrance</li>
            <li> This is a nice smell. Smells nice with a touch of a sweet smell. I had found a cheaper and bigger bottle on another website but after smelling this cologne I decided to keep both bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying a sample before purchasing this cologne to confirm you like the smell.</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes I have every used. I will buy it again. The perfume has a unique and attractive smell.</li>
            <li> Husband loved this cologne! It&#x27;s a nice scent for daily wear!  Spring time is perfect for it in my opinion!  Not to overpowering very fresh scent!</li>
            <li> If you like the original Issey Miyake you will love this one! Believe it or not I like this little better than the original. It does last shorter time on the body.</li>
            <li> Smells Great Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> This is an exccelent fragrance with a very good smell and fixation. Probably i&#x27;ll buy another one when this was finished.</li>
            <li> I saw this cologne in a magazine and fell in love with the smell. I looked everywhere for it, but couldn&#x27;t pass up the size and price on amazon for a gift for my hubby for the holidays.Worth the buy! I used to swear by A&amp;F Fierce, but now I have a new favorite!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect balance between sporty and dressed up for warmer weather settings. You can wear it equally well in a pair of chino shorts and a polo or a suit and tie. And most important of all of course, my girlfriend loves it ;)</li>
            <li> Great Smell very Lemon like good for daily work or sport times, the essence lost pretty fast though like 4 hours before stop sensing it</li>
            <li> product is watered down or just does not leave fragrance for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t want to use it but will use lots of sprays to get rid of. sorry</li>
            <li> Love the smell, for some reason we ordered this and got the box set, the one with shower gel and after shave and the 3.4 bottle. We ain&#x27;t complaining. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> EXCELENT SELLER THIS PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE PURCHASED LIKE presentation and quality is everything I expected THE SELLER WAS VERY SAME eficas And the product is genuine</li>
            <li> Pretty much love anything Issey Miyake makes.  Always a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance however I am not pretty sure it is original.  I mean the smells goes away to fast</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. I wanted to try something new and came across this in either Details or GQ, One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This is a nice and good  sweet . This is a nice fragance for people that like the citric smells</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend on his birthday. He absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> OK first the estimated delivery was wrong. Then the bottle came missing about a third of it. I guess you get what you paid for. NOT A HAPPY EXPERIENCE</li>
            <li> i got this for my boyfriend and lets just say it makes me want to take all my clothes off.</li>
            <li> Great gift! this iten has travelled to brazil!</li>
            <li> Super surprised this was a gift pack and such a great value!  My nephew loved it and even parted it out and was able to give the other two items as gifts to his friends!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  One of my favorite colognes  First class!</li>
            <li> This is the third perfume I bought from Amazon.  I would have given this 5 stars but the scent only lasts 3 to 4 hours.</li>
