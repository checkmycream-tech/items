            <li>I own alot of colognes.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I liked to look of container and read some of the reviews.</li>
            <li>one of my best,, even i feel like its for old man, but trust me if you 25 year this is yours!</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Really really love it.</li>
            <li>therefore I layer something more youthful on top of it.</li>
            <li>The bottle is much better than the spray itself.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this fragrance smells great, I&#x27;m glad I brought it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunatelly spray itself is WAY TO SWEET !</li>
            <li>This is a good choice for those who want an Amouage feel and quality but can&#x27;t afford the high end price point of an Amouage cologne.</li>
            <li>It reminds  that cheap stuff you can buy at Wallmart, Meijer, Wallgreen etc... .</li>
            <li>Bentley Colonge yea right more like Ford Pinto Colonge.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a big compliment getter, but where it for yourself and feel good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bentley Intense smell unique, good silage and very long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It was a good price, and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li>I choosed this rating because it is a really nice perfume Bentley INTENSE Eau De Parfum Natural Spray 3.4oz / 100ml</li>
            <li>Very good, long lasting, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Perfect but expensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ajmal &#x27;Magnificent Oudh&#x27;, have mellow oud note and quite expensive anyway.</li>
            <li>This scent is classic and powerful.  </li>
            <li>and it got here fast</li>
            <li>A very manly dark leathery fragrance sure to be noticed.  </li>
            <li>When Bentley Intense dry down it have the nearly the same tone as Ajmal fragrance oil &#x27;Magnificent Oudh&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that WOW factor like Burberry when you first spray it on</li>
            <li>main difference is the oud note which is not found in Bentley Intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like an older gentlemen</li>
            <li>the nose behind this perfume is Nathalie Lorson who create more than hundred perfumes for many designer houses, some are very well known such as Boucheron , Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent , etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like an old man!</li>
            <li>but when it settles it smells really mature.</li>
            <li>Long lasting masculine scent worth the money</li>
            <li>dense, complex and strong texture make it comparable to some from Amouage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not my favorite but not the worse either</li>
