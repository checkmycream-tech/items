            <li> I have short hair and my granddaughter has very long hair.</li>

            <li> We don&#x27;t even use any other brushes now.  </li>
            <li> It had a slight burnt rubber smell but after reaching out to Wet Brush, they gave me a few tips to get rid of the scent.</li>
            <li> The print on the brush is a little smudgy in places and the bristles were bent because the brush packaging got squished in the mail.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this everyday on herself and our daughter.</li>
            <li> We have a few of these.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in that aspect.</li>

            <li> I recommend these brushes all the time.  I actually opened my mouth to recommend these to my stylist, and then he pulled one out himself to detangle my hair.  They&#x27;re that good!  My oldest daughter has mixed hair, and she can actually do her own hair in the morning with these.  I have every bathroom stocked with these.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Wet Brush is a phenomenal brand and really does work wonders on knotty curly hair without ripping or pulling. The little mustaches are just adorable. It had a slight burnt rubber smell but after reaching out to Wet Brush, they gave me a few tips to get rid of the scent. I use this brush on a daily basis. Will buy again!</li>

They detangle without all the pain.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
