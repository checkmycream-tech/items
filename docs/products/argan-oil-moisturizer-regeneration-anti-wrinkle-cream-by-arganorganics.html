            <li>Thank you very much.!!!</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>It has made her complexion so smooth, with no breakouts!</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and does not leave a greasy film as some products do.</li>
            <li>I invested also in the shampoo and conditioner and love them.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>First,I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like feeding your skin, wot more</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will agree</li>
            <li>I love argan oil creams but would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Nice and light, moisturizing yet disappearing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally lovely</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice lightweight cream with a cool gel feel to it.</li>
            <li>After only 2 days my skin looked and felt wonderful, it does what it says and it has smoothed out the fine line wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Good price and fast delivery .</li>
            <li>This really works and has REALLY good ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It is a good size jar too and you don&#x27;t need to use much each day.</li>
            <li>I heard Judy Murray, (mother of tennis pro, Andy Murray), describe this cream as one of her can&#x27;t-live-without products during a radio interview, and I thought if it&#x27;s good enough for Judy, who&#x27;s my sort of age and looks great, it&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>it is way to strong.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job of keeping my skin soft than the Neutrogena that I have used for years, and I thought that did a really good job.</li>
            <li>As I am a senior citizen I am very pleased with the product and will certainly continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>Regeneration is a refined, light, smooth cream which is very kind to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>When I applied it to my face it went on very smoothly and absorbed very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>As a cancer survivor, I appreciate that the ingredients are organic...that is really important to me.</li>
            <li>Creamy and light.</li>
            <li>A light and easily absorbed cream that smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Although there is no difference in my wrinkles (too much sun as a youth), it is a good moisturizer, has a pleasant fragrance and is not too heavy.</li>
            <li>but I have only  been using Argan Oil Moisturizer for two weeks and intend give this cream a fair trial  as on applying cream</li>
            <li>The argan oil and frankincense and rose are all age old products that have been used forever.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face really soft and the after glow of the fresh scent is nice.</li>
            <li>cream is good value - the pot lasts a long time</li>
            <li>I also really like the light scent that it has when she uses it.</li>
            <li>can I say, this is the one for me, it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>Well absorbed and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and the scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li>This product is economically priced for having argan oil as an ingredient.</li>
            <li>She says it makes her skin feel great and that the texture of the cream is just right - not too thick or too light.</li>
            <li>This Argan oil moisturiser is lovely, left skin feeling soft and hydrated will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>liked this product, would recommend to anyone with dry skin and or wrinkles, works well and would order again.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels and looks so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Still using my first jar but will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>It is smoothing out some lines and my skin is smooth and really soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>and that was why I bought it in first place.</li>
            <li>Although the scent is quite strong, and it took me awhile to get used to it, at least it is a clean, refreshing scent instead of one loaded with fragrance, since I am allergic to any products that contain fragrance.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to this when it first comes.</li>
            <li>I had to keep reminding myself, you don&#x27;t need much!</li>
            <li>It made my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>this cream is lovely &amp; soft leaving my skin feeling the same.it&#x27;s just as nice as my more expensive cream.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so soft and really does reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and absorbs into the skin really well leaving it feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>this product just feels high quality and is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>They are tried and true and do not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Seems really nice, goes on smoothly, but the smell is not good.</li>
            <li>I will certainly recommend this to my friends.  </li>
            <li>When I received this cream I thought it was a large pot for the amount of cream</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is very nourishing without being at all greasy.</li>
            <li>but I have doubts that any cream really does that.</li>
            <li>I like the texture and the smoothness of the cream and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing.</li>
            <li>I really like  this product.</li>
            <li>I have used other anti-wrinkle products with less than the great results in the ads.</li>
            <li>Cannot recommend it too highly.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t meet my expectation compared to the high price this item has</li>
            <li>This is cheaper, a little lighter and I like the feel better.</li>
            <li>I had been using green science, but that is more than twice the price.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying kinder cosmetics for over two years now after recovering from breast cancer and am always on the look out for new creams that aren&#x27;t too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin just drinks this in and it leaves my face feeling so soft and not oily at all!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>She has been using organ oil in other products and was excited to see organ oil in a face cream.</li>
            <li>I got results right away but didn&#x27;t do anymore than the few wrinkles on the right side but cheek.</li>
            <li>Compared with my previous moisturisers this one is so smooth and my face feels refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I get ads in the mail of lots of different anti-aging products that cost way to much for me.</li>
            <li>I have older dry skin</li>
            <li>I have mature skin and have spent an absolute fortune over the years with different brands.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working on my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I could barely see.</li>
            <li>This started on 2/8 and in the past four days I have seen the laugh lines diminish.</li>
            <li>and I couldn’t believe what a small amount you need – a little goes a long way, and for me the big bonus is that it is absorbed straight away and doesn’t leave any oily residue</li>

            <li> Makes your skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> She has been using organ oil in other products and was excited to see organ oil in a face cream.</li>
            <li> I got results right away but didn&#x27;t do anymore than the few wrinkles on the right side but cheek.</li>
            <li> Compared with my previous moisturisers this one is so smooth and my face feels refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I get ads in the mail of lots of different anti-aging products that cost way to much for me.</li>
            <li> I have older dry skin</li>
            <li> I have mature skin and have spent an absolute fortune over the years with different brands.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working on my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I could barely see.</li>
            <li> This started on 2/8 and in the past four days I have seen the laugh lines diminish.</li>
            <li> and I couldn’t believe what a small amount you need – a little goes a long way, and for me the big bonus is that it is absorbed straight away and doesn’t leave any oily residue</li>
            <li> This is thicker cream so a tiny bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for a long time and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how little you can use to be completely moisturized.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and FIRM.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use this cream 3 different times and because it has such a strong unpleasant scent I could not use it.  </li>
            <li> It takes a very small amount to do your whole  face and neck area.</li>
            <li> I live in a very harsh climate – sunny and dry –</li>
            <li> My mom has dry skin</li>
            <li> It only took a few days for my teenage daughter to notice a difference in her skin.</li>
            <li> especially dry skin from dry</li>
            <li> Not sure about how well it works because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Regeneration Cream not really knowing what to expect.</li>
            <li> I would suggest anyone no matter what age to try this product I am sure you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I only need to use a small bit each day.</li>
            <li> Product seemed old, discolored, or seal was broken.</li>
            <li> I used Argan Oil Moisturizer - Generation Aniti - Wrinkle Cream and in less than 10 minutes noticed results.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a little hyaluronic syrum and it goes on a little smoother.</li>
            <li> If broken send it back!</li>
            <li> it gives a tightening effect and a small  amount</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any dramatic reduction in my wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have received a few bad jars.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>

            <li> This Argan oil moisturiser is lovely, left skin feeling soft and hydrated will be ordering more. Good price and fast delivery . Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. This is the best face cream I have ever used. It is very nourishing without being at all greasy. It just melts into the skin. Smells wonderful too. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice non greasy, creamy texture. No overpowering scent like some creams. Recommend.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me.  Regeneration is a refined, light, smooth cream which is very kind to my sensitive skin.  It is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It has a fantastic smell and my skin feels great</li>
            <li> This is amazing! My skin feels so soft and FIRM.  Don&#x27;t miss out on this wonderful cream.  Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> When I opened the jar, the first thing I noticed was the delightful fragrance.  When I applied it to my face it went on very smoothly and absorbed very quickly.  Compared with my previous moisturisers this one is so smooth and my face feels refreshed.  As I am a senior citizen I am very pleased with the product and will certainly continue to use it.  I also feel, even though I have only used it for a short time, that my skin feels tighter and hopefully in time my skin will improve. I will certainly recommend this to my friends.  P Franks</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I love this product! As a cancer survivor, I appreciate that the ingredients are organic...that is really important to me. My skin just drinks this in and it leaves my face feeling so soft and not oily at all! After just one week, I noticed such a change in my skin! I was so impressed with this moisturizer that I ordered it for both of my daughters for Christmas and they love it too! It only took a few days for my teenage daughter to notice a difference in her skin. It has made her complexion so smooth, with no breakouts! I am so happy that I found Arganorganics!</li>
            <li> Made my face feel moistured</li>
            <li> I originally discovered this cream as a very famous person uses it  - so how could I not like it?</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Argan Moisturizer.  I have older dry skin and I add a drop of Argan Oil with the cream and it silkens  my skin  Very happy with my new moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful! Makes your skin feel so soft and really does reduce fine lines. Love it!</li>
            <li> When I received this cream I thought it was a large pot for the amount of cream but I have only  been using Argan Oil Moisturizer for two weeks and intend give this cream a fair trial  as on applying cream it gives a tightening effect and a small  amount does what it says.</li>
            <li> I got results right away but didn&#x27;t do anymore than the few wrinkles on the right side but cheek.</li>
            <li> I have only just discovered Argan Oil after reading about it in a beauty book. I ordered the Regeneration Cream not really knowing what to expect. I have mature skin and have spent an absolute fortune over the years with different brands. I could not believe this product, it is amazing. After only 2 days my skin looked and felt wonderful, it does what it says and it has smoothed out the fine line wrinkles around my eyes. It smells lovely and does not leave a greasy film as some products do. I invested also in the shampoo and conditioner and love them. I would suggest anyone no matter what age to try this product I am sure you will not be disappointed. I shall be re-ordering again.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel. It takes a very small amount to do your whole  face and neck area. Still using my first jar but will definitely buy more.I purchased this  item through Amazon on Dec 10, 2014.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff.  This really works and has REALLY good ingredients.  I use this morning and night and on my face and neck.  It is smoothing out some lines and my skin is smooth and really soft and hydrated.  The argan oil and frankincense and rose are all age old products that have been used forever.  They are tried and true and do not irritate my sensitive skin.  Feels so good on.</li>
            <li> liked this product, would recommend to anyone with dry skin and or wrinkles, works well and would order again. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used other anti-wrinkle products with less than the great results in the ads. I used Argan Oil Moisturizer - Generation Aniti - Wrinkle Cream and in less than 10 minutes noticed results. This started on 2/8 and in the past four days I have seen the laugh lines diminish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not my favorite.  Very light smell.  I mix it with a little hyaluronic syrum and it goes on a little smoother.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any dramatic reduction in my wrinkles but I have doubts that any cream really does that. However, this cream has a beautifully fragrance and I only need to use a small bit each day. I&#x27;m now on my 2nd jar and whilst I may try another brand next time, I will keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> Good product. Creamy and light. Like the feel. Not sure about how well it works because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Makes your skin feel so soft! After using for one month my skin tone was noticeably softer and finer lines! The scent of the cream isn&#x27;t overwhelming and the texture of the cream is perfect for the face. Goes on smooth, not greasy and absorbs quickly. I would definately purchase this again!</li>
            <li> First,I love the smell of this.The rose scent is nice.I like the argon oil in this and that was why I bought it in first place.It makes my face really soft and the after glow of the fresh scent is nice.I will rebuy this when I need again.It seems to be working on my extra sensitive skin.I was leary to get it because of that aspect,but it seems to be doing well with my skin.No breakouts and rashes.This is thicker cream so a tiny bit goes a long ways.Does not make your face feel greasy at all.Light and wonderful smell!!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I live in a very harsh climate – sunny and dry – so I was absolutely thrilled to find this marvellous cream. It has a delightful light fragrance and I couldn’t believe what a small amount you need – a little goes a long way, and for me the big bonus is that it is absorbed straight away and doesn’t leave any oily residue but my skin feels and looks so smooth and soft! I’ve used a lot of the ‘big name’ products over the years but this cream beats them all. I have been looking for something like this for a long time and will definitely order again. Cannot recommend it too highly.</li>
            <li> My mom has dry skin and I thought this would be moisturizing enough for her but it is not. It&#x27;s probably more ideal for someone with combination skin</li>
            <li> I like this cream. Although the scent is quite strong, and it took me awhile to get used to it, at least it is a clean, refreshing scent instead of one loaded with fragrance, since I am allergic to any products that contain fragrance. I like the texture and the smoothness of the cream and the price is reasonable. I have used it for several months and while I do not see any specific difference in my skin, I do not anticipate changing my allegiance to a different brand.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is pucky,cannot use it</li>
            <li> I do not like to rose scent it has. it is way to strong. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A light and easily absorbed cream that smells lovely. I really enjoyed using it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried this face cream, and it&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s like feeding your skin, wot more can I say, this is the one for me, it&#x27;s worth a try and I&#x27;m sure you will agree</li>
            <li> I am looking for a replacement for the Sellecca Solution Miracle face cream which also had frankincense in it. This is the closest thing to it that I have found. This is a nice lightweight cream with a cool gel feel to it. It goes on very easily, absorbs well and is non greasy. It has a woodsy rose scent that I love. I&#x27;m hooked, must be on my 5th or 6th jar. It is a good size jar too and you don&#x27;t need to use much each day. I use it day and night. It is very soothing. I have received a few bad jars. Product seemed old, discolored, or seal was broken. There is just a tiny paper seal on the side. Pay attention to this when it first comes. If broken send it back! If discolored send it back!</li>
            <li> I tried to use this cream 3 different times and because it has such a strong unpleasant scent I could not use it.  Very disappointing.  I love argan oil creams but would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Nice and light, moisturizing yet disappearing.  I had been using green science, but that is more than twice the price.  This is cheaper, a little lighter and I like the feel better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for several weeks.  Although there is no difference in my wrinkles (too much sun as a youth), it is a good moisturizer, has a pleasant fragrance and is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> My wife stared to use this cream recently and she&#x27;s happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I heard Judy Murray, (mother of tennis pro, Andy Murray), describe this cream as one of her can&#x27;t-live-without products during a radio interview, and I thought if it&#x27;s good enough for Judy, who&#x27;s my sort of age and looks great, it&#x27;s good enough for me! And huge credit and thanks to Judy because this is the best anti-wrinkle moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s totally lovely and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Brilliant moisturiser- the best I ever had. Well absorbed and not greasy. Nice smell too. Would thoroughly recommend</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturising product ever.&lt;br /&gt;The heat in my apartment in the winter&lt;br /&gt;dries me up. This is a beautiful effective&lt;br /&gt;solution. I recommend it to anyone with&lt;br /&gt;dry skin....especially dry skin from dry&lt;br /&gt;heat.&lt;br /&gt;CC</li>
            <li> Seems really nice, goes on smoothly, but the smell is not good.</li>
            <li> I really like  this product. It makes my skin feel soft and the scent is refreshing. It does a much better job of keeping my skin soft than the Neutrogena that I have used for years, and I thought that did a really good job. All in all, I  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> wonderful and softening</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. She has been using organ oil in other products and was excited to see organ oil in a face cream. She says it makes her skin feel great and that the texture of the cream is just right - not too thick or too light. I also really like the light scent that it has when she uses it. This product is economically priced for having argan oil as an ingredient. From the packaging to the cream this product just feels high quality and is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I already told how I like this product. I couldn&#x27;t believe how little you can use to be completely moisturized. I had to keep reminding myself, you don&#x27;t need much! It made my skin smooth and soft. I used another anti-aging product just before this one that hurt my eyes so I could barely see. My eyes feel good with your product. I think I am getting the benefits of the ant-wrinkle properties. And I love the price! I get ads in the mail of lots of different anti-aging products that cost way to much for me. Thank you Karen Osmundson karenosmund@gmail.com 143 W 5th St. #A Watsonville CA 95076</li>
            <li> this cream is lovely &amp; soft leaving my skin feeling the same.it&#x27;s just as nice as my more expensive cream.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Non greasy and leaves your skin feeling great. Great value. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Heard about this cream on BBC Radio 4 when Judy Murray was on and googled it.  I have been buying kinder cosmetics for over two years now after recovering from breast cancer and am always on the look out for new creams that aren&#x27;t too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is good value - the pot lasts a long time and I have been using it both day and night.  It is non greasy and absorbs into the skin really well leaving it feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectation compared to the high price this item has so I don&#x27;t think I will order it again</li>
