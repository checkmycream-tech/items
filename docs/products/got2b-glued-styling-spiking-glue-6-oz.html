            <li>Love it, nothing is stronger.</li>
            <li>this is my all-time favorite hair gel.</li>
            <li>The price is always much better than Spiker as well.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this brand for many years</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love the hold it has on my hair..</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping and a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Got2B for probably 6 years or more.  </li>
            <li>I have used many gels over the years and this is &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Even though I am sensitive to many hair products this one has the quality !!</li>
            <li>Shampoos out, easily.</li>
            <li>It shampoos out easily.</li>
            <li>You have to be very quick to do you</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>STRONG hair gel.  </li>
            <li>Ridiculously strong.</li>
            <li>A bit too strong.</li>
            <li>It still seems to work just fine even when</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve always put it in my palms and rub them together and its fine.      </li>
            <li>I have used this &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; for about five or six years now and think that it is a wonderful styling tool for my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>Great price on a product I use regularly</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>(im not kidding here, if you flick it, it will sound like you&#x27;re flicking plastic.</li>
            <li>i have thick curly hair and am able to use a quarter size amount for PERFECT hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product - possibly the best glue I&#x27;ve used in years</li>
            <li>just as you had it in the Morning, it&#x27;s super easy to remove with water and a bit of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had a more well-known product and it worked pretty well,</li>
            <li>My boys love this spiking glue and were so excited that it came so fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best stuff out there for thick, stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t really look like there is product in my hair, but its not wet-shiny any more, either.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Curiously tough, they&#x27;re advertising spikes (of course you can spike), but the best effect one can obtain with it is curls!!!</li>
            <li>We purchased this for my 6 year old son because his hair never stayed up with his spikey/flat top look.  </li>
            <li>it has some powerful hold.</li>
            <li>Each tube lasts me one year its so powerful.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool product.</li>
            <li>Product does not leave your hair extremely stiff and has a great hold.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve got them at walmart not so long before... and cheaper.. but its ok!</li>
            <li>The price was right and it was amazon prime.</li>
            <li>Also, since you don&#x27;t need much of this gel to get a good hold, a bottle of it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Best gel for asian hair, hands down.  </li>
            <li>It holds well, but i believe it is a different formulation from the original, as it is not as strong as i remeber it to be.</li>
            <li>my husbands first choice in hair care for the \\&quot;spikes\\&quot; he sports.</li>
            <li>It rained the first day I wore it</li>
            <li>Works as advertised and hair stays exactly where I want it to stay all day without any reapplication.  </li>
            <li>It really is GLUE!  </li>
            <li>Gives me so much volume!</li>
            <li>It dries lightning fast!</li>
            <li>I actually like the CVS version better.</li>
            <li>a minor issue for such a great product.</li>
            <li>The price changed form my first order.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering this product online.</li>
            <li>And i&#x27;m willing to bet that your hair will not move in a category 4 hurricane.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I have extremely straight hair, and this holds it pretty well, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Not as good or strong as Spiker (which sometimes can be a bit excessive), but a close second.</li>
            <li>But you young whippersnappers have to love this stuff too as it will spike up or lay it down smooth, it does exactly what you want.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to achieve for camp Halloween or short spike-y hair.  </li>
            <li>so I can make sure it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>If you want something that stays strong look no further</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve had my three large tubes for two years now</li>
            <li>This is so cheap and is the actual name brand product!  </li>
            <li>tried several that are available at grocery stores and salon chains.</li>
            <li>You may have to really scrub your hands after using.  </li>
            <li>I use it to spike my hair and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really do ask a lot of my gel/glue and this stuff lives up to all I ask.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t use too much or you will cause some flaking to occur.</li>
            <li>because now I have 3 whole tubes that I have to &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use too much it gets too paste-like in the hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, you don&#x27;t mind saving some money, you may need to mix with some water when applying since it is really sticky just like glue.</li>
            <li>25.00 for a 3 pack is too much.  </li>
            <li>Got2b&#x27;s smell is very nice (kinda fruity?) and not strong enough to be obtrusive.</li>
            <li>This gel is much better than other spiking gels that I have used.  </li>
            <li>If I go more than three weeks between cuts think Bozo in black hair - straight out, 360 degrees.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;ICE Spiker is a little better, but this is easier to wash out and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>G2BG really works on spiking the new hair.</li>
            <li>As a tip, make sure you give the item a good shake each time prior to use ... or slowly let out the clear liquid before the actual glue comes out.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks decent after taking my helmet off once or twice.</li>
            <li>The glue was separated, so there was clumps of super sticky glue and water, it was like it wasn&#x27;t mixed throughly.</li>
            <li>I could even fold over my mohawk and it will quickly spring back into place)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I just have a normal haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Had</li>
            <li>I have been using this product few years now, I love it .</li>
            <li>On the Halloween of 2012, I got a mohawk on a whim, And after trying everything (from hairspray, to sugar water, to normal gel)</li>
            <li>Although it leaves your hair with a very, very, very hard hold (great for spikes or simply to hold your hair all day... and night)</li>
            <li>If you looking for a strong hold this will do the trick, and a little will give you some nice style without the plasticy, hard look gel causes.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need alot of this stuff because it&#x27;s very potent.</li>
            <li>You can style your hair in the morning and it will still be like new in the evening.</li>
            <li>Cant live without this product,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become completely dependent upon it!</li>
            <li>This is the only brand I buy since I first found it 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>mix it with a little water and be  sure not to put it all in one spot or it will get super crunchy, but when used right - it is seriously your go-to styling product.</li>
            <li>For ultra fine, limp hair, a pea-sized drop of this stuff run through your hair before blow-drying gives you lots of bounce and even some curl.  </li>
            <li>If you use a little, it will hold the hair well in any style and will even keep it that way in a light rain.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that it is really sticky.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for something that looks natural and</li>
            <li>I am old.  </li>
            <li>This usually only happens when you use too much though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended if your hair doesn&#x27;t fall/grow naturally in the direction you like.</li>
            <li>but I must have received an old batch.</li>
            <li>others say: i&#x27;m completely dependant on it.....</li>
            <li>Old stock?</li>
            <li>It gives a gel free look if you use very little and continue to shape your hair with your fingers.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than tape or glue, especially if you only wear your piece a few days at a time.</li>
            <li>Even as his hair grew out this gel was strong enough to keep his hair stiff and spikey all day</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are very minor complaints and don&#x27;t really bother me, but I thought I&#x27;d share.  </li>
            <li>I use no other hair styling product that this.  </li>
            <li>The is the only stuff that keeps my wild hair in the shape I want it.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and pretty decent price.</li>
            <li>If you want major control - this is the only way to go.</li>
            <li>I have used other gels that get really, crunchy and itchy on the scalp or start shedding white flakes by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it works exactly how I wanted, stiff and unchanging.  </li>
            <li>I might figure out a way to use less since the brand version is so much stronger.</li>
            <li>My husband only uses a little at a time but it seems to keep his hairstyle in shape the whole day.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love the hold it has on my hair..</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Got2B for probably 6 years or more.  </li>
            <li> I have used many gels over the years and this is &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Even though I am sensitive to many hair products this one has the quality !!</li>
            <li> Shampoos out, easily.</li>
            <li> It shampoos out easily.</li>
            <li> You have to be very quick to do you</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> STRONG hair gel.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculously strong.</li>
            <li> A bit too strong.</li>
            <li> It still seems to work just fine even when</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve always put it in my palms and rub them together and its fine.      </li>
            <li> I have used this &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; for about five or six years now and think that it is a wonderful styling tool for my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li> Great price on a product I use regularly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> (im not kidding here, if you flick it, it will sound like you&#x27;re flicking plastic.</li>
            <li> i have thick curly hair and am able to use a quarter size amount for PERFECT hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - possibly the best glue I&#x27;ve used in years</li>
            <li> just as you had it in the Morning, it&#x27;s super easy to remove with water and a bit of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had a more well-known product and it worked pretty well,</li>
            <li> My boys love this spiking glue and were so excited that it came so fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best stuff out there for thick, stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t really look like there is product in my hair, but its not wet-shiny any more, either.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Curiously tough, they&#x27;re advertising spikes (of course you can spike), but the best effect one can obtain with it is curls!!!</li>
            <li> We purchased this for my 6 year old son because his hair never stayed up with his spikey/flat top look.  </li>
            <li> it has some powerful hold.</li>
            <li> Each tube lasts me one year its so powerful.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool product.</li>
            <li> Product does not leave your hair extremely stiff and has a great hold.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve got them at walmart not so long before... and cheaper.. but its ok!</li>
            <li> The price was right and it was amazon prime.</li>
            <li> Also, since you don&#x27;t need much of this gel to get a good hold, a bottle of it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Best gel for asian hair, hands down.  </li>
            <li> It holds well, but i believe it is a different formulation from the original, as it is not as strong as i remeber it to be.</li>
            <li> my husbands first choice in hair care for the \\&quot;spikes\\&quot; he sports.</li>
            <li> It rained the first day I wore it</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and hair stays exactly where I want it to stay all day without any reapplication.  </li>
            <li> It really is GLUE!  </li>
            <li> Gives me so much volume!</li>
            <li> It dries lightning fast!</li>
            <li> I actually like the CVS version better.</li>
            <li> a minor issue for such a great product.</li>
            <li> The price changed form my first order.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering this product online.</li>
            <li> And i&#x27;m willing to bet that your hair will not move in a category 4 hurricane.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have extremely straight hair, and this holds it pretty well, and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Not as good or strong as Spiker (which sometimes can be a bit excessive), but a close second.</li>
            <li> But you young whippersnappers have to love this stuff too as it will spike up or lay it down smooth, it does exactly what you want.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to achieve for camp Halloween or short spike-y hair.  </li>
            <li> so I can make sure it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> If you want something that stays strong look no further</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve had my three large tubes for two years now</li>
            <li> This is so cheap and is the actual name brand product!  </li>
            <li> tried several that are available at grocery stores and salon chains.</li>
            <li> You may have to really scrub your hands after using.  </li>
            <li> I use it to spike my hair and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really do ask a lot of my gel/glue and this stuff lives up to all I ask.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t use too much or you will cause some flaking to occur.</li>
            <li> because now I have 3 whole tubes that I have to &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use too much it gets too paste-like in the hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, you don&#x27;t mind saving some money, you may need to mix with some water when applying since it is really sticky just like glue.</li>
            <li> 25.00 for a 3 pack is too much.  </li>
            <li> Got2b&#x27;s smell is very nice (kinda fruity?) and not strong enough to be obtrusive.</li>
            <li> This gel is much better than other spiking gels that I have used.  </li>
            <li> If I go more than three weeks between cuts think Bozo in black hair - straight out, 360 degrees.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;ICE Spiker is a little better, but this is easier to wash out and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> G2BG really works on spiking the new hair.</li>
            <li> As a tip, make sure you give the item a good shake each time prior to use ... or slowly let out the clear liquid before the actual glue comes out.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks decent after taking my helmet off once or twice.</li>
            <li> The glue was separated, so there was clumps of super sticky glue and water, it was like it wasn&#x27;t mixed throughly.</li>
            <li> I could even fold over my mohawk and it will quickly spring back into place)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just have a normal haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Had</li>
            <li> I have been using this product few years now, I love it .</li>
            <li> On the Halloween of 2012, I got a mohawk on a whim, And after trying everything (from hairspray, to sugar water, to normal gel)</li>
            <li> Although it leaves your hair with a very, very, very hard hold (great for spikes or simply to hold your hair all day... and night)</li>
            <li> If you looking for a strong hold this will do the trick, and a little will give you some nice style without the plasticy, hard look gel causes.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need alot of this stuff because it&#x27;s very potent.</li>
            <li> You can style your hair in the morning and it will still be like new in the evening.</li>
            <li> Cant live without this product,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become completely dependent upon it!</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I buy since I first found it 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> mix it with a little water and be  sure not to put it all in one spot or it will get super crunchy, but when used right - it is seriously your go-to styling product.</li>
            <li> For ultra fine, limp hair, a pea-sized drop of this stuff run through your hair before blow-drying gives you lots of bounce and even some curl.  </li>
            <li> If you use a little, it will hold the hair well in any style and will even keep it that way in a light rain.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that it is really sticky.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for something that looks natural and</li>
            <li> I am old.  </li>
            <li> This usually only happens when you use too much though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended if your hair doesn&#x27;t fall/grow naturally in the direction you like.</li>
            <li> but I must have received an old batch.</li>
            <li> others say: i&#x27;m completely dependant on it.....</li>
            <li> Old stock?</li>
            <li> It gives a gel free look if you use very little and continue to shape your hair with your fingers.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than tape or glue, especially if you only wear your piece a few days at a time.</li>
            <li> Even as his hair grew out this gel was strong enough to keep his hair stiff and spikey all day</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are very minor complaints and don&#x27;t really bother me, but I thought I&#x27;d share.  </li>
            <li> I use no other hair styling product that this.  </li>
            <li> The is the only stuff that keeps my wild hair in the shape I want it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and pretty decent price.</li>
            <li> If you want major control - this is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> I have used other gels that get really, crunchy and itchy on the scalp or start shedding white flakes by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it works exactly how I wanted, stiff and unchanging.  </li>
            <li> I might figure out a way to use less since the brand version is so much stronger.</li>
            <li> My husband only uses a little at a time but it seems to keep his hairstyle in shape the whole day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t foresee my using any other gel/glue in the near future.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way - too much and you&#x27;ll find you need to rewash your hair.  </li>
            <li> If you go to the beach or a pool, if you don&#x27;t mess to much with your hair, you can let it dry again</li>
            <li> The 6oz tubes last a long time for my short hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much-- just a small dot in your palm-- to have a noticeable effect on how you can style your hair.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to debate about how much I like this or that product, but I have no doubt in my mind here.</li>
            <li> I take a small amount, about the size of a nickel, and spread it between my palms evenly, then gently rub my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair in the same style on my long 12 hour shifts, and I&#x27;ve even gone swimming and my hair is still styled.  </li>
            <li> A single tube will last me 5-6 months.</li>
            <li> Although I usually only do this when I&#x27;m running out of glue, it does seem wasteful that there is so much left in the tube due to</li>
            <li> do have a couple minor complaints, though</li>
            <li> Its the only thing I can use that will actually help my long, thin, stick straight hair look thicker.  </li>
            <li> Apply on wet hair only.</li>
            <li> Does the job every time and holds it as long as you need it until washed.</li>
            <li> I have straight and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I used this when I was in highschool and have used some other gels between that time and decided to come back to this.</li>
            <li> It definitely works for &amp;#34;spiking&amp;#34; and other gravity defying styles.</li>
            <li> A little dab is enough to give my hair a style that will last all day, even when the wind is blowing and the rain is falling.</li>
            <li> He particularly appreciates the hard as a rock feel his hair has after the gel dries.  </li>
            <li> The clear liquid makes your hair kinda gross and is hard to get off on your hands.  </li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair to spike hair out or straighten strands for a separated look.</li>
            <li> it keep brushing it until its dry.  </li>
            <li> I like to take a shower, hop out, towel dry my hair, and then use Got 2 b.</li>
            <li> --sometimes the glue separates so you get some thin liquid and thicker glue that first comes out of the tube (sort of like ketchup).  </li>
            <li> This product allows me to set my hair exactly as I want it without an overly wet look or excessive &amp;#34;hardening&amp;#34; that would happen with a firm gel.</li>
            <li> I water this down and only use about a dime size each day.  </li>
            <li> When I mess it up with a hoody or a hat, I simply just wet it</li>
            <li> Splash a little water on if you have bed head from a nap... springs back to life.</li>
            <li> It may separate on you, no big deal just massage the tube a little before use to mix it all together</li>
            <li> When it was in stores, it came out as a clear gel with a firm hold, but when i recieved this, it was a little watery</li>
            <li> Also some people say don&#x27;t put it on wet hair, but I need it for my hair and all I do</li>
            <li> I like this because it isn&#x27;t too wet</li>
            <li> Use this product on wet hair.</li>
            <li> tried a bunch of other types of hair product.</li>
            <li> When you need extreme hold with a gloss look this is the stuff to get</li>
            <li> You only need a little dab of this gel for the hair, as it is like glue and a small amount will hold the hair up.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that this stuff can be hard to get out of your hair at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint--</li>
            <li> so the gels that are really wet make my hair limp and less controlled.</li>
            <li> Without my Got 2 b, my hair style would be flat and dull.</li>
            <li> Seriously I have hair that grows in 10 different directions, think Chia Pet Hair.  </li>
            <li> The last ~10 uses require contortion of the tube (worse than a tube of toothpaste) to get the remaining glue.  </li>
            <li> A few people mentioned that it separates.  </li>
            <li> This is all I have been using for quite a few years now, as my hair is not easy to tame.</li>
            <li> and my hair is still stiff at 8 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a little water on my hands to make it a little thinner, because it seems a little too thick</li>
            <li> other minor complaint is that the last portion of the tube is very difficult to squeeze out.  </li>
            <li> - At least it has never happened to me, other than when it&#x27;s applied excessively...</li>
            <li> I put this on at least half an hour before I ride</li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy hair and before I tried this, I had a hard time keeping my hair in regulation.</li>
            <li> the product was getting hard to find and was here in a convenient 3-pack.</li>
            <li> But a dab, I really mean a dab, of this stuff</li>
            <li> The glue can flake off in your hair after it dries and makes it look like you have a serious case of dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that can be hard to style they way I like.</li>
            <li> I was tired of getting bent over every time I had to buy this stuff at the store.  </li>
            <li> Tired of helmet hair?</li>
            <li> we want a fake Mohawk or spikes...</li>
            <li> So I Was Very Skeptical When I Walked In To Rite Aid</li>
            <li> pet peeve of mine is when my gel smells bad</li>
            <li> thing bad, is the Bad A$&amp; look you&#x27;ll have after applying this to your hair.</li>
            <li> It can also be painful to try and brush your hair once you use the product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hubby used to use Spiker, which is considerably more expensive. He got this while traveling and likes it even better. The price is a plus as well. It makes his hair spiky (and crispy - just so you know). You will not be able to get a comb through your hair after using it, but if you are looking for durable spikes, this will be great for you.</li>
            <li> No flaking, superior hold...I use it to hold my kids (regular)  hairstyle in place all day.  But&lt;br /&gt;if we want a fake Mohawk or spikes...look no further...it&#x27;s easy to achieve for camp Halloween or short spike-y hair.  Great product very versatile.</li>
            <li> Best deal around! I was tired of getting bent over every time I had to buy this stuff at the store.  This is so cheap and is the actual name brand product!  I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I used to use ICE Spiker, but they kept increasing the cost until I had to find an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several that are available at grocery stores and salon chains. This one is the best of the copies and can be purchases almost anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ICE Spiker is a little better, but this is easier to wash out and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Product works great at a good price for the bundle!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for spiking or controlling your hair style.  Only drawback is that it is really sticky.  You may have to really scrub your hands after using.  It can also be painful to try and brush your hair once you use the product.  I love it, I spike my hair and this product stays all day.</li>
            <li> Simply Love It!&lt;br /&gt;Is The Best Styling Gel Ive Seen N Tried In My Life.&lt;br /&gt;Ive Used Over 20 Different Brands. N More Than 50 Product Lines. So I Was Very Skeptical When I Walked In To Rite Aid N Saw It. But This Is The Best Gel On Earth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years, and it works well for me.  The 6oz tubes last a long time for my short hair.  I have extremely straight hair, and this holds it pretty well, and lasts all day.  I use a little water on my hands to make it a little thinner, because it seems a little too thick otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a couple minor complaints, though--sometimes the glue separates so you get some thin liquid and thicker glue that first comes out of the tube (sort of like ketchup).  This doesn&#x27;t always happen with every tube, and doesn&#x27;t happen throughout the tube.  It still seems to work just fine even when separated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other minor complaint is that the last portion of the tube is very difficult to squeeze out.  The last ~10 uses require contortion of the tube (worse than a tube of toothpaste) to get the remaining glue.  Although I usually only do this when I&#x27;m running out of glue, it does seem wasteful that there is so much left in the tube due to the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very minor complaints and don&#x27;t really bother me, but I thought I&#x27;d share.  Overall, the glue works well for me.</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great holding product! You can style your hair in the morning and it will still be like new in the evening. I use it on dry hair to spike hair out or straighten strands for a separated look. The best thing is it washes out. No residue left in hair. Cant live without this product,</li>
            <li> my husbands first choice in hair care for the \\&quot;spikes\\&quot; he sports. the product was getting hard to find and was here in a convenient 3-pack.</li>
            <li> For ultra fine, limp hair, a pea-sized drop of this stuff run through your hair before blow-drying gives you lots of bounce and even some curl.  I&#x27;ve become completely dependent upon it!</li>
            <li> This gel has a great hold</li>
            <li> The item was shipped within hours of my purchase. The hair gel works great! It rained the first day I wore it and my hair didn&#x27;t get messed up when I rode my bike home from work. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great price for his favorite gel. This is great for people who like a strong hold. Doesn&#x27;t leave build-up on the hair/scalp. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product allows me to set my hair exactly as I want it without an overly wet look or excessive &amp;#34;hardening&amp;#34; that would happen with a firm gel. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and plan to continue. I buy it in bulk to take advantage of the savings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and it works exactly how I wanted, stiff and unchanging.  It holds my hair style sometimes overnight.</li>
            <li> Great price on a product I use regularly</li>
            <li> The best gel you can get</li>
            <li> I used this when I was in highschool and have used some other gels between that time and decided to come back to this. It&#x27;s the best stuff out there for thick, stubborn hair. I use it to spike my hair and it works very well. A little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t need alot of this stuff because it&#x27;s very potent.</li>
            <li> STRONG hair gel.  Nice that it comes in a 3 pack.  My husband only uses a little at a time but it seems to keep his hairstyle in shape the whole day.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and hair stays exactly where I want it to stay all day without any reapplication.  I have mastered the amount to use to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t have that hard/crusty feel.</li>
            <li> tried a bunch of other types of hair product. keep coming back to this. rain proof. hair stays in place. no complaints</li>
            <li> We purchased this for my 6 year old son because his hair never stayed up with his spikey/flat top look.  Even as his hair grew out this gel was strong enough to keep his hair stiff and spikey all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know use this as my hair gel and my hair stays in place all day - I put it in at 6 am and my hair is still stiff at 8 pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something that looks natural and people can&#x27;t tell that you are wearing it, then pass on this gel.  If you are looking to have hair that stays in place and is either spikey or you like the &amp;#34;slicked look&amp;#34;  this gel is the gel for you.</li>
            <li> easier than going to the store and a better price too</li>
            <li> This is the strongest, firmest, holdiest (sic?) glue you will ever try.  Seriously I have hair that grows in 10 different directions, think Chia Pet Hair.  If I go more than three weeks between cuts think Bozo in black hair - straight out, 360 degrees.  But a dab, I really mean a dab, of this stuff and I honestly have tamed the mane.  If I was &amp;#34;hip&amp;#34;, I could spike it, but I am not.  I am old.  But you young whippersnappers have to love this stuff too as it will spike up or lay it down smooth, it does exactly what you want.  Thank goodness, I really do ask a lot of my gel/glue and this stuff lives up to all I ask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for well over 10 years; using maybe 4-5 tubes during the coarse of the year.  A little goes a LONG way - too much and you&#x27;ll find you need to rewash your hair.  As a tip, make sure you give the item a good shake each time prior to use ... or slowly let out the clear liquid before the actual glue comes out.  The clear liquid makes your hair kinda gross and is hard to get off on your hands.  So let the liquid &amp; glue come together, or just eliminate it before each use.  One more tip - this item goes on-and-off sale with Amazon so watch for the price...avoid 3rd party sellers, as they tend to be much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Best gel for asian hair, hands down.  It gives a gel free look if you use very little and continue to shape your hair with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I literally work in a wind tunnel (indoor skydiving) and this stuff holds up to 120+ mph winds every time. If you want something that stays strong look no further</li>
            <li> I wear a men&#x27;s hair piece and the person who made it told me about using this product (along with some Got2b Glued Blasting Freeze Spray) to hold the hair piece in place. This is so much better than tape or glue, especially if you only wear your piece a few days at a time. It is water soluble, so you don&#x27;t have to use solvents to get it out. I also use it as intended to spike my hair when I want. I&#x27;m sure it works just as well on &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; hair!</li>
            <li> I have used this &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; for about five or six years now and think that it is a wonderful styling tool for my fine, limp hair. It doesn&#x27;t take much-- just a small dot in your palm-- to have a noticeable effect on how you can style your hair. It definitely works for &amp;#34;spiking&amp;#34; and other gravity defying styles. I like to use it as a body enhancer to my hair. A little dab is enough to give my hair a style that will last all day, even when the wind is blowing and the rain is falling. I work the glue through my hair with my hands and then use a brush to shape it into a &amp;#34;windblown&amp;#34; style. Nothing too radical. A part on the side, some pull back on the sides below the temples, and that&#x27;s about it. You can do more with this stuff-- it has some powerful hold. But don&#x27;t use too much or you will cause some flaking to occur. That is my only complaint-- The glue can flake off in your hair after it dries and makes it look like you have a serious case of dandruff. This usually only happens when you use too much though.</li>
            <li> Love it, nothing is stronger. Got 2b Glued Spiking Glue 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3) Got 2b Glued Spiking Glue 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3) Got 2b Glued Spiking Glue 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3) Got 2b Glued Spiking Glue 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3) Got 2b Glued Spiking Glue 6-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)</li>
            <li> this hair gel has a strong hold, lasts all day, and smells good.  it leaves your hair extremely crisp so its perfect for spiking.</li>
            <li> I water this down and only use about a dime size each day.  The price was right and it was amazon prime.</li>
            <li> Holds all day, doesn&#x27;t let go. Shampoos out, easily. Splash a little water on if you have bed head from a nap... springs back to life.</li>
            <li> this is my all-time favorite hair gel. i have thick curly hair and am able to use a quarter size amount for PERFECT hair. mix it with a little water and be  sure not to put it all in one spot or it will get super crunchy, but when used right - it is seriously your go-to styling product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great value.</li>
            <li> After several years of use I have NO complaints !</li>
            <li> The only stuff that works for my boys hair! Works great and amazon has a great price. It may separate on you, no big deal just massage the tube a little before use to mix it all together</li>
            <li> Product does not leave your hair extremely stiff and has a great hold.  A little goes a long way and pretty decent price.</li>
            <li> The is the only stuff that keeps my wild hair in the shape I want it.  A+&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if your hair doesn&#x27;t fall/grow naturally in the direction you like.</li>
            <li> Do you ride a motorcycle? Tired of helmet hair? I put this on at least half an hour before I ride so I can make sure it&#x27;s dry. My hair looks decent after taking my helmet off once or twice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all ok !!! Tks !!</li>
            <li> Not as good or strong as Spiker (which sometimes can be a bit excessive), but a close second. The price is always much better than Spiker as well. If you looking for a strong hold this will do the trick, and a little will give you some nice style without the plasticy, hard look gel causes.</li>
            <li> Comes with 3. Each tube lasts me one year its so powerful.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this brand for many years but I must have received an old batch. The glue was separated, so there was clumps of super sticky glue and water, it was like it wasn&#x27;t mixed throughly. Bummer because now I have 3 whole tubes that I have to &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; each time I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only hair gel that I will use. I had chemotherapy and my hair changed.  G2BG really works on spiking the new hair.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to debate about how much I like this or that product, but I have no doubt in my mind here. This stuff is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pet peeve of mine is when my gel smells bad and I&#x27;ve bought enough to last the next year. I had this problem with Axe products, especially when I have to use a lot because my hair grows out. Got2b&#x27;s smell is very nice (kinda fruity?) and not strong enough to be obtrusive. I don&#x27;t foresee my using any other gel/glue in the near future.</li>
            <li> When you need extreme hold with a gloss look this is the stuff to get</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product I use it all the time, it&#x27;s simply the best. The one I bought I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else so amazon was a big help. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff for spiking or anything else you can think of. I would recommend this to any body.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I just have a normal haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Had been using Crew Clay for years. Tried this out.&lt;br /&gt;All it takes is a drop about the size of a dime and works great holding my hair. A single tube will last me 5-6 months. Best value out there.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair the way i want it all day in perfect form even if i happen to get alot of water on it, it stays the way i want it without problems and goes great with all types of hair styles and lengthes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now.  It really is GLUE!  Its the only thing I can use that will actually help my long, thin, stick straight hair look thicker.  I had a more well-known product and it worked pretty well, but when I tried Got 2b Glue, I never went back.  You don&#x27;t need a ton, even on my waist-length hair.    A few people mentioned that it separates.  Well, I&#x27;ve had my three large tubes for two years now and yes, the product will eventually separate.  But I&#x27;ve always put it in my palms and rub them together and its fine.      Also some people say don&#x27;t put it on wet hair, but I need it for my hair and all I do it keep brushing it until its dry.  So it doesn&#x27;t really look like there is product in my hair, but its not wet-shiny any more, either.  Gives me so much volume!</li>
            <li> Awesome best hair product ever non sticky and keeps your hair the way you want .</li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy hair and before I tried this, I had a hard time keeping my hair in regulation. Once I started using this, my hair stayed in place all day and I stopped getting yelled at for it. It shampoos out easily. Apply on wet hair only.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair. And it&#x27;s a bit curly and i want it CURLY!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all brands of gel, foam yadi yada....but THIS IS THE BEST EVER...&lt;br /&gt;like others say: i&#x27;m completely dependant on it.....&lt;br /&gt;Curiously tough, they&#x27;re advertising spikes (of course you can spike), but the best effect one can obtain with it is curls!!!</li>
            <li> This is all I have been using for quite a few years now, as my hair is not easy to tame. Although it leaves your hair with a very, very, very hard hold (great for spikes or simply to hold your hair all day... and night) just as you had it in the Morning, it&#x27;s super easy to remove with water and a bit of shampoo. Actually, just with water and your hands it can be removed. If you go to the beach or a pool, if you don&#x27;t mess to much with your hair, you can let it dry again and it will re-activate. It dries lightning fast! Won&#x27;t leave any residues - At least it has never happened to me, other than when it&#x27;s applied excessively... Pretty cool product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This gel is much better than other spiking gels that I have used.  You only need a little dab of this gel for the hair, as it is like glue and a small amount will hold the hair up. If you use too much it gets too paste-like in the hair.  I have used other gels that get really, crunchy and itchy on the scalp or start shedding white flakes by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel holds the hair in place without overly drying it out and it doesn&#x27;t flake off. What impresses me is that by the end of the day after using this gel your hair is still in the style that you put it in in the morning and you still look great. Also, since you don&#x27;t need much of this gel to get a good hold, a bottle of it lasts a long time. If you get a three pack through amazon you should be set for awhile. Its a good deal.</li>
            <li> I actually like the CVS version better. Both are very good products however. I might figure out a way to use less since the brand version is so much stronger.</li>
            <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Great Viscosity&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t flake&lt;br /&gt;-Long lasting hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Only thing bad, is the Bad A$&amp; look you&#x27;ll have after applying this to your hair.</li>
            <li> I love it and I&#x27;ll stock with it for a while! I found it when my big bottle one was tossed away by custom officer at the airport...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complain really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you don&#x27;t mind saving some money, you may need to mix with some water when applying since it is really sticky just like glue.</li>
            <li> My boys love this spiking glue and were so excited that it came so fast.</li>
            <li> Great price for a three pack</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not using wax I use this. Holds my hair all day and even the next!</li>
            <li> Ridiculously strong. A bit too strong. You have to be very quick to do you hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as b&amp;m bought.  Old stock?</li>
            <li> Best Guy hair gel for spiking your hair!!</li>
            <li> This is the end all and be all for hair styling. Without my Got 2 b, my hair style would be flat and dull. Nothing else I have tried on the market holds like this glue. I have used this product for probably a good 10 years. I have straight and thick hair. I believe the label recommends having damp hair to style. I like to take a shower, hop out, towel dry my hair, and then use Got 2 b. I take a small amount, about the size of a nickel, and spread it between my palms evenly, then gently rub my fingers through my hair. This gives me the best styling capacity. What&#x27;s also great is that I have a parted hairstyle with a big Elvis-esque pompadour, so it&#x27;s not just spiky hair that this is great for.</li>
            <li> Quality product and great price</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve got them at walmart not so long before... and cheaper.. but its ok!</li>
            <li> My son loves got 2b glued hair gel. He particularly appreciates the hard as a rock feel his hair has after the gel dries.  He is able to hang his head out the window with the dog at 50 mph and his hair stays perfectly coiffed into position.  If you have a teenage son that takes longer to do his hair than everyone else in the family, this gel is for you!</li>
            <li> This is my go to hair product every day and have been using it for years. I have very thick hair that can be hard to style they way I like. This stuff does the job perfectly. Easy to use and it gives all day hold. The only drawback is that this stuff can be hard to get out of your hair at the end of the day...a minor issue for such a great product.</li>
            <li> This pack has 3 XL size for the price of 2 regular size at CVS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great special and it works great</li>
            <li> The price changed form my first order.  25.00 for a 3 pack is too much.  Target lists this same product, pack of 1 for just under 4.  The product itself is great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love the hold it has on my hair..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product few years now, I love it . Even though I am sensitive to many hair products this one has the quality !!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product, but I could not find it on the shelves of the stores I went to. This was a great multipack deal because I use a lot.</li>
            <li> I really like this product - possibly the best glue I&#x27;ve used in years and I have tried a lot of different ones.  Fast Shipping and a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering this product online. When it was in stores, it came out as a clear gel with a firm hold, but when i recieved this, it was a little watery and it was white. It holds well, but i believe it is a different formulation from the original, as it is not as strong as i remeber it to be.</li>
            <li> I use no other hair styling product that this.  It keeps my hair in the same style on my long 12 hour shifts, and I&#x27;ve even gone swimming and my hair is still styled.  Talk about rico suave!</li>
            <li> I like this because it isn&#x27;t too wet and I have very fine hair so the gels that are really wet make my hair limp and less controlled.</li>
            <li> On the Halloween of 2012, I got a mohawk on a whim, And after trying everything (from hairspray, to sugar water, to normal gel) It wouldnt stay up all that well. I came across this hair glue, and I gotta say, it&#x27;s fantastic. If you use a little, it will hold the hair well in any style and will even keep it that way in a light rain. If you use a lot however, it will basically turn your hairstyle into a bulletproof plastic (im not kidding here, if you flick it, it will sound like you&#x27;re flicking plastic. I could even fold over my mohawk and it will quickly spring back into place) And i&#x27;m willing to bet that your hair will not move in a category 4 hurricane. But disregarding the fact that it works so well, its best quality is that it smells like peaches :3</li>
            <li> Still a good deal for the price.  Shopping cart photo shows 7.2 oz bonus tube.</li>
            <li> Use this product on wet hair. Wash and wear for the summer months.  Have used this for years but can&#x27;t find the local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Got2B for probably 6 years or more.  It&#x27;s the only hair gel that never leaves my hair flakey or anything.  When I mess it up with a hoody or a hat, I simply just wet it and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Best hair product EVER.  Nothing holds the \\&quot;spikes\\&quot; like this.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! Described perfectly! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I have used many gels over the years and this is &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34;. Does the job every time and holds it as long as you need it until washed. This is the only brand I buy since I first found it 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> If you want major control - this is the only way to go.</li>
    </ol>
