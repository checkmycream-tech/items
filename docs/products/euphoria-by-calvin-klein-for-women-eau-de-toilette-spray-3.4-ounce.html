            <li>Great scent for every day or a special evening out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you already know the smell if ordering online, but the smell is pleasant as well.  </li>
            <li>Euphoria is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten alot of compliments on how nice it smells on me.  </li>
            <li>this one is nice</li>
            <li>Shipped on time and is a nice sized bottle.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this perfume for years, but have never been able to afford it.</li>
            <li>so nice looking bottle..</li>
            <li>Although it was sent to me now I can&#x27;t return because it is now apparently hazardous material.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice scent but its not my style.</li>
            <li>I love my Euphoria, it&#x27;s nice summer parfume, very elegant.</li>
            <li>it is a good service, do understand the customer needs when we require more service more than the item.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x60;t like the smell don&#x27;t know why, but it turn out to be that my mom just loved the smell and because she dosn&#x60;t accept every smell because she got like allergy on strong smells.</li>
            <li>It gets better over the course of the day, smelling like warm floral vanilla-ish as time goes on.</li>
            <li>Great price, packed nicely, and arrived fast!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love all of the Euphoria scents!</li>
            <li>shipping was awesome and handling was great, so if anyone is worried about it breaking down don&#x27;t worry it&#x60;s safe.</li>
            <li>Good gift to someone special.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, happy with product and seller service</li>

            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the scent but have to use a lot more than  I used with the sample in order to notice the smell.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>This was the real thing and got at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I get it for her every year and once again it was a favorite gift.</li>
            <li>love wearing it.</li>

            <li>I love the way this fragrance smells on me</li>
            <li>Not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I am already enjoying it and will order it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I waited because I got a better price.</li>
            <li>She gets lots of compliments on it and has become her favorite parfum.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for all women.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I have never got so many comments....</li>
            <li>bought it as a gift for my mother and mother in law and they absolutely love</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on this perfume then</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love my Euphoria, i get alot of compliments everywhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad i bought it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent</li>
            <li>Smells so sexy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments.</li>
            <li>I have always bought Euphoria at the store, but was hoping to find a better deal online.</li>
            <li>It is very seductive and sexy smelling, I get tons of compliments when I wear it, love it!!</li>
            <li>Just what I expected at a great price!</li>
            <li>I go, including one man who bought it for his girlfriend because he liked it so much :)</li>
            <li>an Eau de Toilette does not have as strong of a concentration as an Eau de Parfam.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like strong scents.</li>
            <li>It was a nice big bottle for a good price, just not my style....</li>
            <li>Received this in a sample size from a friend and loved it so much I ordered the full size.</li>
            <li>It used to be kind of harsh when you first sprayed it, but once it settled, it was the perfect.  </li>
            <li>Big bottle at great price.  </li>
            <li>It sure brought a lot of smile on her face this morning.</li>
            <li>When I found it for this cheap</li>
            <li>It is light not over powering.</li>
            <li>This perfume is good but doesn&#x27;t last for more than 3hrs.</li>
            <li>using it pretty much everyday..stay for long time.overall awesome..:) :)</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend it for anyone on the lookout for a good perfume for their better halves.</li>
            <li>It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li>I love the price for it was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Has a nice soft smell to it no too strong, considering i don&#x27;t like perfumes but</li>
            <li>I was familiar with the scent before I purchased, so I knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li>Also, the package and the container was not looking like the original neither.</li>
            <li>and since I was notified when I bought this spray, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>They are all absolutely fresh, clean and intense in their own unique way.</li>
            <li>The scent did not seem as strong, but it&#x27;s definitely the one I love!</li>
            <li>I love perfumes I am very picking.</li>
            <li>Smells good on the back of my wifes&#x27; neck!</li>
            <li>Received quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I got free shipping, so it was pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>my girlfriend has been wearing this perfume for the past year, and i got a say, it smells very good.</li>
            <li>Got this for my girlfriend and it smells so good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I should always know to check amazon first!~</li>
            <li>Came exactly as expect and even sooner than the original quoted time.</li>
            <li>exactly what we wanted smells great cool bottle shape and pretty pink color</li>
            <li>This is soft and feminine, while being timeless and sexy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this scent - soft, alluring, musky with a touch of sweetness.</li>
            <li>But I love the smell and it&#x27;s a soft scent.</li>
            <li>Was surprised and excited to find it so cheap through this company.</li>
            <li>I recommend other people to buy it good product.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal, and it does still smell good, but it is NOT the same as the stuff I have bought for the past five years at department stores.</li>
            <li>I used the sample, everyone complimented me right away.</li>
            <li>Klein is right on for this scent.  </li>
            <li>The eau de toilette is a bit less strong, which is fine, because it&#x27;s a strong scent to begin with.</li>
            <li>Given as a gift for a special daughter in law that REALLY deserves it.</li>
            <li>Shipping reasonable and quick.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a sexy new scent.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet and sort of musty and sophisticated but not tooo sophisticated if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>got many compliments of men liking this fragrance totally buying again</li>
            <li>So-I ordered it the fragrance does not last for more than an hour, if that.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be different.</li>
            <li>I am definitely purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I first found this scent as a sample when I ordered some makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>This price was much better than our local walmart&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>Hope there&#x27;s more like this in the future for me to buy!</li>
            <li>I went to the mall during the Christmas season and this was priced higher</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying Ck.</li>
            <li>This is the only spicier frangrance that I love.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought this perfume for me as a birthday present because he knew that&#x27;s my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>It has the crisp smell of a woman who is in control and yet feminine.  </li>
            <li>The presentation is cute and smells soft, young and delicated.</li>
            <li>The bottle is bigger than I expected and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I would certainly consider buying this again</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and very well packed so no worries with breakage during shipping.</li>
            <li>It was better than I expected.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an unusual &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; smell that attracts people to it.  </li>
            <li>I really did not like this perfume....</li>
            <li>Such a lovely scent...not too heavy, not too sweet.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are a fan of Calvin Klein, not cloying.</li>
            <li>This not only smells good it last for a very long time too!</li>
            <li>for lovers of classic calvin klein I think that makes fragrances that you could live a lifetime, this is one of theses</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and I purchased it for less than what I paid for it at the department store!</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last like an original would last.</li>
            <li>Its little strong..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad different per se, just different.</li>
            <li>giant bottle great smell nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li>So I never actually smelt the real perfume</li>
            <li>Do not waste you time and money on this item</li>
            <li>Complete waist of my money.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is classy but not floral or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells like it is old, maybe expired .</li>
            <li>The product looks legitimate but maybe my taste has changed since I last wore it because I don&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
            <li>Now I feel that it doesn&#x27;t even get to the &amp;#34;settled&amp;#34; point before it vanishes completely.  </li>
            <li>This is a very sophisticated casual smell for those who dont like flowery smelling perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I wasn&#x27;t aware of the difference between \\&quot;Eau de parfum\\&quot; and \\&quot;Eau de toilette\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Well, it didn&#x27;t take long enough for me to discover that this product was an imitation of the original.</li>
            <li>The price was much cheaper on other fragrance websites and the package arrived on time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells WONDERFUL, and I cant believe I found it on Amazon for such a Great Price!</li>
            <li> The container and bottle are designed attractively and packaged safely.  </li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this people tell me I smell amazing, it is that good.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice but, sexy scent.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful, light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  </li>
            <li> My favorite!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!</li>
            <li> Works almost as well as a \\&quot;cute puppy on a leash\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Great scent for every day or a special evening out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you already know the smell if ordering online, but the smell is pleasant as well.  </li>
            <li> Euphoria is the absolute best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten alot of compliments on how nice it smells on me.  </li>
            <li> this one is nice</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and is a nice sized bottle.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume for years, but have never been able to afford it.</li>
            <li> so nice looking bottle..</li>
            <li> Although it was sent to me now I can&#x27;t return because it is now apparently hazardous material.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice scent but its not my style.</li>
            <li> I love my Euphoria, it&#x27;s nice summer parfume, very elegant.</li>
            <li> it is a good service, do understand the customer needs when we require more service more than the item.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x60;t like the smell don&#x27;t know why, but it turn out to be that my mom just loved the smell and because she dosn&#x60;t accept every smell because she got like allergy on strong smells.</li>
            <li> It gets better over the course of the day, smelling like warm floral vanilla-ish as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Great price, packed nicely, and arrived fast!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love all of the Euphoria scents!</li>
            <li> shipping was awesome and handling was great, so if anyone is worried about it breaking down don&#x27;t worry it&#x60;s safe.</li>
            <li> Good gift to someone special.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, happy with product and seller service</li>
            <li> I thought it was probably too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> Great price for this large bottle.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> but it feels euphoric :-)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume-I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>

            <li> My fiance will love it.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne for women.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the scent but have to use a lot more than  I used with the sample in order to notice the smell.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> This was the real thing and got at a great price.  </li>
            <li> I immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I get it for her every year and once again it was a favorite gift.</li>
            <li> love wearing it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend calls it a &#x27;sexy hippy scent&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I love the way this fragrance smells on me</li>
            <li> Not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I am already enjoying it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I waited because I got a better price.</li>
            <li> She gets lots of compliments on it and has become her favorite parfum.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for all women.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have never got so many comments....</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift for my mother and mother in law and they absolutely love</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this perfume then</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love my Euphoria, i get alot of compliments everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent</li>
            <li> Smells so sexy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> I have always bought Euphoria at the store, but was hoping to find a better deal online.</li>
            <li> It is very seductive and sexy smelling, I get tons of compliments when I wear it, love it!!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected at a great price!</li>
            <li> I go, including one man who bought it for his girlfriend because he liked it so much :)</li>
            <li> an Eau de Toilette does not have as strong of a concentration as an Eau de Parfam.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like strong scents.</li>
            <li> It was a nice big bottle for a good price, just not my style....</li>
            <li> Received this in a sample size from a friend and loved it so much I ordered the full size.</li>
            <li> It used to be kind of harsh when you first sprayed it, but once it settled, it was the perfect.  </li>
            <li> Big bottle at great price.  </li>
            <li> It sure brought a lot of smile on her face this morning.</li>
            <li> When I found it for this cheap</li>
            <li> It is light not over powering.</li>
            <li> This perfume is good but doesn&#x27;t last for more than 3hrs.</li>
            <li> using it pretty much everyday..stay for long time.overall awesome..:) :)</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend it for anyone on the lookout for a good perfume for their better halves.</li>
            <li> It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li> I love the price for it was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Has a nice soft smell to it no too strong, considering i don&#x27;t like perfumes but</li>
            <li> I was familiar with the scent before I purchased, so I knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li> Also, the package and the container was not looking like the original neither.</li>
            <li> and since I was notified when I bought this spray, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> They are all absolutely fresh, clean and intense in their own unique way.</li>
            <li> The scent did not seem as strong, but it&#x27;s definitely the one I love!</li>
            <li> I love perfumes I am very picking.</li>
            <li> Smells good on the back of my wifes&#x27; neck!</li>
            <li> Received quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I got free shipping, so it was pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend has been wearing this perfume for the past year, and i got a say, it smells very good.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend and it smells so good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I should always know to check amazon first!~</li>
            <li> Came exactly as expect and even sooner than the original quoted time.</li>
            <li> exactly what we wanted smells great cool bottle shape and pretty pink color</li>
            <li> This is soft and feminine, while being timeless and sexy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scent - soft, alluring, musky with a touch of sweetness.</li>
            <li> But I love the smell and it&#x27;s a soft scent.</li>
            <li> Was surprised and excited to find it so cheap through this company.</li>
            <li> I recommend other people to buy it good product.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal, and it does still smell good, but it is NOT the same as the stuff I have bought for the past five years at department stores.</li>
            <li> I used the sample, everyone complimented me right away.</li>
            <li> Klein is right on for this scent.  </li>
            <li> The eau de toilette is a bit less strong, which is fine, because it&#x27;s a strong scent to begin with.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift for a special daughter in law that REALLY deserves it.</li>
            <li> Shipping reasonable and quick.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a sexy new scent.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and sort of musty and sophisticated but not tooo sophisticated if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> got many compliments of men liking this fragrance totally buying again</li>
            <li> So-I ordered it the fragrance does not last for more than an hour, if that.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be different.</li>
            <li> I am definitely purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I first found this scent as a sample when I ordered some makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> This price was much better than our local walmart&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> Hope there&#x27;s more like this in the future for me to buy!</li>
            <li> I went to the mall during the Christmas season and this was priced higher</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying Ck.</li>
            <li> This is the only spicier frangrance that I love.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought this perfume for me as a birthday present because he knew that&#x27;s my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> It has the crisp smell of a woman who is in control and yet feminine.  </li>
            <li> The presentation is cute and smells soft, young and delicated.</li>
            <li> The bottle is bigger than I expected and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I would certainly consider buying this again</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and very well packed so no worries with breakage during shipping.</li>
            <li> It was better than I expected.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an unusual &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; smell that attracts people to it.  </li>
            <li> I really did not like this perfume....</li>
            <li> Such a lovely scent...not too heavy, not too sweet.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are a fan of Calvin Klein, not cloying.</li>
            <li> This not only smells good it last for a very long time too!</li>
            <li> for lovers of classic calvin klein I think that makes fragrances that you could live a lifetime, this is one of theses</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and I purchased it for less than what I paid for it at the department store!</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last like an original would last.</li>
            <li> Its little strong..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad different per se, just different.</li>
            <li> giant bottle great smell nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> So I never actually smelt the real perfume</li>
            <li> Do not waste you time and money on this item</li>
            <li> Complete waist of my money.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is classy but not floral or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The scent smells like it is old, maybe expired .</li>
            <li> The product looks legitimate but maybe my taste has changed since I last wore it because I don&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
            <li> Now I feel that it doesn&#x27;t even get to the &amp;#34;settled&amp;#34; point before it vanishes completely.  </li>
            <li> This is a very sophisticated casual smell for those who dont like flowery smelling perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I wasn&#x27;t aware of the difference between \\&quot;Eau de parfum\\&quot; and \\&quot;Eau de toilette\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t take long enough for me to discover that this product was an imitation of the original.</li>
            <li> The price was much cheaper on other fragrance websites and the package arrived on time.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance,itself,did not last for very long.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t last very long for me</li>
            <li> For an Eau De Toilette it lasts a long time and wears well.</li>
            <li> Fragnance lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> This EDT is much better and less expensive than a couple of regular EDPs I bought few months back.</li>
            <li> I wear it every day and it lingers on clothes for a long time!</li>
            <li> I used to wear Euphoria daily, but I stopped because I refused to pay $60+ for a tiny little bottle of perfume.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was $10 cheaper than the dark purple boxes that supposedly had the same perfume in them.</li>
            <li> But this smells different than the previous bottle I owned.</li>
            <li> Not sure why multiple listings for one product would yield such varying results!</li>
            <li> It only takes a little and the smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and received packages just as one would purchase from a retail store.</li>
            <li> This is an imitation.  </li>
            <li> It was half  All the dept. stores.</li>
            <li> and I found it less costly than at the department stores.</li>
            <li> any other I ever worn!!  </li>
            <li> Ordered here to save a few bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;it lasts for longer than usual Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li> No more to say. . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Not to sound boring</li>
            <li> As stated, the shipment was about two days late</li>
            <li> When he told me how much he had paid, I was doubtful about it</li>
            <li> This is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very disappointment fro this product!</li>
            <li> figure...stuck with wrong perfume set.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s wayyyy too expensive in department stores.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with it</li>
            <li> Very,very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> bought this for my mom for her birthday. she loved it.</li>
            <li> Great buy/great product.  I read some reviews that said this was not the same as what they had smelled in the store- keep in mind an Eau de Toilette does not have as strong of a concentration as an Eau de Parfam.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this cologne.  There doesn&#x27;t a day go by without someone asking me what I am wearing or complimenting me on my cologne.  Euphoria is the absolute best!</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  The same size bottle at a retailer was around  $80. Saw this on Amazon for under $37, I jumped on it.  Glad I did.  Would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. I don&#x27;t know how to describe it but it feels euphoric :-) it&#x27;s a good size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> This perfume is good but doesn&#x27;t last for more than 3hrs. I recommend other people to buy it good product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see or smelt it, but the one I sent it to seemed to be very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This perfume is wonderful!  This is my 5th bottle over the years.  I will continue to wear it (even my teen daughters borrow it from time to time). I get compliments everywhere I go, including one man who bought it for his girlfriend because he liked it so much :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume-I get compliments every time I wear it. I highly recommend it.  You will love it too.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance..........It&#x27;s 24.00 cheaper on Amazon....Euphoria by Calvin Klein for Women Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4 Ounce....I paid 69.00 now I find it for 45.00 I should always know to check amazon first!~</li>
            <li> wasnt the one i wanted when i ordered but smelled so good i ended up loving this perfume !! got many compliments of men liking this fragrance totally buying again</li>
            <li> Big bottle at great price.  Everything was as promised.  Much bigger bottle than I got at the store last year for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Such a lovely scent...not too heavy, not too sweet. Great scent for every day or a special evening out! Love it!</li>
            <li> giant bottle great smell nothing wrong with it exactly what we wanted smells great cool bottle shape and pretty pink color</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for Christmas. It was half  All the dept. stores. Excellent value and product. Received quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Smells WONDERFUL, and I cant believe I found it on Amazon for such a Great Price! Shipping was fast and very well packed so no worries with breakage during shipping. I&#x27;m very happy and I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I had tested this in a department store and loved it. So-I ordered it the fragrance does not last for more than an hour, if that. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So Great!!!! I ordered this and it was here the next day. I got free shipping, so it was pretty sweet. The bottle is bigger than I expected and smells AMAZING! I smelt it in a fold-out in Elle Magazine and three minutes later, I bought it here. So I never actually smelt the real perfume so I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be different. It was better than I expected. For an Eau De Toilette it lasts a long time and wears well. It gets better over the course of the day, smelling like warm floral vanilla-ish as time goes on. I am very satisfied! My fiance will love it. I&#x27;m 21 and I don&#x27;t like strong scents. This is soft and feminine, while being timeless and sexy. Just perfect.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law recommended this perfume so I ordered it and I Love it!!! It smells so good on her I had to try it.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne for women.  I&#x27;ve gotten alot of compliments on how nice it smells on me.  I am definitely purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is an imitation.  The bottle and stand are correct,however,their outside coloring is different from what you buy in department stores or fragrance.net.  The fragrance,itself,did not last for very long.  Very,very disappointing.  Do not waste you time and money on this item</li>
            <li> I was worried that the fragrance would not smell like the stuff I usually get at Macys for a much higher price but it was the same! Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  It has a very nice but, sexy scent.  I have used this perfume now for about 6 yrs.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and I purchased it for less than what I paid for it at the department store!</li>
            <li> brought it for mom cause she has been obsessing over it so i got it and she liked it, even i did too, wears it all the time! Has a nice soft smell to it no too strong, considering i don&#x27;t like perfumes but this one is nice</li>
            <li> Complete waist of my money. This is a rip-off. Do not buy it. I ordered this women&#x27;s perfume but when I got my package it was a completely different item and also it smells like men&#x27;s cologne. I do not know what to do with it now. So just go to Macy&#x27;s if you don&#x27;t want to get ripped off. I learnt my lesson.</li>
            <li> I love the scent but have to use a lot more than  I used with the sample in order to notice the smell.&lt;br /&gt;When I used the sample, everyone complimented me right away.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for Mother&#x27;s day. It was delivered as promised. My wife has this perfume and we wanted to gift the same to her mother. It sure brought a lot of smile on her face this morning.</li>
            <li> This was the real thing and got at a great price.  I&#x27;m sure you already know the smell if ordering online, but the smell is pleasant as well.  Exactly as expected and received packages just as one would purchase from a retail store.</li>
            <li> I first found this scent as a sample when I ordered some makeup brushes. I immediately fell in love with it. This price was much better than our local walmart&#x27;s price. Shipped on time and is a nice sized bottle. The scent did not seem as strong, but it&#x27;s definitely the one I love! I wear it every day and it lingers on clothes for a long time!</li>
            <li> Great perfume! My favorite! Great price, packed nicely, and arrived fast! Hope there&#x27;s more like this in the future for me to buy!</li>
            <li> I was familiar with the scent before I purchased, so I knew what I was getting. The eau de toilette is a bit less strong, which is fine, because it&#x27;s a strong scent to begin with. It arrived on time, and was a very good price. I would order again - unless I change my perfume tastes!</li>
            <li> it is a good service, do understand the customer needs when we require more service more than the item. thanks</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend and it smells so good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice bottle. The bottle comes in a box and my wife likes it. So that&#x27;s what I bought.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Just what I expected at a great price!</li>
            <li> My daughter asks for this every Christmas, it is her &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent.  I get it for her every year and once again it was a favorite gift.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as expect and even sooner than the original quoted time. I&#x27;ve loved this perfume for years, but have never been able to afford it. Was surprised and excited to find it so cheap through this company. I&#x27;m definitely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love perfumes I am very picking. This not only smells good it last for a very long time too!</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I wear this cologne... it&#x27;s wonderful, light and refreshing.  Perfect for any season of the year</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was $10 cheaper than the dark purple boxes that supposedly had the same perfume in them. But this smells different than the previous bottle I owned. It&#x27;s not a bad different per se, just different. Not sure why multiple listings for one product would yield such varying results!</li>
            <li> very nice perfume...&lt;br /&gt;I love wearing it. Got lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;it lasts for longer than usual Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li> The only scent I wear.</li>
            <li> Floral and woody. My boyfriend calls it a &#x27;sexy hippy scent&#x27;. It&#x27;s my go-to smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the way this fragrance smells on me but I will say that it does disappear on me by lunch time.&lt;br /&gt;I will just have to get a stronger version next time!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love all of the Euphoria scents! They are all absolutely fresh, clean and intense in their own unique way.</li>
            <li> Good value for money. Fragnance lingers for a long time. Not too overwhelming.Good gift to someone special.Been using for almost a year.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a christmas gift for my sister in law. She loves it. Found this at a great price and it came in time too.</li>
            <li> I thought the price point on this size bottle was an exceptional value!! I am already enjoying it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> Its little strong..i loved it..so nice looking bottle..best smell for party..using it pretty much everyday..stay for long time.overall awesome..:) :)</li>
            <li> I went to the mall during the Christmas season and this was priced higher but I waited to see if I could find online.  I&#x27;m so glad I waited because I got a better price.</li>
            <li> Bought this a gift for my Mom.  The fragrance is classy but not floral or overpowering.  It&#x27;s an unusual &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; smell that attracts people to it.  She gets lots of compliments on it and has become her favorite parfum.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for all women.  They won&#x27;t be disappointed.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying Ck.And I brought it because someone told me that it would smell good on me.I have never did that but I&#x27;m glad I did.I have never got so many comments....Try it!!!</li>
            <li> Euphoria is an all time favorite and amazon has the best price .&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a gift for my mother and mother in law and they absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t last very long for me but then it depends on every individual i guess.</li>
            <li> My sister in law loved it</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and sort of musty and sophisticated but not tooo sophisticated if you know what I mean. Really big bottle for the price. Came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This scent is wonderful for me, flowery without being cloying and clean-smelling as well.  I ordered it because I got a flyer from Macy&#x27;s and loved the scent.  Ordered here to save a few bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calvin Klein is right on for this scent.  Shipping reasonable and quick.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on this perfume then any other I ever worn!!  I will use it forever  and hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would buy this type of spray, but this Eau De Toilette Spray is so very nice.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great price for this large bottle.  This is a very sophisticated casual smell for those who dont like flowery smelling perfumes.  It only takes a little and the smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scent - soft, alluring, musky with a touch of sweetness. Received this in a sample size from a friend and loved it so much I ordered the full size. Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a sexy new scent.</li>
            <li> Not to sound boring but Ive bought this spray for my wife two years in a row!!  She loves the scent and so do I what can I say!</li>
            <li> I love my Euphoria, i get alot of compliments everywhere I go. This is the perfume I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance for women.</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments by sexes but my son says its too musky. But I love the smell and it&#x27;s a soft scent.</li>
            <li> for lovers of classic calvin klein I think that makes fragrances that you could live a lifetime, this is one of theses</li>
            <li> The scent smells like it is old, maybe expired .</li>
            <li> Although it was sent to me now I can&#x27;t return because it is now apparently hazardous material.  Go figure...stuck with wrong perfume set.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift for a special daughter in law that REALLY deserves it. She just loves this fragrance!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Great price and delivery. This is the only spicier frangrance that I love.  I has the perfect balance.  Smells great, can wear to work or on a date.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume, it is delicious and beautiful. The presentation is cute and smells soft, young and delicated. i recommend it</li>
            <li> My husband bought this perfume for me as a birthday present because he knew that&#x27;s my favorite perfume. When he told me how much he had paid, I was doubtful about it but he said he bought it from Amazon. Well, it didn&#x27;t take long enough for me to discover that this product was an imitation of the original. The scent doesn&#x27;t last like an original would last. Also, the package and the container was not looking like the original neither. Overall, I&#x27;m very disappointment fro this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I&#x27;ve always wanted this perfume but it&#x27;s wayyyy too expensive in department stores.  I&#x27;m so glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> My suggestion to you is go to Sephora a smell it your darn self. Its a nice scent but its not my style. I will wear it till it runs out. but wont be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I love the price for it was very reasonable. It came on time. I didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall and fight with the holiday shoppers!</li>
            <li> I knew that I wanted Eau De Toilette.  As stated, the shipment was about two days late and since I was notified when I bought this spray, I was not disappointed.  Very nice odor.  Bought for my wife&#x27;s birthday and she is happy, happy.  The container and bottle are designed attractively and packaged safely.  It has the crisp smell of a woman who is in control and yet feminine.  I like.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and I found it less costly than at the department stores. I would this product again</li>
            <li> mi madre adora el perfume, excelente producto, tiene un olor muy agradable.. llego en el tiempo indicado muchas gracias.. muy chevere</li>
            <li> This EDT is much better and less expensive than a couple of regular EDPs I bought few months back. Heavenly smell!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! and got it at a great price.</li>
            <li> Smells so sexy. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love my Euphoria, it&#x27;s nice summer parfume, very elegant.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this people tell me I smell amazing, it is that good. Highly recommend if you are a fan of Calvin Klein, not cloying.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Euphoria daily, but I stopped because I refused to pay $60+ for a tiny little bottle of perfume.  When I found it for this cheap I thought it was probably too good to be true.  The product looks legitimate but maybe my taste has changed since I last wore it because I don&#x27;t like it as much.  It used to be kind of harsh when you first sprayed it, but once it settled, it was the perfect.  Now I feel that it doesn&#x27;t even get to the &amp;#34;settled&amp;#34; point before it vanishes completely.  I&#x27;ve tried spraying only my skin, only clothes, and a combination of both, but it&#x27;s gone within an hour.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift for my sister, who have very specific sensibilities. She absolutely loved it. I would certainly consider buying this again</li>
            <li> This is a great scent!!  I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> the wife loves it.....nuff said</li>
            <li> excellent choise. Great fragance for woman. i recomend it. No more to say. . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> MMMMMMM!  The perfect Men&#x27;s fragrance!  I&#x27;m constantly asked what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing!  Works almost as well as a \\&quot;cute puppy on a leash\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Got this as a surprise for my wife - and she totally swooned over it.  The price was much cheaper on other fragrance websites and the package arrived on time.  Would definitely recommend it for anyone on the lookout for a good perfume for their better halves.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x60;t like the smell don&#x27;t know why, but it turn out to be that my mom just loved the smell and because she dosn&#x60;t accept every smell because she got like allergy on strong smells. So because my mom loved the smell im satisfy with the spray. shipping was awesome and handling was great, so if anyone is worried about it breaking down don&#x27;t worry it&#x60;s safe.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling perfume by C.K. It is very seductive and sexy smelling, I get tons of compliments when I wear it, love it!!</li>
            <li> I have always bought Euphoria at the store, but was hoping to find a better deal online. This is a good deal, and it does still smell good, but it is NOT the same as the stuff I have bought for the past five years at department stores. Extremely disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I wasn&#x27;t aware of the difference between \\&quot;Eau de parfum\\&quot; and \\&quot;Eau de toilette\\&quot;. This is the latter, I was looking for the former.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend has been wearing this perfume for the past year, and i got a say, it smells very good. you can&#x27;t go wrong with it so i recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> I really did not like this perfume....It was a nice big bottle for a good price, just not my style....I sold it to someone who loved it....</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, happy with product and seller service</li>
            <li> Great smell! Always get compliments.</li>
            <li> Smells good on the back of my wifes&#x27; neck!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas Present for my wife. She loved it, I did good!! It is light not over powering.</li>
