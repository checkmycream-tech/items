            <li>Arrived super fast and really good quality.</li>
            <li>The bowl is sturdy and easy to clean, and the brushes make applying product easy.</li>
            <li>They are too cheap and ineffective.</li>
            <li>The brushes are a bit cheap on quality, but for the price, they are acceptable.</li>
            <li>I primarily needed the bowl to mix my henna in.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a kit that had everything I needed for at home coloring and this seemed to fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>It is convenient, and at first i thought it should have a better handle, but i changed my mind.  </li>
            <li>but it rinses completely clean.</li>
            <li>The mixing bowl worked just fine, as you really cannot screw that up.</li>
            <li>The big one is good for dying large sections.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its good.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to clean love that it is black.</li>
            <li>This stuff is not flimsy cheap containers its strong and is not affected by the bleach powder and developer I used several times in it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend paying a little more and getting a better product.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping to Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Some bristles are not cut properly, but great product overall</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>For the price I was able to go to an outlet beauty supply store and found the same items.</li>
            <li>This product is very practical and useful.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it because it was not expensive.</li>
            <li>Perfect set for maintaining difficult hair colors in between salon appointments.</li>
            <li>I was beginning an at home ombre treatment, and these were exactly the tools that I needed to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>The items are exactly as described and I have used them already.  </li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent set for coloring hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re mixing your dyes and developer yourself, this will help SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a decent quality.  </li>
            <li>The packaging looked like it was made by 90&#x27;s high schoolers, but this just goes to show that you can&#x27;t judge a book by its cover.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient little set of brushes, the bowl holds more than enough dye for a whole head of hair.</li>
            <li>This allowed for more precise application with less mess.</li>
            <li>The little one is good for mixing and sharp corners.</li>
            <li>The bowl is fine, you can&#x27;t mess up a bowl, but the brushes are ineffective.</li>
            <li>The brush attached to the combo is a bit too stiff, but the other brushes are good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get my hair professionally dyed because it can get pricey.</li>
            <li>Only thing is I can&#x27;t really see the numbers in the mixing cup.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy, and the bowl is plenty big enough for mixing colours and developers in, and the little extra lip to hold on to it came in handy.  </li>
            <li>The bowl leaked hair color all over my counter top... not good.</li>
            <li>and this makes it difficult to get enough dye on the brush to effectively put enough dye on each section.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> came packaged well but the brush just felt really stiff and plastic like that i couldn&#x27;t use it on my hair because i wouldn&#x27;t actually apply the dye to my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes hair coloring easier</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.  Just what I wanted to mix and distribute hair dye. Worked great.</li>
            <li> Great tools.  Beats using the squirt bottles that come with drugstore brand hair coloring.  This allowed for more precise application with less mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this product just so I could do a salon style coloring at home. It is a nice size. It seems sturdy as well. Great purchased.</li>
            <li> A real great value for your money! Arrived super fast and really good quality. The bowl is not flimsy, but steady the black color is A++++</li>
            <li> This thing is great. I don&#x27;t get my hair professionally dyed because it can get pricey. But using this kit, I got every part of my hair dyed! It took a little longer than usual, but of course totally worth it.</li>
            <li> i dont have to scrub forever to  get bleach out of these brushes. the bristles dont get all ratchet for a while so they last longer.</li>
            <li> For the price I was able to go to an outlet beauty supply store and found the same items. I&#x27;ll keep these and they work as expected.</li>
            <li> This product is very practical and useful.  The bowl is sturdy and easy to clean, and the brushes make applying product easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. washes well, for the next use. You could also use this product to apply perms. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received the hair dying kit on time.  It seems to be a decent quality.  It works well to dye my hair and I recommend it because it was not expensive.</li>
            <li> The mixing bowl worked just fine, as you really cannot screw that up. However, the brushes are very stiff and have shed quite a bit, and are hard to use. Would recommend ordering a different set.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not flimsy cheap containers its strong and is not affected by the bleach powder and developer I used several times in it.</li>
            <li> Perfect..good enough for home use. Will buy from again. Super fast shipping to Hawaii. Great gift for sister and good friends who does home coloring.</li>
            <li> Everything works well. Only thing is I can&#x27;t really see the numbers in the mixing cup. Other than that, its good.</li>
            <li> Not cheap and flimsy. Looks like the picture. The bowl has always been big enough to mix enough for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Okay quality brushes.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was glad to have the special tools for dyeing my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great! Some bristles are not cut properly, but great product overall</li>
            <li> Back of package states: &amp;#34;This product contains lead and other harmful ingredients known in the state of California to cause cancer, or birth defects, or other reproductive harm.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This set has been serving me well for a year. The variety of brushes help dying. The little one is good for mixing and sharp corners. The big one is good for dying large sections. The one with the comb helps with highlights and streaks of color. If you&#x27;re mixing your dyes and developer yourself, this will help SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> The bowl and brushes work fine for my purposes.  The brush attached to the combo is a bit too stiff, but the other brushes are good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the bowl doesn&#x27;t stain but it rinses completely clean. Perfect set for maintaining difficult hair colors in between salon appointments.</li>
            <li> The bowl is fine, you can&#x27;t mess up a bowl, but the brushes are ineffective. The brushes are not good at picking up hair dye, The sections are far apart and this makes it difficult to get enough dye on the brush to effectively put enough dye on each section. I had to continuously try to scoop more dye on the brush. All of the brushes had the same problem. They are too cheap and ineffective.I finally just used gloved hands to scoop the hair dye and apply it. I would recommend paying a little more and getting a better product.</li>
            <li> handle on one of the brushes broke just looking at it.  I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Easy to use, Great tools</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent set for coloring hair. I use it for at home blonding. Only complaint is I wish the bristles weren&#x27;t so stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  The brushes are a bit cheap on quality, but for the price, they are acceptable.</li>
            <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;does the work&lt;br /&gt;I m not sure about the tools but I use the bowl... I use one of the tools just to mix my product.</li>
            <li> I primarily needed the bowl to mix my henna in. The end result, not deep enough. Lesson learned,  The accessory brushes are okay That&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> I was beginning an at home ombre treatment, and these were exactly the tools that I needed to get the job done.  They are sturdy, and the bowl is plenty big enough for mixing colours and developers in, and the little extra lip to hold on to it came in handy.  The packaging looked like it was made by 90&#x27;s high schoolers, but this just goes to show that you can&#x27;t judge a book by its cover.  They really were pretty great quality</li>
            <li> Very convenient little set of brushes, the bowl holds more than enough dye for a whole head of hair.</li>
            <li> Quality is good and strong for doing your hair at home. Strong plastic and combs are quality.  It is convenient, and at first i thought it should have a better handle, but i changed my mind.  I used to have one that had a handle that my finger or gloves would get stuck in and I&#x27;d spill the dye. No, this is easy and convenient. I&#x27;m satisfied.  Great choice of various combs/brushes and the price is definitely fair.</li>
            <li> The bowl leaked hair color all over my counter top... not good.</li>
            <li> always wanted these. never can find them in the store.</li>
            <li> I have used the bowl twice and it was easy to clean love that it is black.</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes and the bowl does have measures</li>
            <li> Great service, awesome delivery and the items were exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I was looking for a kit that had everything I needed for at home coloring and this seemed to fit the bill.  The order arrived within a few days and was well packaged.  The items are exactly as described and I have used them already.  I like them a lot.  The price was great and overall was a great transaction.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and does what it is suppose to do.</li>
