            <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>This one has been the most effective!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended that I use it on Wednesdays (just once a week) and it keeps my scalp healthy!  </li>
            <li>I asked him how he liked it.  </li>
            <li>Works great and leave your scalp feeling clean and not irritated.</li>
            <li>I counteract that by using Redken Body Full Conditioner, which works great for restoring the moisture I lose.</li>
            <li>It has a good smell that is not too strong and overbearing.  </li>
            <li>I have literally tried dozens of dandruff shampoos and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more this weekend.  </li>
            <li>After reading rviews for the many options, I chose this Redken option.  </li>
            <li>It helps my itchy scalp and keeps me flake free!</li>
            <li>Works way better than walmart brand dandruff shampoos</li>
            <li>A reviewer below noted that it has a medicine-ey smell to it, but to me it was more minty and felt refreshing.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions on the bottle and let the shampoo stay in the hair five minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li>this shampoo smells awesome compared to regular dandruff shampoos which often have a tar like stink.</li>
            <li>okay, foams up well.</li>
            <li>I love the mint smell, as well.</li>
            <li>so I sometimes have to use more.</li>
            <li>It puts the softness back in and leaves my hair smelling delicious!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo</li>
            <li>I think I would have been better off saving my cash and buying head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use conditioner afterward, though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li>This product seems aimed more at women.</li>
            <li>but after some sleuthing around, I was able to find this product from Redken, which is basically the women&#x27;s or unisex version of the Retaliate.  </li>
            <li>A couple years ago my friend suggested this shampoo and it works much better than dandruff shampoos you find at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>and I kind of like the way it gives your scalp cool tingle, not going to lie.</li>
            <li>Best Dry Scalp Shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Dandruff persists, and price is higher than more effective lower cost options</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong stuff-</li>
            <li>This product does what it is supposed to, however I had to dock one star since it has a strong chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost as effective -- and much safer!</li>
            <li>Works fine for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li>This helps with my itchy scalp lesion my hair nice and clean no residue good for my colored hair the color last longer</li>
            <li>The shampoo is my only help for dandruff; the service was great</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo for anyone that has an itchy or flaky scalp - I have been using it for years and it totally controls the problems</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;ve noticed that my scalp is dandruff free all of the time.</li>
            <li>Plus my scalp is flake free</li>
            <li>I wish dandruff shampoo had a nice scent, but they all smell very minty.</li>
            <li>My daughter used it and she was dandruff free within a week.  </li>
            <li>Very cost effective.  </li>
            <li>It does the same great job.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money to me!</li>
            <li>How excited can one be about dandruff shampoo?</li>
            <li>My hair dresser originally turned me onto Redken&#x27;s Retaliate shampoo for Men that did wonders for dandruff.  </li>
            <li>now its been two days since I washed it and my hair looks and feels so clean,</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean because it leaves a chalky residue.  </li>
            <li>The Redken shampoo and conditioner helped with the flakiness and kept my hair soft and nice looking.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that a lot of the negative reviews are because it is just as effective as Head and Shoulders, which is a fair assessment when it comes to dandruff.</li>
            <li>I researched many including Paul Mitchell and this was highly rated.  </li>
            <li>Good product for itchy scalp and minor flaking.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good shampoo to combat dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>where most other anti dandruff or light clarifying shampoo&#x27;s cause irritation and heavier moisturizing shampoo&#x27;s are too heavy - this one works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no fake reviewer either!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the higher price!</li>
            <li>but I think you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders was not cutting it, so we tried Redken.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend following the directions because it isn&#x27;t as effective when I rinse it out before the 5 minutes is up.</li>
            <li>It is pricy but worth it to put an end to dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the good reviews (and I use a lot of other Redken products) &amp; it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t lived up to the other reviews... to be fair</li>
            <li>Good product other than that.</li>
            <li>My wife has a severe dandruff problem and this product helped right away.</li>
            <li>I used it with my normal All Soft conditioner which kind of masked the smell.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight scent but its pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger on my hair.</li>
            <li>I occasionally make the mistake of trying something new and it never works as good as this shampoo does.</li>
            <li>not that great, just get head and shoulders, kind of stinks</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>It feels nice in your hair too, not much to the smell.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work the first use, but stopped working after that.</li>
            <li>Even better reason to use it occasionally.</li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have pretty unruly hairs, so I think I am justifiably a bit of a hair products snob.</li>
            <li>have used it twice and follow each shampoo with a home hot oil treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I AM COMPLETELY DANDRUFF FREE AFTER ABOUT SIX MONTHS USE AND</li>
            <li>This absolutely helps my itchy scalp!</li>
            <li>i lather it on my roots when I first get in the shower, and rinse it off</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for it surprises me that salons don&#x27;t carry this anymore.</li>
            <li>We have tried many products and this is the first that actually worked.</li>
            <li>But seeing as how in California we are having the driest winter ever recorded, my dry scalp has been getting even more itchy and noticeable; so I felt it was time to admit to myself that I have dandruff.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I plan on using it for a long time!!</li>
            <li>Really keeps the flakes away.</li>
            <li>Fast service, and item was just as described.</li>
            <li>REALLY wish you could get a conditioner to go with this.</li>
            <li>It makes it feel like its working and its very soothing to an irritated scalp..</li>
            <li>The shampoo works very well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything?</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well..  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really lather as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>very nice&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li>works very well to treat my dandruff</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Would definitely be good for a person with thick scratchy hair.</li>
            <li>Redken does not mean trust it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products:</li>
            <li>I had to go back to Head and Shoulders which does let my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>I actually use this in conjunction with the Redken&#x27;s Mint Clean shampoo.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many shampoos to help my scalp problem, including shampoos from well known lines like American Crew, Paul Mitchell, Pantene, and so forth-but somehow, only the Redken dandruff control scalp relief worked</li>
            <li>initial use is all I&#x27;ve used for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li>With the other brand, I am flake free in about a week.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin around my hairline and have used many different types of dandruff shampoos, with the same or even higher zinc %age.  </li>
            <li>i have very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other shampoos this one actually works.</li>
            <li>I have used Redken products in the past and just stumbled onto this dandruff shampoo after many unsuccessful attempts to control scalp problem.  </li>
            <li>This worked the first time I used it and it doesn&#x27;t strip all the red color out of my hair!</li>
            <li>When I had short hair, I used products like H&amp;S or Selsun Blue, which was fine because my hair was very short.</li>
            <li>I AM SEVENTY THREE YEARS OLD AND HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH DANDRUFF ALL OF MY ADULT LIFE.  </li>
            <li>it makes your hair soft too.</li>
            <li>when im done washing the rest of me, and it has completely fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do 5stars only because it does not lather very well</li>
            <li>to herbaliz natural shampoo instead</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo that worked for the long term for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner in my hair when it is still wet, right before I comb my hair.</li>
            <li>As long as you follow the directions for leaving it on for 5 minutes before rinsing, this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li>Ehhh it&#x27;s only decent because it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair color, but i haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement in scalp health or dandruff in general.</li>
            <li>the other dandruff shampoo that works better allow me to leave to wash it out almost immediately and thus take less time to use.</li>
            <li>I only have mild dandruff, so I have been using it every other wash, so every 4 days, and it has helped with itching.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far, but I trust from the reviewers below that my dandruff will soon completely go away (the itchiness has already stopped).</li>
            <li>There is no other brand that would do the job for my scalp.</li>
            <li>price&#x27;s higher than other shampoos, yes,</li>
            <li>but I never noticed any major improvement with scalp issues.</li>
            <li>not only faster but the effects last a decent time for her case.</li>
            <li>This is probably the only Amazon review I have written in the past year so do not take it lightly when I say how well this stuff works.</li>
            <li>After I got this I was completely cured from dandruff after the second day of using it.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has completely made my scalp stop flaking and itching.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t use it frequently the dandruff may come back.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive, too.</li>
            <li>My wife has commented on how much healthier my hair looks than when I used the other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve battled with dandruff my entire adult life-10 years now-and have tried numerous shampoos, home remedies, etc.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that this works as well as some other, much cheaper brands I have tried (specifically one that comes in a blue bottle).</li>
            <li>I hesitate to use most of the standard shampoos because of the amount of detergents and other ingredients that are hard on my hair.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, it would start coming back after a few days</li>
            <li>I have very long and thick hair and use about 2 teaspoons, it leaves my hair feeling funny, so I recommend following it off with the Redken Smooth Down Butter Treat for dry and unruly hair.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me, although it does dry my hair out, but not nearly as much the above products.</li>

            <li> but now I&#x27;ve noticed that my scalp is dandruff free all of the time.</li>
            <li> Plus my scalp is flake free</li>
            <li> I wish dandruff shampoo had a nice scent, but they all smell very minty.</li>
            <li> My daughter used it and she was dandruff free within a week.  </li>
            <li> Very cost effective.  </li>
            <li> It does the same great job.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money to me!</li>
            <li> How excited can one be about dandruff shampoo?</li>
            <li> My hair dresser originally turned me onto Redken&#x27;s Retaliate shampoo for Men that did wonders for dandruff.  </li>
            <li> now its been two days since I washed it and my hair looks and feels so clean,</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean because it leaves a chalky residue.  </li>
            <li> The Redken shampoo and conditioner helped with the flakiness and kept my hair soft and nice looking.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that a lot of the negative reviews are because it is just as effective as Head and Shoulders, which is a fair assessment when it comes to dandruff.</li>
            <li> I researched many including Paul Mitchell and this was highly rated.  </li>
            <li> Good product for itchy scalp and minor flaking.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good shampoo to combat dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> where most other anti dandruff or light clarifying shampoo&#x27;s cause irritation and heavier moisturizing shampoo&#x27;s are too heavy - this one works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no fake reviewer either!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the higher price!</li>
            <li> but I think you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders was not cutting it, so we tried Redken.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend following the directions because it isn&#x27;t as effective when I rinse it out before the 5 minutes is up.</li>
            <li> It is pricy but worth it to put an end to dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews (and I use a lot of other Redken products) &amp; it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t lived up to the other reviews... to be fair</li>
            <li> Good product other than that.</li>
            <li> My wife has a severe dandruff problem and this product helped right away.</li>
            <li> I used it with my normal All Soft conditioner which kind of masked the smell.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight scent but its pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger on my hair.</li>
            <li> I occasionally make the mistake of trying something new and it never works as good as this shampoo does.</li>
            <li> not that great, just get head and shoulders, kind of stinks</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> It feels nice in your hair too, not much to the smell.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work the first use, but stopped working after that.</li>
            <li> Even better reason to use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> My hair was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have pretty unruly hairs, so I think I am justifiably a bit of a hair products snob.</li>
            <li> have used it twice and follow each shampoo with a home hot oil treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I AM COMPLETELY DANDRUFF FREE AFTER ABOUT SIX MONTHS USE AND</li>
            <li> This absolutely helps my itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> i lather it on my roots when I first get in the shower, and rinse it off</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for it surprises me that salons don&#x27;t carry this anymore.</li>
            <li> We have tried many products and this is the first that actually worked.</li>
            <li> But seeing as how in California we are having the driest winter ever recorded, my dry scalp has been getting even more itchy and noticeable; so I felt it was time to admit to myself that I have dandruff.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I plan on using it for a long time!!</li>
            <li> Really keeps the flakes away.</li>
            <li> Fast service, and item was just as described.</li>
            <li> REALLY wish you could get a conditioner to go with this.</li>
            <li> It makes it feel like its working and its very soothing to an irritated scalp..</li>
            <li> The shampoo works very well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything?</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well..  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really lather as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> very nice&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li> works very well to treat my dandruff</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Would definitely be good for a person with thick scratchy hair.</li>
            <li> Redken does not mean trust it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products:</li>
            <li> I had to go back to Head and Shoulders which does let my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> I actually use this in conjunction with the Redken&#x27;s Mint Clean shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shampoos to help my scalp problem, including shampoos from well known lines like American Crew, Paul Mitchell, Pantene, and so forth-but somehow, only the Redken dandruff control scalp relief worked</li>
            <li> initial use is all I&#x27;ve used for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li> With the other brand, I am flake free in about a week.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin around my hairline and have used many different types of dandruff shampoos, with the same or even higher zinc %age.  </li>
            <li> i have very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other shampoos this one actually works.</li>
            <li> I have used Redken products in the past and just stumbled onto this dandruff shampoo after many unsuccessful attempts to control scalp problem.  </li>
            <li> This worked the first time I used it and it doesn&#x27;t strip all the red color out of my hair!</li>
            <li> When I had short hair, I used products like H&amp;S or Selsun Blue, which was fine because my hair was very short.</li>
            <li> I AM SEVENTY THREE YEARS OLD AND HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH DANDRUFF ALL OF MY ADULT LIFE.  </li>
            <li> it makes your hair soft too.</li>
            <li> when im done washing the rest of me, and it has completely fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do 5stars only because it does not lather very well</li>
            <li> to herbaliz natural shampoo instead</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo that worked for the long term for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner in my hair when it is still wet, right before I comb my hair.</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions for leaving it on for 5 minutes before rinsing, this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> Ehhh it&#x27;s only decent because it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair color, but i haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement in scalp health or dandruff in general.</li>
            <li> the other dandruff shampoo that works better allow me to leave to wash it out almost immediately and thus take less time to use.</li>
            <li> I only have mild dandruff, so I have been using it every other wash, so every 4 days, and it has helped with itching.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far, but I trust from the reviewers below that my dandruff will soon completely go away (the itchiness has already stopped).</li>
            <li> There is no other brand that would do the job for my scalp.</li>
            <li> price&#x27;s higher than other shampoos, yes,</li>
            <li> but I never noticed any major improvement with scalp issues.</li>
            <li> not only faster but the effects last a decent time for her case.</li>
            <li> This is probably the only Amazon review I have written in the past year so do not take it lightly when I say how well this stuff works.</li>
            <li> After I got this I was completely cured from dandruff after the second day of using it.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has completely made my scalp stop flaking and itching.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t use it frequently the dandruff may come back.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive, too.</li>
            <li> My wife has commented on how much healthier my hair looks than when I used the other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with dandruff my entire adult life-10 years now-and have tried numerous shampoos, home remedies, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that this works as well as some other, much cheaper brands I have tried (specifically one that comes in a blue bottle).</li>
            <li> I hesitate to use most of the standard shampoos because of the amount of detergents and other ingredients that are hard on my hair.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, it would start coming back after a few days</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair and use about 2 teaspoons, it leaves my hair feeling funny, so I recommend following it off with the Redken Smooth Down Butter Treat for dry and unruly hair.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me, although it does dry my hair out, but not nearly as much the above products.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not nervous wearing black or having people mess with my hair for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> Before I start my review, I want to say that I am a middle aged male with long straight hair that goes down to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> I know it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but doesn&#x27;t keep it away long enough for the price of the shampoo</li>
            <li> That said, i had to make a couple of concessions to use this shampoo: (1) it smells like a dandruff shampoo--medicine-y; (2) to get good results</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, but I only need a teaspoon&#x27;s worth of this shampoo to keep my head/scalp hydrated and not snowing flakes</li>
            <li> I tried all the typical ones like selsun, head and shoulders, and even an all natural tea tree oil shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The only dandruff shampoo that soothes my dry and itchy scalp in the winter.</li>
            <li> When pregnant, my dandruff is 5 times worse for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> no white flakes on my hair, no oil or dry scalp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only gotten dandruff back when I stopped using this stuff and used some other dandruff-relief shampoo.</li>
            <li> No more itching or flaking, and no weird smell like some other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very flowery smelling and leaves my hair a little softer than I wanted with everyday use, so, I alternate, using it maybe once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Appears to control any and all dandruff for long term.</li>
            <li> The printing on the label is of very low quality and does not resemble the labels on Redken&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> I completely dry out.</li>
            <li> Living in the dry desert heat added to the dandruff problem.</li>
            <li> My scalp had become dry and flaky, so I was faced with having to buy dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this because my scalp gets dry when I use dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Does prevent and help with dry head problem.</li>
            <li> After that, I just let it air dry.</li>
            <li> My only thing with this is that i really need a conditioner as well or i can&#x27;t hardly brush through my hair and it feels a little dry.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with it once a week (and use regular shampoo the other times) and my itchy scalp is gone!</li>
            <li> Compared to other dandruff shampoos, that is a very long</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive but well worth the price for the end results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with dandruff the last few years and tried switching my shampoo probably 5 or 6 times but nothing helped.</li>
            <li> My spouse is now also using it for his lifelong dandruff problem as it worked for him as well.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts me months.</li>
            <li> The other reviews say it is supposed to tingle</li>
            <li> By the second application no more itch or dandruff.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one did the job,</li>
            <li> I have used the redken brand in the past, this was slightly different.</li>
            <li> I have tried every other product to no avail.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this shampoo for my son due to his dandruff issue.  </li>
            <li> Other remedies would work for a month or so</li>
            <li> Overall, this isn&#x27;t bad but isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, you only need a little!!!</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble getting a very dry scalp when the seasons change-</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> apply a little bit to my hair every other day or so, and then gradually fade the shampoo out of my shampoo routine.</li>
            <li> I can wear black shirts again without having to dust myself off.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell, but I&#x27;m not too concerned with that.</li>
            <li> A little dab once a week after</li>
            <li> After having my son, something weird went on with my scalp and no shampoo would clear the dry-dantruff-whatever disaster that it became.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like my hair gets cakey or dried out.</li>
            <li> aveda did nothing and head and shoulders dried my hair.</li>
            <li> everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks and hasn&#x27;t worked like</li>
            <li> Again though, I don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Its a little expensive but using it only twice a week</li>
            <li> Usual brand.</li>
            <li> Have been purchasing this product for past two years.  </li>
            <li> Small amount used to massage into hair to build up the lather.  </li>
            <li> No more flakes!</li>
            <li> When I grew my hair out, I noticed that those products dry my hair out extremely bad.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this as I was tired of using cider vinegar as a rinse.</li>
            <li> Irritating since my stylist recommend this for me.</li>
            <li> I had bad dandruff for months and other shampoos like Head and Shoulders did not work.</li>
            <li> Has a weird smell and didn&#x27;t help at all</li>
            <li> chemicals in this product \\&quot;persist\\&quot; in the skin and environment and were rated very poorly on that group&#x27;s safety scale.&lt;br /&gt;switched</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a terrible problem with dandruff but even a little bit of flakiness is embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> As a Redken user I bought this shampoo because \\&quot;Retaliate\\&quot; for men was discontinued to my disappointment.</li>
            <li> My husband even made comments about how bad my hair looked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying to use.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT FOR DANDRUFF. I have never found a product that help minimize or eliminate Dandruff but this here is the one!</li>
            <li> Does a great job at tackling the itching and flakes.  Will be ordering more this weekend.  Lasts a long time, you only need a little!!!</li>
            <li> Definetly works !!!! Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> it stripped my hair!  Redken does not mean trust it!</li>
            <li> This helps with my itchy scalp lesion my hair nice and clean no residue good for my colored hair the color last longer</li>
            <li> Best Dry Scalp Shampoo I have ever used. I don&#x27;t feel like my hair gets cakey or dried out. It is the only shampoo I use.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo for my dandruff</li>
            <li> Has a weird smell and didn&#x27;t help at all</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble getting a very dry scalp when the seasons change- I completely dry out. My husband does too, but not substantially. Anyway, I&#x27;ve used everything to help with dandruff and I can say this product is #1! It prevents dandruff and battles it off if it has begun- I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;m no fake reviewer either! If you have any scalp problems, buy this product. It feels nice in your hair too, not much to the smell. It&#x27;s awesome though. I wish it was cheaper, but who doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Living in the dry desert heat added to the dandruff problem. I&#x27;ve tried many other products: aveda did nothing and head and shoulders dried my hair. This is color safe too!</li>
            <li> This thing works.  Two weeks of continue usage and I no longer remember what dandruff is.  I&#x27;m still using it it but only once a week or so.  Very happy.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work the first use, but stopped working after that. Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> My scalp had become dry and flaky, so I was faced with having to buy dandruff shampoo.  After reading rviews for the many options, I chose this Redken option.  The bottom line:  it seems to be working great.  I can wear black shirts again without having to dust myself off.  That said, i had to make a couple of concessions to use this shampoo: (1) it smells like a dandruff shampoo--medicine-y; (2) to get good results, I had to follow the instructions and leave the shampoo in for about 5 minutes.  Even with those things, I plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is my only help for dandruff; the service was great</li>
            <li> after having a halo for 2 years and a prom stretch the 50 pounds online neck I have a lot of junk that grows on my scalp this has been very good</li>
            <li> Good product for itchy scalp and minor flaking. If I use this every day, it seems to itch again. I use it a couple times a week to help with itching and the drying from my &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; everyday shampoo. Kind of expensive, too. Even better reason to use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> This is probably the only Amazon review I have written in the past year so do not take it lightly when I say how well this stuff works. I had bad dandruff for months and other shampoos like Head and Shoulders did not work. After I got this I was completely cured from dandruff after the second day of using it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  It has a good smell that is not too strong and overbearing.  It helps my itchy scalp and keeps me flake free!</li>
            <li> Consistently good product. I have tried many other shampoos this one actually works.</li>
            <li> This is my go to dandruff shampoo. There is no other brand that would do the job for my scalp. I will not stop buying it..</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products for my scalp. This is the only product that has completely made my scalp stop flaking and itching.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great with Nioxin cleanser &amp; conditioner.  Really keeps the flakes away.</li>
            <li> Fast service, and item was just as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My stylist requested I bring a dandruff shampoo on our next appointment.  I researched many including Paul Mitchell and this was highly rated.  I got to the salon and my stylist proclaimed this the best. My hair was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, doesn&#x27;t take the place of prescription shampoo</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a terrible problem with dandruff but even a little bit of flakiness is embarrassing.  I hesitate to use most of the standard shampoos because of the amount of detergents and other ingredients that are hard on my hair.  The Redken shampoo and conditioner helped with the flakiness and kept my hair soft and nice looking.  I just with it was easier to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Works great and leave your scalp feeling clean and not irritated. My only thing with this is that i really need a conditioner as well or i can&#x27;t hardly brush through my hair and it feels a little dry. REALLY wish you could get a conditioner to go with this. Works way better than walmart brand dandruff shampoos and I kind of like the way it gives your scalp cool tingle, not going to lie. It makes it feel like its working and its very soothing to an irritated scalp..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a flakey scalp for a while, but was in denial that it was dandruff because I didn&#x27;t want to have to use Pert Plus or Head and Shoulders. I have pretty unruly hairs, so I think I am justifiably a bit of a hair products snob. But seeing as how in California we are having the driest winter ever recorded, my dry scalp has been getting even more itchy and noticeable; so I felt it was time to admit to myself that I have dandruff. I was happy to find that Redkin offered a solution for me. I have only used it once so far, but I trust from the reviewers below that my dandruff will soon completely go away (the itchiness has already stopped). What I like about it is how good my hair felt looked after using it. A reviewer below noted that it has a medicine-ey smell to it, but to me it was more minty and felt refreshing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every shampoo of this type and nothing ever worked as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it twice and follow each shampoo with a home hot oil treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference in my hair and scalp is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shampoos to help my scalp problem, including shampoos from well known lines like American Crew, Paul Mitchell, Pantene, and so forth-but somehow, only the Redken dandruff control scalp relief worked properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a little bit to my hair every other day or so, and then gradually fade the shampoo out of my shampoo routine. I&#x27;ve only gotten dandruff back when I stopped using this stuff and used some other dandruff-relief shampoo. It&#x27;s strong stuff- I have very thick hair, but I only need a teaspoon&#x27;s worth of this shampoo to keep my head/scalp hydrated and not snowing flakes everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price&#x27;s higher than other shampoos, yes, but I think you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s worth it. For this price, I&#x27;d definitely say yes.</li>
            <li> I AM SEVENTY THREE YEARS OLD AND HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH DANDRUFF ALL OF MY ADULT LIFE.  I AM COMPLETELY DANDRUFF FREE AFTER ABOUT SIX MONTHS USE AND MY SCALP NO LONGER ITCHES.  I USE THIS PRODUCT ONCE DAILY.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with dandruff for years. I decided to use this as I was tired of using cider vinegar as a rinse. The shampoo works very well. I don&#x27;t have itching or flakiness. I would like to see if I can go back to a regular shampoo as my sister used this one to regulate the ph balance between alkaline and acid and then switched back to a regular shampoo. if that doesn;t work for me then i guess I&#x27;ll keep using this.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything? The other reviews say it is supposed to tingle but I don&#x27;t feel anything. I have been using it every 2-3 days for a month and I looked in the mirror this morning and saw flakes. Irritating since my stylist recommend this for me. I do like that you don&#x27;t need a ton and that it does last forever - if only it worked!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for anyone that has an itchy or flaky scalp - I have been using it for years and it totally controls the problems</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive scalp. where most other anti dandruff or light clarifying shampoo&#x27;s cause irritation and heavier moisturizing shampoo&#x27;s are too heavy - this one works perfectly! a noticeable difference since i started using this product.</li>
            <li> This has been helping my itchy, flaky scalp. Not 100%, but maybe because I don&#x27;t use it daily? I&#x27;m undecided on whether I&#x27;ll continue using this product, though... it&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The best of its kind I have found. I have used it for several years and would not look for anything else</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews (and I use a lot of other Redken products) &amp; it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  Definitely works to reduce flaking, but it does have a chemical smell.  I used it with my normal All Soft conditioner which kind of masked the smell.  I only have mild dandruff, so I have been using it every other wash, so every 4 days, and it has helped with itching.</li>
            <li> This absolutely helps my itchy scalp! I don&#x27;t have dandruff but every now and then, my scalp gets so itchy, especially during the winter. I was recommended by my hair stylist to use this. I wash my hair with it once a week (and use regular shampoo the other times) and my itchy scalp is gone!</li>
            <li> After having my son, something weird went on with my scalp and no shampoo would clear the dry-dantruff-whatever disaster that it became.  I tried all the typical ones like selsun, head and shoulders, and even an all natural tea tree oil shampoo.  Took me over a year to come across one that helps -- this one did the trick!  Worth the money to me!</li>
            <li> I have literally tried dozens of dandruff shampoos and this one is by far the best. It didn&#x27;t work immediately like some of the others but after about 3 weeks of use (I only wash my hair 2-3 a week), it has done wonders. No more flakes! It does have a slight smell, but I&#x27;m not too concerned with that. After all, would you rather suffer from dandruff or smell a sulfer-y shampoo while washing your hair for 5 min? Great product. Will continue using.</li>
            <li> My scalp was always itchy and no matter what dandruff shampoo I used the problem would not go away until I used Redken. By the second application no more itch or dandruff. Make sure you follow the directions on the bottle and let the shampoo stay in the hair five minutes before rinsing. Yes it is expensive but well worth the price for the end results.</li>
            <li> It works for a day or two but if you don&#x27;t use it frequently the dandruff may come back.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good shampoo to combat dry scalp.  This stuff works very well..  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for three reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) It didn&#x27;t work for me.  It didn&#x27;t help my scalp, it smells medicinal (and possibly made my hair smell medicinal), and it weighed my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) It&#x27;s annoying to use.  The instructions state that the product to be left on the hair for five minutes.  Compared to other dandruff shampoos, that is a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) I am concerned that this might not be an actual Redken product.  The printing on the label is of very low quality and does not resemble the labels on Redken&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> this shampoo smells awesome compared to regular dandruff shampoos which often have a tar like stink. it makes your hair soft too.</li>
            <li> not that great, just get head and shoulders, kind of stinks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with dandruff the last few years and tried switching my shampoo probably 5 or 6 times but nothing helped. I got this and twice a week i lather it on my roots when I first get in the shower, and rinse it off when im done washing the rest of me, and it has completely fixed the problem. When I first used it, it would start coming back after a few days but now I&#x27;ve noticed that my scalp is dandruff free all of the time. It has a slight scent but its pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger on my hair. Its a little expensive but using it only twice a week I know it will last a long time. Plus my scalp is flake free and I&#x27;m not nervous wearing black or having people mess with my hair for the first time in years! Buy it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I was hoping.  Smells okay, foams up well.</li>
            <li> Im not gonna say a lot things.&lt;br /&gt;Just you need to try..&lt;br /&gt;Definitely work!!</li>
            <li> I use it. It works. How excited can one be about dandruff shampoo?</li>
            <li> works PERFECT for Dandruff, and doesn&#x27;t have the Odor that Most Dandruff shampoos have. Highly Recommended!!! *****</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great if your scalp needs some help and you have color treated hair. I love the mint smell, as well.</li>
            <li> Works fine for my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Best dandruff shampoo on the market.  A little dab once a week after initial use is all I&#x27;ve used for more than ten years.  Have not had dandruff since started using.</li>
            <li> I have used Redken products in the past and just stumbled onto this dandruff shampoo after many unsuccessful attempts to control scalp problem.  I have even seen dermatologists for this and the medicine they prescribed did not work.  THIS ONE WORKS!  Just follow the directions and use a good moisturizer after.  I would and have recommended this to friends.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because my scalp gets dry when I use dry shampoo. Using this when I wash has helped immensely.  I didn&#x27;t do 5stars only because it does not lather very well so I sometimes have to use more.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for it surprises me that salons don&#x27;t carry this anymore. It works great and leaves my hair in good shape</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin around my hairline and have used many different types of dandruff shampoos, with the same or even higher zinc %age.  This one has been the most effective!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cut all the dandruff out, but did help. I wish dandruff shampoo had a nice scent, but they all smell very minty. I have very long and thick hair and use about 2 teaspoons, it leaves my hair feeling funny, so I recommend following it off with the Redken Smooth Down Butter Treat for dry and unruly hair. It puts the softness back in and leaves my hair smelling delicious!</li>
            <li> Works like it is suppose to.  My daughter used it and she was dandruff free within a week.  Head and Shoulders was not cutting it, so we tried Redken.  So happy we did!!</li>
            <li> Usual brand. Does prevent and help with dry head problem.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but doesn&#x27;t keep it away long enough for the price of the shampoo</li>
            <li> no problems good product.</li>
            <li> This thing is like magic!!! I just got it two days ago and I washed my hair the same day, now its been two days since I washed it and my hair looks and feels so clean, no white flakes on my hair, no oil or dry scalp! I love this product and I plan on using it for a long time!!</li>
            <li> Did not get rid of my flakes.</li>
            <li> Before I start my review, I want to say that I am a middle aged male with long straight hair that goes down to the middle of my back. I noticed that a lot of the negative reviews are because it is just as effective as Head and Shoulders, which is a fair assessment when it comes to dandruff. When I had short hair, I used products like H&amp;S or Selsun Blue, which was fine because my hair was very short. When I grew my hair out, I noticed that those products dry my hair out extremely bad. I bought the Redken Dandruff Shampoo from Ulta, and I am on my 2nd bottle. It works very well for me, although it does dry my hair out, but not nearly as much the above products. I counteract that by using Redken Body Full Conditioner, which works great for restoring the moisture I lose. I also spray It&#x27;s a 10 leave in conditioner in my hair when it is still wet, right before I comb my hair. After that, I just let it air dry. My wife has commented on how much healthier my hair looks than when I used the other products. I do recommend following the directions because it isn&#x27;t as effective when I rinse it out before the 5 minutes is up.</li>
            <li> My wife has a severe dandruff problem and this product helped right away. We&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one did the job, not only faster but the effects last a decent time for her case.</li>
            <li> Works great on dandruff.  Love this shampoo</li>
            <li> After the third use of this shampoo my hair felt like straw, literally. My husband even made comments about how bad my hair looked. It smells and looks like mylanta. It didn&#x27;t really lather as much as I thought it would. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and hasn&#x27;t worked like I thought it would. I think I would have been better off saving my cash and buying head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Great product and good value.</li>
            <li> very nice&amp;iexcl;&amp;iexcl;</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t lived up to the other reviews... to be fair I have not yet found something that has worked well for my dandruff.</li>
            <li> Got that for my wife she like it</li>
            <li> The best Dandruff shampoo that I&#x27;ve used. Make sure to use conditioner afterward, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a year now and I love it! I also just purchased the Redken Hair Cleansing Cream for All Hair Types and I&#x27;m going to try alternating between the two as you&#x27;re not supposed to use the dandruff control repeatedly in succession (am I the only one who reads the bottles?). I will update this review and that review (once I&#x27;ve actually tried it) to reflect the results in about a week or so.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend uses this shampoo-and it&#x27;s the only one that worked for his dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;since looking up this product on the environmental working group&#x27;s database however, we decided to stop purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;the chemicals in this product \\&quot;persist\\&quot; in the skin and environment and were rated very poorly on that group&#x27;s safety scale.&lt;br /&gt;switched to herbaliz natural shampoo instead and it&#x27;s almost as effective -- and much safer!</li>
            <li> This worked after one use. I have used the redken brand in the past, this was slightly different. Minty smell, tingles. All I care about is that it worked after one use!</li>
            <li> The only dandruff shampoo that soothes my dry and itchy scalp in the winter. I have tried every other product to no avail. Love it!!</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this shampoo for my son due to his dandruff issue.  It is the only product that has worked.  My spouse is now also using it for his lifelong dandruff problem as it worked for him as well.  It is pricy but worth it to put an end to dandruff.  We have tried many products and this is the first that actually worked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that this works as well as some other, much cheaper brands I have tried (specifically one that comes in a blue bottle). I also don&#x27;t like that you have to leave this shampoo on for 5 minutes before rinsing it off, the other dandruff shampoo that works better allow me to leave to wash it out almost immediately and thus take less time to use. I have been using this for over 2 weeks now, and I see some improvement but still have flakes. With the other brand, I am flake free in about a week. Overall, this isn&#x27;t bad but isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product does what it is supposed to, however I had to dock one star since it has a strong chemical smell to it. Good product other than that.</li>
            <li> Once KMS California stopped making it&#x27;s Head Remedy line I went searching for a substitute. This is great! It works on dandruff and irritated scalps. I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean because it leaves a chalky residue.  I had to go back to Head and Shoulders which does let my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> Best dandruff shampoo for colored hair! This worked the first time I used it and it doesn&#x27;t strip all the red color out of my hair!</li>
            <li> Have been purchasing this product for past two years.  Very cost effective.  Small amount used to massage into hair to build up the lather.  Appears to control any and all dandruff for long term.</li>
            <li> My daughter pick it up at a salon she worked at and said it was good stuff. It is so don&#x27;t hesitate a moment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with dandruff my entire adult life-10 years now-and have tried numerous shampoos, home remedies, etc. This is the first shampoo that worked for the long term for me. Other remedies would work for a month or so and then I would have dandruff again. When pregnant, my dandruff is 5 times worse for whatever reason. As long as you follow the directions for leaving it on for 5 minutes before rinsing, this stuff works really well. It&#x27;s definitely worth the higher price!</li>
            <li> works very well to treat my dandruff</li>
            <li> Dandruff persists, and price is higher than more effective lower cost options</li>
            <li> As a Redken user I bought this shampoo because \\&quot;Retaliate\\&quot; for men was discontinued to my disappointment. Everything I like gets discontinued, but that&#x27;s another story. This shampoo is very flowery smelling and leaves my hair a little softer than I wanted with everyday use, so, I alternate, using it maybe once or twice a week. It has zinc in it for dandruff and itching but I never noticed any major improvement with scalp issues. Again though, I don&#x27;t use it everyday. This product seems aimed more at women. Would definitely be good for a person with thick scratchy hair. BRING BACK RETALIATE for men!</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended that I use it on Wednesdays (just once a week) and it keeps my scalp healthy!  My husband uses it too.</li>
            <li> Ehhh it&#x27;s only decent because it doesn&#x27;t strip your hair color, but i haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement in scalp health or dandruff in general.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband. I asked him how he liked it.  His answer &amp;#34;This sh*t is good!&amp;#34; It has stopped his flaking &amp; itching.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser originally turned me onto Redken&#x27;s Retaliate shampoo for Men that did wonders for dandruff.  Then Redken stopped selling it entirely.  Boo, but after some sleuthing around, I was able to find this product from Redken, which is basically the women&#x27;s or unisex version of the Retaliate.  (Actually retaliate was the off-shoot of this I believe.)  It does the same great job.  I actually use this in conjunction with the Redken&#x27;s Mint Clean shampoo.  Two times a week I use the Dandruff shampoo and the rest of the time it is the Mint.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Since I was a pre-teen I have dealt with dandruff. A couple years ago my friend suggested this shampoo and it works much better than dandruff shampoos you find at the grocery store. It doesn&#x27;t leave residue in my hair and it helps with my dandruff a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo on and off for years. I occasionally make the mistake of trying something new and it never works as good as this shampoo does. A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts me months. No more itching or flaking, and no weird smell like some other dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
