            <li>This is great stuff!</li>
            <li>not the best bargain for the price.will not buy again</li>
            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Very good travel makeup,</li>
            <li>This is a great color for all eyes.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>It is so great color...</li>
            <li>My experience with this seller was pleasant.</li>
            <li>Good color saturation too.</li>
            <li>That said it applies smoothly and has a wonderful color.</li>
            <li>So happy to find this powder on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;The formula is discontinued, and it&#x27;s my favorite color.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery</li>
            <li>I just love these!</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and stays on pretty well after a good blending</li>
            <li>Not too much to wear during the day but wonderful at night.</li>
            <li>the brush is very easy to apply it...</li>
            <li>Burgundy is my favorite...</li>
            <li>it is an okay eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t anticipated that these shadows are more of a powdery consistency than a liquid, so imagine my surprise when I pull out the applicator to get a powdery surprise on my hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the idea of this product, and it goes on very nicely, but there is too much fall out.  </li>
            <li>The liner is good for being applied exactly where you want it</li>
            <li>I like that it is easy to get into the lash line for more depth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome and stays on my waterline better than any other liner I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>The applicator is fine.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday, no matter</li>
            <li>I utilized instructional videos on YouTube for more information on the correct application method, which was very helpful.    </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and will never use anything else!</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal really should have given better instructions on the package so there wouldn&#x27;t be so much confusion about this product.</li>
            <li>When I use this product I have to put it on first</li>
            <li>The color is true &amp; rich, and it blends very well, but also can be applied densely for solid lines.</li>
            <li>and once it&#x27;s on and dry, it has a tendency to stay on for a respectable amount of time.</li>
            <li>was fast like a bunny, product is real.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the gold.</li>
            <li>Be prepared for some clean up after applying just like with any loose powder liner.  </li>
            <li>not worth the money, even if it was worth a penny!</li>
            <li>in mind, this is more like loose powder with a bit of water mixed in than an actual eyeliner.</li>
            <li>If you apply with a pressing motion instead of sweeping it on like a pencil, there is less clean up.</li>
            <li>I was slippin&#x27; and should&#x27;ve came straight to Amazon to purchase these for the low!  </li>
            <li>There is a technique for using this style of liner as a few other reviewers mentioned, and once you learn it, you will probably love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat difficult to make a clear line with this stuff (and for some reason I have more success with the gold color of this same product), and I prefer just using my favorite eyeshadow and liner brush with a bit of water, but this stuff works well when I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li>This powder liner can be messy, but with careful application makes a stunning impact.    </li>
            <li>And this stuff has major staying power.</li>
            <li>I have green eyes, and this color really makes them shine!</li>
            <li>The color is a nice, dark purple, and I usually just use it for a subtle pop of color beneath my lower lashes (pressed on rather than drawn on because the powder does fall off the sponge-tip applicator, which can be heck for a woman with large cheeks like me).</li>

            <li> this thing ruins their good reputation... when you apply it on your eyes it dusts all over your face getting it all dirty.</li>
            <li> It will get everywhere, it is highly pigmented so cleaning it off is also messy.  </li>
            <li> I want my &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; to be (with the tip pointing up), and press it flat.</li>
            <li> This was my 1st experience with loose kohl .</li>
            <li> The packaging makes it worse as you cannot control how much powder to apply to the applicator wand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not overwhelmingly black and not colorfully glittery.</li>
            <li> and you can choose the thickness or thinness; however, it flakes off and you have little sprinkles of the color all over your cheeks.</li>
            <li> This does have a little fallout, but when applied the correct way (the eastern method)</li>
            <li> It is a little messy getting on because it is a powder like product</li>
            <li> but it is sooo messy.  </li>
            <li> too small a unit unless you have really little hands.  </li>
            <li> So if you bought this liner and were disappointed with the fall-out and the unusual wand, search for how to use kohl liners before you give up on it!</li>
            <li> Dried out as soon as product opened!  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s hard to get wiped off</li>
            <li> I went back to using my gel liner :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that L&#x27;Oreal discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Awful don&#x27;t waste your money couldn&#x27;t even put it on</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to experiment with a Guerlain $37.00 kohl and be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I almost gave this a bad rating, but then I realized I was using it incorrectly!</li>

            <li> This powder liner can be messy, but with careful application makes a stunning impact.    I utilized instructional videos on YouTube for more information on the correct application method, which was very helpful.    This is meant to go on the waterline of your eyelid.    Burgundy is my favorite...I have green eyes, and this color really makes them shine!</li>
            <li> Be prepared for some clean up after applying just like with any loose powder liner.  If you apply with a pressing motion instead of sweeping it on like a pencil, there is less clean up. I like that it is easy to get into the lash line for more depth. Good color saturation too.</li>
            <li> This is a great color for all eyes. It is a little messy getting on because it is a powder like product but it does stay on your eyes once you get it on!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and stays on pretty well after a good blending but it is sooo messy.  It will get everywhere, it is highly pigmented so cleaning it off is also messy.  The packaging makes it worse as you cannot control how much powder to apply to the applicator wand.  When I use this product I have to put it on first and then do the rest of my face so I won&#x27;t get any powder on my finished look.</li>
            <li> I just love these! I happened to be on vacation and found these on clearance.  I was slippin&#x27; and should&#x27;ve came straight to Amazon to purchase these for the low!  I highly recommend the gold.</li>
            <li> This was my 1st experience with loose kohl . I didn&#x27;t want to experiment with a Guerlain $37.00 kohl and be disappointed. This kohl is deeply pigmented and makes liner the water line a breeze. My eyes are hypersensitive and this liner did not irritate. My experience with this seller was pleasant.</li>
            <li> So happy to find this powder on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;The formula is discontinued, and it&#x27;s my favorite color.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast like a bunny, product is real.</li>
            <li> I almost gave this a bad rating, but then I realized I was using it incorrectly! There is a technique for using this style of liner as a few other reviewers mentioned, and once you learn it, you will probably love it as much as I do. L&#x27;Oreal really should have given better instructions on the package so there wouldn&#x27;t be so much confusion about this product.This liner is NOT like liquid liner, nor is it like a pencil liner. It is a kohl liner that you apply to your waterline. I have also found a way to use it to create a foolproof &amp;#34;cat-eye&amp;#34; look. I hold the wand at the angle I want my &amp;#34;wing&amp;#34; to be (with the tip pointing up), and press it flat. Voila! Instant wing. And this stuff has major staying power. Once it sets, it is not coming off until you take it off. So if you bought this liner and were disappointed with the fall-out and the unusual wand, search for how to use kohl liners before you give up on it!</li>
            <li> it is an okay eyeliner.  it doesnt form a solid line across my eyelid. if i even touch my eye lid the eye liner comes off.  i will not be buy this eyeliner again i have since found one that works for me</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this product, and it goes on very nicely, but there is too much fall out.  I went back to using my gel liner :(</li>
            <li> Awful don&#x27;t waste your money couldn&#x27;t even put it on</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I&#x27;m sorry that L&#x27;Oreal discontinued it. It is a hair powdery and you have to sometimes remove powder on your face. That said it applies smoothly and has a wonderful color. A brownish burgundy with a bit of sparkle. Not too much to wear during the day but wonderful at night. The applicator is fine. A great product.</li>
            <li> The liner is good for being applied exactly where you want it and you can choose the thickness or thinness; however, it flakes off and you have little sprinkles of the color all over your cheeks.</li>
            <li> loreal has to take it off the market cos this thing ruins their good reputation... when you apply it on your eyes it dusts all over your face getting it all dirty. then it&#x27;s hard to get wiped off so you have to wash your face with water and soap, if you use foundation then obviously that goes too...I don&#x27;t know who came up with an idea of eye liner in powder... not worth the money, even if it was worth a penny!</li>
            <li> Just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not overwhelmingly black and not colorfully glittery. Perfect for everyday, no matter what!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never go without it.</li>
            <li> too small a unit unless you have really little hands.  not the best bargain for the price.will not buy again</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t anticipated that these shadows are more of a powdery consistency than a liquid, so imagine my surprise when I pull out the applicator to get a powdery surprise on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like it! The color is true &amp; rich, and it blends very well, but also can be applied densely for solid lines.</li>
            <li> It is so great color... the brush is very easy to apply it... however, the powder of the liner is all over under my eyes...</li>
            <li> Dried out as soon as product opened!  Threw away after opening and trying. Dont waste your money!  I regret buying!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I used it for the first time and will never use anything else! Price and product were (on a scale of 1 to 10) a 13. Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This does have a little fallout, but when applied the correct way (the eastern method) it&#x27;s awesome and stays on my waterline better than any other liner I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> Verdict: Recommended with a tentative, &#x27;Why not?&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, this is more like loose powder with a bit of water mixed in than an actual eyeliner. The color is a nice, dark purple, and I usually just use it for a subtle pop of color beneath my lower lashes (pressed on rather than drawn on because the powder does fall off the sponge-tip applicator, which can be heck for a woman with large cheeks like me). It&#x27;s somewhat difficult to make a clear line with this stuff (and for some reason I have more success with the gold color of this same product), and I prefer just using my favorite eyeshadow and liner brush with a bit of water, but this stuff works well when I&#x27;m lazy. Very good travel makeup, and once it&#x27;s on and dry, it has a tendency to stay on for a respectable amount of time.</li>
