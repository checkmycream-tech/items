            <li>but it was a great buy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this item gets great reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a great product I use it with Organix healing weightless oil and Bazillion Keratin heat protection spray.</li>

            <li>This heats up nicely and works beautifully!  </li>

            <li>great product</li>
            <li>But it just goes to show what a great product this is that one would even consider spending that load of cash on it.</li>
            <li>and they are great of course.</li>
            <li>Still works great.</li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>

            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have to set it to the highest setting and it still works great with her frizzy hair.lol</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>i love it!!</li>
            <li>I just got mine today, the packaging is very nice</li>

            <li>Amazing hair straightner!</li>
            <li>This hair straightener is amazing!</li>
            <li>My hair smells wonderful (not burnt) and it looks and feel so healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love that the plates are 100% ceramic, which is the best for hair!</li>

            <li>, they used one of these to curl my hair, and i was impressed with how easy it was to use for making curls.</li>
            <li>Excellent product has adjustable tempature control for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It has a good weight to it and it works well.</li>
            <li>As good as costly ones.</li>
            <li>* Good range of temperatures  </li>
            <li>The adjustable dial&#x27;s temperatures are written in a chalk like writing and therefore the words and temperatures will wipe off fairly soon after purchase  </li>
            <li>This is a good straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t exceed my expectations or anything.</li>
            <li>All in all a good product</li>
            <li>It works just as good as the one I got at the booth at the mall for $90.</li>

            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t buy it at the mall and found it on here!</li>
            <li>I should have known that something this cheap was a knock off!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this iron!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised to see that it was better than the iron I paid 175.00 for</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use, and what a great job it did on my hair.</li>
            <li>This straightener works amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have had this straightener for about 3 years now &amp; has been doing an amazing job.</li>
            <li>For the price this is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Your hair looks amazing.&#x27;</li>
            <li>the result was amazing</li>
            <li>Plus, it is an amazing price compared to buying it at the mall stand.</li>
            <li>I thought this  was an amazing iron in the mall.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, every women should own one of these.</li>
            <li>the Herstyler products are amazing and a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what it does.  </li>
            <li>It is great, light weight but performs miracles on my hair which is  thick,coarse, and wavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to tourmaline plates, which are a lot smoother than ceramic, so to me it feels like the plates kind of snag my hair a bit.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the best iron you&#x27;ll ever use for your hair.</li>
            <li>i have to be honest</li>
            <li>Nice iron, it fits the hand nice while you are using it.</li>
            <li>Hair feels like warm to the touch after a run through.</li>
            <li>All the girls in my family own one.</li>
            <li>I bought my own Herstyler from the mall Kiosk and I paid $105.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work so nice.</li>
            <li>works awesome and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I AM THRILLED.</li>
            <li>I have used cheap Conair brand straighteners that work better than this!!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky smooth, and curls really nice too!</li>
            <li>Very excited to receive this product quickly!!!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron, it works great - great price too!  </li>
            <li>I thought it was too good to be true, but rest assured folks!</li>
            <li>heats up quick , works great</li>
            <li>Super happy with my buy</li>
            <li>So to me, investing $30 every 3yrs for great hair seems totally worth it.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Gets nice and ho,t love this product</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to dish out that kind of cash for it again.</li>
            <li>All in all I absolutely love this straightener and won&#x27;t buy another kind or brand ever again.</li>
            <li>So far, so great!</li>
            <li>My best bet is to stick with my old one..</li>
            <li>By far the best price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is the best hair appliance I have ever used does the complete job and the price was excellant.  </li>
            <li>I loved this flat iron, it does wonderful on my hair that I. Ordered more for my family members.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>

            <li>This is a great deal and a very high quality straightener!</li>
            <li>However, the seller offered a great price and Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>The heat setting is great because it can probably go higher than you even need.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, the product came beautifully packaged and all looks well.</li>
            <li>She used it today for the first time and said it works great.</li>
            <li>The product works great just as the first did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it works great and it gets really hot...</li>
            <li>and it almost seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Very cheap .</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t effectively straighten relatively fine wavy hair, even after tons of preheating and working.</li>
            <li>Wonderful to have as a back up FHI or keep in overnight bag for travel.  </li>
            <li>I have never tried a straightener that could get my hair to look as healthy and</li>
            <li>I love my Herstyler and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I was able to save $150 this month by being able to straighten my hair my two daughters hair at home.</li>
            <li>I would have to say in many ways it is much better than the Sedu.</li>
            <li>I have one I bought from a hairstylist that cost a lot more</li>
            <li>The ceramics iron is so much better.    </li>
            <li>The end.  :-)  </li>
            <li>Now I just need to get the herstyle mini iron to get the hairline better.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didnt let the mall price [90-200] scare me away from this product.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>like most are.</li>
            <li>trust me, your hair probably deserves it if you&#x27;re anything like me and have damaged it for so many years before finding this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>since that price has increased with inflation (and demand), i looked on amazon to see if i could find a better deal.</li>
            <li>I love my Herstyler</li>
            <li>more than once although my hair is not curly..</li>
            <li>but I really love this iron</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come with a carrying case which was ok</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and for the money, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I love my straightener.</li>
            <li>and she love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>I  was  able  </li>
            <li>and  I  love  it.</li>
            <li>like it more than my chi.....</li>
            <li>After reading lots of reviews I ordered this item and have been incredibly pleased with it.      </li>
            <li>I love that I can adjust the temperature, too.</li>
            <li>I bought this Herstyler about 3 months ago and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful and such a timesaver.  </li>
            <li>If you have more money, go with a better one.</li>
            <li>It was her favorite hair styling tool</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with hers</li>
            <li>I love this product and didn&#x27;t have to pay that amount again.  </li>
            <li>Bonus for me as I was able to use it on vacation</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t in the top 10 on the review websites</li>
            <li>Perfect for daily styling and for brazillian treatments!!!  </li>
            <li>On top of that, mine didn&#x27;t come with a travel bag that the description said it came with.</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable temp it has and the cover it comes with.</li>
            <li>I guess my Chi will continue to be the one I use the most.</li>
            <li>we just needed more then one since there are 3 of us using it in our household.  </li>
            <li>and so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>My sister-in-law bought hers in the mall and paid a lot more for it.  </li>
            <li>I love herstyler and for the price, I couldnt pass this up.</li>
            <li>It worked perfect until I finally dropped it one too many times on a tile floor a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having more split ends and its showing up faster and faster.</li>
            <li>but it gets more hair spray stuck on it than the Revlon one.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy her a better quality one like a CHI</li>
            <li>Just for the smell I would rather have bought the better quality one.</li>
            <li>This product is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was not so sure about getting any chemical treatment again on my hair.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did it.</li>
            <li>It gives awesome result and the best part for the international traveler that it runs on dual voltage (though I haven&#x27;t checked it personally)</li>
            <li>(and believe me, had I had an extra $200 laying around, I would have purchased it immediately as I was that impressed with the results!)</li>
            <li>to be safe.</li>
            <li>This is better to use if you straighten your hair alot.</li>
            <li>the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
            <li>and she said it does a way better job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I looked on Amazon because this is WAY cheaper than anywhere else</li>
            <li>I also love that this is 100% ceramic</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to everyone, best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I think I just need more practice.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I am able to adjust the temputure according to the texture of the clients hair.</li>
            <li>My daughters really love it.  </li>
            <li>and I swear this one works even better.</li>
            <li>but I love this one its grate</li>
            <li>came recommended, but I sure wont recommend it to anyone,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sooo glad i looked on Amazon for my straightner.</li>
            <li>I feel I tried almost every iron out there, but now im am in love.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for such a great deal!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>They improved the product and I was pleased to see that it heated up to 420.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is!</li>
            <li>Heck, I might order it anyway, just so I have a backup. :-)</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s that you say, you love the results?</li>
            <li>but with so many listings they may not get to this one.</li>
            <li>If you want to spend $40 on one then go to WalMart and by their brand styler, unless you love the look of this one, then buy this one cause</li>
            <li>if you ladies know and love your hair and want a herstyler like my wife had gotten attached to hers, she couldn&#x27;t use another one</li>
            <li>it is more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I think I better stock up on this steal before it&#x27;s no longer</li>
            <li>love it -  </li>
            <li>This heats up so fast and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 years, and like many others, bought the 120 dollar one at the mall before finding it on amazon.</li>
            <li>and you can do what ever you want with this straightener keeping your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>and I look like I just stepped out of the shop. :-)</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it :D</li>
            <li>I do love that this straightener is 100% ceramic</li>
            <li>If you want to stick to a top notch brand try Karmin Pro, Sedu, Croc, HSI.</li>
            <li>LOVE it got it for my daughter</li>
            <li>This price is way better than any employee discount I ever got.</li>
            <li>but No, it&#x27;s real n works great.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Basically I am so pleased with the salon results that I get from home when using the Herstyler and the price of $32</li>
            <li>but i love it.</li>
            <li>It works just like the one at the mall if not even better.</li>
            <li>But I can honestly say that this is the first straightener where after I use it my hair feels better then before I used it!      </li>
            <li>comes in very nice packaging, and it&#x27;s functioning really well, cut my styling time, but still-not perfect-since i have to do each section</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron period.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best flat irons that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>this is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>One of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my flat iron.</li>
            <li>THIS FLAT IRON IS GREAT!</li>
            <li>I use the herstyler serum with it and gives me the best flat iron experience I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>this flat iron is AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li>and so far so good!</li>
            <li>out of all the flat irons I&#x27;ve bought, this has been the best one yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>The best flat iron I have every owned!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it is cheap, great quality, and heats up fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO happy that I found Herstyler on here and wanted to assure anyone who either thought about purchasing one at those mall kiosks to hold on to their money and buy it from here - it&#x27;s the EXACT same iron and comes in a gorgeous box with warranty and everything!</li>
            <li>Over all, it&#x27;s a pretty good straightener, though.</li>
            <li>Each day I use this straightener is pretty much a good hair day for me.</li>
            <li>I can do my hair, and it will look great ALL DAY, and I live in Washington state..</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and does a nice job.</li>
            <li>With the Chi, I can slide through my hair easily and achieve curls, but with this straightener, you need to put a lot more work.</li>
            <li>it works great on my natural hair even though I had to go through it more than once.</li>
            <li>I have tried several irons and this is the best one I have had, leaves my hair smooth and it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s hair nice and smooth and provides smooth curls with the twist of your wrist.  </li>
            <li>It works so great and make your hair feel so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for straightening my natural hair!</li>
            <li>This iron leaves my fine hair silky and it feels like it holds the style much better.</li>
            <li>Its a good flat iron for a good price.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it and works way better than the cheap ones you&#x27;ll get at the store.</li>
            <li>real quick got free shipping for the return over still had to pay for box and all.</li>
            <li>Best $30 I ever spent</li>
            <li>One of my best friends had the pink Herstyler without the adjustable dial but every time I used it to touch up my hair before we went somewhere, it left me with incredible shine.</li>
            <li>, it comes in a very pretty display case,nothing entirely fancy, but when it comes to the Straightener, it is wonderful,</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It used to take an hour easily</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to straighten.  </li>
            <li>Where it is easy to use it burns my hair.</li>
            <li>I got such a great price on it, and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before.  </li>
            <li>Has easy temperature adjustment.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing and can&#x27;t believe that something this effective was so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Easy does and maybe invest in a holder.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>like the swivel cord and helps when I&#x27;m moving around a lot, however wish the cord is retractable for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Still going strong after 2 years.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li>The spring is still strong.</li>
            <li>It is just as good as the high end brands I have used.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s just as amazing as the first one.</li>
            <li>This straighter is exactly the kind of product that I wanted.</li>
            <li>I love my flat irons, they work great and work for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron it works great for straightening</li>
            <li>I still love the Sedu for being so smooth in maneuvering through my fine hair, as the Herstyler always seems to \\&quot;catch\\&quot; and occasionally create indents (which take quite a while to get out) but the curls created by my Herstyler are just magical!!</li>
            <li>If you can get the name out of your head, you are fine.</li>
            <li>It still works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine, wavy hair that tends to frizz in humidity, kink when I sleep on it or curl</li>
            <li>This securely holds my fine hair between the plates and allows for easy straightening and curling if I want.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve paid more for our first &#x27;Her Styler&#x27; straightener and love it -</li>
            <li>Easy to use and enjoy the heat setting knob.</li>
            <li>Daughter says its fine</li>
            <li>I love the way it heats up rather quickly.</li>
            <li>and I love how quickly it heat us</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li>if you ask me, I was super stoked!</li>
            <li>I love how quick it heats up</li>
            <li>That said, I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, so I have no idea how this product holds up against more difficult-to-tame tresses.</li>
            <li>and they never made my hair look so shiny, straight, and healthy and not frizzy!</li>
            <li>Now I see why and how easy factories in China manufacture products so close to the original product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of ordering a second, just because it was so cheap and a great product.</li>
            <li>Great bargain for a solid device.</li>
            <li>Not a problem for me because it&#x27;s really a great deal but just a heads up to potential buyers.</li>
            <li>No complaints, makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>The seller included a free gift (\\&quot;Luxury Shampoo\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>I love this , worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am a cheap buyer</li>
            <li>I placed my order on 1/29/10 (3-5 day free shipping) and received the package on 2/2.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair and it makes my hair real smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 10 minutes to straighten my whole head and it looks amazing and soooo glossy/shiny.</li>
            <li>one\\&quot; this time and this one fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>I had some free time, so I allowed him to.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using the oil and my hair has been damage free since.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that i tried out my friend&#x27;s herstyler and finally bought this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>The plates on this iron are smooth ceramic as well which is nicer on the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m starting to think the risk is too great when you shop with them.</li>
            <li>, I decided to just go with some cheap and affordable off brand that I got from Walmart, to my regret.</li>
            <li>You might as well buy a cheap one at the store.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so silky and so smooth and</li>
            <li>It was cheap and works well.</li>
            <li>but I no longer received the silky smooth salon style results from before.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked so fabulous that when I got home</li>
            <li>Works really good so far.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that comes to just below my shoulder blades so the best way to fix it in the morning is by flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Worked great! and lasted 5 and a half years!</li>
            <li>Not only a great flat iron, but a great deal as well.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously the most awesome hair tool for anyone!</li>
            <li>Great flat irons.</li>
            <li>great 1st flat iron</li>
            <li>Flat iron works great.</li>
            <li>The only package I have been very happy with ordering so far!!</li>
            <li>Great flat iron for the price!</li>
            <li>It really is silky to the touch, and takes just one quick pass through the hair to achieve such wonderful results!  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to use and my hair keeps straight for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my original at the mall and just purchased two as Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li>She was so excited that she called her co-worker and told her that we were coming.  </li>
            <li>, I have had Chi&#x27;s, Gold n&#x27; hot, and many others.  </li>
            <li>Better than the straighteners at Sally&#x27;s or at the stores that just stop working and getting as hot.</li>
            <li>When I originally purchased my HerStyler at the mall for a whopping $200.00</li>
            <li>I ordered this straightner a couple weeks ago and was really excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had this product for about a year now, and I have noticed a significant decrease in the level of heat it holds.</li>
            <li>They got real hot, but they burned my hair out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that its been so long</li>
            <li>But I love love love the flat iron.</li>
            <li>The ceramics heat up very quickly, and are so smooth and effective on hair, very easy to hold, clamp, slide down hair lock and release.</li>
            <li>I love, Love, LOVE this flat iron!</li>
            <li>My hair looks great even if I don&#x27;t put any hair products in it and let my hair air dry and straighten it.</li>
            <li>I have always used herstyler and liked it, it seems more likely that the iron I recieved was a reject batch.</li>
            <li>but I love the tourmaline herstyler flat irons alot better!</li>
            <li>My hair was left feeling so good and light weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didnt pay nearly that :)</li>
            <li>makes great stuff too, but like the Herstylers, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find them on here one day, also heavily discounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was really great, in fact I wish we had bought this Herstyler before we spent over $100 on another very popular name brand flat iron or hair straightener</li>
            <li>and so far we all love the results it has given us!</li>
            <li>My old ine is better!</li>
            <li>So, I paid 160.00 plus tax for a normal sized straightener, mini straightener that is great for new growth, and the grande curler.  </li>
            <li>flat iron is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I am literally blown away at how AMAZING the quality and most of all, the effectiveness of this flat iron!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full ceramic plates don&#x27;t burn my hair and leave it soft and silky every time it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it got so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li>This iron is really good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this so much, I give it as gifts all the time.  </li>
            <li>Your hair comes out pin straight more shiny</li>
            <li>Now imagine how much better results the real one would give you.</li>
            <li>and I think is pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot very quick</li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace my hot tools iron when my easy lights fried it.  </li>
            <li>They went with the other brands and are happy.  </li>
            <li>Great sale price and does the expected!</li>
            <li>so, so, so, loved this this Flat iron.</li>
            <li>I loved the bag that came with it to store the flat iron when not in use.</li>
            <li>Really good flat iron.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, gets hair smooth and straight without a lot of effort, much much better than others in this price range or even a bit higher.</li>
            <li>LovE Love LoVe this flat iron; it&#x27;s 100% real ceramic plates make my hair feel  silky</li>
            <li>I first saw this flat iron in the mall and had always avoided the sales people, but watched them use the product on a friend and it seemed to work very nicely.  </li>
            <li>While there are many devices similar to this one, once purchased and plugged, this device instantly performs splendidly.</li>
            <li>The iron tends to get build-up and oily quickly even without product in the hair (does not affect the hair however)</li>
            <li>It heats up super quick and I just slip it in it&#x27;s bag when I&#x27;m done without worrying it</li>
            <li>It always heats quickly and works efficiently when used.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn or fry my hair, and it works quickly -</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found it on Amazon for 25% of what she paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quick &amp; temp goes up to 460</li>
            <li>The shipping was shockingly quick</li>
            <li>but luckily, I was given a sample of the serum ans</li>
            <li>It was also delivered to be quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and has the option to the control temperature if needed.</li>
            <li>had the same one but in purple before, but I dropped it too many times to the point where it cracked, so just don&#x27;t drop it more than 10</li>
            <li>Well, Straightens quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and it doesnt snag my hair when I straighten it.</li>
            <li>I love that it gets super hot pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I love amazon.com and highly recommend this product for all hair typed.</li>
            <li>Heats up pretty quick, it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li>My mother has this Herstyler Flat Iron and works excellent, but when I ordered it thru Amazon it never got delivered to my household, so Amazon refund me back my money.</li>
            <li>I saw more damage in my hair, and more burnt smells coming from this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have used babybliss, t3, sally beauty brand etc, this has to be my most favorite flat iron.</li>
            <li>But for my next purchase I definitely would seek out a product with a more intelligent design.</li>
            <li>but it is still a good long length.</li>
            <li>she is beside herself with joy as she&#x27;s been admiring mine (and my hair due to it!)</li>
            <li>It is made a little lighter(in weight) than the original but so far works very good!</li>
            <li>I purchased my first HerStyler SEVEN years ago and it still works just as well as when I first got it!!</li>
            <li>so we love how shiny smooth and light this flat iron makes our hair.</li>
            <li>but at this price I will gladly buy a new one.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something quite new and lovely to me.</li>
            <li>my original herstyler flat iron purchased at the kiosk is wonderful also, I really didnt expect to get such a good flat iron for the price....waiting to see what&#x27;s the catch!</li>
            <li>Fast n easy to iron her hair.  </li>
            <li>Used it for first time last night and did good on my hair.  </li>
            <li>After using a different brand for so long, I had forgotten how great this product worked!</li>
            <li>However, the first one I bought I paid $135 for it!</li>
            <li>The first time, I thought it was maybe me mis-using the iron, but nope!</li>
            <li>EXACTLY as if my hairstylist did it himself!</li>
            <li>from the first time I used it I was sold!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and super straight.  </li>
            <li>I can style my hair so much more quickly than I could with my old straightener.</li>
            <li>So what I enjoy about this flat iron is that I can make my hair seem more polished by using the straightener to give it more of a flat look and it gives it a more polished shine.    </li>
            <li>My old iron was bought at a regular super store and did not do a great job of taming my hair</li>
            <li>The flat iron itself is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>So, YES I would highly recommend the Herstyler to everyone looking for a really great flat iron!!</li>
            <li>But it is amazing it gives me soft straight hair.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product made to last.</li>
            <li>my hair is huge and it literally took me two hours to get it straight because every three-five sections i would have to wait for it to reheat.</li>
            <li>It feels cheaply made (very plasticy and lightweight) and I could not get the temperature knob to turn all the way up.</li>
            <li>Good purchase for the minimal $$.</li>
            <li>this works better than the $350 iron i bought that completely fried my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also recommend the Colorful Seasons straightener.</li>
            <li>Not only does it get my hair perfectly straight without even having a relaxer, but it heats up in like 60 seconds, and when you section off your hair, you only have to go over it one time for best results.  </li>
            <li>My mom bought one of these (Colorful seasons) at a vendor at our mall</li>
            <li>IT IS REALLY WORTH</li>
            <li>It is so exciting to have this product at 1/4 of the price.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made and no where near as good as the ones sold at my local mall.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money.</li>
            <li>So worth the money on Amazon, it is around $150-$170 retail on herstyler.com</li>
            <li>to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li>Read all of the reviews to see if it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I can be 10 weeks post and still have a fresh look.</li>
            <li>Useful.</li>
            <li>Better than my old $ 140 chi.</li>
            <li>and she was nice enough to tell me that I could get the Herstyler on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have hair down to about my waist and takes me about 30-40 mins to straighten which is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product heats up quickly and seems to be very gentle on my hair.  </li>
            <li>hair styles you want and heats up pretty quick.</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly, and it stays hot.</li>
            <li>She says it straightens her hair quickly and warms up fast!  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Might be good for some other people but doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>But other than that i loved this product.</li>
            <li>use it all the time and hope it lasts as good as other one has lasted for me</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and the price was definitely right</li>
            <li>and she knew the difference right away,</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing and they were right.</li>
            <li>I need the right mixture of products to get my desired out come.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a perfect replacement for my other her styler flat iron.</li>
            <li>This past weekend I had tried hers out and loved the way my hair was so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>But expected a minimum of a good quality Iron that would straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The temperature does not get as hot as any iron I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>but I am confident that the Herstyler&#x27;s ceramic plates don&#x27;t let me down:)</li>
            <li>Not sure if one of my kids accidentally did so since it&#x27;s a really great product</li>
            <li>There are many great reviews on the product and most of the bad reviews are because of the crappy sales tactics of the mall kiosk people, not the device performance.</li>
            <li>I usually borrow my friend&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m so happy I chose this one.</li>
            <li>It was worth the $30 I paid for it while it was not shattered, great flat iron, just not a very long life span.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this flat iron for over seven months and its good as new.</li>
            <li>I loved the original that I bought several years ago at the mall and hoped these would be the same model.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone that straightens their hair, soooo worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal, for only $30 you get the same quality one you would get at the mall.</li>
            <li>Also the deliver was super fast</li>
            <li>So far, I have loved the way it heats up instantly and makes my hair shine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Package came quickly and product is of high quality!</li>
            <li>This is a a regular type straightener and it&#x27;s worth the $20-30 :)</li>
            <li>Lesson learned, if it sounds to good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly, and every other flat iron I&#x27;ve tried is not as great as this one!</li>
            <li>And surprisingly, it was nearly half the price of what I was willing to pay.  </li>
            <li>As a pre-going out styling aid on normal dry hair, this works so well to make gorgeous silky model hair immediately.</li>
            <li>Used correctly it makes hair more shiny and smooth than other brands have.  </li>
            <li>As listed in some reviews before mine, the pattern on the handle is kind of abrasive and rough on the hands, but it straightens so ridiculously quickly that it hasn&#x27;t been a real issue.</li>
            <li>THIS IS SUCH A GREAT DEAL, I went to the mall to buy this exact flat iron and it cost me $250.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase and will definitely be recommending CALIFORNIAN DISTRIBUTIOR and this flat iron to my friends and family!.</li>
            <li>They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li>The new one doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the old one which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants an affordable high quality iron!!!!</li>
            <li>However, this morning, as I was straightening my hair, I heard a loud pop and then a huge spark.</li>
            <li>Stopped getting hot and fell apart.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I have purchased and I love it.</li>
            <li>From now on, I&#x27;m checking amazon&#x27;s prices first.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the price that I ordered a second one as a spare!</li>
            <li>I bought this product for the first time at a kiosk for $80 which was told was a bargain.</li>
            <li>I did notice that by year 3 the temperature didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as it use to when I first bought it</li>
            <li>one gold n hot, one titanium, and now this one...  </li>
            <li>however the amount of time I spend flat ironing is greatly reduced and I no longer have to apply chemicals and sprays while using my flat iron.</li>
            <li>This is my first review ever.</li>
            <li>I had my first for over +5 years and it went out on me.</li>
            <li>and it heats up fast too!</li>
            <li>It gets so hot.</li>
            <li>but it does exactly what the Ones at the mall do.</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m pretty dissapointed</li>
            <li>The higher the temperature the faster your hair sets, but could cause damage.  </li>
            <li>You can touch it up briefly a second time, but I do not recommend more than that.  </li>
            <li>plus it had metal plates which I know are pretty damaging.  </li>
            <li>I tested it out as soon as I received it and the iron heats up FAST!</li>
            <li>My sisters-in-law, daughter-in-law, and I contemplated many different brands.  </li>
            <li>/wave up if I sleep hot at night.  </li>
            <li>You drop it, you are most likely going to break it.  </li>
            <li>Surely that can&#x27;t be a big deal.  </li>
            <li>I paid for this exact one at the mall but for $100.00.</li>
            <li>I can no longer use it because the hot plate under the ceramic plate is exposed now.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s hot but doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>and it gets really hot to wear even the thickest of hair</li>
            <li>I bought this exact iron from a mall and it was $250.</li>
            <li>and I have always gotten great compliments on my long blonde silky hair.</li>
            <li>I have used several different straighteners some the most affordable to the more pricier ones.</li>
            <li>Thanks bunches!</li>
            <li>This is the first straightening iron I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>I have even seen it at swap meets but for above $10 more.</li>
            <li>Hoping the second one will be better.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot to where when I touched my hair it burnt my fingers.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this again :)</li>
            <li>it did not reach a hot tempurature.</li>
            <li>also many questions about internal voltage change from country to country.</li>
            <li>I love the temp control setting; I keep it on a very low setting.</li>
            <li>I owned one of these years ago, when they first started selling them at the mall.</li>
            <li>I found that those actually work better than this one.</li>
            <li>You may need something sprayed on your hair first before you use this.</li>
            <li>Is it hot?  </li>
            <li>heat is consistent and the hair is bouncy and silky.</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s a temp gauge that allows for you to decide just how hot you need it.</li>
            <li>But I really missed it when I broke it!</li>
            <li>After the first two years of ownership I noticed the product&#x27;s declining performance.</li>
            <li>so I needed something to get my hair straight without the smell and frizzies, this does the job!</li>
            <li>I was looking at a higher priced 100% ceramic, but decided to try this first.  </li>
            <li>Rest assured this will not damage your hair no matter how hot it gets.  </li>
            <li>It will only make it shinier and softer :)</li>
            <li>and I paid about $100 for my first iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, do NOT pay the $200 they want you to spend at the mall, hopefully you&#x27;ve found the Amazon product page first.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as good as the real one , feels cheaper and had a funny smell when turned on and made a slight buzzing noise.</li>
            <li>Amazing, high quality flat iron.</li>
            <li>I try not to use alot of heat on my hair and i was flat ironing about every two weeks, which worked out great because my hair last(straight) pretty long.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, superior temperature control, does not fry or damage hair, alters texture quickly and completely and it lasts, no extra tools or styling products needed - in fact the less the better, and curls tips too.</li>
            <li>This product arrived a day before it was due, so that was nice.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has stopped using her flat iron and now use mine, I am so pleased with it that I am now buying one for my daughter in law.  </li>
            <li>I love my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many flat irons</li>
            <li>In love with my herstyler flat iron.</li>
            <li>The name-brand ones work better and are pretty much the same price.</li>
            <li>I think the Chi is a better flat iron to straighten hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the flat iron, it is just what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I received my flat iron within 2 days, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Did I say I love this flat iron?  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have had many flat irons, even CHI</li>
            <li>Better than my $100 flat irons.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to curl my hair with the flat iron and this one doesn&#x27;t do it for some reason.</li>
            <li>I love the way the Hairstyler ceramic flat irons turn my naturally frizzy and curly hair into a smooth, silky and straight tamed style.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I will be buying the better flat iron!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Those who love this product obviously don&#x27;t know what the real ones feel and look like and therefore because this is a hair straightener, it will work to some extent.</li>
            <li>The Herstyler is the first to NOT damage my hair, it actually IS pure ceramic, not just ceramic COATED</li>
            <li>Overall this flat iron is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The original flat iron temperature only heated up to 200, but overall I was always so happy with this product until I dropped mine and the ceramic plates broke.</li>
            <li>Straightens hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick to my old Revlon flat iron until I buy a nice one like a Chi or something.</li>
            <li>and it stated I should receive it by the end of the week which was pretty fast</li>
            <li>The light would turn on but it&#x27;d apparently burnt itself out.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend that much on a straightener</li>
            <li>Really like that it has a dial for how hot you want it.</li>
            <li>Ordered in the past, this are not as good.</li>
            <li>I hear all the rave about how great Chi is and sorry, but fom the looks of the damaged hair of those who own them, I have stayed far away from that fixed temperature device.  </li>
            <li>I do not know how other Flat Irons rate, but this one is great</li>
            <li>but my friend has the same one and can do it easily.</li>
            <li>The temperature gauge is set between the top and bottom moving parts (sandwiched into the center sort of), so that if you have heat the appliance and need to adjust the temperature setting, you risk burning your fingers when you turn the dial because it is set too close to the hot ceramic plates.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>It has such a strong burning odor that I had to stop using it at work since people would come in thinking that the &amp;#34;heater&amp;#34; was on.</li>
            <li>I received my item 2 days later and was EXTREMELY PLEASED AND HAPPY to see it was the exact same flat iron from the herstyler.com website and my friend&#x27;s flat iron.</li>
            <li>I realized that she must have given me a great discount because her co-worker looked at the printout and sounded kind of disappointed that I wouldn&#x27;t be paying so much for a gift set.  </li>
            <li>I love my new ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!!!!!!</li>

            <li>My friends and family who know how curly my hair is still surprised every time they see how soft and smooth it gets.  </li>

            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really get my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I absolutely</li>
            <li>and strong(and I have really coarse/curly hair).</li>
            <li>My hair is as straight and bouncy as when I go to the salon.  </li>
            <li>After 1 pass, my hair is silky straight.  </li>
            <li>And it is straight... swinging and bouncy straight.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely adore this straightner.</li>
            <li>Fast heat up time  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had hair that has difficulty staying straight...</li>
            <li>comment on how much they like it.</li>
            <li>I used it very often on myself, family and friends.  </li>
            <li>but I found it online at a VERY discounted price</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It manages to make your hair stay straight all day, and makes it shiny as well.</li>
            <li>My scalp is very tender</li>
            <li>I am VERY inquisitive, and I asked her about the Chi that everyone has been telling me about for years, and she told me that it isn&#x27;t 100% ceramic AND showed me as proof.  </li>
            <li>There are people selling products that are very well crafted knock offs.  </li>
            <li>This one has lasted and is so much nicer to my hair.</li>
            <li>It stays straight.</li>
            <li>It is also very durable.  </li>
            <li>and I really didnt want to pay $200 for it again, but I would have.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t want to pay that much again.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and does everything I need it to.</li>
            <li>Straightened or curled hair seems to hold the shape very well and longer  CONS:  100% ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li>No wonder price was discounted so much.</li>
            <li>and I got it fast</li>
            <li>i was very hurt....</li>
            <li>Came as described, fast delivery, I have not used it yet</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy this, just be very carful with it.</li>
            <li>I like this iron because it gets my hair straight, and it has adjustable settings.</li>
            <li>High end straightener !</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail and it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This really does make your hair silkier and softer, it also helps with humidity.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li>This styler has my daughters hair bone straight.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>even when I straight my hair it tugs.</li>
            <li>Did not straighten my hair very.</li>
            <li>It straightens your hair and curls very well.</li>
            <li>I much prefer my curling iron</li>
            <li>I did not like how pushy the sales person was, because it really seemed like he wasn&#x27;t going to let me walk away without buying anything.</li>
            <li>my wife&#x27;s REAL one I paid $300 for died after 4 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll take my chances on the real one for $300.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just thinking you bought something real and finding out</li>
            <li>Fakers, invent something real and manufacture that.</li>
            <li>Lightly touch the outside of the iron.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real deal...</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are absolutely 100% ceramic.</li>
            <li>and it did not hold the straighteness for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am so much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really apprehensive to buy this</li>
            <li>The plates arent as fragile as others make them out to sound, but of course I am not slinging mine around like a lasso..</li>
            <li>But for the price this really is a quality iron.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair very shiny</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend it to any client.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>How much hair do you straighten at once?</li>
            <li>was a real savings to me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron, I bought it since my stylist said she had never had a problem with a cermic flat iron and that it truely didn&#x27;t seem to ever burn hair.</li>
            <li>So, I was walking in the mall one day a few years ago, and got stopped by a nice man who wanted to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you are constantly re shaping your hair on a daily basis, this might be the product for you, the temperature control feature will be handy.</li>
            <li>So in short, if you can buy one at Amazon for such a nice price, then why not.  </li>
            <li>Hair is left soft and manageable:).</li>
            <li>So I was thrilled that I found it on amazon for such a low price.</li>
            <li>I am going back to using my old Revlon one that slides better on my hair and does not feel like its pulling my hair out as I straighten it.</li>
            <li>It does a good job ironing my hair which is wavy, medium thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li>As a mother I know how hard it is sometimes to find just the right thing for a teenage girl, and when she  used her Herstyler and loved it, I knew I had made the right choice in purchasing the Herstyler.</li>
            <li>I first bought a Conair wet to dry hair straightener (max temp 375) and never got good result</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is a must if you have more than one person using the iron, medium to fine or chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly, and once I use it I don&#x27;t have to use it again until I wash my hair, which can be anywhere from 3-5 days later.  </li>
            <li>It gets super hot in the outside of the straighter</li>
            <li>I just baught this one in April pretty much new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just plain handy  Textured grip for secured handling.  </li>
            <li>(I may actually be relaxer free if it works this well on MY new growth!)</li>
            <li>I was jumping for joy and ecstatic that I had received my flat iron in LESS THAN 24 HOURS!</li>
            <li>i originally purchased one from a kiosk at the mall, back when they were selling them at the \\&quot;low\\&quot; price of $100.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for that, I would have gladly purchased cheaper ones off of this site, while using extreme caution.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived, we were extremely pleased that it is the exact same product we paid over $100 for 2 years prior.</li>
            <li>This flat iron leaves my hair silky and smooth and NEVER leaves any heat damage to it.</li>
            <li>I like how this flat iron makes your hair so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>so I really wanted the high heat.</li>
            <li>so I only use it on special occasions.</li>
            <li>He is all about free anything, so he was just mainly trying to see if someone else would do my hair for free, even though I am the only person who does my hair, on a professional and personal level.  </li>
            <li>I have the kind of hair that looks like a giant haystack unless I put a lot of product in it, or dry it for a couple days under wraps in a bun or braid.</li>
            <li>and when I came back the Iron was completely cool and still works.</li>
            <li>My curly hair will be soft, shiny and STRAIGHT as a pin once again!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice and heavy!</li>
            <li>like seeing my normally wavy hair straight.</li>
            <li>My thick, curly hair can be straightened more quickly, efficiently, easily, safely, and in a less damaging way with this.</li>
            <li>Like many, I have been through the mall and been talked into letting some excited individual use this flat iron on my hair, only to have me walk away once they tell me the price.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron definitely gets hot enough and i love it!</li>
            <li>my hair has become more healthier with less split ends.</li>
            <li>This  particular  </li>
            <li>HerStyler Classic</li>
            <li>In just a few minutes I was able to get all the frizz and fluffiness out of my hair and into sleek straight tresses that stayed that way for hours.</li>
            <li>but this flat iron really smoothed the shafts right to the very end.</li>
            <li>They last better to the next day even, quite amazing since my hair has a hard time holding shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Should work on any thickness though, it heats to high temps.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t have to turn it up to a high setting to achieve the look I want.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>that at high temps you&#x27;ll probably need a glove to touch</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>:o)I would highly recommand this straigthner to anyone.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fake kind of strips you of your dignity, which is exactly how I felt and why I&#x27;m venting in this review right now, please forgive me.</li>
            <li>Same flat iron as those sold at the mall for much more money.  </li>
            <li>Also, I am able to give my hair volume by simply using the flat iron to make it into a bit of a curl by twisting it like it was a hair curling iron.    </li>
            <li>It heats u super fast, you have a wide range of options for the heat settings (I use it at the lowest 180F) and keeps hair straight.</li>
            <li>I got this Herstyler on sale at Amazon, so I not only got a first class styler, I saved money doing it !  </li>
            <li>As I open my front door much to my surprise there was my package waiting for me!!</li>
            <li>leaves my hair so soft and shiny and it heats within seconds!!</li>
            <li>It broke because I dropped it on concrete from a high distance</li>
            <li>it was the first thing in my whole life that curled my hair and my hair wasn&#x27;t straight again by the time I finished the other side of my head because my hair is BOARD STRAIGHT!</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron ever, I have spent so much money buying other flat iron</li>
            <li>These flat irons work quickly and I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair 5 times.  </li>
            <li>I have badly damaged hair form dying it alot, but this iron smooths it out and makes my hair look beautiful!</li>
            <li>This does not heat up near as much a my real one does.</li>
            <li>Both get my hair straight but neither leave my hair as shiny,smooth,and soft as the Herstyler.</li>
            <li>My hair looks soft, shiny and straight for 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li>I had an old one that I bought 7 years ago and it just stopped working from me dropping it so much</li>
            <li>I almost wonder if its a fake herstyler or this iron is just not that great.</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky hair which requires a lot of heat when wanting to wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair so soft straight and silky.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so much healthier and softer than my old straightener did.</li>
            <li>Also I had it in 3 days , normal shipping.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and works ten times better than my broken CHI.  </li>
            <li>herstyler is much easier to use than my curling iron, makes nicer curls that last longer than the one made with the curling iron or hot rollers.</li>
            <li>so it does not hold them normally.</li>
            <li>I also see now that patents are created not only so someone doesn&#x27;t make money off of someone else&#x27;s product, but because people put in so much time inventing something for a reason, and this hair straightener proves that statement completely.</li>
            <li>Compared to my old Revlon one (which, by the way is not broken i just felt like buying a new one)</li>
            <li>It was much less expensive here on Amazon, but actually it is such a good flat iron that I would have gladly paid much more.  </li>
            <li>I went with a Solia Tourmaline Flat Iron (sold at folica.com) and it worked pretty good, but definitely not as good as the Herstyler did.</li>
            <li>I tried it by sliding it all the way to the right and all the way to the left and nothing.  </li>
            <li>I sent it back right away.</li>
            <li>How there are 17 left right now is beyond me.</li>
            <li>I know because I abused my first flat iron so much that I busted the plate.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Herstyler flat irons in the past for my daughters and we have had a good experience with all of their products.</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair that is straight no matter what I do to it.</li>
            <li>Glides down the hair easily  </li>
            <li>and it still works as if it were brand new.</li>
            <li>I paid $150 for a brand new CHI at Target</li>
            <li>and it still works like new.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
            <li>the ceramic is as new.</li>
            <li>Seller claimed product was new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll listen to what he has to say about the product before I walk away, as I was on the market to purchasing a new iron anyway.</li>
            <li>No way was I spending $300 for a new one</li>
            <li>For awhile now I have been shopping on Amazon wondering why some of the products I was looking at were cheaper brand new than some used things on ebay.</li>
            <li>That is why I had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I m returning this iron, it was sold it to me as new</li>
            <li>Even though I probably shouldn&#x27;t have, I continued to use it until my new one arrived.</li>
            <li>It doesnt burn your hair and make it feel dry and look flat and lifeless like others and love</li>
            <li>Total salon needs filled with one tool and now utterly affordable.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34; heavy&amp;#34; is not a problem for daily use but important to a stylist who uses it multiple times throughout a day.  </li>
            <li>I was u able to return it to get money back because I had closed the credit card I used to buy it.</li>
            <li>He used this exact product, Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for natural ladies like myself.</li>
            <li>But i know for sure that my conair wet to straight 2&amp;#34; flat iron has a digital thermometer, i know im not suppose to steam my hair straight.</li>
            <li>My wife broke hers and wanted the exact same model to replace hers.</li>
            <li>Second time buying one if these, first one lasted 4 years</li>
            <li>I had the $130 exact same brand from the mall</li>
            <li>I bought my first iron maybe 4 years ago and it finally gave out....</li>
            <li>My husband was like &#x27;WOW!</li>
            <li>They are exactly the same</li>
            <li>What caught my eye first was 100% ceramic plates and then second ...</li>
            <li>I first saw it in my local mall and wanted it but wasn&#x27;t going to pay the 100</li>
            <li>This time around it was $20 for the exact same thing!</li>
            <li>It did a less than satisfactory job on fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m quite relieved to find these listed on amazon now too because this company originally had some foreign name I can&#x27;t pronounce or remember,</li>
            <li>Gets super hot and takes less than 10 min to straighten hair every morning!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived super fast, about a week and a half sooner than was</li>
            <li>The construction seems cheap - the heat control is a plastic knob you dial up or down</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it works well, thin enough to make soft curls, after more than 2 yrs</li>
            <li>Most premium brand flat irons for sale (ex. CHI, GHD, SEDU,...) will last you ~3-4 years with daily use.</li>
            <li>Wow what a rip off, and when it broke they refused to give me a new one, which they promised a lifetie warranty.</li>
            <li>My friend bragged about a new straightener she purchased at the mall for nearly 100 buckaroos</li>
            <li>Amazon allowed me to return this product, and gave me free shipping on another re-order which was also inaccurately described as a 1.5&amp;#34; iron (Herstyler Superstyler Onyx Hair Straightener Black, 1.5&amp;#34; Ceramic Plates).</li>
            <li>Item arrived with no instructions, only a long, detailed safety warning.</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold, does not get heavy.  </li>
            <li>After going to the mall and seeing what the ceramic flat irons can do, I was excited to hop online and seek the same quality product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>My old Conair Infiniti flat iron was not as hot as it was originally and could no longer deal with my African American naturally curly 3b-4a BSL hair.</li>
            <li>The flat iron works exactly like the $200 one i purchased 5+ years ago and</li>
            <li>This is &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34; I compared the two and they work exactly the same giving you the same results.</li>
            <li>I first heard of the HERSTYLER ceramic flat iron from a friend who had purchased hers at a mall and paid $100</li>
            <li>So at first I was hesitant to buy this flat iron since the picture they have doesn&#x27;t depict correct logo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m terrified to use a herstyler flat iron now and very sad as it straightened my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>However, after a week of using it the power cord seemed loose and the red light that shows the straightner is on or heating up was flickering off and on.</li>
            <li>These products are sold at very high prices in various malls</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to get smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fantastic and came in original packaging but was missing the black heat protector bag that&#x27;s shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes its hard finding a good product for african american hair.</li>
            <li>I hope it doesn&#x27;t completely shut off and stop working....</li>
            <li>Also I personally didn&#x27;t like to do my hair very often since it was known to take 4 hours to do.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.   </li>
            <li>I am 22 years old today.</li>
            <li>I use a protective lotion to prevent heat damage and the HerStyler leaves my hair with a natural shine.  </li>
            <li>My  hair  was  straight,  but  then,  I  simply  flipped  it  under  </li>
            <li>Prior to buying the Herstyler, I had been using a Conair and Remington for years and neither made my hair straight all day.</li>
            <li>I can never make all the hair appear like a professional styled it or that natural effortless look.  </li>
            <li>My old ones were nothing like this one.</li>
            <li>it gets my hair just as straight as my chi at almost a third of the price.</li>
            <li>because when I do all of my hair, it doesn&#x27;t always stay as straight as it initially is until I wash my hair</li>
            <li>So here are the pros and cons thus far from my perspective:  </li>
            <li>Leaves the hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>As far was the packaging and delivering, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>this thing reheats fast enough that I can do ten-twenty sections before pausing.</li>
            <li>It was an old Revlon ceramic plated just like this Herstyler iron.</li>
            <li>It beats the chi by far.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re saving so much money, I swear by this straightener, curls last</li>
            <li>and it had a fixed temperature setting which did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li>the styler should completely straighten and seal the cuticle.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>After 2 months it went completely out.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from permed hair to natural</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny and no smell.</li>
            <li>Like my old straightener the plates don&#x27;t close evenly leaving the ever slightest gap.</li>
            <li>And it was nowhere near the $150 I had paid for the professional version.</li>
            <li>My husband purchased it for me and I am blown away by how silky soft and bouncy hair was after using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thats really the only way i could see these breaking..</li>
            <li>My hair constantly gets caught in this thing and there is no indication when it is ready to use.</li>
            <li>How long do you keep the hot plates against your hair?</li>
            <li>It takes 3 or 4 passes over hair to actually get it straight at all.</li>
            <li>Yes, the outer part of the iron has a funny texture and can give you a callous the first few times of use, but after that, you get used to it.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like a ceramic flat iron should.  </li>
            <li>Not really wanting to spend the money for another one (I originally paid $150 for one at a local mall kiosk)</li>
            <li>ten times like I would other flat irons and the shine is amazing... definitely take advantage of this deal on here!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is an absolute must have.</li>
            <li>I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I really believed I would never see those $25 or the flat iron again.</li>
            <li>I have over processed damaged hair so almost all flat irons pull my hair and never get it pin straight.</li>
            <li>Granted, this one has a much lower price than the Chi, but my hair looks noticeably healthier when I am not using this flat iron.</li>
            <li>plastic body of the flat iron has held up very well.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, so don&#x27;t get ripped off by the flat irons they sell at the mall.</li>
            <li>It arrived just yesterday and sure enough, this is the EXACT same iron with the unbelievable salon-like effects!</li>
            <li>I really like this Flat iron would recommend it!</li>
            <li>it worked very well on my natural hair(No perm..Thick &amp; long)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be ridiculous to buy these types of  &amp;#34;kiosk&amp;#34; straighteners for more than $30.</li>
            <li>However, it does not get wavy enough again to necessitate re-straightening, and it has worked better than straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past.    </li>
            <li>This product has made Curling my hair not only possible but fast!</li>
            <li>I must have had it set too high the last time I used it though because it burned my hair</li>
            <li>I had spent so much money buying flat iron after flat iron because I had so many complaints about all of my other ones.</li>
            <li>Should I wait for the little red light to turn off before using the appliance?</li>

            <li>I purchased the Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron</li>
            <li>B002LE8OX8 Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron]]</li>
            <li>B002LE8OX8 Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron]]</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought a new one is because my dog ate my cord.</li>
            <li>so when I was looking for a new one I knew I wanted the same one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s finally time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>You can buy the same ceramic flat iron at Kmart for 1/3 of the price, looks and works identical with the large price.</li>
            <li>I normally have to oil my hair before flat ironing, but with HerStyler</li>
            <li>No other straighter could compete with it in my book.</li>
            <li>Next time I will spend the extra money on higher quality in hopes that it will last longer.</li>
            <li>Just to give some scale to the review, here is a description of my hair type: Thick, long, naturally wavy, slighty frizzy, mostly air-dried, never dyed, never highlighted, and</li>
            <li>It pulls at my hair, and I have normal almost straight hair with odd waves in it.  </li>
            <li>Ceramic provides even heating and less damage if used on the right temperature setting for your hair type.  </li>
            <li>I am not great at styling my hair; so having something that is easy to use was important to me.&lt;br /&gt;I watched a few tutorials on using this styler to curl hair, and decided that I needed to get one.</li>
            <li>My  new  Herstyler  flat  </li>
            <li>I had already planned to purchase a new flat iron yesterday, but hadn&#x27;t decided which one.  </li>
            <li>This straightner is 97.00 on the herstyler web site I got it for less then half that I love it and wanted to get another one.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different hair straighteners ( seriously I have 4 in my drawer).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited, definitely a steal of a deal,if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap  because of low budget,you couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>I can use low heat when necessary or use high heat.</li>
            <li>I still think this straightener is worth $150, but hey.. I&#x27;m not gonna turn down a steal like this!</li>
            <li>Generally one sweep w/</li>
            <li>I still have my old one as a back up and travel one.  </li>
            <li>but after I got permanent straightening done on my hair it changed its texture and now it looks rough, frizzy and very curly.</li>
            <li>It pulls on the ends of my hair if I&#x27;m not careful though.  </li>
            <li>Early the next morning I was checking my emails to track my package</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got naturally curly red hair,which with a 20$ Straightener would take 3 hours, I&#x27;ve tried,but this one,I had done my hair in 5 or so minutes and for TWENTY dollars !</li>
            <li>They sell the same one at the mall near my house for 200 dollars.</li>
            <li>It is naturally curly in back and wavy in front.</li>
            <li>I only wish it had an auto off feature because i sometimes forget that, as my old one did.  </li>
            <li>so I came on here and was so surprised it was only $20.</li>
            <li>(Only spent $60) on the first one.</li>
            <li>I believe the &amp;#34;Forever&amp;#34; model is a 1.5&amp;#34; iron, and since the first one I received several years ago was a 1.5&amp;#34; iron, I expected to get a 1.5&amp;#34; iron on my re-order.  </li>
            <li>still think it feels a bit chinsy, and I am afraid of it breaking, but the functionality is good.</li>
            <li>It is hot 450 degrees with a control to turn it down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same flat iron only much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take quite as long to make my hair straight with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>It was burning hot in less than 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates chipped and cracked on my first one after having it for less than a year.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After my previous HerStyler croaked (it never stopped getting hot-</li>
            <li>it keeps it straight for the whole 1st day and only a few touch-ups are needed for the second day</li>
            <li>I have natural hair, and I don&#x27;t mean the good mixed hair kind, I mean the really tightly curled hard to straighten.  </li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron when I was 17 years old and have had it ever since.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough and small enough to travel with.  </li>
            <li>Not everyone needs to fry their hair with a fixed 392 degree flat iron, or</li>
            <li>This flat iron does the job, but is far below the quality of a Chi hair straightener.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I pulled her away and searched for it online, finding it on amazon.com for MUCH less than the folks in the mall were selling it for ($150!!).  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this product for African American women to have natural hair.</li>
            <li>I already have two InStylers (I think they were between 120.00 and 150.00 while they had a discounted sale going on when they first came out) and a flat iron that I spent over 200 dollars on just by itself!    </li>
            <li>When I first purchased it, the product worked just as well as any other premium brand flat iron.</li>
            <li>I had a pink one with my older flatiron .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot and takes a little longer to reheat.  </li>
            <li>The hair straightener has a dial from the least hotness to 180 degrees, I believe, and even on the lowest setting, it&#x27;s straightened better than any other hair straightener I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I am an African American female and I am transitioning from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li>My GHD flat iron recently stopped operating as normal so went to my salon for a treatment and flat iron.</li>
            <li>Because of my schedule, I usually shower at night right before bed.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast, maybe less than 1 minute and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>However it won&#x27;t give you results the real one gives you and will probably break in less than a month.</li>
            <li>In thin sections it is easy to straighten.</li>
            <li>It was as if I never flat iron it.</li>
            <li>I bought this months ago just to have a new flat iron because my previous one was about 5 yrs old.</li>
            <li>It generally takes her over an hour to straighten her hair, but it only took us 20 mins with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>came before the expected date, actually about 5 days early!</li>
            <li>The ceramic plates began to discolor within the first few months of owning the flat iron.</li>
            <li>(The real box has the choose your fashion label on the back in black, not white and Le, Ni, Dv, Tp 1.75 and 440 are all on the back as well almost looking like a bio chart)</li>
            <li>Most products in general don&#x27;t usually work for me or only do minimally to the point where I&#x27;ve basically wasted money, yet again, but this is not one of those products.    </li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> lol soo this was well along my price range.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going great</li>
            <li> I found it on amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li> From the posts, it seems like this is a great dealer to buy from.  </li>

            <li> lol</li>

            <li> It works great, adjustable heat dial</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> So happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> but it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this item gets great reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I use it with Organix healing weightless oil and Bazillion Keratin heat protection spray.</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> This heats up nicely and works beautifully!  </li>
            <li> This is a great prodict.</li>
            <li> So the price is great.</li>
            <li> Works just as great still.  </li>
            <li> It works great and the price here is exceptional!&lt;br</li>
            <li> great product</li>
            <li> But it just goes to show what a great product this is that one would even consider spending that load of cash on it.</li>
            <li> and they are great of course.</li>
            <li> Still works great.</li>
            <li> Great price.  </li>
            <li> I will go to bed, and wake up with my hair still looking great, I just do a 5 min touch up.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have to set it to the highest setting and it still works great with her frizzy hair.lol</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> i love it!!</li>
            <li> I just got mine today, the packaging is very nice</li>
            <li> Heats up in seconds and works amazing!</li>
            <li> Also, the price is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing hair straightner!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair smells wonderful (not burnt) and it looks and feel so healthy.  </li>
            <li> Love that the plates are 100% ceramic, which is the best for hair!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It was awesome to find this product on amazon and a better price then purchasing it at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> The price for this is outstanding, it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> , they used one of these to curl my hair, and i was impressed with how easy it was to use for making curls.</li>
            <li> Excellent product has adjustable tempature control for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It has a good weight to it and it works well.</li>
            <li> As good as costly ones.</li>
            <li> * Good range of temperatures  </li>
            <li> The adjustable dial&#x27;s temperatures are written in a chalk like writing and therefore the words and temperatures will wipe off fairly soon after purchase  </li>
            <li> This is a good straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t exceed my expectations or anything.</li>
            <li> All in all a good product</li>
            <li> It works just as good as the one I got at the booth at the mall for $90.</li>

            <li> I thought since it was rated well that it would be a good steal.</li>
            <li> I also thought to get a good one you had to pay a lot for it.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend $100 like some of my friends did!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> LOVE the iron!</li>
            <li> Love LOve LOVe LOVE this Iron !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for so many days!</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t buy it at the mall and found it on here!</li>
            <li> I should have known that something this cheap was a knock off!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised to see that it was better than the iron I paid 175.00 for</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use, and what a great job it did on my hair.</li>
            <li> This straightener works amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for about 3 years now &amp; has been doing an amazing job.</li>
            <li> For the price this is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Your hair looks amazing.&#x27;</li>
            <li> the result was amazing</li>
            <li> Plus, it is an amazing price compared to buying it at the mall stand.</li>
            <li> I thought this  was an amazing iron in the mall.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, every women should own one of these.</li>
            <li> the Herstyler products are amazing and a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing what it does.  </li>
            <li> It is great, light weight but performs miracles on my hair which is  thick,coarse, and wavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to tourmaline plates, which are a lot smoother than ceramic, so to me it feels like the plates kind of snag my hair a bit.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best iron you&#x27;ll ever use for your hair.</li>
            <li> i have to be honest</li>
            <li> Nice iron, it fits the hand nice while you are using it.</li>
            <li> Hair feels like warm to the touch after a run through.</li>
            <li> All the girls in my family own one.</li>
            <li> I bought my own Herstyler from the mall Kiosk and I paid $105.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work so nice.</li>
            <li> works awesome and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I AM THRILLED.</li>
            <li> I have used cheap Conair brand straighteners that work better than this!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky smooth, and curls really nice too!</li>
            <li> Very excited to receive this product quickly!!!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron, it works great - great price too!  </li>
            <li> I thought it was too good to be true, but rest assured folks!</li>
            <li> heats up quick , works great</li>
            <li> Super happy with my buy</li>
            <li> So to me, investing $30 every 3yrs for great hair seems totally worth it.</li>
            <li> but this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Gets nice and ho,t love this product</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to dish out that kind of cash for it again.</li>
            <li> All in all I absolutely love this straightener and won&#x27;t buy another kind or brand ever again.</li>
            <li> So far, so great!</li>
            <li> My best bet is to stick with my old one..</li>
            <li> By far the best price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is the best hair appliance I have ever used does the complete job and the price was excellant.  </li>
            <li> I loved this flat iron, it does wonderful on my hair that I. Ordered more for my family members.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Amazon over a year ago and it is still going strong!  </li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I have used many irons, but this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite and works great!!  </li>
            <li> This is a great deal and a very high quality straightener!</li>
            <li> However, the seller offered a great price and Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> The heat setting is great because it can probably go higher than you even need.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, the product came beautifully packaged and all looks well.</li>
            <li> She used it today for the first time and said it works great.</li>
            <li> The product works great just as the first did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it works great and it gets really hot...</li>
            <li> and it almost seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Very cheap .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t effectively straighten relatively fine wavy hair, even after tons of preheating and working.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to have as a back up FHI or keep in overnight bag for travel.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried a straightener that could get my hair to look as healthy and</li>
            <li> I love my Herstyler and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I was able to save $150 this month by being able to straighten my hair my two daughters hair at home.</li>
            <li> I would have to say in many ways it is much better than the Sedu.</li>
            <li> I have one I bought from a hairstylist that cost a lot more</li>
            <li> The ceramics iron is so much better.    </li>
            <li> The end.  :-)  </li>
            <li> Now I just need to get the herstyle mini iron to get the hairline better.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didnt let the mall price [90-200] scare me away from this product.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> like most are.</li>
            <li> trust me, your hair probably deserves it if you&#x27;re anything like me and have damaged it for so many years before finding this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> since that price has increased with inflation (and demand), i looked on amazon to see if i could find a better deal.</li>
            <li> I love my Herstyler</li>
            <li> more than once although my hair is not curly..</li>
            <li> but I really love this iron</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a carrying case which was ok</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and for the money, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I love my straightener.</li>
            <li> and she love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I  was  able  </li>
            <li> and  I  love  it.</li>
            <li> like it more than my chi.....</li>
            <li> After reading lots of reviews I ordered this item and have been incredibly pleased with it.      </li>
            <li> I love that I can adjust the temperature, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this Herstyler about 3 months ago and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderful and such a timesaver.  </li>
            <li> If you have more money, go with a better one.</li>
            <li> It was her favorite hair styling tool</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with hers</li>
            <li> I love this product and didn&#x27;t have to pay that amount again.  </li>
            <li> Bonus for me as I was able to use it on vacation</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t in the top 10 on the review websites</li>
            <li> Perfect for daily styling and for brazillian treatments!!!  </li>
            <li> On top of that, mine didn&#x27;t come with a travel bag that the description said it came with.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable temp it has and the cover it comes with.</li>
            <li> I guess my Chi will continue to be the one I use the most.</li>
            <li> we just needed more then one since there are 3 of us using it in our household.  </li>
            <li> and so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> My sister-in-law bought hers in the mall and paid a lot more for it.  </li>
            <li> I love herstyler and for the price, I couldnt pass this up.</li>
            <li> It worked perfect until I finally dropped it one too many times on a tile floor a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having more split ends and its showing up faster and faster.</li>
            <li> but it gets more hair spray stuck on it than the Revlon one.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy her a better quality one like a CHI</li>
            <li> Just for the smell I would rather have bought the better quality one.</li>
            <li> This product is just ok.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was not so sure about getting any chemical treatment again on my hair.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did it.</li>
            <li> It gives awesome result and the best part for the international traveler that it runs on dual voltage (though I haven&#x27;t checked it personally)</li>
            <li> (and believe me, had I had an extra $200 laying around, I would have purchased it immediately as I was that impressed with the results!)</li>
            <li> to be safe.</li>
            <li> This is better to use if you straighten your hair alot.</li>
            <li> the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
            <li> and she said it does a way better job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I looked on Amazon because this is WAY cheaper than anywhere else</li>
            <li> I also love that this is 100% ceramic</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to everyone, best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I think I just need more practice.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I am able to adjust the temputure according to the texture of the clients hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters really love it.  </li>
            <li> and I swear this one works even better.</li>
            <li> but I love this one its grate</li>
            <li> came recommended, but I sure wont recommend it to anyone,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sooo glad i looked on Amazon for my straightner.</li>
            <li> I feel I tried almost every iron out there, but now im am in love.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for such a great deal!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> They improved the product and I was pleased to see that it heated up to 420.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is!</li>
            <li> Heck, I might order it anyway, just so I have a backup. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s that you say, you love the results?</li>
            <li> but with so many listings they may not get to this one.</li>
            <li> If you want to spend $40 on one then go to WalMart and by their brand styler, unless you love the look of this one, then buy this one cause</li>
            <li> if you ladies know and love your hair and want a herstyler like my wife had gotten attached to hers, she couldn&#x27;t use another one</li>
            <li> it is more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I think I better stock up on this steal before it&#x27;s no longer</li>
            <li> love it -  </li>
            <li> This heats up so fast and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 years, and like many others, bought the 120 dollar one at the mall before finding it on amazon.</li>
            <li> and you can do what ever you want with this straightener keeping your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> and I look like I just stepped out of the shop. :-)</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it :D</li>
            <li> I do love that this straightener is 100% ceramic</li>
            <li> If you want to stick to a top notch brand try Karmin Pro, Sedu, Croc, HSI.</li>
            <li> LOVE it got it for my daughter</li>
            <li> This price is way better than any employee discount I ever got.</li>
            <li> but No, it&#x27;s real n works great.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Basically I am so pleased with the salon results that I get from home when using the Herstyler and the price of $32</li>
            <li> but i love it.</li>
            <li> It works just like the one at the mall if not even better.</li>
            <li> But I can honestly say that this is the first straightener where after I use it my hair feels better then before I used it!      </li>
            <li> comes in very nice packaging, and it&#x27;s functioning really well, cut my styling time, but still-not perfect-since i have to do each section</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron period.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best flat irons that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> this is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> One of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON IS GREAT!</li>
            <li> I use the herstyler serum with it and gives me the best flat iron experience I have ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> this flat iron is AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> and so far so good!</li>
            <li> out of all the flat irons I&#x27;ve bought, this has been the best one yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have every owned!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, it is cheap, great quality, and heats up fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO happy that I found Herstyler on here and wanted to assure anyone who either thought about purchasing one at those mall kiosks to hold on to their money and buy it from here - it&#x27;s the EXACT same iron and comes in a gorgeous box with warranty and everything!</li>
            <li> Over all, it&#x27;s a pretty good straightener, though.</li>
            <li> Each day I use this straightener is pretty much a good hair day for me.</li>
            <li> I can do my hair, and it will look great ALL DAY, and I live in Washington state..</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> With the Chi, I can slide through my hair easily and achieve curls, but with this straightener, you need to put a lot more work.</li>
            <li> it works great on my natural hair even though I had to go through it more than once.</li>
            <li> I have tried several irons and this is the best one I have had, leaves my hair smooth and it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s hair nice and smooth and provides smooth curls with the twist of your wrist.  </li>
            <li> It works so great and make your hair feel so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for straightening my natural hair!</li>
            <li> This iron leaves my fine hair silky and it feels like it holds the style much better.</li>
            <li> Its a good flat iron for a good price.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing and it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and works way better than the cheap ones you&#x27;ll get at the store.</li>
            <li> real quick got free shipping for the return over still had to pay for box and all.</li>
            <li> Best $30 I ever spent</li>
            <li> One of my best friends had the pink Herstyler without the adjustable dial but every time I used it to touch up my hair before we went somewhere, it left me with incredible shine.</li>
            <li> , it comes in a very pretty display case,nothing entirely fancy, but when it comes to the Straightener, it is wonderful,</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It used to take an hour easily</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to straighten.  </li>
            <li> Where it is easy to use it burns my hair.</li>
            <li> I got such a great price on it, and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before.  </li>
            <li> Has easy temperature adjustment.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing and can&#x27;t believe that something this effective was so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Easy does and maybe invest in a holder.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> like the swivel cord and helps when I&#x27;m moving around a lot, however wish the cord is retractable for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Still going strong after 2 years.</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li> The spring is still strong.</li>
            <li> It is just as good as the high end brands I have used.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s just as amazing as the first one.</li>
            <li> This straighter is exactly the kind of product that I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love my flat irons, they work great and work for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron it works great for straightening</li>
            <li> I still love the Sedu for being so smooth in maneuvering through my fine hair, as the Herstyler always seems to \\&quot;catch\\&quot; and occasionally create indents (which take quite a while to get out) but the curls created by my Herstyler are just magical!!</li>
            <li> If you can get the name out of your head, you are fine.</li>
            <li> It still works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine, wavy hair that tends to frizz in humidity, kink when I sleep on it or curl</li>
            <li> This securely holds my fine hair between the plates and allows for easy straightening and curling if I want.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve paid more for our first &#x27;Her Styler&#x27; straightener and love it -</li>
            <li> Easy to use and enjoy the heat setting knob.</li>
            <li> Daughter says its fine</li>
            <li> I love the way it heats up rather quickly.</li>
            <li> and I love how quickly it heat us</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li> if you ask me, I was super stoked!</li>
            <li> I love how quick it heats up</li>
            <li> That said, I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, so I have no idea how this product holds up against more difficult-to-tame tresses.</li>
            <li> and they never made my hair look so shiny, straight, and healthy and not frizzy!</li>
            <li> Now I see why and how easy factories in China manufacture products so close to the original product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of ordering a second, just because it was so cheap and a great product.</li>
            <li> Great bargain for a solid device.</li>
            <li> Not a problem for me because it&#x27;s really a great deal but just a heads up to potential buyers.</li>
            <li> No complaints, makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> The seller included a free gift (\\&quot;Luxury Shampoo\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I love this , worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a cheap buyer</li>
            <li> I placed my order on 1/29/10 (3-5 day free shipping) and received the package on 2/2.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair and it makes my hair real smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 10 minutes to straighten my whole head and it looks amazing and soooo glossy/shiny.</li>
            <li> one\\&quot; this time and this one fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> I had some free time, so I allowed him to.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using the oil and my hair has been damage free since.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy that i tried out my friend&#x27;s herstyler and finally bought this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> The plates on this iron are smooth ceramic as well which is nicer on the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m starting to think the risk is too great when you shop with them.</li>
            <li> , I decided to just go with some cheap and affordable off brand that I got from Walmart, to my regret.</li>
            <li> You might as well buy a cheap one at the store.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so silky and so smooth and</li>
            <li> It was cheap and works well.</li>
            <li> but I no longer received the silky smooth salon style results from before.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked so fabulous that when I got home</li>
            <li> Works really good so far.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that comes to just below my shoulder blades so the best way to fix it in the morning is by flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Worked great! and lasted 5 and a half years!</li>
            <li> Not only a great flat iron, but a great deal as well.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the most awesome hair tool for anyone!</li>
            <li> Great flat irons.</li>
            <li> great 1st flat iron</li>
            <li> Flat iron works great.</li>
            <li> The only package I have been very happy with ordering so far!!</li>
            <li> Great flat iron for the price!</li>
            <li> It really is silky to the touch, and takes just one quick pass through the hair to achieve such wonderful results!  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to use and my hair keeps straight for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my original at the mall and just purchased two as Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li> She was so excited that she called her co-worker and told her that we were coming.  </li>
            <li> , I have had Chi&#x27;s, Gold n&#x27; hot, and many others.  </li>
            <li> Better than the straighteners at Sally&#x27;s or at the stores that just stop working and getting as hot.</li>
            <li> When I originally purchased my HerStyler at the mall for a whopping $200.00</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightner a couple weeks ago and was really excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had this product for about a year now, and I have noticed a significant decrease in the level of heat it holds.</li>
            <li> They got real hot, but they burned my hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that its been so long</li>
            <li> But I love love love the flat iron.</li>
            <li> The ceramics heat up very quickly, and are so smooth and effective on hair, very easy to hold, clamp, slide down hair lock and release.</li>
            <li> I love, Love, LOVE this flat iron!</li>
            <li> My hair looks great even if I don&#x27;t put any hair products in it and let my hair air dry and straighten it.</li>
            <li> I have always used herstyler and liked it, it seems more likely that the iron I recieved was a reject batch.</li>
            <li> but I love the tourmaline herstyler flat irons alot better!</li>
            <li> My hair was left feeling so good and light weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didnt pay nearly that :)</li>
            <li> makes great stuff too, but like the Herstylers, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find them on here one day, also heavily discounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was really great, in fact I wish we had bought this Herstyler before we spent over $100 on another very popular name brand flat iron or hair straightener</li>
            <li> and so far we all love the results it has given us!</li>
            <li> My old ine is better!</li>
            <li> So, I paid 160.00 plus tax for a normal sized straightener, mini straightener that is great for new growth, and the grande curler.  </li>
            <li> flat iron is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is nothing special.  </li>
            <li> I am literally blown away at how AMAZING the quality and most of all, the effectiveness of this flat iron!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full ceramic plates don&#x27;t burn my hair and leave it soft and silky every time it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it got so many great reviews.  </li>
            <li> This iron is really good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this so much, I give it as gifts all the time.  </li>
            <li> Your hair comes out pin straight more shiny</li>
            <li> Now imagine how much better results the real one would give you.</li>
            <li> and I think is pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot very quick</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace my hot tools iron when my easy lights fried it.  </li>
            <li> They went with the other brands and are happy.  </li>
            <li> Great sale price and does the expected!</li>
            <li> so, so, so, loved this this Flat iron.</li>
            <li> I loved the bag that came with it to store the flat iron when not in use.</li>
            <li> Really good flat iron.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, gets hair smooth and straight without a lot of effort, much much better than others in this price range or even a bit higher.</li>
            <li> LovE Love LoVe this flat iron; it&#x27;s 100% real ceramic plates make my hair feel  silky</li>
            <li> I first saw this flat iron in the mall and had always avoided the sales people, but watched them use the product on a friend and it seemed to work very nicely.  </li>
            <li> While there are many devices similar to this one, once purchased and plugged, this device instantly performs splendidly.</li>
            <li> The iron tends to get build-up and oily quickly even without product in the hair (does not affect the hair however)</li>
            <li> It heats up super quick and I just slip it in it&#x27;s bag when I&#x27;m done without worrying it</li>
            <li> It always heats quickly and works efficiently when used.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn or fry my hair, and it works quickly -</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found it on Amazon for 25% of what she paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quick &amp; temp goes up to 460</li>
            <li> The shipping was shockingly quick</li>
            <li> but luckily, I was given a sample of the serum ans</li>
            <li> It was also delivered to be quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and has the option to the control temperature if needed.</li>
            <li> had the same one but in purple before, but I dropped it too many times to the point where it cracked, so just don&#x27;t drop it more than 10</li>
            <li> Well, Straightens quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and it doesnt snag my hair when I straighten it.</li>
            <li> I love that it gets super hot pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I love amazon.com and highly recommend this product for all hair typed.</li>
            <li> Heats up pretty quick, it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li> My mother has this Herstyler Flat Iron and works excellent, but when I ordered it thru Amazon it never got delivered to my household, so Amazon refund me back my money.</li>
            <li> I saw more damage in my hair, and more burnt smells coming from this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have used babybliss, t3, sally beauty brand etc, this has to be my most favorite flat iron.</li>
            <li> But for my next purchase I definitely would seek out a product with a more intelligent design.</li>
            <li> but it is still a good long length.</li>
            <li> she is beside herself with joy as she&#x27;s been admiring mine (and my hair due to it!)</li>
            <li> It is made a little lighter(in weight) than the original but so far works very good!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first HerStyler SEVEN years ago and it still works just as well as when I first got it!!</li>
            <li> so we love how shiny smooth and light this flat iron makes our hair.</li>
            <li> but at this price I will gladly buy a new one.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something quite new and lovely to me.</li>
            <li> my original herstyler flat iron purchased at the kiosk is wonderful also, I really didnt expect to get such a good flat iron for the price....waiting to see what&#x27;s the catch!</li>
            <li> Fast n easy to iron her hair.  </li>
            <li> Used it for first time last night and did good on my hair.  </li>
            <li> After using a different brand for so long, I had forgotten how great this product worked!</li>
            <li> However, the first one I bought I paid $135 for it!</li>
            <li> The first time, I thought it was maybe me mis-using the iron, but nope!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY as if my hairstylist did it himself!</li>
            <li> from the first time I used it I was sold!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and super straight.  </li>
            <li> I can style my hair so much more quickly than I could with my old straightener.</li>
            <li> So what I enjoy about this flat iron is that I can make my hair seem more polished by using the straightener to give it more of a flat look and it gives it a more polished shine.    </li>
            <li> My old iron was bought at a regular super store and did not do a great job of taming my hair</li>
            <li> The flat iron itself is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> So, YES I would highly recommend the Herstyler to everyone looking for a really great flat iron!!</li>
            <li> But it is amazing it gives me soft straight hair.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product made to last.</li>
            <li> my hair is huge and it literally took me two hours to get it straight because every three-five sections i would have to wait for it to reheat.</li>
            <li> It feels cheaply made (very plasticy and lightweight) and I could not get the temperature knob to turn all the way up.</li>
            <li> Good purchase for the minimal $$.</li>
            <li> this works better than the $350 iron i bought that completely fried my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also recommend the Colorful Seasons straightener.</li>
            <li> Not only does it get my hair perfectly straight without even having a relaxer, but it heats up in like 60 seconds, and when you section off your hair, you only have to go over it one time for best results.  </li>
            <li> My mom bought one of these (Colorful seasons) at a vendor at our mall</li>
            <li> IT IS REALLY WORTH</li>
            <li> It is so exciting to have this product at 1/4 of the price.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made and no where near as good as the ones sold at my local mall.</li>
            <li> Its worth the money.</li>
            <li> So worth the money on Amazon, it is around $150-$170 retail on herstyler.com</li>
            <li> to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li> Read all of the reviews to see if it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I can be 10 weeks post and still have a fresh look.</li>
            <li> Useful.</li>
            <li> Better than my old $ 140 chi.</li>
            <li> and she was nice enough to tell me that I could get the Herstyler on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to about my waist and takes me about 30-40 mins to straighten which is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product heats up quickly and seems to be very gentle on my hair.  </li>
            <li> hair styles you want and heats up pretty quick.</li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly, and it stays hot.</li>
            <li> She says it straightens her hair quickly and warms up fast!  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Might be good for some other people but doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> But other than that i loved this product.</li>
            <li> use it all the time and hope it lasts as good as other one has lasted for me</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and the price was definitely right</li>
            <li> and she knew the difference right away,</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing and they were right.</li>
            <li> I need the right mixture of products to get my desired out come.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a perfect replacement for my other her styler flat iron.</li>
            <li> This past weekend I had tried hers out and loved the way my hair was so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> But expected a minimum of a good quality Iron that would straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The temperature does not get as hot as any iron I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> but I am confident that the Herstyler&#x27;s ceramic plates don&#x27;t let me down:)</li>
            <li> Not sure if one of my kids accidentally did so since it&#x27;s a really great product</li>
            <li> There are many great reviews on the product and most of the bad reviews are because of the crappy sales tactics of the mall kiosk people, not the device performance.</li>
            <li> I usually borrow my friend&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m so happy I chose this one.</li>
            <li> It was worth the $30 I paid for it while it was not shattered, great flat iron, just not a very long life span.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this flat iron for over seven months and its good as new.</li>
            <li> I loved the original that I bought several years ago at the mall and hoped these would be the same model.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone that straightens their hair, soooo worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is a great deal, for only $30 you get the same quality one you would get at the mall.</li>
            <li> Also the deliver was super fast</li>
            <li> So far, I have loved the way it heats up instantly and makes my hair shine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Package came quickly and product is of high quality!</li>
            <li> This is a a regular type straightener and it&#x27;s worth the $20-30 :)</li>
            <li> Lesson learned, if it sounds to good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly, and every other flat iron I&#x27;ve tried is not as great as this one!</li>
            <li> And surprisingly, it was nearly half the price of what I was willing to pay.  </li>
            <li> As a pre-going out styling aid on normal dry hair, this works so well to make gorgeous silky model hair immediately.</li>
            <li> Used correctly it makes hair more shiny and smooth than other brands have.  </li>
            <li> As listed in some reviews before mine, the pattern on the handle is kind of abrasive and rough on the hands, but it straightens so ridiculously quickly that it hasn&#x27;t been a real issue.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SUCH A GREAT DEAL, I went to the mall to buy this exact flat iron and it cost me $250.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase and will definitely be recommending CALIFORNIAN DISTRIBUTIOR and this flat iron to my friends and family!.</li>
            <li> They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li> The new one doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the old one which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants an affordable high quality iron!!!!</li>
            <li> However, this morning, as I was straightening my hair, I heard a loud pop and then a huge spark.</li>
            <li> Stopped getting hot and fell apart.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased and I love it.</li>
            <li> From now on, I&#x27;m checking amazon&#x27;s prices first.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the price that I ordered a second one as a spare!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time at a kiosk for $80 which was told was a bargain.</li>
            <li> I did notice that by year 3 the temperature didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as it use to when I first bought it</li>
            <li> one gold n hot, one titanium, and now this one...  </li>
            <li> however the amount of time I spend flat ironing is greatly reduced and I no longer have to apply chemicals and sprays while using my flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever.</li>
            <li> I had my first for over +5 years and it went out on me.</li>
            <li> and it heats up fast too!</li>
            <li> It gets so hot.</li>
            <li> but it does exactly what the Ones at the mall do.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m pretty dissapointed</li>
            <li> The higher the temperature the faster your hair sets, but could cause damage.  </li>
            <li> You can touch it up briefly a second time, but I do not recommend more than that.  </li>
            <li> plus it had metal plates which I know are pretty damaging.  </li>
            <li> I tested it out as soon as I received it and the iron heats up FAST!</li>
            <li> My sisters-in-law, daughter-in-law, and I contemplated many different brands.  </li>
            <li> /wave up if I sleep hot at night.  </li>
            <li> You drop it, you are most likely going to break it.  </li>
            <li> Surely that can&#x27;t be a big deal.  </li>
            <li> I paid for this exact one at the mall but for $100.00.</li>
            <li> I can no longer use it because the hot plate under the ceramic plate is exposed now.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s hot but doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> and it gets really hot to wear even the thickest of hair</li>
            <li> I bought this exact iron from a mall and it was $250.</li>
            <li> and I have always gotten great compliments on my long blonde silky hair.</li>
            <li> I have used several different straighteners some the most affordable to the more pricier ones.</li>
            <li> Thanks bunches!</li>
            <li> This is the first straightening iron I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I have even seen it at swap meets but for above $10 more.</li>
            <li> Hoping the second one will be better.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot to where when I touched my hair it burnt my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again :)</li>
            <li> it did not reach a hot tempurature.</li>
            <li> also many questions about internal voltage change from country to country.</li>
            <li> I love the temp control setting; I keep it on a very low setting.</li>
            <li> I owned one of these years ago, when they first started selling them at the mall.</li>
            <li> I found that those actually work better than this one.</li>
            <li> You may need something sprayed on your hair first before you use this.</li>
            <li> Is it hot?  </li>
            <li> heat is consistent and the hair is bouncy and silky.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a temp gauge that allows for you to decide just how hot you need it.</li>
            <li> But I really missed it when I broke it!</li>
            <li> After the first two years of ownership I noticed the product&#x27;s declining performance.</li>
            <li> so I needed something to get my hair straight without the smell and frizzies, this does the job!</li>
            <li> I was looking at a higher priced 100% ceramic, but decided to try this first.  </li>
            <li> Rest assured this will not damage your hair no matter how hot it gets.  </li>
            <li> It will only make it shinier and softer :)</li>
            <li> and I paid about $100 for my first iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, do NOT pay the $200 they want you to spend at the mall, hopefully you&#x27;ve found the Amazon product page first.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as good as the real one , feels cheaper and had a funny smell when turned on and made a slight buzzing noise.</li>
            <li> Amazing, high quality flat iron.</li>
            <li> I try not to use alot of heat on my hair and i was flat ironing about every two weeks, which worked out great because my hair last(straight) pretty long.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, superior temperature control, does not fry or damage hair, alters texture quickly and completely and it lasts, no extra tools or styling products needed - in fact the less the better, and curls tips too.</li>
            <li> This product arrived a day before it was due, so that was nice.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has stopped using her flat iron and now use mine, I am so pleased with it that I am now buying one for my daughter in law.  </li>
            <li> I love my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many flat irons</li>
            <li> In love with my herstyler flat iron.</li>
            <li> The name-brand ones work better and are pretty much the same price.</li>
            <li> I think the Chi is a better flat iron to straighten hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the flat iron, it is just what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I received my flat iron within 2 days, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Did I say I love this flat iron?  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have had many flat irons, even CHI</li>
            <li> Better than my $100 flat irons.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to curl my hair with the flat iron and this one doesn&#x27;t do it for some reason.</li>
            <li> I love the way the Hairstyler ceramic flat irons turn my naturally frizzy and curly hair into a smooth, silky and straight tamed style.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I will be buying the better flat iron!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Those who love this product obviously don&#x27;t know what the real ones feel and look like and therefore because this is a hair straightener, it will work to some extent.</li>
            <li> The Herstyler is the first to NOT damage my hair, it actually IS pure ceramic, not just ceramic COATED</li>
            <li> Overall this flat iron is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The original flat iron temperature only heated up to 200, but overall I was always so happy with this product until I dropped mine and the ceramic plates broke.</li>
            <li> Straightens hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick to my old Revlon flat iron until I buy a nice one like a Chi or something.</li>
            <li> and it stated I should receive it by the end of the week which was pretty fast</li>
            <li> The light would turn on but it&#x27;d apparently burnt itself out.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend that much on a straightener</li>
            <li> Really like that it has a dial for how hot you want it.</li>
            <li> Ordered in the past, this are not as good.</li>
            <li> I hear all the rave about how great Chi is and sorry, but fom the looks of the damaged hair of those who own them, I have stayed far away from that fixed temperature device.  </li>
            <li> I do not know how other Flat Irons rate, but this one is great</li>
            <li> but my friend has the same one and can do it easily.</li>
            <li> The temperature gauge is set between the top and bottom moving parts (sandwiched into the center sort of), so that if you have heat the appliance and need to adjust the temperature setting, you risk burning your fingers when you turn the dial because it is set too close to the hot ceramic plates.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> It has such a strong burning odor that I had to stop using it at work since people would come in thinking that the &amp;#34;heater&amp;#34; was on.</li>
            <li> I received my item 2 days later and was EXTREMELY PLEASED AND HAPPY to see it was the exact same flat iron from the herstyler.com website and my friend&#x27;s flat iron.</li>
            <li> I realized that she must have given me a great discount because her co-worker looked at the printout and sounded kind of disappointed that I wouldn&#x27;t be paying so much for a gift set.  </li>
            <li> I love my new ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The only iron that really worked and made my hair look smooth and</li>
            <li> My friends and family who know how curly my hair is still surprised every time they see how soft and smooth it gets.  </li>
            <li> The real ones come with a silver circular seal on it.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I absolutely</li>
            <li> and strong(and I have really coarse/curly hair).</li>
            <li> My hair is as straight and bouncy as when I go to the salon.  </li>
            <li> After 1 pass, my hair is silky straight.  </li>
            <li> And it is straight... swinging and bouncy straight.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely adore this straightner.</li>
            <li> Fast heat up time  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had hair that has difficulty staying straight...</li>
            <li> comment on how much they like it.</li>
            <li> I used it very often on myself, family and friends.  </li>
            <li> but I found it online at a VERY discounted price</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It manages to make your hair stay straight all day, and makes it shiny as well.</li>
            <li> My scalp is very tender</li>
            <li> I am VERY inquisitive, and I asked her about the Chi that everyone has been telling me about for years, and she told me that it isn&#x27;t 100% ceramic AND showed me as proof.  </li>
            <li> There are people selling products that are very well crafted knock offs.  </li>
            <li> This one has lasted and is so much nicer to my hair.</li>
            <li> It stays straight.</li>
            <li> It is also very durable.  </li>
            <li> and I really didnt want to pay $200 for it again, but I would have.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t want to pay that much again.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and does everything I need it to.</li>
            <li> Straightened or curled hair seems to hold the shape very well and longer  CONS:  100% ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li> No wonder price was discounted so much.</li>
            <li> and I got it fast</li>
            <li> i was very hurt....</li>
            <li> Came as described, fast delivery, I have not used it yet</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy this, just be very carful with it.</li>
            <li> I like this iron because it gets my hair straight, and it has adjustable settings.</li>
            <li> High end straightener !</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail and it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This really does make your hair silkier and softer, it also helps with humidity.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li> This styler has my daughters hair bone straight.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> even when I straight my hair it tugs.</li>
            <li> Did not straighten my hair very.</li>
            <li> It straightens your hair and curls very well.</li>
            <li> I much prefer my curling iron</li>
            <li> I did not like how pushy the sales person was, because it really seemed like he wasn&#x27;t going to let me walk away without buying anything.</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s REAL one I paid $300 for died after 4 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take my chances on the real one for $300.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just thinking you bought something real and finding out</li>
            <li> Fakers, invent something real and manufacture that.</li>
            <li> Lightly touch the outside of the iron.  </li>
            <li> This is not the real deal...</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are absolutely 100% ceramic.</li>
            <li> and it did not hold the straighteness for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am so much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really apprehensive to buy this</li>
            <li> The plates arent as fragile as others make them out to sound, but of course I am not slinging mine around like a lasso..</li>
            <li> But for the price this really is a quality iron.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair very shiny</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend it to any client.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> How much hair do you straighten at once?</li>
            <li> was a real savings to me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron, I bought it since my stylist said she had never had a problem with a cermic flat iron and that it truely didn&#x27;t seem to ever burn hair.</li>
            <li> So, I was walking in the mall one day a few years ago, and got stopped by a nice man who wanted to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you are constantly re shaping your hair on a daily basis, this might be the product for you, the temperature control feature will be handy.</li>
            <li> So in short, if you can buy one at Amazon for such a nice price, then why not.  </li>
            <li> Hair is left soft and manageable:).</li>
            <li> So I was thrilled that I found it on amazon for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I am going back to using my old Revlon one that slides better on my hair and does not feel like its pulling my hair out as I straighten it.</li>
            <li> It does a good job ironing my hair which is wavy, medium thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> As a mother I know how hard it is sometimes to find just the right thing for a teenage girl, and when she  used her Herstyler and loved it, I knew I had made the right choice in purchasing the Herstyler.</li>
            <li> I first bought a Conair wet to dry hair straightener (max temp 375) and never got good result</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is a must if you have more than one person using the iron, medium to fine or chemically treated hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quickly, and once I use it I don&#x27;t have to use it again until I wash my hair, which can be anywhere from 3-5 days later.  </li>
            <li> It gets super hot in the outside of the straighter</li>
            <li> I just baught this one in April pretty much new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just plain handy  Textured grip for secured handling.  </li>
            <li> (I may actually be relaxer free if it works this well on MY new growth!)</li>
            <li> I was jumping for joy and ecstatic that I had received my flat iron in LESS THAN 24 HOURS!</li>
            <li> i originally purchased one from a kiosk at the mall, back when they were selling them at the \\&quot;low\\&quot; price of $100.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for that, I would have gladly purchased cheaper ones off of this site, while using extreme caution.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived, we were extremely pleased that it is the exact same product we paid over $100 for 2 years prior.</li>
            <li> This flat iron leaves my hair silky and smooth and NEVER leaves any heat damage to it.</li>
            <li> I like how this flat iron makes your hair so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> so I really wanted the high heat.</li>
            <li> so I only use it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> He is all about free anything, so he was just mainly trying to see if someone else would do my hair for free, even though I am the only person who does my hair, on a professional and personal level.  </li>
            <li> I have the kind of hair that looks like a giant haystack unless I put a lot of product in it, or dry it for a couple days under wraps in a bun or braid.</li>
            <li> and when I came back the Iron was completely cool and still works.</li>
            <li> My curly hair will be soft, shiny and STRAIGHT as a pin once again!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice and heavy!</li>
            <li> like seeing my normally wavy hair straight.</li>
            <li> My thick, curly hair can be straightened more quickly, efficiently, easily, safely, and in a less damaging way with this.</li>
            <li> Like many, I have been through the mall and been talked into letting some excited individual use this flat iron on my hair, only to have me walk away once they tell me the price.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron definitely gets hot enough and i love it!</li>
            <li> my hair has become more healthier with less split ends.</li>
            <li> This  particular  </li>
            <li> HerStyler Classic</li>
            <li> In just a few minutes I was able to get all the frizz and fluffiness out of my hair and into sleek straight tresses that stayed that way for hours.</li>
            <li> but this flat iron really smoothed the shafts right to the very end.</li>
            <li> They last better to the next day even, quite amazing since my hair has a hard time holding shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should work on any thickness though, it heats to high temps.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have to turn it up to a high setting to achieve the look I want.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> that at high temps you&#x27;ll probably need a glove to touch</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> :o)I would highly recommand this straigthner to anyone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fake kind of strips you of your dignity, which is exactly how I felt and why I&#x27;m venting in this review right now, please forgive me.</li>
            <li> Same flat iron as those sold at the mall for much more money.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am able to give my hair volume by simply using the flat iron to make it into a bit of a curl by twisting it like it was a hair curling iron.    </li>
            <li> It heats u super fast, you have a wide range of options for the heat settings (I use it at the lowest 180F) and keeps hair straight.</li>
            <li> I got this Herstyler on sale at Amazon, so I not only got a first class styler, I saved money doing it !  </li>
            <li> As I open my front door much to my surprise there was my package waiting for me!!</li>
            <li> leaves my hair so soft and shiny and it heats within seconds!!</li>
            <li> It broke because I dropped it on concrete from a high distance</li>
            <li> it was the first thing in my whole life that curled my hair and my hair wasn&#x27;t straight again by the time I finished the other side of my head because my hair is BOARD STRAIGHT!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron ever, I have spent so much money buying other flat iron</li>
            <li> These flat irons work quickly and I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair 5 times.  </li>
            <li> I have badly damaged hair form dying it alot, but this iron smooths it out and makes my hair look beautiful!</li>
            <li> This does not heat up near as much a my real one does.</li>
            <li> Both get my hair straight but neither leave my hair as shiny,smooth,and soft as the Herstyler.</li>
            <li> My hair looks soft, shiny and straight for 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li> I had an old one that I bought 7 years ago and it just stopped working from me dropping it so much</li>
            <li> I almost wonder if its a fake herstyler or this iron is just not that great.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair which requires a lot of heat when wanting to wear my hair straight.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair so soft straight and silky.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so much healthier and softer than my old straightener did.</li>
            <li> Also I had it in 3 days , normal shipping.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and works ten times better than my broken CHI.  </li>
            <li> herstyler is much easier to use than my curling iron, makes nicer curls that last longer than the one made with the curling iron or hot rollers.</li>
            <li> so it does not hold them normally.</li>
            <li> I also see now that patents are created not only so someone doesn&#x27;t make money off of someone else&#x27;s product, but because people put in so much time inventing something for a reason, and this hair straightener proves that statement completely.</li>
            <li> Compared to my old Revlon one (which, by the way is not broken i just felt like buying a new one)</li>
            <li> It was much less expensive here on Amazon, but actually it is such a good flat iron that I would have gladly paid much more.  </li>
            <li> I went with a Solia Tourmaline Flat Iron (sold at folica.com) and it worked pretty good, but definitely not as good as the Herstyler did.</li>
            <li> I tried it by sliding it all the way to the right and all the way to the left and nothing.  </li>
            <li> I sent it back right away.</li>
            <li> How there are 17 left right now is beyond me.</li>
            <li> I know because I abused my first flat iron so much that I busted the plate.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Herstyler flat irons in the past for my daughters and we have had a good experience with all of their products.</li>
            <li> I have fine limp hair that is straight no matter what I do to it.</li>
            <li> Glides down the hair easily  </li>
            <li> and it still works as if it were brand new.</li>
            <li> I paid $150 for a brand new CHI at Target</li>
            <li> and it still works like new.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
            <li> the ceramic is as new.</li>
            <li> Seller claimed product was new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll listen to what he has to say about the product before I walk away, as I was on the market to purchasing a new iron anyway.</li>
            <li> No way was I spending $300 for a new one</li>
            <li> For awhile now I have been shopping on Amazon wondering why some of the products I was looking at were cheaper brand new than some used things on ebay.</li>
            <li> That is why I had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I m returning this iron, it was sold it to me as new</li>
            <li> Even though I probably shouldn&#x27;t have, I continued to use it until my new one arrived.</li>
            <li> It doesnt burn your hair and make it feel dry and look flat and lifeless like others and love</li>
            <li> Total salon needs filled with one tool and now utterly affordable.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34; heavy&amp;#34; is not a problem for daily use but important to a stylist who uses it multiple times throughout a day.  </li>
            <li> I was u able to return it to get money back because I had closed the credit card I used to buy it.</li>
            <li> He used this exact product, Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for natural ladies like myself.</li>
            <li> But i know for sure that my conair wet to straight 2&amp;#34; flat iron has a digital thermometer, i know im not suppose to steam my hair straight.</li>
            <li> My wife broke hers and wanted the exact same model to replace hers.</li>
            <li> Second time buying one if these, first one lasted 4 years</li>
            <li> I had the $130 exact same brand from the mall</li>
            <li> I bought my first iron maybe 4 years ago and it finally gave out....</li>
            <li> My husband was like &#x27;WOW!</li>
            <li> They are exactly the same</li>
            <li> What caught my eye first was 100% ceramic plates and then second ...</li>
            <li> I first saw it in my local mall and wanted it but wasn&#x27;t going to pay the 100</li>
            <li> This time around it was $20 for the exact same thing!</li>
            <li> It did a less than satisfactory job on fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m quite relieved to find these listed on amazon now too because this company originally had some foreign name I can&#x27;t pronounce or remember,</li>
            <li> Gets super hot and takes less than 10 min to straighten hair every morning!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived super fast, about a week and a half sooner than was</li>
            <li> The construction seems cheap - the heat control is a plastic knob you dial up or down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it works well, thin enough to make soft curls, after more than 2 yrs</li>
            <li> Most premium brand flat irons for sale (ex. CHI, GHD, SEDU,...) will last you ~3-4 years with daily use.</li>
            <li> Wow what a rip off, and when it broke they refused to give me a new one, which they promised a lifetie warranty.</li>
            <li> My friend bragged about a new straightener she purchased at the mall for nearly 100 buckaroos</li>
            <li> Amazon allowed me to return this product, and gave me free shipping on another re-order which was also inaccurately described as a 1.5&amp;#34; iron (Herstyler Superstyler Onyx Hair Straightener Black, 1.5&amp;#34; Ceramic Plates).</li>
            <li> Item arrived with no instructions, only a long, detailed safety warning.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold, does not get heavy.  </li>
            <li> After going to the mall and seeing what the ceramic flat irons can do, I was excited to hop online and seek the same quality product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> My old Conair Infiniti flat iron was not as hot as it was originally and could no longer deal with my African American naturally curly 3b-4a BSL hair.</li>
            <li> The flat iron works exactly like the $200 one i purchased 5+ years ago and</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34; I compared the two and they work exactly the same giving you the same results.</li>
            <li> I first heard of the HERSTYLER ceramic flat iron from a friend who had purchased hers at a mall and paid $100</li>
            <li> So at first I was hesitant to buy this flat iron since the picture they have doesn&#x27;t depict correct logo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrified to use a herstyler flat iron now and very sad as it straightened my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> However, after a week of using it the power cord seemed loose and the red light that shows the straightner is on or heating up was flickering off and on.</li>
            <li> These products are sold at very high prices in various malls</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fantastic and came in original packaging but was missing the black heat protector bag that&#x27;s shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes its hard finding a good product for african american hair.</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t completely shut off and stop working....</li>
            <li> Also I personally didn&#x27;t like to do my hair very often since it was known to take 4 hours to do.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.   </li>
            <li> I am 22 years old today.</li>
            <li> I use a protective lotion to prevent heat damage and the HerStyler leaves my hair with a natural shine.  </li>
            <li> My  hair  was  straight,  but  then,  I  simply  flipped  it  under  </li>
            <li> Prior to buying the Herstyler, I had been using a Conair and Remington for years and neither made my hair straight all day.</li>
            <li> I can never make all the hair appear like a professional styled it or that natural effortless look.  </li>
            <li> My old ones were nothing like this one.</li>
            <li> it gets my hair just as straight as my chi at almost a third of the price.</li>
            <li> because when I do all of my hair, it doesn&#x27;t always stay as straight as it initially is until I wash my hair</li>
            <li> So here are the pros and cons thus far from my perspective:  </li>
            <li> Leaves the hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> As far was the packaging and delivering, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> this thing reheats fast enough that I can do ten-twenty sections before pausing.</li>
            <li> It was an old Revlon ceramic plated just like this Herstyler iron.</li>
            <li> It beats the chi by far.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re saving so much money, I swear by this straightener, curls last</li>
            <li> and it had a fixed temperature setting which did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> the styler should completely straighten and seal the cuticle.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> After 2 months it went completely out.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from permed hair to natural</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny and no smell.</li>
            <li> Like my old straightener the plates don&#x27;t close evenly leaving the ever slightest gap.</li>
            <li> And it was nowhere near the $150 I had paid for the professional version.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased it for me and I am blown away by how silky soft and bouncy hair was after using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thats really the only way i could see these breaking..</li>
            <li> My hair constantly gets caught in this thing and there is no indication when it is ready to use.</li>
            <li> How long do you keep the hot plates against your hair?</li>
            <li> It takes 3 or 4 passes over hair to actually get it straight at all.</li>
            <li> Yes, the outer part of the iron has a funny texture and can give you a callous the first few times of use, but after that, you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like a ceramic flat iron should.  </li>
            <li> Not really wanting to spend the money for another one (I originally paid $150 for one at a local mall kiosk)</li>
            <li> ten times like I would other flat irons and the shine is amazing... definitely take advantage of this deal on here!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is an absolute must have.</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I really believed I would never see those $25 or the flat iron again.</li>
            <li> I have over processed damaged hair so almost all flat irons pull my hair and never get it pin straight.</li>
            <li> Granted, this one has a much lower price than the Chi, but my hair looks noticeably healthier when I am not using this flat iron.</li>
            <li> plastic body of the flat iron has held up very well.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, so don&#x27;t get ripped off by the flat irons they sell at the mall.</li>
            <li> It arrived just yesterday and sure enough, this is the EXACT same iron with the unbelievable salon-like effects!</li>
            <li> I really like this Flat iron would recommend it!</li>
            <li> it worked very well on my natural hair(No perm..Thick &amp; long)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be ridiculous to buy these types of  &amp;#34;kiosk&amp;#34; straighteners for more than $30.</li>
            <li> However, it does not get wavy enough again to necessitate re-straightening, and it has worked better than straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past.    </li>
            <li> This product has made Curling my hair not only possible but fast!</li>
            <li> I must have had it set too high the last time I used it though because it burned my hair</li>
            <li> I had spent so much money buying flat iron after flat iron because I had so many complaints about all of my other ones.</li>
            <li> Should I wait for the little red light to turn off before using the appliance?</li>

            <li> B002LE8OX8 Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron]]</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought a new one is because my dog ate my cord.</li>
            <li> so when I was looking for a new one I knew I wanted the same one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s finally time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> You can buy the same ceramic flat iron at Kmart for 1/3 of the price, looks and works identical with the large price.</li>
            <li> I normally have to oil my hair before flat ironing, but with HerStyler</li>
            <li> No other straighter could compete with it in my book.</li>
            <li> Next time I will spend the extra money on higher quality in hopes that it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Just to give some scale to the review, here is a description of my hair type: Thick, long, naturally wavy, slighty frizzy, mostly air-dried, never dyed, never highlighted, and</li>
            <li> It pulls at my hair, and I have normal almost straight hair with odd waves in it.  </li>
            <li> Ceramic provides even heating and less damage if used on the right temperature setting for your hair type.  </li>
            <li> I am not great at styling my hair; so having something that is easy to use was important to me.&lt;br /&gt;I watched a few tutorials on using this styler to curl hair, and decided that I needed to get one.</li>
            <li> My  new  Herstyler  flat  </li>
            <li> I had already planned to purchase a new flat iron yesterday, but hadn&#x27;t decided which one.  </li>
            <li> This straightner is 97.00 on the herstyler web site I got it for less then half that I love it and wanted to get another one.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different hair straighteners ( seriously I have 4 in my drawer).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited, definitely a steal of a deal,if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap  because of low budget,you couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I can use low heat when necessary or use high heat.</li>
            <li> I still think this straightener is worth $150, but hey.. I&#x27;m not gonna turn down a steal like this!</li>
            <li> Generally one sweep w/</li>
            <li> I still have my old one as a back up and travel one.  </li>
            <li> but after I got permanent straightening done on my hair it changed its texture and now it looks rough, frizzy and very curly.</li>
            <li> It pulls on the ends of my hair if I&#x27;m not careful though.  </li>
            <li> Early the next morning I was checking my emails to track my package</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got naturally curly red hair,which with a 20$ Straightener would take 3 hours, I&#x27;ve tried,but this one,I had done my hair in 5 or so minutes and for TWENTY dollars !</li>
            <li> They sell the same one at the mall near my house for 200 dollars.</li>
            <li> It is naturally curly in back and wavy in front.</li>
            <li> I only wish it had an auto off feature because i sometimes forget that, as my old one did.  </li>
            <li> so I came on here and was so surprised it was only $20.</li>
            <li> (Only spent $60) on the first one.</li>
            <li> I believe the &amp;#34;Forever&amp;#34; model is a 1.5&amp;#34; iron, and since the first one I received several years ago was a 1.5&amp;#34; iron, I expected to get a 1.5&amp;#34; iron on my re-order.  </li>
            <li> still think it feels a bit chinsy, and I am afraid of it breaking, but the functionality is good.</li>
            <li> It is hot 450 degrees with a control to turn it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same flat iron only much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take quite as long to make my hair straight with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> It was burning hot in less than 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates chipped and cracked on my first one after having it for less than a year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After my previous HerStyler croaked (it never stopped getting hot-</li>
            <li> it keeps it straight for the whole 1st day and only a few touch-ups are needed for the second day</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, and I don&#x27;t mean the good mixed hair kind, I mean the really tightly curled hard to straighten.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron when I was 17 years old and have had it ever since.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough and small enough to travel with.  </li>
            <li> Not everyone needs to fry their hair with a fixed 392 degree flat iron, or</li>
            <li> This flat iron does the job, but is far below the quality of a Chi hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I pulled her away and searched for it online, finding it on amazon.com for MUCH less than the folks in the mall were selling it for ($150!!).  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this product for African American women to have natural hair.</li>
            <li> I already have two InStylers (I think they were between 120.00 and 150.00 while they had a discounted sale going on when they first came out) and a flat iron that I spent over 200 dollars on just by itself!    </li>
            <li> When I first purchased it, the product worked just as well as any other premium brand flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had a pink one with my older flatiron .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot and takes a little longer to reheat.  </li>
            <li> The hair straightener has a dial from the least hotness to 180 degrees, I believe, and even on the lowest setting, it&#x27;s straightened better than any other hair straightener I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female and I am transitioning from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li> My GHD flat iron recently stopped operating as normal so went to my salon for a treatment and flat iron.</li>
            <li> Because of my schedule, I usually shower at night right before bed.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast, maybe less than 1 minute and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> However it won&#x27;t give you results the real one gives you and will probably break in less than a month.</li>
            <li> In thin sections it is easy to straighten.</li>
            <li> It was as if I never flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago just to have a new flat iron because my previous one was about 5 yrs old.</li>
            <li> It generally takes her over an hour to straighten her hair, but it only took us 20 mins with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> came before the expected date, actually about 5 days early!</li>
            <li> The ceramic plates began to discolor within the first few months of owning the flat iron.</li>
            <li> (The real box has the choose your fashion label on the back in black, not white and Le, Ni, Dv, Tp 1.75 and 440 are all on the back as well almost looking like a bio chart)</li>
            <li> Most products in general don&#x27;t usually work for me or only do minimally to the point where I&#x27;ve basically wasted money, yet again, but this is not one of those products.    </li>
            <li> I can straighten my whole head in 5 minutes, and my hair is long down to the middle of my back!</li>
            <li> Normally I keep my hair pulled into a bun, since getting this straightener I wear my hair down all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many expensive salon and hairdresser recommended flat irons throughout the years and this is the ONLY one that gives me results</li>
            <li> I finally recently broke down and bought a new one.  </li>
            <li> The logo/etc aren&#x27;t exactly the way these flat irons usually look.</li>
            <li> I am Asian, so I have the naturally flat hair that simply won&#x27;t curl.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually, I&#x27;d spend around $100-$200 on a &amp;#34;good quality&amp;#34; flat iron, but this one being only $20, gives me the same quality</li>
            <li> I use this flat iron all day on African American hair .The  </li>
            <li> Obviously, this wasn&#x27;t a big deal as I still continued to use the flat iron over this extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since HerStyler is trying to sell these flat irons in the same price range, one would assume and expect the same product quality.</li>
            <li> I also had purchased the same product over two years ago and paid over a hundred dollars for same flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I am not a fan of curling irons or flat irons because the right look has always been hard for me to achieve.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is less than half the price of folica&#x27;s \\&quot;best\\&quot; (the Sedu) and definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I just received this flat iron last week.</li>
            <li> But anyway this is the only flat iron that works on my hair period.  </li>
            <li> This is the same flat iron that was being sold in the mall for $180.00.  </li>
            <li> Ive had the same straightener for 8 years till it finally died and herstyler products last long.</li>
            <li> I paid $120.00 for the Herstyler flat iron in the mall several years ago.  </li>
            <li> The ceramic on the flat iron was different also, it keeps pulling on my hair.</li>
            <li> Before i even used it the flat iron plug popped off in the back</li>
            <li> I thought all flat irons were the same.  </li>
            <li> The price is competitive with similar ceramic flat irons.</li>
            <li> why would someone only give 3/5 stars for a flat iron that lasted them 5 years?</li>
            <li> Well thats because I only used the flat iron</li>
            <li> i will never order an alternate flat iron - herstyler fan for life!</li>
            <li> They work with either long or short hair, and mine is short, but growing out, so it is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> THIS is one of the few that can manage the curls and make them straight for a long time.</li>
            <li> I went to the shop once and was so disappointed at how pouffy my hair looked that I went to the mall and bought one of these after remembering how good it worked when the guy gave me a brief demo at the mall.  </li>
            <li> I found the sellers California Distributors had the same brand and style flat iron for a STEAL OF A DEAL $25!!</li>
            <li> and I have been trying different methods to stretch my relaxers, such as blow drying very close to the scalp, flat ironing as close as the heat will allow me to get, and using hot curlers on the new growth, all of which hurt me so badly and take up a lot of time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure really what it is</li>
            <li> I use this Flat Iron all the time.  </li>
            <li> This has been designated as my &#x27;emergency&#x27; flat iron.</li>
            <li> I could have bought this flat iron for $100.00 there,or go on the website and it would cost almost $300.00.  </li>
            <li> Works well, gets up to 460 degrees in heat-the hottest flat iron that&#x27;s sold.  </li>
            <li> I got this flat iron on recommendation of someone who purchased at kiosk at the mall.</li>
            <li> I have now 3 flat irons...</li>
            <li> So I can flat iron my hair in about 20 mins.</li>
            <li> I hope they will not stop making this flat iron because I don&#x27;t need to go to salon anymore.</li>
            <li> Also, I have tried to curl with the flat iron..</li>
            <li> I have long blonde extentions and it makes them so shiney.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy it because I&#x27;ve purchased flat irons that couldn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about a year now</li>
            <li> yes, you CAN use the flat iron to both straighten your hair AND curl it.</li>
            <li> Before buying this flat iron, I bought another from Sally for twice the price, and returned it...</li>
            <li> I was intending on buying the CHI flat iron but decided to purchase the Herstyler instead</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron, and I returned it.</li>
            <li> I hope it last as long.</li>
            <li> flat  </li>
            <li> I question whether or not I turned off the flat iron.</li>
            <li> having baught this flat iron.</li>
            <li> They broke one of the actually flat irons to show us that what this product is 100% ceramic.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays nicely flat all day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> , i decided that i&#x27;d never again spend $100+ on a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Problem is, there is no need to use a flat iron at anything over 350 degrees for my hair type unless I am getting a brazillian treatment, then I need 450.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE SEEN THIS FLAT IRON</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a couple of years ago</li>
            <li> I have had my herstyler flat iron for 2 years.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is a fire hazard.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long hair and both straighten it daily with this one straightener.  </li>
            <li> and I never used flat iron before</li>
            <li> It curls my hair as well which a lot of flat irons can not do.</li>
            <li> I purchased the flat iron on Monday September 15th</li>
            <li> and It stated that my flat iron had already been delivered.</li>
            <li> Even after flat ironing my hair still has kinks and looks frizzy but not with this tool</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 2 inch flat iron and according to the description, this one is 2.2 inches.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a wider flat iron, do not purchase this one.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless I ordered my flat iron and had emailed the selller:</li>
            <li> I uploaded a picture showing the packaging it comes in and flat iron with warranty card.</li>
            <li> This flat iron seems to tug/pull my hair.  </li>
            <li> I adore this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I had never used a flat iron on my hair before today.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron would straighten the hair</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a couple of years ago and still using it.</li>
            <li> I have the flat iron and the 3M exchangeable clipless curling wands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my flat iron does it all.</li>
            <li> I asked my stylist what flat iron did she use</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this flat iron for &#x27;curling&#x27; my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this flat iron for my mom and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this flat iron to last long, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I am mixed race so my hair is natural tightly curled.</li>
            <li> I was a little upset that I had spent so much for a straightener but</li>
            <li> I have had dry brittle hair and after using this flat iron along with the crack hair product my hair is shiny and recovering after using these products only two weeks.  </li>
            <li> have extra thick afro hair that I wear straight by blow drying and flat ironing</li>
            <li> So of course, I was just ready to prove the saleswoman wrong and figured that NOTHING could really do anything to straighten my hair as well as what I was already using.  </li>
            <li> Half way through I went to clamp it on a section if hair and it just completely shattered.</li>
            <li> and your actually suppose to use it when your hair is 80% dry.</li>
            <li> The item does straighten hair quickly; however, the design is poor and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair, and it leaves it shiny and straight!!</li>
            <li> My hair is straight in less time than the average device.  </li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying this flat iron, DO IT!!</li>
            <li> I had a ceramic-coated flat iron for so long because 200 dollars is a ridiculous amount of money for hot slabs of metal.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying a flat iron so cheap</li>
            <li> it closes very well at the tip of the straightener but leaves a slight gap in the inner part causing uneven pressure and snagging.&lt;br /&gt;#2</li>
            <li> Way better than the Chi or other expensive straightening irons.</li>
            <li> (means less heat on hair) and then flat iron with no other products.</li>
            <li> Mine just now started to slowly stop working, but only because the cord is coming loose, which very well could be my fault for wrapping it around the straightener when I am done with it.</li>
            <li> Just because you have a flat iron that heats above 410 degrees, doesn&#x27;t mean that high heat is what you need for your hair.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all your $40 will end up going to is the look and maybe the cord for the plug, at least that part was real.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the temperature control dial, even if it is in an awkward location.</li>
            <li> and she has long hair and with this one being narrower that is what it didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> It  did  not  take  long  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend was curious about the kiosk in the mall, so we stopped by last night to see what it was all about.  </li>
            <li> after my 3 year old daughter killed my chi by dunking it in the commode, don&#x27;t worry--it was in a drawer, not plugged in or turned on</li>
            <li> and she has long hair.</li>
            <li> Long swivel cord.  </li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> Bought this not to long ago.</li>
            <li> We spent a lot of money on the same product at the mall a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> However, it is actually 1 inch wide.</li>
            <li> But, since I had already spent the money, I just stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;I was recently stopped by one of the guys at the mall kiosk and thought, what the heck.</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t damage my long hair</li>
            <li> Then again, only pushy salespeople at mall kiosks sell these with the wide haggling range of $30-$200....</li>
            <li> I bought this styler to replace my old one, which I had for a few years.</li>
            <li> (How long do you allow the straigtener to heat up?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heat-producing electrical appliance for crying out loud.</li>
            <li> as others have mentioned, I spent $150 on my last one when I bought it from a kiosk at the mall.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick but manageable and this can t even get them straight at the maximum heat setting, also your hair will get stuck in the plates and break.</li>
            <li> I managed to talk the pushy salesperson down from $200 to $30, so I can only imagine what this product actually costs wholesale.</li>
            <li> Its just plain old non glossy black, no zebra print, leopard print, hot pink or neon green stripes or polka dots.  </li>
            <li> ive left other ones on before (Chi) and it ended up dying after a couple months.</li>
            <li> Well my daughter, which has very long hair, tested this straightner and now will use nothing else.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s when I discovered the EXACT same flat iron (and serum) on Amazon for the unbelievable price of $20!!!</li>
            <li> They work great initially, and then they begin to malfunction and then the buyers rant and rave on sites saying that it is a horrible products</li>
            <li> I had to do it after it was dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair</li>
            <li> Use a syrum in your hair after you shower, let your hair air dry</li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair and have tried to straighten it in the past.  </li>
            <li> I found that if you are cautious of your hair type and don&#x27;t put a ton of heat on it, it actually will help you not to have to get deep conditioning treatments or even a \\&quot;cut\\&quot; for dead ends as often.</li>
            <li> I can curl my entire head in ten minutes or less!</li>
            <li> The plates are way off and way small, they&#x27;re risen instead of indented, they pull hair, the screws are stripped metal screws not those black triangle screws like on the real one</li>
            <li> Will never use anything other than ceramic (for a flat iron) again.</li>
            <li> We are an african american family with thick and coarse hair</li>
            <li> The product itself is difficult to use, becomes way too hot, no way to easily slide hair thru to the ends, can&#x27;t be used abroad (see warranty), so generally is mostly useless.</li>
            <li> I realized it was the same issue with the previous one</li>
            <li> Thank you to those who rated this product previously, it helped in making my decision and with proper care of it.</li>
            <li> but i must say that even when i do steam my soppy wet hair &amp; it comes out dry too.</li>
            <li> ] on wet hair too, it will both instantly dry and style it.</li>
            <li> I was super sad when my straightener broke after 5+ years of putting this baby to work.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and curly.  </li>
            <li> The list of things that one must do to avoid invalidating the so-called warranty is endless &amp; way too long to reprint here.</li>
            <li> The real ones were invented to do what regular hair straighteners can&#x27;t do, and my wife could curl her hair with her straightener and now she can curve it a bit with the fake one and it doesn&#x27;t hold long at all.</li>
            <li> And this one looked a little different.</li>
            <li> a guy at one of the little booths in the middle of the mall asked me if I wanted to straighten my hair...</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair and after blow drying, I&#x27;m left with a frizzy and still somewhat wavy mess.</li>
            <li> And the only reason I replaced it, is because my son knocked it off the counter onto the time floor and the plates chipped a little on the edges.</li>
            <li> I had the herstyler BLACK flat iron.</li>
            <li> The cheap brand just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> Wide</li>
            <li> I was still skeptical about the product however since I had yet to use it on my hair freshly washed.  </li>
            <li> So he straightens it out in only a few minutes</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with this.  </li>
            <li> I was at a local mall a few months ago and was approached by an overly aggressive salesperson who insisted I try the iron-</li>
            <li> I am used to curling irons and have not really tried mastering it with the straightener.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I had had it for a few months, I tried the knob again and finally it let me turn it all the way up!</li>
            <li> This is NOT REAL.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be like the ones they offer you in shopping malls for like $150.</li>
            <li> The ceramic WILL CRACK if you drop it, so be careful where you set it.</li>
            <li> So sad my other one has broken plates because it still heats up amazingly.</li>
            <li> (I mean show stopping bling, even from far distances)  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and its hard to find a flat iron thats hot enough to tame it!</li>
            <li> (I have fairly long, thick in density but moderate thickness in hair shaft size), I can do it in about half an hour, which is actually quicker than with other straighteners I&#x27;ve had because I need to go over it fewer times.  </li>
            <li> I spend less time straightening my long hair because the product works so well.</li>
            <li> When I found the exact same straighter online at a fraction of the price, I was a little skeptical.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little disappointed, but that was no big deal because it comes in a lovely box with a magnet closure which is where I keep it once it cools.  </li>
            <li> before I spent 100.00 on other ones.</li>
            <li> It had a small piece of regular tape keeping it closed.</li>
            <li> i have moderately thick long blonde hair</li>
            <li> It has always been a chore to detangle my hair, which is why my mother eventually started to relax my hair and even though I&#x27;d like to be natural with straight hair, it was impossible with my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black girl with thick natural hair.</li>
            <li> Even now in winter when I can tend to have awful dry hair stick ups, I feel this keeps things looking good.  </li>
            <li> Only lasted a few months, I had my previous CHI for years!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to do with my other 2 metal irons.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother looking for any other irons.</li>
            <li> this iron does NOT crisp upon my ends like others and with the hair serum</li>
            <li> and we knew she wouldn&#x27;t be there until maybe 30 minutes from now, so she told us to pay her other co-worker who would be there this morning.  </li>
            <li> I had never used anything on my hair, other than a curling iron once and a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for three years when the other day I plugged it up to do my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product to seal storage bags and it worked extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Also I like this one because with dyed hair, it does not pull out the color due to the ceramic plates, or something.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit at first I was skeptical on buying it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely waivy hair and this Iron</li>
            <li> To address a couple concerns from other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had one other one that lasted me 3-4 to years.  </li>
            <li> Now I know it wasn&#x27;t due to product residue, because I cleaned it after every use (either damp microfiber cloth &amp; drop of soap or isopropanol).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as other straighteners I owned</li>
            <li> Then I thought, maybe I&#x27;ll just spend the extra money and try a different expensive brand to compare (since there were other flat irons out there with rave reviews).</li>
            <li> Be very careful.</li>
            <li> I love the wide base and heat setting.  </li>
            <li> They only put a thin coat of ceramic on the Chi flat irons.  </li>
            <li> My old one was dying, and I desperately needed a replacement for the little frizzies/curlicues that pop up just near my forehead and make me look like a bag lady.  </li>
            <li> I use it on average 4 days a week and have been doing this for a number of months.  </li>
            <li> I would say its average.</li>
            <li> was sad but as I said, I didn&#x27;t pay much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick, coarse or unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> I just hate that i dont have it any more.</li>
            <li> I have thick, moderately wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have had all types of straighteners, and they do not work for my truly thick coarse hair.      </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> I have used other flat irons in the past and found that they broke off and dried my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I have to turn it way down</li>
            <li> I am assuming it shut itself down.</li>
            <li> started hunting it down</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have the technique down</li>
            <li> Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke!</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it 1000% to anyone with hard to flat iron hair like me.</li>
            <li> just lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this flat iron from a mall kiosk in late 2007.</li>
            <li> But $100 less...</li>
            <li> I went on a hunt and found it here for way less</li>
            <li> It also takes half the time to get my hair straightened with blow drying it.</li>
            <li> There are black stains.</li>
            <li> 100% ceramic plate iron are typically in the $200-$450 range.  </li>
            <li> Heats up in less than 25 seconds.  </li>
            <li> so I found it on here for much less and thought I had to take advantage.</li>
            <li> It only takes me a few minutes to do my hair and my hair is really thick.</li>
            <li> so it is less damaging.</li>
            <li> Some people just have no clue about this product because EVEN THOUGH FAKE, it still works like a hair straightener, just not fantastic results like the real one.</li>
            <li> Less damage to my hair .</li>
            <li> and it has adjustable temperature on it for those who prefer less heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with relaxed, long, and thick hair, and</li>
            <li> (I have long thick hair)</li>
            <li> my  long,  thick  hair  </li>
            <li> I have used a GVP flat iron I got from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and got bored with it because it sucked the moisture out of my hair, so when I got outside in humid weather it frizzed up.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a lot less damage after a few months of using it.</li>
            <li> I used my daughter as my test subject, because she has very thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy about buying it because I&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;herstyler&amp;#34; purchaser / owner for years.</li>
            <li> a little challenged come</li>
            <li> Amazon didn&#x27;t let me down on this one!</li>
            <li> I did not give it 5 stars because it is heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair when air dried has a waves and curls and this iron just straightens all of that out...</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t get my hair dried any faster [but I am looking into a ceramin blow dryer]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money and so damaging to your hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wasted money for us.</li>
            <li> it stays on for a few minutes and</li>
            <li> I owned a few hair straighteners (i.e. Conair, Revlon, etc.)</li>
            <li> I ordered it and it came in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Also I  have one that I bought from a distributor in person a few years ago and there are differences in them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few years ago from Amazon and received a 1.5&amp;#34; iron.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The iron is heavy.  </li>
            <li> so basically I wasted about $18 to get a refund?  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I were in the mall a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This causes for uneven grip in your hair</li>
            <li> but I read a few reviews for it and thought for the price, why not.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to touch the cord; the item just has trouble staying upright because it&#x27;s so narrow at its base.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to reach the dial as it&#x27;s in the lower inside part of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I use to spend around 20 minutes to flatten my hair and now it takes me less than 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> I was stoked when I saw it on Amazon for a fraction of the price I paid previously!</li>
            <li> and then the hair would be stiff and smell burned.  </li>
            <li> my bf has long hair and he can never go back to regular flat iron its horrible if you have to do so ^_^</li>
            <li> Lastly also, I shouldn&#x27;t be expected to just know a product is fake because the price is low, because it&#x27;s not like I mind buying fake products to begin with</li>
            <li> My only regret is not purchasing it on Amazon for a less expensive price.</li>
            <li> I did drop it a few times and a small corner piece of the ceramic broke off.  </li>
            <li> I am caucasian with thick wavy and slightly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This slowly got worse over the next 3 years.</li>
            <li> There is no more frizz or breakage either.</li>
            <li> I usually do my hair, my sisters and mothers</li>
            <li> (usually about 1 min to heat up).</li>
            <li> The ones i bought in the past cost me 180+++</li>
            <li> After a few curls he created, I was hooked!  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why they usually stop working.</li>
            <li> like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t return it as it&#x27;s past the return time period.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s probably as good--if not better than--a Chi...</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this model forever..</li>
            <li> I had to send back in the same day :(</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> When I first got this product, I was slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> but then when I examined it I felt so burned that Amazon could let such a fake product slip through the cracks like this.</li>
            <li> I went out and paid $75 for a different brand iron, hoping it would work as well and not be as expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the plates had a few scuffs on them, not something you would expect from a brand new item.</li>
            <li> So I found them on Amazon for less than $40!!  </li>
            <li> I am hispanic and my hair is very difficult naturally.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst flat iron I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> it was put through, nothing to hard</li>
            <li> so it is hard for me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother with the on-off switch or the temperature gauge anymore (hard to get to)</li>
            <li> Of course in stores they cost at least 80 dollars....</li>
            <li> I will be writing a complaint</li>
            <li> With at least 2 strokes it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I was told that I received the wrong one, but after doing research, I found out that this product is in fact 1 inch wide.</li>
            <li> if you wanna spend $40, at least you know it&#x27;s what it says it is on the box.</li>
            <li> , there was zero, yes 0, metal in this sucker.  </li>
            <li> I would sell these for at least $100 each.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others on my thick, curly hair, and none worked as well as this one.  </li>
            <li> i have thick curly hair and this products works</li>
            <li> Worked wonderfully on my extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> I used this with putting my hair in sections, and slowly went through it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the straightener on Monday, June 18; it didn&#x27;t leave the shipping zip code to start its journey to my house until June 21 which, for an Amazon purchase, is on the slow side.</li>
            <li> and I mean a lot of hair</li>
            <li> It hurts and it&#x27;s not cute!  </li>
            <li> She had it tangled with another hair device she had broken and was throwing away and cut flat iron cord instead of the other one :-(</li>
            <li> We bought out girls flat irons from a local department store and were very disappointed with the results.  </li>
            <li> The base is so narrow that the appliance constantly tips over on its side.</li>
            <li> A little skeptical because of the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick or thin hair</li>
            <li> and if they end up hating their herstyler now I feel bad for the negative comments the real company would get because some people are just blind to fake products like this.</li>
            <li> For the price/quality..this one is hard to beat!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look at Amazon first because that $75 iron is horrible and I can get my coveted HerStyler for way</li>
            <li> Overall disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when a cover bag did not come with the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have color processed hair that is very thick</li>
            <li> it is the hard as a rock handle with the weird design in it.  </li>
            <li> It came with a thin (but cushioned) travel case.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I had a lemon, or maybe it&#x27;s just a poor design.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t buy this crap, go to cvs and buy a regular one off the shelf</li>
            <li> and they did a worse job so for $25</li>
            <li> Ive bought her other CHI products and have nothing bad to say about them</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed, but it is to be expected.</li>
            <li> so I was less disappointed than if I had bought it for hundreds in the mall.</li>
            <li> So I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again if mine ever went missing!!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the persons who had experiences.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that my hair never has that weird smoky or cookout smell when it blows across my face anymore.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical about it being a knock off</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this leaves my hair looking</li>
            <li> Unfortunately some silly, foolish upcoming hair dresser cut my cord.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m already skeptical.</li>
            <li> Not a wonderful as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it as much only on those horrible hair days where I needed it.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry if you order this product.  </li>
            <li> and alas Amazon.com came to my rescue!</li>
            <li> The curls hold for longer than a curling iron holds them, which is shocking because my hair is thick and heavy</li>
            <li> i read allot of reviews about women getting fake four seasons herstyler irons.</li>
            <li> so sad .</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> , sadly I cannot duplicate her technique.</li>
            <li> I think you can&#x27;t do anything wrong it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> It is difficult to tell from the markings on the heat adjustment knob whether you are increasing or decreasing the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Sorry, ladies, but I had never straightened my hair until I received this item, and I was truly uncertain how to use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the expensive Chi, and this out does the job for me.  </li>
            <li> THE ADVERTISING was very poor.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair &amp; straighten my hair every day.</li>
            <li> I never write bad reviews, but I was completely not happy with this iron.</li>
            <li> Am i crazy, I havent changed my hair routine, just the iron</li>
            <li> I thought was awkward, but then I realized it is to keep you from accidently turning it off as you use it.</li>
            <li> It has the controls &#x27;inside&#x27; between the wands, which I find awkward for access.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy and for some people who have no clue, it&#x27;s those people who keep those factories making products and money.</li>
            <li> And then within an hour or two my hair became extremely dried out and awful looking.</li>
            <li> And I never write bad reviews so this says a lot.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it was supposed to come with a travel case</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> Bitterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have crazy hair!</li>
            <li> The base to me seems to be a 1.5&#x27;&#x27; (not a 1</li>
            <li> The thing I HATE about</li>
            <li> Unlike the crap I just bought was probably tin and created in china to look like metal.</li>
            <li> the Herstyler, I promise you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed a cover or case did not come with it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out why this straightener is getting some horrible reviews.</li>
            <li> This company is CRAP!</li>
            <li> This straightener is horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great flat irons. My teenagers love them!</li>
            <li> This device is almost a chi.  It doesn&#x27;t get quite as hot and takes a little longer to reheat.  However, it does have solid ceramic plates and seems to be built sturdily.  Wonderful to have as a back up FHI or keep in overnight bag for travel.  Great bargain for a solid device.</li>
            <li> I just received this flat iron last week. Love it! It glides along my hair and it doesn&#x27;t burn. I love the way it heats up rather quickly. I just wish it came with the pouch that was advertised. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product. I&#x27;m happy with it, but it&#x27;s not a 1.5&amp;#34; plate it&#x27;s a 1&amp;#34;. Not a problem for me because it&#x27;s really a great deal but just a heads up to potential buyers. If it had been I would have given a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Heats up in seconds and works amazing! My hair is silky after using it! Totally&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> i bought a herstyler from the mall kiosk and I don&#x27;t think this one can compare it to. This does not heat up near as much a my real one does. Yes, this is a great deal but in the end, you get what you pay for.... This was also not properly sealed. It had a small piece of regular tape keeping it closed. The real ones come with a silver circular seal on it.  The heat seems to be weakening each time I use it. I hope it doesn&#x27;t completely shut off and stop working....</li>
            <li> This straighter is exactly the kind of product that I wanted. Of course in stores they cost at least 80 dollars....for this price, it makes the straighter even better! No complaints, makes my hair smooth and shiny. Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> This product arrived a day before it was due, so that was nice. The seller included a free gift (\\&quot;Luxury Shampoo\\&quot;). The flat iron itself is pretty good quality. It has a good weight to it and it works well. I&#x27;m used to tourmaline plates, which are a lot smoother than ceramic, so to me it feels like the plates kind of snag my hair a bit. Over all, it&#x27;s a pretty good straightener, though. It was supposed to come with a heat resistant bag, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is junk! broke within a week. I never dropped it and took very great care of it. Stopped getting hot and fell apart. I wish I can give it zero stars.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get wrong with this one. Fast shipping. Wife loves it and works way better than the cheap ones you&#x27;ll get at the store.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased and I love it. I accidently dropped my last one and broke it. But before that, it lasted me 3 years. However, the first one I bought I paid $135 for it! I was at the mall and of course they sqeeuzed every penny they could get out of me. From now on, I&#x27;m checking amazon&#x27;s prices first. This is a great deal and a very high quality straightener! I would definitely purchase it:D</li>
            <li> My wife broke hers and wanted the exact same model to replace hers. She was going to pay over a hundred at a local store!?! I was so pleased with the price that I ordered a second one as a spare!</li>
            <li> Second time buying one if these, first one lasted 4 years</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, superior temperature control, does not fry or damage hair, alters texture quickly and completely and it lasts, no extra tools or styling products needed - in fact the less the better, and curls tips too. Total salon needs filled with one tool and now utterly affordable.  This one is a no brainer  - you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This straightener works amazing. That&#x27;s all you have to know. I was a little iffy about buying it because I&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;herstyler&amp;#34; purchaser / owner for years. And this one looked a little different. But it is amazing it gives me soft straight hair. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the first time at a kiosk for $80 which was told was a bargain. It lasted me about 3yrs until the cord broke. I did notice that by year 3 the temperature didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as it use to when I first bought it, however I would still buy this product again and again. I have tried the CHI and the Angelique. Both get my hair straight but neither leave my hair as shiny,smooth,and soft as the Herstyler. I am caucasian with thick wavy and slightly frizzy hair. I also have been dying my hair for years. I have never tried a straightener that could get my hair to look as healthy and pin-straight as the herstyler does. So to me, investing $30 every 3yrs for great hair seems totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this Flat Iron all the time.  It really get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I love my Herstyler and would recommend it. I did not give it 5 stars because it is heavy. &amp;#34; heavy&amp;#34; is not a problem for daily use but important to a stylist who uses it multiple times throughout a day.  I have found it straightens various hair types by only going through the strand of hair once. Also, the price is amazing! In my opinion the Herstyler compares to a $120 iron.</li>
            <li> My mother has this Herstyler Flat Iron and works excellent, but when I ordered it thru Amazon it never got delivered to my household, so Amazon refund me back my money.</li>
            <li> Needed a temporary replacement for my Chi &amp; this iron was priced to sell!  Works great, just don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LovE Love LoVe this flat iron; it&#x27;s 100% real ceramic plates make my hair feel  silky and strong(and I have really coarse/curly hair). I&#x27;ve only owned mine for about a month now but I am confident that the Herstyler&#x27;s ceramic plates don&#x27;t let me down:)</li>
            <li> I can not believe that this item is such a deal. It is just as good as the high end brands I have used. I thought I&#x27;d try this one. I am glad I did. I have dropped it tons of times and it wont break. It is hot 450 degrees with a control to turn it down. I&#x27;d say but this before I spent 100.00 on other ones. They are about the same. It&#x27;s just the name. If you can get the name out of your head, you are fine. Great product. As good as costly ones. I know,</li>
            <li> I had an ISO purchased from the mall for years, and needed to replace it after multiple drops. I debated between buying another ISO and a Herstyler, and went with the Herstyler because of the look, the price and the reviews. I&#x27;m glad I did. The base to me seems to be a 1.5&#x27;&#x27; (not a 1 like some have said on here). Yes, the outer part of the iron has a funny texture and can give you a callous the first few times of use, but after that, you get used to it. I love the wide base and heat setting.  I use mine as both a curling iron and a straighterner. Good purchase for the minimal $$.</li>
            <li> this is a great product. I was able to save $150 this month by being able to straighten my hair my two daughters hair at home. it works great on my natural hair even though I had to go through it more than once. I do recommend this product for African American women to have natural hair. I am purchasing one next week for my mom.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after one use!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on a Thursday and received it on Saturday. You can adjust the temperature and that works great.  My hair is straight in less time than the average device.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This has been designated as my &#x27;emergency&#x27; flat iron. I have now had it for over 4 years... I use it maybe 30 days a year. But when I do (like when our Sedu breaks) I am amazed that I am not using it more often! I would have to say in many ways it is much better than the Sedu. It leaves my hair bouncier, shinier (I do curls with it) and it is probably even faster than the Sedu at creating curls. I still love the Sedu for being so smooth in maneuvering through my fine hair, as the Herstyler always seems to \\&quot;catch\\&quot; and occasionally create indents (which take quite a while to get out) but the curls created by my Herstyler are just magical!! They last better to the next day even, quite amazing since my hair has a hard time holding shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is less than half the price of folica&#x27;s \\&quot;best\\&quot; (the Sedu) and definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Same flat iron as those sold at the mall for much more money.  I purchased my original at the mall and just purchased two as Christmas gifts.  I loved the original that I bought several years ago at the mall and hoped these would be the same model.  They are!  I have told several friends.  Everyone is happy with their purchase.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> After going to the mall and seeing what the ceramic flat irons can do, I was excited to hop online and seek the same quality product for a fraction of the price. Amazon didn&#x27;t let me down on this one! I love my new ceramic flat iron. This iron leaves my fine hair silky and it feels like it holds the style much better. There is no more frizz or breakage either. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants an affordable high quality iron!!!!</li>
            <li> At the flea market a seller used one of these on my hair and I loved it! I could have bought this flat iron for $100.00 there,or go on the website and it would cost almost $300.00.  Told a friend how wonderful it was and she saw it on here.  This is the best flat iron I have ever used!  I have one I bought from a hairstylist that cost a lot more and it does not compare to this one.  It not only straightens, it curls, it makes my hair softer and shinier.  Do not hesitate to buy this!  You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought the flat iron.  Works well, gets up to 460 degrees in heat-the hottest flat iron that&#x27;s sold.  Tried it out at the mall and had to have it. It works great on all types of hair textures. Glad I found it cheaper on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002LE8OX8 Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron]]  I got this flat iron on recommendation of someone who purchased at kiosk at the mall. It was much less expensive here on Amazon, but actually it is such a good flat iron that I would have gladly paid much more.  I have now 3 flat irons... one gold n hot, one titanium, and now this one...  The ceramics iron is so much better.    My hair is as straight and bouncy as when I go to the salon.  After 1 pass, my hair is silky straight.  So I can flat iron my hair in about 20 mins. It used to take an hour easily and then the hair would be stiff and smell burned.  Not anymore!!!  Now I can wash my hair and pull it back with just a tiny amount of argan oil.  Let my hair AIRDRY (means less heat on hair) and then flat iron with no other products. My hair when air dried has a waves and curls and this iron just straightens all of that out... ONE PASS.   My hair smells wonderful (not burnt) and it looks and feel so healthy.  And it is straight... swinging and bouncy straight.  I finish my look with a dime size of hair serum to give it a bit of shine.  The end.  :-)  I hope they will not stop making this flat iron because I don&#x27;t need to go to salon anymore. I don&#x27;t know what to do with my other 2 metal irons.  I never use them anymore.  Now I just need to get the herstyle mini iron to get the hairline better.    Also, I have tried to curl with the flat iron.. and I just can&#x27;t master that.  But I love love love the flat iron.</li>
            <li> great product that gives you all you want. I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unique, irreplaceable. great, great, great. great.</li>
            <li> I bought the item about a year ago at the mall, was very impressed after trying it for myself.  I find it very easy to use and my hair keeps straight for a longer period of time.  My daughter has stopped using her flat iron and now use mine, I am so pleased with it that I am now buying one for my daughter in law.  Sorry for the persons who had experiences. I love my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore this straightner. They sell for over $100 at the mall. I bought one 3 years ago and it was the best!! This time I bought off Amazon and its just as great, and cheaper. I hughly recommend it. I have long blonde extentions and it makes them so shiney. Also I had it in 3 days , normal shipping. I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase. Thanks amazon, I normally don&#x27;t waste my time writing reviews but I encoursge others to give this straightner a shot.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth&amp;&amp;with no frizz!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron, I bought it since my stylist said she had never had a problem with a cermic flat iron and that it truely didn&#x27;t seem to ever burn hair. I usually do my hair, my sisters and mothers so I wanted something we could all rely on and trust. We are an african american family with thick and coarse hair so we love how shiny smooth and light this flat iron makes our hair. Also I personally didn&#x27;t like to do my hair very often since it was known to take 4 hours to do. I still can&#x27;t get my hair dried any faster [but I am looking into a ceramin blow dryer] however the amount of time I spend flat ironing is greatly reduced and I no longer have to apply chemicals and sprays while using my flat iron. An added bonus is that my hair never has that weird smoky or cookout smell when it blows across my face anymore. I&#x27;m so glad I didnt let the mall price [90-200] scare me away from this product. I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month and so far we all love the results it has given us!</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, and I don&#x27;t mean the good mixed hair kind, I mean the really tightly curled hard to straighten.  But anyway this is the only flat iron that works on my hair period.  I went to the shop once and was so disappointed at how pouffy my hair looked that I went to the mall and bought one of these after remembering how good it worked when the guy gave me a brief demo at the mall.  This is the best flat iron period.</li>
            <li> I love this , worth the money. Very cheap . I am a cheap buyer lol soo this was well along my price range. Id recommend</li>
            <li> I purchased my Forever straightener about a month ago and it is the best hair product I have ever used. Normally I keep my hair pulled into a bun, since getting this straightener I wear my hair down all the time. I get so many compliments on my hair. The best straightener on the market and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black girl with thick natural hair. I&#x27;ve had many flat irons but this is by far the best! It straightened my hair without a problem. I was hesitant to buy it because I&#x27;ve purchased flat irons that couldn&#x27;t get the job done. So glad I bought this one! Pleasantly surprised.   I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about a year now and it still works as if it were brand new. This is one of the best flat irons that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron when I was 17 years old and have had it ever since. I am 22 years old today. That&#x27;s 5 years!! I am hispanic and my hair is very difficult naturally. I had spent so much money buying flat iron after flat iron because I had so many complaints about all of my other ones. The Herstyler is the first to NOT damage my hair, it actually IS pure ceramic, not just ceramic COATED like most are. I cracked it about 2 years ago when I dropped it off of the counter. That&#x27;s all it ever remained, was a crack. It still works perfectly fine. It is absolutely the best iron you&#x27;ll ever use for your hair. trust me, your hair probably deserves it if you&#x27;re anything like me and have damaged it for so many years before finding this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, you CAN use the flat iron to both straighten your hair AND curl it. I do it all the time. Don&#x27;t bother looking for any other irons. And don&#x27;t EVER buy/use a Chi. It&#x27;s a waste of money and so damaging to your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the Herstyler, I promise you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My wife had me purchase this based on the reviews. Once she got it she said that it would not go through her hair with out pulling it. I believe that it wasn&#x27;t wide enough as her old one was 1 1/2\\&quot; Wide and she has long hair and with this one being narrower that is what it didn&#x27;t work as well. However, the seller offered a great price and Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> this is the best flat iron i&#x27;ve ever owned. i originally purchased one from a kiosk at the mall, back when they were selling them at the \\&quot;low\\&quot; price of $100. since that price has increased with inflation (and demand), i looked on amazon to see if i could find a better deal. this works better than the $350 iron i bought that completely fried my hair. i will never order an alternate flat iron - herstyler fan for life!</li>
            <li> Not only a great flat iron, but a great deal as well.  I&#x27;ve tried others on my thick, curly hair, and none worked as well as this one.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this straightener! I purchased my first HerStyler SEVEN years ago and it still works just as well as when I first got it!! This is an amazing product made to last. I bought this one as a christmas gift for my sister - she is beside herself with joy as she&#x27;s been admiring mine (and my hair due to it!) for the last seven years! I highly recommend this to anyone that straightens their hair, soooo worth the money!</li>
            <li> the one I got turned on and in a matter of  minutes it turned off and never turned on again , I did get my money back real quick got free shipping for the return over still had to pay for box and all. May have been just that one that was defective .</li>
            <li> This is my first review ever. But I am inclined to write one because I am so impressed. From the delivery to the actual product. I placed my order on 1/29/10 (3-5 day free shipping) and received the package on 2/2.  Before buying this flat iron, I bought another from Sally for twice the price, and returned it...just didn&#x27;t seem to get the job done.  I used my daughter as my test subject, because she has very thick, coarse hair. It generally takes her over an hour to straighten her hair, but it only took us 20 mins with this flat iron. Best $30 I ever spent and I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002LE8OX8 Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron]]    I purchased the Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron and I promptly received my order within two business days. One of my best friends had the pink Herstyler without the adjustable dial but every time I used it to touch up my hair before we went somewhere, it left me with incredible shine. I was still skeptical about the product however since I had yet to use it on my hair freshly washed.  My old Conair Infiniti flat iron was not as hot as it was originally and could no longer deal with my African American naturally curly 3b-4a BSL hair. I was intending on buying the CHI flat iron but decided to purchase the Herstyler instead and I must say it was the best decision. I love my Herstyler and I am intending on purchasing the curling wands. I do not regret my decision at all. The Herstyler is truly an underestimated product.  Pros:  * Good range of temperatures  * Fast heat up time  * Incredible shine (I mean show stopping bling, even from far distances)  * Can create sleek hair or beautiful curls/waves    Cons:  * The adjustable dial&#x27;s temperatures are written in a chalk like writing and therefore the words and temperatures will wipe off fairly soon after purchase  * The iron tends to get build-up and oily quickly even without product in the hair (does not affect the hair however)</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron, and I returned it. It pulls at my hair, and I have normal almost straight hair with odd waves in it.  My hair is easy to straighten.  I would not recommend this iron.  I never write bad reviews, but I was completely not happy with this iron.</li>
            <li> comes in very nice packaging, and it&#x27;s functioning really well, cut my styling time, but still-not perfect-since i have to do each section more than once although my hair is not curly..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had hair that has difficulty staying straight...but I really love this iron it keeps it straight for the whole 1st day and only a few touch-ups are needed for the second day, I can get away without doing it sometimes too.</li>
            <li> You can buy the same ceramic flat iron at Kmart for 1/3 of the price, looks and works identical with the large price.</li>
            <li> Love it.... One of the best purchases. I had the $130 exact same brand from the mall and this works the same... But $100 less... Very happy customer</li>
            <li> This is a good straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t exceed my expectations or anything. I was disappointed that it was supposed to come with a travel case and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was in the mall in Missouri one day and a guy at one of the little booths in the middle of the mall asked me if I wanted to straighten my hair...So he straightens it out in only a few minutes (I have long thick hair) and I noticed that this actually makes my hair look thinner and a lot softer..So of course I buy it...A year later and it&#x27;s still going great (And I have life insurance on it!)..I love this!</li>
            <li> In love with my herstyler flat iron. I had my first for over +5 years and it went out on me. Could not beat the price in total I paid about $20!! The mall wanted $150. It didn&#x27;t come with a carrying case which was ok so I just leave it in the box.</li>
            <li> I had my mother buy me this straightener after my Chi broke. I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve had friends and even their parents (moms) comment on how much they like it. They want one instead of their Chi. It&#x27;s a wonderful straightener. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;d also recommend the Colorful Seasons straightener. They are both great!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used!  My thick, curly hair can be straightened more quickly, efficiently, easily, safely, and in a less damaging way with this.</li>
            <li> I have used many irons, but this is the best by far.  I normally have to oil my hair before flat ironing, but with HerStyler I don&#x27;t.  I use a protective lotion to prevent heat damage and the HerStyler leaves my hair with a natural shine.  I have very dry hair.  The only problem I had was not receiving the pouch that it is suppose to come with.  I e-mailed the seller and had a response and problem solved within 24 hours.  I didn&#x27;t receive the pouch but I did receive 15% of the already low price of the iron.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I paid $150 for a brand new CHI at Target and it broke in 6 months. I purchased this one, which is WAY cheaper and in my opinion works WAY better! This is my second herstyler. The only reason I bought a new one is because my dog ate my cord. I also have a Herstyler curling wand. I love this brand and for the money, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it..great 1st flat iron</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh I have the thickest hair ever. This is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the straightener they sell at malls but for a fraction of the cost. I love my straightener. It heats up super quick and I just slip it in it&#x27;s bag when I&#x27;m done without worrying it will burn the surface it&#x27;s on. It also straightens like a dream. I have hair down to about my waist and takes me about 30-40 mins to straighten which is amazing! I definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This was a graduation gift for my niece and she love it.  Fast n easy to iron her hair.  Great quality!</li>
            <li> Its a good flat iron for a good price. I have naturally straight hair and it makes my hair real smooth and shiny. I can also curl my hair too. I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> Where it is easy to use it burns my hair. I have to turn it way down and then I still don&#x27;t get the results I want. Might be good for some other people but doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair straightener. I wash my hair the night before and sleep on it and then I use it before I head out the door to work.  It takes me about 10 minutes to straighten my whole head and it looks amazing and soooo glossy/shiny. I have also used the iron to curl my and and I think is pretty easy.  All in all a good product and it heats up fast too!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! I got such a great price on it, and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before.  It doesn&#x27;t snag your hair.  The heat setting is great because it can probably go higher than you even need. It gets so hot. I can straighten my whole head in 5 minutes, and my hair is long down to the middle of my back! Love it!</li>
            <li> THIS IS SUCH A GREAT DEAL, I went to the mall to buy this exact flat iron and it cost me $250. Wow what a rip off, and when it broke they refused to give me a new one, which they promised a lifetie warranty. This is a great deal, for only $30 you get the same quality one you would get at the mall.</li>
            <li> I am Asian, so I have the naturally flat hair that simply won&#x27;t curl.  So what I enjoy about this flat iron is that I can make my hair seem more polished by using the straightener to give it more of a flat look and it gives it a more polished shine.    Also, I am able to give my hair volume by simply using the flat iron to make it into a bit of a curl by twisting it like it was a hair curling iron.    I use this about every morning and I love how quickly it heat us (usually about 1 min to heat up).</li>
            <li> I must say, I&#x27;m very pleased with this iron.  I bought my first iron maybe 4 years ago and it finally gave out....and it wasn&#x27;t the products fault, but wear &amp; tear.  I used it very often on myself, family and friends.  I was in a panic when it finally died but I found it online at a VERY discounted price so I bought my 2nd.  I hope it last as long.</li>
            <li> It works just as good as the one I got at the booth at the mall for $90. Thank u.</li>
            <li> Love love this hair iron.!!  The ones i bought in the past cost me 180+++ and i never got the result i gotten with this straighter this iron does NOT crisp upon my ends like others and with the hair serum it leave my hair looking flawless ! will recommend others about this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+++++ Also the deliver was super fast +++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous how some people can buy this iron at a mall kiosk for 350+ when you can get it  online ALOT cheaper</li>
            <li> My  new  Herstyler  flat  iron  is  \\&quot;Amazing.\\&quot;  It  did  not  take  long  to  do  my  long,  thick  hair  at  all.  I  was  able  to  use  the  460 degree  setting  without  a  problem.  My  hair  was  straight,  but  then,  I  simply  flipped  it  under  for  a  bob.  This  particular  flat  iron  is  versatile,  and  I  love  it.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for about 3 years now &amp; has been doing an amazing job. It is now starting to lose heat strength ):</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron, it works great - great price too!  This is the same flat iron that was being sold in the mall for $180.00.  Arrived on time as promised.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Straightens hair pretty fast. Have bought for myself and my sister. I just wish it had temperature controls, and auto shut-off for all those times I question whether or not I turned off the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the attached comb. It pulls my hair out.  Tried it on my daughter and she cried because it hurt.  Wasted money for us.</li>
            <li> My friend bragged about a new straightener she purchased at the mall for nearly 100 buckaroos so I decided to try it out. After just one use, I decided I would purchase one for myself the next time I went to the mall.   However, being the cautious consumer I am, I decided to go online and read some reviews. Everything seemed good, so I decided I would purchase a Herstyler. One of my friends recommended checking Amazon. Lo and behold, they do! And surprisingly, it was nearly half the price of what I was willing to pay.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this straightener. It manages to make your hair stay straight all day, and makes it shiny as well. Prior to buying the Herstyler, I had been using a Conair and Remington for years and neither made my hair straight all day. This straightener also doesn&#x27;t snag like the Chi (I&#x27;ve used it several times).</li>
            <li> This flat iron is an absolute must have. I saw them at the mall selling for 120 dollars. I found it on amazon for a great price. Was skeptical about it being a knock off but it does exactly what the Ones at the mall do. I absolutely love it and works ten times better than my broken CHI.  One of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Ordered in the past, this are not as good.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m pretty dissapointed having baught this flat iron. I noticed the same problem from the last iron.There seems to be an issue with the extension cord. It does not stay on when I plug it into the outlet. I have to keep wiggling it, moving it until it stays on an it stays on for a few minutes and then again I have to wiggle the cord until itturns back on. The first time, I thought it was maybe me mis-using the iron, but nope! I realized it was the same issue with the previous one and I hanged on to it for some time, dealing with the problem. I just baught this one in April pretty much new. Now I have to find where tobuy another one. I would not recommend buying, there&#x27;s an issue with the extension cord!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was curious about the kiosk in the mall, so we stopped by last night to see what it was all about.  He is all about free anything, so he was just mainly trying to see if someone else would do my hair for free, even though I am the only person who does my hair, on a professional and personal level.  When the woman told me about this straightener, all I could think was that she is just making things up to sell it.  I already have two InStylers (I think they were between 120.00 and 150.00 while they had a discounted sale going on when they first came out) and a flat iron that I spent over 200 dollars on just by itself!    I&#x27;m a black woman with relaxed, long, and thick hair, and nothing else has come close to taming my hair as well as I&#x27;d like.  My scalp is very tender and I have been trying different methods to stretch my relaxers, such as blow drying very close to the scalp, flat ironing as close as the heat will allow me to get, and using hot curlers on the new growth, all of which hurt me so badly and take up a lot of time.  It has always been a chore to detangle my hair, which is why my mother eventually started to relax my hair and even though I&#x27;d like to be natural with straight hair, it was impossible with my hair.  So of course, I was just ready to prove the saleswoman wrong and figured that NOTHING could really do anything to straighten my hair as well as what I was already using.  She passed the ceramic plate through my hair and asked me to feel it, and my jaw dropped!  I had to tell my boyfriend to feel that part and look and feel the difference in that versus the hair that hadn&#x27;t been straightened.  It really is silky to the touch, and takes just one quick pass through the hair to achieve such wonderful results!  She had it on the highest setting, but I know that temp works best for my hair to avoid heat damage.  I am VERY inquisitive, and I asked her about the Chi that everyone has been telling me about for years, and she told me that it isn&#x27;t 100% ceramic AND showed me as proof.  They only put a thin coat of ceramic on the Chi flat irons.  They broke one of the actually flat irons to show us that what this product is 100% ceramic.  Most products in general don&#x27;t usually work for me or only do minimally to the point where I&#x27;ve basically wasted money, yet again, but this is not one of those products.    Since the mall was about to close and I didn&#x27;t bring my purse with me, I told the saleswoman that I&#x27;d be back tomorrow.  So we came back today and we knew she wouldn&#x27;t be there until maybe 30 minutes from now, so she told us to pay her other co-worker who would be there this morning.  She was so excited that she called her co-worker and told her that we were coming.  I realized that she must have given me a great discount because her co-worker looked at the printout and sounded kind of disappointed that I wouldn&#x27;t be paying so much for a gift set.  So, I paid 160.00 plus tax for a normal sized straightener, mini straightener that is great for new growth, and the grande curler.  I tested out how close I could get to my roots, and I could actually touch my scalp AND NOT GET BURNED!  If I wasn&#x27;t sold before, that did it for me!  If you have the money to spend, buy one or a gift set of these ceramic straighteners from an authorized dealer of this product, as you will be able to register your products online good for one year AND a Lifetime Warranty as well, if you know where to look, FOR FREE!!!  If it weren&#x27;t for that, I would have gladly purchased cheaper ones off of this site, while using extreme caution.  There are people selling products that are very well crafted knock offs.  They work great initially, and then they begin to malfunction and then the buyers rant and rave on sites saying that it is a horrible products and they won&#x27;t recommend it.  From the posts, it seems like this is a great dealer to buy from.  I&#x27;ll have to keep that in mind for any future purchases.    (I may actually be relaxer free if it works this well on MY new growth!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for awhile now and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. The straightener works well and straightens great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, great service, good deal!  My daughter loves this iron, she wanted a \\&quot;good one\\&quot; this time and this one fit the bill.  I do wish Amazon would take Paypal payments though.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I have had mine straightener for about 2 years now..... the one I had before it only lasted 6 months before it broke. This one has lasted and is so much nicer to my hair. I have badly damaged hair form dying it alot, but this iron smooths it out and makes my hair look beautiful!</li>
            <li> This product only lasted 4 months. Will not heat up anymore. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Still going strong after 2 years. like it more than my chi..... my go to hair straightner. My hair looks soft, shiny and straight for 24-48 hours. It stays straight.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out why this straightener is getting some horrible reviews. I&#x27;ve had this one for 6 years. (Only spent $60) on the first one. This thing has been dropped and it still works. I&#x27;ve gotten water on it numerous times, it still works. Mine just now started to slowly stop working, but only because the cord is coming loose, which very well could be my fault for wrapping it around the straightener when I am done with it. Leaves my hair silky smooth, and curls really nice too! I just bought this again, here is to hoping I can get another 6 years out of it!</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, gets hair smooth and straight without a lot of effort, much much better than others in this price range or even a bit higher. There should definitely be a thermostat or something to cause it to shut off should it be left on accidentally. Hence it is a safety hazard. All the others I have used have this feature.</li>
            <li> So, I was walking in the mall one day a few years ago, and got stopped by a nice man who wanted to style my hair.  I had some free time, so I allowed him to.  He used this exact product, Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron.  I had never used anything on my hair, other than a curling iron once and a while.  I am not a fan of curling irons or flat irons because the right look has always been hard for me to achieve.  I can never make all the hair appear like a professional styled it or that natural effortless look.  Plus I did not want to take a chance and damage my hair.  So I was a skeptic.  After a few curls he created, I was hooked!  I did not want to buy this product at the mall because it was retailing for $200 at that time.  I found it on Amazon for about $40 at the time.  I bought it and have been using it ever since.  It is easy to hold, does not get heavy.  Has easy temperature adjustment.  I did drop it a few times and a small corner piece of the ceramic broke off.  I still use it and it works great.  Also,  I was putting Moroccan oil in my hair then using the Herstyler.  I noticed that combination was damaging my hair and staining the ceramic plate.  It gave the plate a rusty burnt color.  I stopped using the oil and my hair has been damage free since.  Keeping the iron on a medium temperature setting also helps prevent damage.  The higher the temperature the faster your hair sets, but could cause damage.  Do not redo a piece of hair several times.  One time should be enough on the piece of hair you are styling.  You can touch it up briefly a second time, but I do not recommend more than that.  I only use the Herstyler to create waves and curls, not to straighten my hair.  I do not know how it would work to straighten.  I finally recently broke down and bought a new one.  It was even cheaper this time around on Amazon!  It&#x27;s light enough and small enough to travel with.  I still have my old one as a back up and travel one.  I do not know how other Flat Irons rate, but this one is great so I do not feel the need to look for a different one.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this iron! I was tempted to purchase one from the mall for about $100, fortunatley my husband wouldn&#x27;t let me give in to my impulses. I went on a hunt and found it here for way less and now I&#x27;m thankful for how it worked out and Amazon delivered it to me in a couple days!!</li>
            <li> Because of my schedule, I usually shower at night right before bed.  Unfortunately this leaves my hair looking a little challenged come morning.  I have fine, straight hair that comes to just below my shoulder blades so the best way to fix it in the morning is by flat iron.  My old iron was bought at a regular super store and did not do a great job of taming my hair plus it had metal plates which I know are pretty damaging.  After reading lots of reviews I ordered this item and have been incredibly pleased with it.      I use it on average 4 days a week and have been doing this for a number of months.  It always heats quickly and works efficiently when used.  My hair stays nicely flat all day.  Even now in winter when I can tend to have awful dry hair stick ups, I feel this keeps things looking good.  For the price this is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! I owned a few hair straighteners (i.e. Conair, Revlon, etc.) and they never made my hair look so shiny, straight, and healthy and not frizzy! My husband was like &#x27;WOW! Your hair looks amazing.&#x27; My old ones were nothing like this one. My hair looks great even if I don&#x27;t put any hair products in it and let my hair air dry and straighten it. It also takes half the time to get my hair straightened with blow drying it. I recommend the Herstyler brand and its way cheaper on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Good product, nice price..haven&#x27;t had any problems. If this one breaks or stops working I would probably buy another one</li>
            <li> Amazing, high quality flat iron. Doesn&#x27;t burn or fry my hair, and it works quickly - I don&#x27;t ever need to go over the same area. I love that I can adjust the temperature, too. My hair is so shiny &amp; I don&#x27;t even use product. Love that the plates are 100% ceramic, which is the best for hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this Herstyler about 3 months ago and absolutely love it.  It is wonderful and such a timesaver.  Not only does it get my hair perfectly straight without even having a relaxer, but it heats up in like 60 seconds, and when you section off your hair, you only have to go over it one time for best results.  I love this thing and can&#x27;t believe that something this effective was so reasonably priced.  It is also very durable.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Received my styler last week. Used it a couple times already. I like it, but it pulls my hair. I used Herstyler/Colorful Seasons before and not once has it pulled my hair. So I am a little disappointed. But, oh well. If you have more money, go with a better one.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my girlfriend&#x27;s birthday. She was about to get it from the mall kiosk for about 4 times the price when we found this seller. The shipping was fast, the product came beautifully packaged and all looks well. I tested it out as soon as I received it and the iron heats up FAST! It was burning hot in less than 60 seconds. She used it today for the first time and said it works great. I will update if things go south. At this point, I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The product woeks but It looks like it has been used. There are black stains. Don&#x27;t buy the oveepriced ones that they sell in the malls. They are exactly the same</li>
            <li> after my 3 year old daughter killed my chi by dunking it in the commode, don&#x27;t worry--it was in a drawer, not plugged in or turned on, i decided that i&#x27;d never again spend $100+ on a flat iron. i read the reviews on the herstyler and decided to give it a try. it gets my hair just as straight as my chi at almost a third of the price. i love it!!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s herstyler broke.  She bought it for $100 at one of those sleazy carts at the mall.  It was her favorite hair styling tool and I had to hear all about it when it broke.  Luckily, I found it on Amazon for 25% of what she paid for it.  I ordered it and it came in a few days.  She loves it and uses it almost daily.  Its been over a year since we got this one and it still works like new.</li>
            <li> Great! I love it. I had an old one that I bought 7 years ago and it just stopped working from me dropping it so much and I really didnt want to pay $200 for it again, but I would have. I was happy to come across it on amazon and it works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She loves it ! heats up quick , works great and she has long hair. The bonus is the bag that comes with it for travel.</li>
            <li> Gets nice and ho,t love this product</li>
            <li> I received this straightener as a gift from my sister in a package with the wand. I fell in love with hers so she bought me one. I&#x27;ve had it for three years when the other day I plugged it up to do my hair an my plates were cracked! I didn&#x27;t drop it either! Not sure if one of my kids accidentally did so since it&#x27;s a really great product so I&#x27;m reordering it. So sad my other one has broken plates because it still heats up amazingly.</li>
            <li> My mom bought one of these (Colorful seasons) at a vendor at our mall, the salesperson did LITERALLY push us up to her place and started away, she used a cotton ball to show us how its not too damaging to your hair. So she got it for 175$ (did drop a lot off the price). I saw this before I left for vacation and chose one day shipping and got it the next day. One complain, it does get some brown crusty stuff of the sides after a while, have no idea why? From hair of course, but all you need to do is heat it up and take a towel and wipe it off. I did scratch it already from trying to take it off with my keys lol</li>
            <li> Flat iron works great. I used it to curl my hair &amp; it makes great ringlets if you want it to. Heats up quick &amp; temp goes up to 460* I must have had it set too high the last time I used it though because it burned my hair so I now have a lot of breakage &amp; frizz (my fault though, not the straightener)</li>
            <li> i have thick curly hair and this products works i have to be honest i do not use it on a daily basis so i have no clue if that affects the way i feel about this product amazon has it a lot cheaper then the mall</li>
            <li> Ive had the same straightener for 8 years till it finally died and herstyler products last long. It doesnt burn your hair and make it feel dry and look flat and lifeless like others and love it.&lt;br /&gt;It was awesome to find this product on amazon and a better price then purchasing it at the mall.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> While there are many devices similar to this one, once purchased and plugged, this device instantly performs splendidly. If you are constantly re shaping your hair on a daily basis, this might be the product for you, the temperature control feature will be handy.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fantastic and came in original packaging but was missing the black heat protector bag that&#x27;s shown in the picture.  Also I  have one that I bought from a distributor in person a few years ago and there are differences in them. The new one doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the old one which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> I paid $120.00 for the Herstyler flat iron in the mall several years ago.  I loved the product.  Unfortunately some silly, foolish upcoming hair dresser cut my cord.  I just didn&#x27;t want to pay that much again.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  I love this product and didn&#x27;t have to pay that amount again.  The product works great just as the first did.  My sisters-in-law, daughter-in-law, and I contemplated many different brands.  They went with the other brands and are happy.  I went with this brand, didn&#x27;t pay a quarter the price they did, and I recommend it.  I even received the product before the shipment date.  Bonus for me as I was able to use it on vacation</li>
            <li> I got this back in Jan 2011 when my roommate paid $200 for a set from the mall, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My old one was dying, and I desperately needed a replacement for the little frizzies/curlicues that pop up just near my forehead and make me look like a bag lady.  It came with a thin (but cushioned) travel case.  It heats up pretty quickly, and once I use it I don&#x27;t have to use it again until I wash my hair, which can be anywhere from 3-5 days later.  When I use it to straighten all of my hair (I have fairly long, thick in density but moderate thickness in hair shaft size), I can do it in about half an hour, which is actually quicker than with other straighteners I&#x27;ve had because I need to go over it fewer times.  However, I gave it a four because when I do all of my hair, it doesn&#x27;t always stay as straight as it initially is until I wash my hair (again, 3-5 days later).  However, it does not get wavy enough again to necessitate re-straightening, and it has worked better than straighteners I&#x27;ve had in the past.    All in all, this is a GREAT item for the money, although there are better straighteners out there--for over $100 a pop.</li>
            <li> This product curls my hair like nothing I have ever seen before. They tried it on me in the   Mall and I had to have it. I found it on her for a fraction of the cost! I have fine limp hair that is straight no matter what I do to it. This product has made Curling my hair not only possible but fast! It heats up fast and does everything I need it to. I can curl my entire head in ten minutes or less! The price is a steal since the mall can be from 120 to 200 dollars! A must have!</li>
            <li> Like many, I have been through the mall and been talked into letting some excited individual use this flat iron on my hair, only to have me walk away once they tell me the price.  Yesterday, I saw sellers set up in my local bulk store.  I had already planned to purchase a new flat iron yesterday, but hadn&#x27;t decided which one.  What caught my eye first was 100% ceramic plates and then second ... the price. HerStyler Classic Forever.  Where had i heard that before?  It wasn&#x27;t in the top 10 on the review websites but I knew the name.   I don&#x27;t have thick, coarse or unruly hair.  I have lots of fine, wavy hair that tends to frizz in humidity, kink when I sleep on it or curl/wave up if I sleep hot at night.  Problem is, there is no need to use a flat iron at anything over 350 degrees for my hair type unless I am getting a brazillian treatment, then I need 450.  I hear all the rave about how great Chi is and sorry, but fom the looks of the damaged hair of those who own them, I have stayed far away from that fixed temperature device.  Just because you have a flat iron that heats above 410 degrees, doesn&#x27;t mean that high heat is what you need for your hair.  So here are the pros and cons thus far from my perspective:  PROS:  100% ceramic plates. Not coated plates, not nano ceramic plates.  100% ceramic plate iron are typically in the $200-$450 range.  Ceramic provides even heating and less damage if used on the right temperature setting for your hair type.  Leaves the hair shiny and soft.  Glides down the hair easily  Floating plates with a bevelled type edge.  This securely holds my fine hair between the plates and allows for easy straightening and curling if I want. the flex allows the device to glide easier  Adjustable heat settings. Seriously, this is a must if you have more than one person using the iron, medium to fine or chemically treated hair.  Not everyone needs to fry their hair with a fixed 392 degree flat iron, or the highest heat setting just because they haveit.  This device goes from 180 to 460 degrees.  Perfect for daily styling and for brazillian treatments!!!  Long swivel cord.  It&#x27;s just plain handy  Textured grip for secured handling.  Heats up in less than 25 seconds.  Straightened or curled hair seems to hold the shape very well and longer  CONS:  100% ceramic plates.  You need to be careful with this.  You drop it, you are most likely going to break it.  Easy does and maybe invest in a holder.  No automatic shut off.  Get use to turning it off when you are done.  Its just plain old non glossy black, no zebra print, leopard print, hot pink or neon green stripes or polka dots.  Surely that can&#x27;t be a big deal.  So in short, if you can buy one at Amazon for such a nice price, then why not.  Save yourself the headache from the mall people, get a quality product for a great value.  There are many great reviews on the product and most of the bad reviews are because of the crappy sales tactics of the mall kiosk people, not the device performance.</li>
            <li> I love, Love, LOVE this flat iron! I first saw it in my local mall and wanted it but wasn&#x27;t going to pay the 100+ price there. So I went home and did a search and found it for about 40 bucks on amazon. When I finally got it I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and opened it immediately! It gets hot very quick and I can do my hair in about 30 minutes with blow drying!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Herstylers, and something looks off about this product. The logo/etc aren&#x27;t exactly the way these flat irons usually look. On top of that, mine didn&#x27;t come with a travel bag that the description said it came with. I will be writing a complaint and hopefully they send me one. I haven&#x27;t even used it yet but I&#x27;m already skeptical.</li>
            <li> I received this iron for Christmas and I have been very pleased with it.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I love the adjustable temp it has and the cover it comes with.</li>
            <li> This iron is really good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this Herstyler on sale at Amazon, so I not only got a first class styler, I saved money doing it !  Whhen I got my hair styled, they used one of these to curl my hair, and i was impressed with how easy it was to use for making curls. I am not great at styling my hair; so having something that is easy to use was important to me.&lt;br /&gt;I watched a few tutorials on using this styler to curl hair, and decided that I needed to get one. They work with either long or short hair, and mine is short, but growing out, so it is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;The herstyler is much easier to use than my curling iron, makes nicer curls that last longer than the one made with the curling iron or hot rollers. You just start at the roots, and then roll it through your hair to the ends, and out comes a nice curl that shapes around your head perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this so much, I give it as gifts all the time.  I keep one extra one just in case I can&#x27;t find one in the future.  Makes hairstyling EASY!!  Hair is left soft and manageable:). All smiles.</li>
            <li> I love my flat irons, they work great and work for all types of hair. Im going to buy them for my friends.</li>
            <li> The list of things that one must do to avoid invalidating the so-called warranty is endless &amp; way too long to reprint here. The product itself is difficult to use, becomes way too hot, no way to easily slide hair thru to the ends, can&#x27;t be used abroad (see warranty), so generally is mostly useless. No wonder price was discounted so much.</li>
            <li> Not a wonderful as I had hoped for. I guess my Chi will continue to be the one I use the most.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few years ago from Amazon and received a 1.5&amp;#34; iron.  Since I left my iron at a hotel, I wanted to replace my iron and placed a &amp;#34;re-order&amp;#34; for this same product and this time got a 1&amp;#34; iron, this time purchased from TouchDown, fulfilled by Amazon.  I believe the &amp;#34;Forever&amp;#34; model is a 1.5&amp;#34; iron, and since the first one I received several years ago was a 1.5&amp;#34; iron, I expected to get a 1.5&amp;#34; iron on my re-order.  Amazon allowed me to return this product, and gave me free shipping on another re-order which was also inaccurately described as a 1.5&amp;#34; iron (Herstyler Superstyler Onyx Hair Straightener Black, 1.5&amp;#34; Ceramic Plates).</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gets super hot and takes less than 10 min to straighten hair every morning! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> What a bargain for the price. Works better than my CHI! Definitely skip the overpriced mall kiosks and buy online.</li>
            <li> This is a very good hair straightener. As listed in some reviews before mine, the pattern on the handle is kind of abrasive and rough on the hands, but it straightens so ridiculously quickly that it hasn&#x27;t been a real issue. The hair straightener has a dial from the least hotness to 180 degrees, I believe, and even on the lowest setting, it&#x27;s straightened better than any other hair straightener I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my flat iron. Thank you and I got it fast</li>
            <li> I ended up sending this product back for a refund.  Maybe I had a lemon, or maybe it&#x27;s just a poor design.  Didn&#x27;t effectively straighten relatively fine wavy hair, even after tons of preheating and working. The name-brand ones work better and are pretty much the same price.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy and a wonderful product. I have purchased Herstyler flat irons in the past for my daughters and we have had a good experience with all of their products. I would definitely recommend this product to others and I would purchase another one in the future.</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON IS GREAT! I HAVE SEEN THIS FLAT IRON AT THE MALLS FOR $95, AND IT IS THE SAME BRAND AND EVERYTHING... IT IS REALLY WORTH WAITING A COUPLE DAYS TO RECEIVE IT IN THE MAIL!</li>
            <li> My friend bought one of these straighteners at the mall and paid $100.00 for it.  I was envious but that price just wasn&#x27;t in our budget.  It is so exciting to have this product at 1/4 of the price.  It arrived earlier than expected.  So far, I have loved the way it heats up instantly and makes my hair shine.  Recommending this product with confidence.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t worth the buy. It&#x27;s cheaply made and no where near as good as the ones sold at my local mall. The plates do not look ceramic and it doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair well. Overall you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve paid more for our first &#x27;Her Styler&#x27; straightener and love it - we just needed more then one since there are 3 of us using it in our household.  When I found the exact same straighter online at a fraction of the price, I was a little skeptical.  When it arrived, we were extremely pleased that it is the exact same product we paid over $100 for 2 years prior.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a couple of years ago and it&#x27;s still working! Great investment! It&#x27;s awesome and is my go to tool every day. I love it! It heats up fast, maybe less than 1 minute and works like a charm. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have had my herstyler flat iron for 2 years. Worked wonderfully on my extremely thick hair. However, this morning, as I was straightening my hair, I heard a loud pop and then a huge spark. The spark burnt my arm! This flat iron is a fire hazard. I&#x27;m terrified to use a herstyler flat iron now and very sad as it straightened my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to seal storage bags and it worked extremely well.  I cannot comment on the use for it intended purpose the hair because it was never used for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this flat iron for over seven months and its good as new. It does a good job ironing my hair which is wavy, medium thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Bought this not to long ago. Love love love it! I paid for this exact one at the mall but for $100.00. This has always been my go to flatiron!  Love the price and product!</li>
            <li> I so, so, so, loved this this Flat iron. This was truely one of the best ones i have had. I just hate that i dont have it any more. Somehow my grandmother used it and ruined the cord. She had it tangled with another hair device she had broken and was throwing away and cut flat iron cord instead of the other one :-( i was very hurt.... But other than that i loved this product. it worked very well on my natural hair(No perm..Thick &amp; long) and on my weave. It didnt burn or over heat. Sometimes its hard finding a good product for african american hair. I try not to use alot of heat on my hair and i was flat ironing about every two weeks, which worked out great because my hair last(straight) pretty long. As far was the packaging and delivering, I have no complaints. I loved the bag that came with it to store the flat iron when not in use. I definalty am going to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I already have this from Texas and wanted to have another one for back up. Work like wonders for anything hair styles you want and heats up pretty quick. I would buy this again if mine ever went missing!!!!</li>
            <li> Came as described, fast delivery, I have not used it yet but it&#x27;s a perfect replacement for my other her styler flat iron.</li>
            <li> I loved this flat iron, it does wonderful on my hair that I. Ordered more for my family members. Thanks</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have every owned!  Used correctly it makes hair more shiny and smooth than other brands have.  Recommended by a family member and so glad I bought it.  Didn&#x27;t come with the travel bag though so I was a little disappointed, but that was no big deal because it comes in a lovely box with a magnet closure which is where I keep it once it cools.  My sister-in-law bought hers in the mall and paid a lot more for it.  We compared them and they are the same.  I am very happy that I got a nice iron at an awesome price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one month and it broke. The warranty says you have to send them $20 to initiate the return and warranty coverage. Be warned!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy this, just be very carful with it. I&#x27;ve had mine 6 months now and 2 weeks ago my dog knocked it off my bed side table (which is only like 2 feet off the ground) and one of the ceramic plates cracked. No big deal, whatever. It still worked. I didn&#x27;t use it as much only on those horrible hair days where I needed it. As for today, we are having family pictures so I wanted to straighten my hair. Half way through I went to clamp it on a section if hair and it just completely shattered. I can no longer use it because the hot plate under the ceramic plate is exposed now. It was worth the $30 I paid for it while it was not shattered, great flat iron, just not a very long life span.</li>
            <li> Nice iron, it fits the hand nice while you are using it. I really like this flat iron. It is a good size.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter had heard about the Herstyler from her friends so she just had to have one and she just loves it!!! As a mother I know how hard it is sometimes to find just the right thing for a teenage girl, and when she  used her Herstyler and loved it, I knew I had made the right choice in purchasing the Herstyler. The price was really great, in fact I wish we had bought this Herstyler before we spent over $100 on another very popular name brand flat iron or hair straightener which ever way you prefer to call it. So, YES I would highly recommend the Herstyler to everyone looking for a really great flat iron!!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron ever, I have spent so much money buying other flat iron and they usually stop working after my first use.  I have a lot and I mean a lot of hair and that&#x27;s why they usually stop working. But I have this one over a year now and it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li> I love herstyler and for the price, I couldnt pass this up. However, after a week of using it the power cord seemed loose and the red light that shows the straightner is on or heating up was flickering off and on. The ceramic on the flat iron was different also, it keeps pulling on my hair. I have always used herstyler and liked it, it seems more likely that the iron I recieved was a reject batch.</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron and great price!  Easy to use.  Leaves hair smooth and super straight.  I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
            <li> I bought this same one back in 2000 in colorado inside a mall. It worked perfect until I finally dropped it one too many times on a tile floor a couple of months ago. I paid $200 for it back then. So I was thrilled that I found it on amazon for such a low price. The electrical cord is about 18 inches shorter but it is still a good long length. It is made a little lighter(in weight) than the original but so far works very good! I hope this one last 14 years as well. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst flat iron I have ever owned! And I never write bad reviews so this says a lot. There is no indicator to even tell you it&#x27;s on- the only way is to touch it and risk burning your fingers. I have thick, moderately wavy hair. In thin sections it is easy to straighten. This iron didn&#x27;t take out any of the waves at all! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I have used cheap Conair brand straighteners that work better than this!! I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;d even sell this product. The iron claims to get to 400+ degrees but doesn&#x27;t come close. Hair feels like warm to the touch after a run through. Bitterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a ceramic-coated flat iron for so long because 200 dollars is a ridiculous amount of money for hot slabs of metal. I am so happy that i tried out my friend&#x27;s herstyler and finally bought this one. my hair is huge and it literally took me two hours to get it straight because every three-five sections i would have to wait for it to reheat. this thing reheats fast enough that I can do ten-twenty sections before pausing.</li>
            <li> Best iron ever. It&#x27;s full ceramic plates don&#x27;t burn my hair and leave it soft and silky every time it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried several irons and this is the best one I have had, leaves my hair smooth and it lasts longer. All the girls in my family own one. Definetely the best choice for a good price.</li>
            <li> The straightener definitely worked well for its price, but it does not hold up. It didn&#x27;t turn on the 3rd time I used it. I say just invest in a more expensive, reliable straightener. It&#x27;s more worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> It works well. I am trying to have healthier hair so I only use it on special occasions. Once I forgot to turn it off and when I came back the Iron was completely cool and still works. I am assuming it shut itself down. I really like this Flat iron would recommend it!</li>
            <li> It pulls my hair and destroys it! Plus I continue to try to register it online and of course it won&#x27;t work. I just bought it. Don&#x27;t waste your money. My old ine is better!</li>
            <li> They sell these straightners at a mall close by for around $200!!!  I bought one years ago... it broke and I couldn-&#x27;t pay another $200.  So I found them on Amazon for less than $40!!  Works great, I have had Chi&#x27;s, Gold n&#x27; hot, and many others.  This is by far my favorite and works great!!  I have very thick curly hair, and it leaves it shiny and straight!!</li>
            <li> I like this iron because it gets my hair straight, and it has adjustable settings. I can use low heat when necessary or use high heat. The plates on this iron are smooth ceramic as well which is nicer on the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> ceramic iron started chipping and then broke off in an area. it still works however, I am worried that it could cause hair burning</li>
            <li> I bought this months ago just to have a new flat iron because my previous one was about 5 yrs old. It was an old Revlon ceramic plated just like this Herstyler iron. I thought since it was rated well that it would be a good steal. It does not glide on hair well at all.... I almost wonder if its a fake herstyler or this iron is just not that great. I&#x27;ve been having more split ends and its showing up faster and faster. Compared to my old Revlon one (which, by the way is not broken i just felt like buying a new one) I am going back to using my old Revlon one that slides better on my hair and does not feel like its pulling my hair out as I straighten it. And does not get all this sticky residue from hairspray on the iron. Am i crazy, I havent changed my hair routine, just the iron but it gets more hair spray stuck on it than the Revlon one. Anyway I would never buy anything of this brand again. I&#x27;m going to stick to my old Revlon flat iron until I buy a nice one like a Chi or something.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and does a nice job. Wish the turn on and off button was on the outside instead of inside of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome! The shipping was shockingly quick and i got emails everytime it was scanned. I love amazon.com and highly recommend this product for all hair typed.</li>
            <li> Before i even used it the flat iron plug popped off in the back and then it shows the bag but it didnt even come with it ......</li>
            <li> My very favorite straightener! It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come at the time it was supposed to .</li>
            <li> I thought all flat irons were the same.  I also thought to get a good one you had to pay a lot for it.  This one is great. Get&#x27;s hot but doesn&#x27;t burn.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife she likes it although it smells EVERY time its heated up. I wanted to buy her a better quality one like a CHI but she didn&#x27;t want to spend the money so we tried this. Just for the smell I would rather have bought the better quality one. Ive bought her other CHI products and have nothing bad to say about them</li>
            <li> The Herstyler is great!  Get&#x27;s hair nice and smooth and provides smooth curls with the twist of your wrist.  These products are sold at very high prices in various malls however amazon has the BEST price point for it!  They are delicate...try to avoid dropping it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product has adjustable tempature control for fine hair.  Heats up in a very short time.  Would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> This product is just ok.  I think the Chi is a better flat iron to straighten hair.  The Herstyler has the ability to curl and I have not attempted this...</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. My daughter and I both have long hair and both straighten it daily with this one straightener.  It lasted us 3 years before a short in the cord broke it. So,[[ASIN:B002LE8OX8 Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron]] I had to buy another and I plan on buying a second one too. Its worth the money.</li>
            <li> This iron rocks! It beats the chi by far. It is ceramic plated all the way through not just coated. It seals in humidity so you don&#x27;t friz up when you walk outside etc. I love it. So worth the money on Amazon, it is around $150-$170 retail on herstyler.com</li>
            <li> I have medium coarse hair and I never used flat iron before but after I got permanent straightening done on my hair it changed its texture and now it looks rough, frizzy and very curly. I was not so sure about getting any chemical treatment again on my hair. I first bought a Conair wet to dry hair straightener (max temp 375) and never got good result then I saw this in a mall kiosk and the guy at the kiosk did my hair with this iron and the result was amazing but he was selling it for $90 with some shampoo and conditioner package form the same company. I wanted to do some research before buying. I came back home and saw the same iron for $48 @ amazon and I ordered it immediately and I am so glad I did it. It gives awesome result and the best part for the international traveler that it runs on dual voltage (though I haven&#x27;t checked it personally)</li>
            <li> I am literally blown away at how AMAZING the quality and most of all, the effectiveness of this flat iron! I was at a local mall a few months ago and was approached by an overly aggressive salesperson who insisted I try the iron- I was blown away by the results it gave, but NOT at the price they were asking! (and believe me, had I had an extra $200 laying around, I would have purchased it immediately as I was that impressed with the results!) but luckily, I was given a sample of the serum ans started hunting it down online- that&#x27;s when I discovered the EXACT same flat iron (and serum) on Amazon for the unbelievable price of $20!!! It arrived just yesterday and sure enough, this is the EXACT same iron with the unbelievable salon-like effects! I&#x27;ve tried SO many expensive salon and hairdresser recommended flat irons throughout the years and this is the ONLY one that gives me results EXACTLY as if my hairstylist did it himself! And for $20?! What do you have to lose? I&#x27;m SO happy that I found Herstyler on here and wanted to assure anyone who either thought about purchasing one at those mall kiosks to hold on to their money and buy it from here - it&#x27;s the EXACT same iron and comes in a gorgeous box with warranty and everything! Cannot recommend highly enough!</li>
            <li> Very good product that I purchased after a friend&#x27;s recommendation. It&#x27;s light, it works well, thin enough to make soft curls, after more than 2 yrs the ceramic is as new.</li>
            <li> They sell this straightener at the kiosk stands at the mall, yeah the $100 ones. You&#x27;re saving so much money, I swear by this straightener, curls last and it gets really hot to wear even the thickest of hair gets straightened but doesn&#x27;t burn off your hair. For thinner hair I&#x27;d say lower the temp. to be safe. Better than the straighteners at Sally&#x27;s or at the stores that just stop working and getting as hot. High end straightener !</li>
            <li> Ever sinve I have been using this straightener my hair has become more healthier with less split ends. This is better to use if you straighten your hair alot. I am mixed race so my hair is natural tightly curled. With at least 2 strokes it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair which requires a lot of heat when wanting to wear my hair straight. I had a chi  before and it had a fixed temperature setting which did nothing for my hair.This flat iron leaves my hair silky and smooth and NEVER leaves any heat damage to it. It curls my hair as well which a lot of flat irons can not do.</li>
            <li> Overall this flat iron is pretty good.  My hair is smooth and shiny.  It pulls on the ends of my hair if I&#x27;m not careful though.  The thing I HATE about it is the hard as a rock handle with the weird design in it.  It&#x27;s giving me a callus on my thumb!  It hurts and it&#x27;s not cute!  So, I think the handle needs improvement for sure!  I would recommend, but maybe wear a glove when using!</li>
            <li> Gets to the root with ease!</li>
            <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact iron from a mall and it was $250. I absolutely loved it and it has lasted me over 5 years. I decided to get another one for back up. I saw this deal online and it almost seemed too good to be true. I got it in the mail and it is the real deal. It works so great and make your hair feel so soft and healthy. I&#x27;ve used herstyler products for years and I have always gotten great compliments on my long blonde silky hair.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron for the price! My sister and I have been using this for years and we have had no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Even though I got suckered at the mall where they sell this product.  IT WORKS!!!!!!  I have had all types of straighteners, and they do not work for my truly thick coarse hair.      I used this with putting my hair in sections, and slowly went through it.  I had to do it after it was dry.  But I can honestly say that this is the first straightener where after I use it my hair feels better then before I used it!      Also I like this one because with dyed hair, it does not pull out the color due to the ceramic plates, or something.  Not sure really what it is but my hair looks better and keeps its shine!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works just like my daughter says it would and she loves it. Arrived on time for her Birthday and she is happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It gets the job done but I love the tourmaline herstyler flat irons alot better! Your hair comes out pin straight more shiny and it stays that way! I had the herstyler BLACK flat iron. Worked great! and lasted 5 and a half years! I will be buying the better flat iron!</li>
            <li> I have long naturally curly hair and have tried to straighten it in the past.  The only iron that really worked and made my hair look smooth and shiny was a Chi... and who has the money for that??!!  I read the reviews and the price was definitely right so I decided to give this one a try.  I purchased this from Amazon over a year ago and it is still going strong!  My friends and family who know how curly my hair is still surprised every time they see how soft and smooth it gets.  If you need the quality of a Chi, but don&#x27;t have the budget the Herstyler IS the way to go!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is amazing.  I have had dry brittle hair and after using this flat iron along with the crack hair product my hair is shiny and recovering after using these products only two weeks.  You will not be sorry if you order this product.  Also it does have a adjustable temperature knob, although it is not digital.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my daughter.....arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> So I tried this out in the mall, and I was extremely impressed but thought 200 was a rediculous price to pay.. so I found it on here for much less and thought I had to take advantage. Heat up time is short, I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair ten times like I would other flat irons and the shine is amazing... definitely take advantage of this deal on here!</li>
            <li> I have used several different straighteners some the most affordable to the more pricier ones. When I originally purchased my HerStyler at the mall for a whopping $200.00 I was a little upset that I had spent so much for a straightener but from the first time I used it I was sold! No other straighter could compete with it in my book. I was super sad when my straightener broke after 5+ years of putting this baby to work. I knew I wanted the same straightener but I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to dish out that kind of cash for it again. This lead me to search elsewhere for it and alas Amazon.com came to my rescue! I found the sellers California Distributors had the same brand and style flat iron for a STEAL OF A DEAL $25!! I purchased the flat iron on Monday September 15th and it stated I should receive it by the end of the week which was pretty fast if you ask me, I was super stoked! Early the next morning I was checking my emails to track my package and It stated that my flat iron had already been delivered. I thought to myself this must be a mistake I just submitted my order yesterday! I really believed I would never see those $25 or the flat iron again. As I open my front door much to my surprise there was my package waiting for me!! I was jumping for joy and ecstatic that I had received my flat iron in LESS THAN 24 HOURS! That&#x27;s the quickest EVER that I have received anything that I ordered online. The flat iron works exactly like the $200 one i purchased 5+ years ago and the icing on the cake is that I got it for $25 (including taxes/shipping). I am so happy with this purchase and will definitely be recommending CALIFORNIAN DISTRIBUTIOR and this flat iron to my friends and family!. Thanks bunches! xoxo!</li>
            <li> was on sale when i got it. had for over 2 years now and i love it. i have moderately thick long blonde hair and i have never ahd a problem with it.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Still using it years later!  Will never use anything other than ceramic (for a flat iron) again.</li>
            <li> Love it! great price for a heat monster!</li>
            <li> I just got mine today, the packaging is very nice, it comes in a very pretty display case,nothing entirely fancy, but when it comes to the Straightener, it is wonderful,I&#x27;ve got naturally curly red hair,which with a 20$ Straightener would take 3 hours, I&#x27;ve tried,but this one,I had done my hair in 5 or so minutes and for TWENTY dollars ! This is an amazing deal!! I&#x27;m so excited, definitely a steal of a deal,if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap  because of low budget,you couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This is the first straightening iron I&#x27;ve ever bought. I usually borrow my friend&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m so happy I chose this one. It heats up really quickly, and it stays hot. Every time I use it, my friends compliment me on how great my hair looks. I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far. I put 4 stars instead of 5 because I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I am VERY satisfied! You can work with it very fast with the greatest results. Also the Luxury shampoo and Sylicone treatment are great. Thanx.</li>
            <li> The iron is heavy.  The plates were scratched.  The product itself did not work.  It&#x27;s very hard to reach the dial as it&#x27;s in the lower inside part of the flat iron.  I tried it by sliding it all the way to the right and all the way to the left and nothing.  Low heat at all times.  I gave it time to heat up but it did not heat up well at all.  I returned it but I lost out on shipping both ways so basically I wasted about $18 to get a refund?  Think before you purchase.  I&#x27;m not sure how it got so many great reviews.  Maybe I just received a defective model.  Seller claimed product was new and I won&#x27;t be getting a refund so not only am I out the cost plus shipping to receive but now the product is on it&#x27;s way back to them and I paid another fee to ship back.  Why would Amazon approve my return if I was not going to be reimbursed.  I&#x27;ve been shopping at Amazon for years but I&#x27;m starting to think the risk is too great when you shop with them.</li>
            <li> best straightener I&#x27;ve owned. it straightens and curls my hair. The curls hold for longer than a curling iron holds them, which is shocking because my hair is thick and heavy so it does not hold them normally.</li>
            <li> I like it. It does the job that it is meant to do. It only takes me a few minutes to do my hair and my hair is really thick. For the price, its great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightner a couple weeks ago and was really excited to try it out. It arrived in beautiful condition and worked wonderfully. I used it that day and it made my hair feel like a million bucks. I unplugged it and left to go to the movies but, when I came to use it the next day, it didn&#x27;t heat up. The light would turn on but it&#x27;d apparently burnt itself out. It wasn&#x27;t an electrical or circuitry problem either. I have never had a straightner just stop working so suddenly. I don&#x27;t know if I just was unlucky and I&#x27;m the only person this has happened to but I can imagine it can and will happen to anyone. So when purchasing, keep this in mind.</li>
            <li> I bought a blue straightener at the mall for over $100. It broke because I dropped it on concrete from a high distance so when I was looking for a new one I knew I wanted the same one. I am so glad that I looked on Amazon because this is WAY cheaper than anywhere else I have seen. I have even seen it at swap meets but for above $10 more. This really does make your hair silkier and softer, it also helps with humidity. I also love that this is 100% ceramic so it is less damaging. Some people have said that their hair gets caught but I have owned this straightener for over a year and the blue before that for about a year and that has never happened to me. I don&#x27;t have thick or thin hair I would say its average. I have tried to curl with it but I don&#x27;t have the technique down so it is hard for me but my friend has the same one and can do it easily. I am used to curling irons and have not really tried mastering it with the straightener. All in all I absolutely love this straightener and won&#x27;t buy another kind or brand ever again.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  The ceramic plates chipped and cracked on my first one after having it for less than a year.  Hoping the second one will be better.</li>
            <li> Works! I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend $100 like some of my friends did! Heats up pretty quick, it&#x27;s smooth and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> This straightener is affordable and my pride and joy, I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. It was also delivered to be quickly. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! I don&#x27;t even need to use a blow dryer!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product. My friend has one except she bought hers at the mall for a steep $200!!! I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend that much on a straightener so I did some research and came across this one. I&#x27;ll admit at first I was skeptical on buying it. I thought it was too good to be true, but rest assured folks! This is &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34; I compared the two and they work exactly the same giving you the same results. The only difference is the price, but I don&#x27;t know anyone who&#x27;d complain about that! Why purchase something at $200 when $25 could get you the same thing? I definitely recommend this to everyone, best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas gift. I bought my own Herstyler from the mall Kiosk and I paid $105. This one was a steal and I will never ever buy anything from those foolish sales scammers in the mall.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Read all of the reviews to see if it was worth it. It was. Worth the price. Works well</li>
            <li> The product performs what it is advertised to do.  It is easy to use.  The price is competitive with similar ceramic flat irons.</li>
            <li> with my Herstyler. I first saw this flat iron in the mall and had always avoided the sales people, but watched them use the product on a friend and it seemed to work very nicely.  Luckily, I pulled her away and searched for it online, finding it on amazon.com for MUCH less than the folks in the mall were selling it for ($150!!).  Works great, no issues. Thank you to those who rated this product previously, it helped in making my decision and with proper care of it. So far, so great!</li>
            <li> Used it for first time last night and did good on my hair.  It gets really hot to where when I touched my hair it burnt my fingers.  I think I just need more practice.  I was very disappointed a cover or case did not come with it.  THE ADVERTISING was very poor.  It shows a cover with the iron and it did not state the size of the plate so had to search the web to get the info needed.</li>
            <li> I love the flat iron, it is just what I needed.  The price was unbeatable.  I love the fact that I am able to adjust the temputure according to the texture of the clients hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters really love it.  It was at a great price and arrived in the promised time frame.  We spent a lot of money on the same product at the mall a couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> Love it!  This product heats up quickly and seems to be very gentle on my hair.  My only suggestion would be that heating gloves would be included.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying this flat iron, DO IT!! My sister has the same one she purchased from the mall for over $100 and I swear this one works even better. I have over processed damaged hair so almost all flat irons pull my hair and never get it pin straight. Even after flat ironing my hair still has kinks and looks frizzy but not with this tool it makes my hair so soft straight and silky. I LOVE this flat iron and I would recommend it 1000% to anyone with hard to flat iron hair like me. It just might be the best deal on amazon. I use the herstyler serum with it and gives me the best flat iron experience I have ever had in my life. Dont be fooled by the price this flat iron is AWESOME!!! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> It works great, adjustable heat dial so this works for different hair types and styles needing different levels of heat. Easy to use and my hairdresser said my hair is in good condition, yet I use it daily! LOVE the iron!</li>
            <li> This straightner is 97.00 on the herstyler web site I got it for less then half that I love it and wanted to get another one.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to straightener. It heats up quickly and has the option to the control temperature if needed. Each day I use this straightener is pretty much a good hair day for me. Plus, it is an amazing price compared to buying it at the mall stand. Would highly recommend the product!</li>
            <li> This product works grate I love how quick it heats up my father purchased it for Christmas my cat decided to play with the cord and dropped it but it still works two years still with plate falling off it still worked grate my bf has long hair and he can never go back to regular flat iron its horrible if you have to do so ^_^ but I love this one its grate</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a Chi iron for sometime. Well after being convinced to try the her styler I sought out looking for this iron. After looking and looking I found it on Amazon for $27.00. The mall retail price was $150 online price $200. This styler has my daughters hair bone straight. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. I spend less time straightening my long hair because the product works so well. I use to spend around 20 minutes to flatten my hair and now it takes me less than 10 minutes! I plan to order an extra one for backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the swivel cord and helps when I&#x27;m moving around a lot, however wish the cord is retractable for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Also a very good price.  Best one I have ever used - the on/off is on the inside, which at 1st I thought was awkward, but then I realized it is to keep you from accidently turning it off as you use it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 2 inch flat iron and according to the description, this one is 2.2 inches. However, it is actually 1 inch wide. I was told that I received the wrong one, but after doing research, I found out that this product is in fact 1 inch wide. Very disappointing! If you are looking for a wider flat iron, do not purchase this one.</li>
            <li> Only lasted a few months, I had my previous CHI for years!&lt;br /&gt;This came recommended, but I sure wont recommend it to anyone,&lt;br /&gt;I will also tell them to stay away!!!</li>
            <li> This item does not heat up. It was a gift so I can&#x27;t return it as it&#x27;s past the return time period.</li>
            <li> Very excited to receive this product quickly!!! Works great.  I have really curly hair so it&#x27;s hard to get smooth and straight.  This straightner did the job!! Sooo glad i looked on Amazon for my straightner.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when a cover bag did not come with the flat iron.  I had a pink one with my older flatiron .</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! My hair is very curly, and every other flat iron I&#x27;ve tried is not as great as this one! It doesn&#x27;t take quite as long to make my hair straight with this flat iron. And it&#x27;s probably as good--if not better than--a Chi...plus, it&#x27;s cheaper, lol! I would definitely buy this again :)</li>
            <li> Cons, wish it turned off by itself, as I sometimes forget to turn it off! Other than that, it works perfectly. My hair is on the thinner side but with the right cut/style, it styles it perfectly. Should work on any thickness though, it heats to high temps.</li>
            <li> I feel I tried almost every iron out there, but now im am in love. I only use heat on my hair once a week, and that&#x27;s all I need with this. I am an African American with type  4a course ii hair that is relaxed. I can be 10 weeks post and still have a fresh look. This is a must have for me.</li>
            <li> I first heard of the HERSTYLER ceramic flat iron from a friend who had purchased hers at a mall and paid $100+. This past weekend I had tried hers out and loved the way my hair was so shiny and smooth. So I decided to go to Amazon and see if they had and they DID!!! So at first I was hesitant to buy this flat iron since the picture they have doesn&#x27;t depict correct logo. Nonetheless I ordered my flat iron and had emailed the selller: dixied and my doubt was erased. I received my item 2 days later and was EXTREMELY PLEASED AND HAPPY to see it was the exact same flat iron from the herstyler.com website and my friend&#x27;s flat iron. It even came with the 1yr warranty booklet that you can register online for and can even extend your warranty. So happy with this purchase and I&#x27;m raving about it to all my friends and the price you cannot beat. I uploaded a picture showing the packaging it comes in and flat iron with warranty card. Definitely recommend others to buy.</li>
            <li> The best quality with an economical price. Thank you Amazon for such a great deal! Greatly impress and very thankful for an impressive product.</li>
            <li> I saw the same iron on youtube used to curl your hair as well but ive tried it doesn&#x27;t work. even when I straight my hair it tugs. My best bet is to stick with my old one..</li>
            <li> I received my flat iron within 2 days, and I love it.  I wish it came with the nylon case.</li>
            <li> Love LOve LOVe LOVE this Iron !!!!!! My hair was left feeling so good and light weight. I have extremely waivy hair and this Iron had no problems straightening it out.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this model forever.. Did not straighten my hair very. It was as if I never flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I thought this  was an amazing iron in the mall. i read allot of reviews about women getting fake four seasons herstyler irons. and even though mine came in a herstyler box and from the herstyler amazon store. it did not reach a hot tempurature. I could still touch my hair after i pulled it away from the iron. any hair stylist knows thats a nono if you want to get burned. always use a comb. But to test it, i used my hand. Generally one sweep w/ the styler should completely straighten and seal the cuticle. But it did not. I had to send back in the same day :( boo&lt;br /&gt; It said when i ordered it was tourmaline. But ended up ceramic w/ floating plates.. also many questions about internal voltage change from country to country. I think it works as it said 120v &amp; 240 v. But i know for sure that my conair wet to straight 2&amp;#34; flat iron has a digital thermometer, i know im not suppose to steam my hair straight. and your actually suppose to use it when your hair is 80% dry. but i must say that even when i do steam my soppy wet hair &amp; it comes out dry too. it is definately STTRAAIIGHT! something this iron could not even hold a candle too. so sad . i want the one from the mall. and why cant they make a 2&amp;#34; iron..</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron! I have thick curly hair and its hard to find a flat iron thats hot enough to tame it! This flat iron definitely gets hot enough and i love it! The price for this is outstanding, it&#x27;s a great buy! i</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. It straightens your hair and curls very well. I was skeptical about buying a flat iron so cheap but it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace my hot tools iron when my easy lights fried it.  it&#x27;s ok.  It doesn&#x27;t straighten in one swipe though.  I much prefer my curling iron</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair &amp; straighten my hair every day. I love the temp control setting; I keep it on a very low setting.</li>
            <li> this was a xmas gift for my sis...she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;it works great and it gets really hot...now i&#x27;m thinking of getting one for my self!</li>
            <li> I owned one of these years ago, when they first started selling them at the mall. The original flat iron temperature only heated up to 200, but overall I was always so happy with this product until I dropped mine and the ceramic plates broke. Not really wanting to spend the money for another one (I originally paid $150 for one at a local mall kiosk), I decided to just go with some cheap and affordable off brand that I got from Walmart, to my regret. I have thick, naturally curly hair and after blow drying, I&#x27;m left with a frizzy and still somewhat wavy mess. The cheap brand just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. Then I thought, maybe I&#x27;ll just spend the extra money and try a different expensive brand to compare (since there were other flat irons out there with rave reviews). I went with a Solia Tourmaline Flat Iron (sold at folica.com) and it worked pretty good, but definitely not as good as the Herstyler did. But, since I had already spent the money, I just stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;I was recently stopped by one of the guys at the mall kiosk and thought, what the heck. I&#x27;ll listen to what he has to say about the product before I walk away, as I was on the market to purchasing a new iron anyway. When he did the demo on my hair, I was just ecstatic! They improved the product and I was pleased to see that it heated up to 420. After using a different brand for so long, I had forgotten how great this product worked! I do have to say, I did not like how pushy the sales person was, because it really seemed like he wasn&#x27;t going to let me walk away without buying anything. But, knowing that their products worked so well, I ultimately ended up giving in and making a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;For those out there, this is a price you cannot pass for an excellent product!! I can&#x27;t say enough about how great this product is! In my opinion, it&#x27;s one of the best on the market. They&#x27;ve been around for quite some time now, so that has to say something. My only regret is not purchasing it on Amazon for a less expensive price. :-/ Heck, I might order it anyway, just so I have a backup. :-) LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> This flat iron seems to tug/pull my hair.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like a ceramic flat iron should.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  It has the controls &#x27;inside&#x27; between the wands, which I find awkward for access.  The construction seems cheap - the heat control is a plastic knob you dial up or down - you have to guess at the setting - there is no read-out or  marks indicating the temperature setting.  I don&#x27;t expect this flat iron to last long, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Useful. It is really good. I have been using it for so many days! There is nothing wrong with it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this item gets great reviews. You might as well buy a cheap one at the store. I found that those actually work better than this one. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female and I am transitioning from relaxed to natural. This is a great product I use it with Organix healing weightless oil and Bazillion Keratin heat protection spray. My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does the job, but is far below the quality of a Chi hair straightener. I saw more damage in my hair, and more burnt smells coming from this flat iron. Overtime, the ceramic plates have also become a bit burnt with use. It is also very bulky and heavy when compared to the Chi. With the Chi, I can slide through my hair easily and achieve curls, but with this straightener, you need to put a lot more work. I would recommend this for straightening, but not for curling. As I started straightening my hair daily with this, the ends of my hair gradually became crispy, even with the use of heat protecting sprays. Granted, this one has a much lower price than the Chi, but my hair looks noticeably healthier when I am not using this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly for straightening hair. I bought it after a woman at the mall curled my hair beautifully with it, sadly I cannot duplicate her technique.</li>
            <li> When I first got this product, I was slightly disappointed. It feels cheaply made (very plasticy and lightweight) and I could not get the temperature knob to turn all the way up. It worked, but not as well as I wanted it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had had it for a few months, I tried the knob again and finally it let me turn it all the way up! I guess it was just stuck. I have thick, coarse hair so I really wanted the high heat. Now, it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think it feels a bit chinsy, and I am afraid of it breaking, but the functionality is good. I don&#x27;t bother with the on-off switch or the temperature gauge anymore (hard to get to), I just unplug it instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had this product for about a year now, and I have noticed a significant decrease in the level of heat it holds. I am quite disappointed, but it is to be expected. Next time I will spend the extra money on higher quality in hopes that it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener. The price is amazing and it is worth every penny. I am African American and i don&#x27;t have to turn it up to a high setting to achieve the look I want. I would recommend to anyone. I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Great buy. Planning to purchase a second one. Easy to use and enjoy the heat setting knob. I&#x27;ve been using the Chi for years now and I will never purchase another over priced Chi.</li>
            <li> Some people just have no clue about this product because EVEN THOUGH FAKE, it still works like a hair straightener, just not fantastic results like the real one. What&#x27;s that you say, you love the results? Now imagine how much better results the real one would give you. Please hear me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my wife&#x27;s REAL one I paid $300 for died after 4 years. No way was I spending $300 for a new one so I found one on Amazon for $40 figuring they dropped in price online since 4 years ago. Well. This is NOT REAL. The plates are way off and way small, they&#x27;re risen instead of indented, they pull hair, the screws are stripped metal screws not those black triangle screws like on the real one there was a gold passed sticker on it and a bogus warranty card in the box as well. (The real box has the choose your fashion label on the back in black, not white and Le, Ni, Dv, Tp 1.75 and 440 are all on the back as well almost looking like a bio chart) I sent it back right away. Those who love this product obviously don&#x27;t know what the real ones feel and look like and therefore because this is a hair straightener, it will work to some extent. However it won&#x27;t give you results the real one gives you and will probably break in less than a month. I question the plates even being metal, let alone tourmaline or titanium, I bet its synthesized metal created in a lab somewhere in china. How there are 17 left right now is beyond me. All that says to me is if they had 100 then 83 people who never had a herstlyer before just got ripped off and if they end up hating their herstyler now I feel bad for the negative comments the real company would get because some people are just blind to fake products like this. I contacted amazon and they&#x27;ve removed the one I purchased already, I&#x27;d assume this one would be next but with so many listings they may not get to this one. Just try not to be one of the next 17 people from the 17 left that get ripped off. If you want to spend $40 on one then go to WalMart and by their brand styler, unless you love the look of this one, then buy this one cause that&#x27;s all your $40 will end up going to is the look and maybe the cord for the plug, at least that part was real. Fakers go home. I&#x27;ll take my chances on the real one for $300. I now see why they&#x27;re $200~$300, but you can find them for $100~$180 depending on the model you want elsewhere. trust me, if you ladies know and love your hair and want a herstyler like my wife had gotten attached to hers, she couldn&#x27;t use another one and she knew the difference right away, but then when I examined it I felt so burned that Amazon could let such a fake product slip through the cracks like this. I&#x27;ll 2nd guess some of my purchases from Amazon from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. For awhile now I have been shopping on Amazon wondering why some of the products I was looking at were cheaper brand new than some used things on ebay. Now I see why and how easy factories in China manufacture products so close to the original product it&#x27;s crazy and for some people who have no clue, it&#x27;s those people who keep those factories making products and money. I also see now that patents are created not only so someone doesn&#x27;t make money off of someone else&#x27;s product, but because people put in so much time inventing something for a reason, and this hair straightener proves that statement completely. The real ones were invented to do what regular hair straighteners can&#x27;t do, and my wife could curl her hair with her straightener and now she can curve it a bit with the fake one and it doesn&#x27;t hold long at all. So shame on this hunk of garbage. Lastly also, I shouldn&#x27;t be expected to just know a product is fake because the price is low, because it&#x27;s not like I mind buying fake products to begin with, it&#x27;s just thinking you bought something real and finding out it&#x27;s fake kind of strips you of your dignity, which is exactly how I felt and why I&#x27;m venting in this review right now, please forgive me. Just don&#x27;t buy this crap, go to cvs and buy a regular one off the shelf if you wanna spend $40, at least you know it&#x27;s what it says it is on the box. Unlike the crap I just bought was probably tin and created in china to look like metal. Fakers, invent something real and manufacture that.</li>
            <li> They got real hot, but they burned my hair out. Be very careful. You may need something sprayed on your hair first before you use this.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be like the ones they offer you in shopping malls for like $150. Its not as good but for the price you pay here it is more than satisfactory. I had more expensive ones than this one and they did a worse job so for $25 I think you can&#x27;t do anything wrong it.</li>
            <li> Works really good so far. Hope it last. A little skeptical because of the price. Really like that it has a dial for how hot you want it.</li>
            <li> I adore this flat iron.  I paid $120 for this same product 7 years ago and it&#x27;s finally time for a new one.  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only $25 on Amazon!  To address a couple concerns from other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  \\&quot;I can&#x27;t tell when it&#x27;s ready\\&quot;-  Lightly touch the outside of the iron.  Is it hot?  It&#x27;s ready.&lt;br /&gt;2.  \\&quot;My hair gets stuck in it all the time\\&quot;-  Your hair goes between the irons.  I can&#x27;t imagine where you&#x27;re putting it that it would get stuck???  I didn&#x27;t ever have this issue FOR SEVEN YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my previous HerStyler croaked (it never stopped getting hot- eventually the handle broke from daily use.  Did I mention I used it for seven years?) I went out and paid $75 for a different brand iron, hoping it would work as well and not be as expensive.  Too bad I didn&#x27;t look at Amazon first because that $75 iron is horrible and I can get my coveted HerStyler for way less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for it to get here!  My curly hair will be soft, shiny and STRAIGHT as a pin once again!  Happy happy!</li>
            <li> Easy to use! And doesn&#x27;t damage my long hair</li>
            <li> Wow!!! For the price I paid for my iron I was pleasantly suprised to see that it was better than the iron I paid 175.00 for, it has adjustable temperature and it&#x27;s nice and heavy! I&#x27;ve only had my iron for a week and so far so good! Don&#x27;t get me wrong my original herstyler flat iron purchased at the kiosk is wonderful also, I really didnt expect to get such a good flat iron for the price....waiting to see what&#x27;s the catch! LOL!!! I think I better stock up on this steal before it&#x27;s no longer available![[ASIN:B002LE8OX8 Herstyler Classic Forever Ceramic Flat Iron]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how quickly it gets to it&#x27;s set temperature and how well it stays at that temperature. I can style my hair so much more quickly than I could with my old straightener. That said, I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, so I have no idea how this product holds up against more difficult-to-tame tresses.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Makes my hair so silky and so smooth and no split ends! So glad I didn&#x27;t buy it at the mall and found it on here!</li>
            <li> I just got this today. I had never used a flat iron on my hair before today.  This heats up nicely and works beautifully!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use, and what a great job it did on my hair. It seems like it&#x27;s solidly made!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work so nice. I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing and they were right. It was cheap and works well.</li>
            <li> out of all the flat irons I&#x27;ve bought, this has been the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;Usually, I&#x27;d spend around $100-$200 on a &amp;#34;good quality&amp;#34; flat iron, but this one being only $20, gives me the same quality if not better!&lt;br /&gt;I had the same one but in purple before, but I dropped it too many times to the point where it cracked, so just don&#x27;t drop it more than 10 times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it is cheap, great quality, and heats up fast!</li>
            <li> Hair so silky and shiny. I use this flat iron all day on African American hair .The  heat is consistent and the hair is bouncy and silky.</li>
            <li> love it -  use it all the time and hope it lasts as good as other one has lasted for me</li>
            <li> This is a great prodict. I have had one other one that lasted me 3-4 to years.  I was a little disappointed that the plates had a few scuffs on them, not something you would expect from a brand new item.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were in the mall a few years ago. Within one of the kiosk&#x27;s they were selling this product for 5X&#x27;s what was advertised through Amazon.  Well my daughter, which has very long hair, tested this straightner and now will use nothing else.</li>
            <li> I bought this same product a year before from a kiosk in a mall for $150. This time around it was $20 for the exact same thing! So the price is great. This heats up so fast and does a great job. My hair doesn&#x27;t get torn up or burned up from this, so whatever the material is, it works. It seems to make my hair smoother and silkier. I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering a second, just because it was so cheap and a great product.</li>
            <li> so affordable! works like a champ. i leave it on by accident all the time and ive never had issues with it. ive left other ones on before (Chi) and it ended up dying after a couple months.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron to have at my job as a spare. It has such a strong burning odor that I had to stop using it at work since people would come in thinking that the &amp;#34;heater&amp;#34; was on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would be the same as the one in the mall. It did a less than satisfactory job on fine wavy hair. After 2 months it went completely out. When I contacted The manufacturer they said there was nothing they could do bc Amazon sellers are not authorized dealers. I should have known that something this cheap was a knock off!!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the most awesome hair tool for anyone! It doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, there&#x27;s a temp gauge that allows for you to decide just how hot you need it. It is amazing, every women should own one of these. I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 years, and like many others, bought the 120 dollar one at the mall before finding it on amazon. The ceramic WILL CRACK if you drop it, so be careful where you set it. That is why I had to buy a new one. But I really missed it when I broke it! I found that if you are cautious of your hair type and don&#x27;t put a ton of heat on it, it actually will help you not to have to get deep conditioning treatments or even a \\&quot;cut\\&quot; for dead ends as often. Use a syrum in your hair after you shower, let your hair air dry and you can do what ever you want with this straightener keeping your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Just to give some scale to the review, here is a description of my hair type: Thick, long, naturally wavy, slighty frizzy, mostly air-dried, never dyed, never highlighted, and just lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this flat iron from a mall kiosk in late 2007. I managed to talk the pushy salesperson down from $200 to $30, so I can only imagine what this product actually costs wholesale. When I first purchased it, the product worked just as well as any other premium brand flat iron. After the first two years of ownership I noticed the product&#x27;s declining performance. It would take longer periods of time to straighten my hair. The flat iron would straighten the hair but I no longer received the silky smooth salon style results from before.  The iron would take longer to heat up. It began snagging on my hair. Etc. Etc. This slowly got worse over the next 3 years. Obviously, this wasn&#x27;t a big deal as I still continued to use the flat iron over this extended period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description of the product over the 5 year period:&lt;br /&gt;The plastic body of the flat iron has held up very well. I absolutely love the temperature control dial, even if it is in an awkward location. The spring is still strong. However, the ceramic plates.....The ceramic plates began to discolor within the first few months of owning the flat iron. Now I know it wasn&#x27;t due to product residue, because I cleaned it after every use (either damp microfiber cloth &amp; drop of soap or isopropanol). The discoloration actually looks like brown scratches over the plates. However, the plates are still smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now why would someone only give 3/5 stars for a flat iron that lasted them 5 years? Well thats because I only used the flat iron ~once a month, if that. Most premium brand flat irons for sale (ex. CHI, GHD, SEDU,...) will last you ~3-4 years with daily use. Since HerStyler is trying to sell these flat irons in the same price range, one would assume and expect the same product quality. Then again, only pushy salespeople at mall kiosks sell these with the wide haggling range of $30-$200....</li>
            <li> came before the expected date, actually about 5 days early! The only package I have been very happy with ordering so far!!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron a couple of years ago and still using it. It&#x27;s great for straightening my natural hair!</li>
            <li> I m returning this iron, it was sold it to me as new but it looked used when it arrived. Also the carrying pouch you see in the pic was not included when it arrived. My hair is thick but manageable and this can t even get them straight at the maximum heat setting, also your hair will get stuck in the plates and break. Overall disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. She be straightening and straightening all day, and not burn your neck up.</li>
            <li> Works just as great still.  Tried it at a mall kiosk where they were charging a grip for it.  Got it here for a steal!!</li>
            <li> Did I say I love this flat iron?  I have used babybliss, t3, sally beauty brand etc, this has to be my most favorite flat iron. The babybliss that I had died so I had to find replacement. I am transitioning from permed hair to natural so I needed something to get my hair straight without the smell and frizzies, this does the job! I was looking at a higher priced 100% ceramic, but decided to try this first.  My hair is so soft and shiny and no smell. I use Tresmme heat protectant and I look like I just stepped out of the shop. :-) The only down-side is that it&#x27;s to big to get the shorter hair..I&#x27;m back looking for a smaller version as well. For the price/quality..this one is hard to beat!</li>
            <li> This is not the real deal... It&#x27;s a knockoff.  It didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as good as the real one , feels cheaper and had a funny smell when turned on and made a slight buzzing noise. I was u able to return it to get money back because I had closed the credit card I used to buy it. Lesson learned, if it sounds to good to be true, it usually is. (Buy this  from an approved herstyler dealer) check the herstyler website to see who is approved.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!!!! just like the one I had bought from the mall before it broke and way cheaper!! leaves my hair so soft and shiny and it heats within seconds!! I definitely recommend it :D</li>
            <li> Worked very well. Made my hair very soft and shiny. Highly recommend it. Very good price. Found it at a women&#x27;s show and they wanted $170 for it. Looked on amazon and found it here and it works awesome!</li>
            <li> We bought out girls flat irons from a local department store and were very disappointed with the results.  In the mall, a salesperson showed us this iron and offered to sell it to us for $200!  It works great and the price here is exceptional!&lt;br /&gt;Package came quickly and product is of high quality!</li>
            <li> Great sale price and does the expected! Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I do love that this straightener is 100% ceramic and it&#x27;s selling at a good price. It heats u super fast, you have a wide range of options for the heat settings (I use it at the lowest 180F) and keeps hair straight. It would be perfect if it weren&#x27;t for these 2 flaws:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 it snags hair- Like my old straightener the plates don&#x27;t close evenly leaving the ever slightest gap. This causes for uneven grip in your hair cos it closes very well at the tip of the straightener but leaves a slight gap in the inner part causing uneven pressure and snagging.&lt;br /&gt;#2 It gets super hot in the outside of the straighter that at high temps you&#x27;ll probably need a glove to touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be ridiculous to buy these types of  &amp;#34;kiosk&amp;#34; straighteners for more than $30. If you want to stick to a top notch brand try Karmin Pro, Sedu, Croc, HSI. This is a a regular type straightener and it&#x27;s worth the $20-30 :)</li>
            <li> i love my straightener its a great hair product for the price</li>
            <li> LOVE it got it for my daughter and she uses it daily. works awesome and heats up fast. great product</li>
            <li> The quality for the price you cannot beat this. Better than my old $ 140 chi. Less damage to my hair . They sell the same one at the mall near my house for 200 dollars. I&#x27;m glad I didnt pay nearly that :)</li>
            <li> She says it straightens her hair quickly and warms up fast!  It shipped quickly and works great!  Best straightener that she has ever had.</li>
            <li> Everyone is raving about the Nume products out there. Well guess what...the Herstyler products are amazing and a fraction of the price. So save your cash and pick up the Herstyler irons and wands. I have the flat iron and the 3M exchangeable clipless curling wands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are absolutely 100% ceramic. I know because I abused my first flat iron so much that I busted the plate. Low and behold, when I picked it up it might as well have been a terracotta pot, there was zero, yes 0, metal in this sucker.  Rest assured this will not damage your hair no matter how hot it gets.  It will only make it shinier and softer :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite relieved to find these listed on amazon now too because this company originally had some foreign name I can&#x27;t pronounce or remember, and I paid about $100 for my first iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product becuase it was the first thing in my whole life that curled my hair and my hair wasn&#x27;t straight again by the time I finished the other side of my head because my hair is BOARD STRAIGHT! With these products I can actually use NO HAIRSPRAY REQUIRED and still have curls the next day!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nume makes great stuff too, but like the Herstylers, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find them on here one day, also heavily discounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps... as you an tell I LOVE THESE PRODUCTS!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this styler to replace my old one, which I had for a few years. And it&#x27;s just as amazing as the first one.</li>
            <li> This price is Sooooo good I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I would sell these for at least $100 each. This price is way better than any employee discount I ever got. I ordered it thinking it could be a knock-off (No offence to the seller) but No, it&#x27;s real n works great. No need to buy another curler my flat iron does it all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. 2nd one purchased. By far the best price on Amazon.  Last one went over 4 years with conatant use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this flat iron. I had one I bought at Sally for about 5 years. When it died, I got a simple one from WalMart. Bad idea. Pulled my hair out constantly, took forever and it did not hold the straighteness for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS flat iron is by far the best I have ever used.It is simply amazing. And it was nowhere near the $150 I had paid for the professional version. FRACTION of the cost and I am so much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never been smoother or shinier or silkier. I love it. I have color processed hair that is very thick and I have a lot of hair. It is naturally curly in back and wavy in front. THIS is one of the few that can manage the curls and make them straight for a long time.</li>
            <li> Finally got this after getting a demo at the mall. First of all, do NOT pay the $200 they want you to spend at the mall, hopefully you&#x27;ve found the Amazon product page first. But it just goes to show what a great product this is that one would even consider spending that load of cash on it. The ceramics heat up very quickly, and are so smooth and effective on hair, very easy to hold, clamp, slide down hair lock and release. I have the kind of hair that looks like a giant haystack unless I put a lot of product in it, or dry it for a couple days under wraps in a bun or braid. As a pre-going out styling aid on normal dry hair, this works so well to make gorgeous silky model hair immediately. In just a few minutes I was able to get all the frizz and fluffiness out of my hair and into sleek straight tresses that stayed that way for hours. As the mall guy demonstrated, I can actually use this plus the [[ASIN:B000TW2JQC Herstyler Hair Serum Vitamin E and Aloe Vera(2.0 oz 60ml)]] on wet hair too, it will both instantly dry and style it. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Still working every morning</li>
            <li> Amazing hair straightner!</li>
            <li> My GHD flat iron recently stopped operating as normal so went to my salon for a treatment and flat iron. My hair looked so fabulous that when I got home I asked my stylist what flat iron did she use and she was nice enough to tell me that I could get the Herstyler on Amazon. My husband purchased it for me and I am blown away by how silky soft and bouncy hair was after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extra thick afro hair that I wear straight by blow drying and flat ironing but this flat iron really smoothed the shafts right to the very end. Basically I am so pleased with the salon results that I get from home when using the Herstyler and the price of $32 has me elated!!!!!!  I hope this product lasts as I did read a review that the ceramic plate chipped for a customer but at this price I will gladly buy a new one. MUST HAVE ITEM!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron!  It&#x27;s amazing what it does.  Though I must say for my hair I need the right mixture of products to get my desired out come.  I highly recommend it for natural ladies like myself.</li>
            <li> I was really apprehensive to buy this but I read a few reviews for it and thought for the price, why not. I love it! It works so well. It leaves my hair feeling so much healthier and softer than my old straightener did. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is amazing! Don&#x27;t buy at a mall when you can buy online for a fifth the price! The picture shows the hair straightener with a bag but the one I ordered came in a box that was covered in fabric and came with no heat bag. I just place it back in the fabric box when I&#x27;m done using it, hoping it wont hurt the box though.</li>
            <li> Daughter says its fine</li>
            <li> Pulls and breaks hair.</li>
            <li> Works Well, Straightens quickly. The plates arent as fragile as others make them out to sound, but of course I am not slinging mine around like a lasso.. Thats really the only way i could see these breaking.. Its a solid product. I only wish it had an auto off feature because i sometimes forget that, as my old one did.  But. All in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist so I know a thing or two about irons. I have had many flat irons, even CHI and they are great of course. But for the price this really is a quality iron. It leaves hair very shiny and I have noticed a lot less damage after a few months of using it. I would absolutely recommend it to any client.</li>
            <li> This straightener is horrible! My hair constantly gets caught in this thing and there is no indication when it is ready to use. It doesn&#x27;t straighten as well as other straighteners I owned did.</li>
            <li> It is nothing special.  I already have a hair straightener and thought this was going to be different but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought one just like tis a couple years ago for $100 and it worked awesome, I had to get another one. Great price!! I bought 3!</li>
            <li> I bought this back in 2010. Still works great. Super happy with my buy :o)I would highly recommand this straigthner to anyone. Can&#x27;t beat the price either!!!</li>
            <li> Just now writing this review and I received it like a month or two ago but i love it. Shipping was fast. It heats up quickly and it doesnt snag my hair when I straighten it. I recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I paid around $100 dollars for a Herstyler straightener at the mall. That one broke so I came on here and was so surprised it was only $20. It works just like the one at the mall if not even better.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this flat iron for &#x27;curling&#x27; my hair. It was a good recommendation! It heats up quickly and is easy to use. Plus there is an on-off button and temperature control dial. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair straightener.</li>
            <li> The item does straighten hair quickly; however, the design is poor and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;1) The base is so narrow that the appliance constantly tips over on its side. A regular annoyance. You don&#x27;t even have to touch the cord; the item just has trouble staying upright because it&#x27;s so narrow at its base.&lt;br /&gt;2) The temperature gauge is set between the top and bottom moving parts (sandwiched into the center sort of), so that if you have heat the appliance and need to adjust the temperature setting, you risk burning your fingers when you turn the dial because it is set too close to the hot ceramic plates.&lt;br /&gt;3) It is difficult to tell from the markings on the heat adjustment knob whether you are increasing or decreasing the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;4) Item arrived with no instructions, only a long, detailed safety warning. Sorry, ladies, but I had never straightened my hair until I received this item, and I was truly uncertain how to use it (How long do you allow the straigtener to heat up? Should I wait for the little red light to turn off before using the appliance? How long do you keep the hot plates against your hair? How much hair do you straighten at once? etc.) It&#x27;s a heat-producing electrical appliance for crying out loud. Some instructions would have been nice.&lt;br /&gt;5) I ordered the straightener on Monday, June 18; it didn&#x27;t leave the shipping zip code to start its journey to my house until June 21 which, for an Amazon purchase, is on the slow side. This was not an order that contained several items that had to be split up (which sometimes means delayed shipping). I bought just the one item.&lt;br /&gt;I like seeing my normally wavy hair straight. That&#x27;s something quite new and lovely to me. But for my next purchase I definitely would seek out a product with a more intelligent design.</li>
            <li> Really good flat iron. I have used a GVP flat iron I got from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and got bored with it because it sucked the moisture out of my hair, so when I got outside in humid weather it frizzed up. I like how this flat iron makes your hair so silky and smooth. YOU WON\\&quot;T NEED A OIL OR SHINE PRODUCT! This adds the shine for you. You won&#x27;t be wasting your money. This is the real deal, so don&#x27;t get ripped off by the flat irons they sell at the mall. It&#x27;s the same flat iron only much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and curly.  These flat irons work quickly and I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair 5 times.  Great price.  Better than my $100 flat irons.</li>
            <li> I loved it.I have bought this item for both my granddaughters and my exchanged student from Germany and she also loved it</li>
            <li> It is the best hair appliance I have ever used does the complete job and the price was excellant.  I have used other flat irons in the past and found that they broke off and dried my hair out.  I also had purchased the same product over two years ago and paid over a hundred dollars for same flat iron.  I will always go to amazon to order any additional products for now on this was a real savings to me.</li>
            <li> Had another for five years before this one. It is great, light weight but performs miracles on my hair which is  thick,coarse, and wavy. One pass on a section does it.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron it works great for straightening but when I had my chi I used to be able to curl my hair with the flat iron and this one doesn&#x27;t do it for some reason. I&#x27;m happy that its been so long and it&#x27;s still working though! Almost a year now I think.</li>
            <li> I have crazy hair! It will frizz at a weather report. I have tried so many different hair straighteners ( seriously I have 4 in my drawer). I recently purchased this one, and let me tell you I AM THRILLED. I can do my hair, and it will look great ALL DAY, and I live in Washington state..so there is tons of rain! I will go to bed, and wake up with my hair still looking great, I just do a 5 min touch up. It used to take me 2 hours to do my hair, and now I am at 45 min max. This product is amazing, and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is my second straightening iron from HerStyler. The last one I had lasted 5 years before I replaced it. And the only reason I replaced it, is because my son knocked it off the counter onto the time floor and the plates chipped a little on the edges. Even though I probably shouldn&#x27;t have, I continued to use it until my new one arrived. It worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived super fast, about a week and a half sooner than was estimated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this straightener to ANYONE! Way better than the Chi or other expensive straightening irons. I love that it gets super hot pretty quickly and it has adjustable temperature on it for those who prefer less heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as others have mentioned, I spent $150 on my last one when I bought it from a kiosk at the mall. I was stoked when I saw it on Amazon for a fraction of the price I paid previously! I still think this straightener is worth $150, but hey.. I&#x27;m not gonna turn down a steal like this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the expensive Chi, and this out does the job for me.  Every time I use it is like a trip to the hair salon.</li>
            <li> I love the way the Hairstyler ceramic flat irons turn my naturally frizzy and curly hair into a smooth, silky and straight tamed style.  My hair looks as if it had been relaxed without the chemicals!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on several good-great reviews. Wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles by any means based on the price. But expected a minimum of a good quality Iron that would straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The temperature does not get as hot as any iron I have ever purchased. It takes 3 or 4 passes over hair to actually get it straight at all. And then within an hour or two my hair became extremely dried out and awful looking. I used the iron about 4-5 times and gave up all together.&lt;br /&gt;I was sad but as I said, I didn&#x27;t pay much so I was less disappointed than if I had bought it for hundreds in the mall.</li>
            <li> Bought this flat iron for my mom and she loves it.  She doesn&#x27;t have to set it to the highest setting and it still works great with her frizzy hair.lol</li>
