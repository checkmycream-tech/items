            <li>Does a great job, I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when taking this out of the package, I didn&#x27;t realize the metal bit that attaches the bristles to the handle is like tin foil; it bends and curls VERY easily!</li>
            <li>Good, inexpensive brow &amp;#34;spoolie.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Just what I was hoping to find and a good price.</li>
            <li>Good brush.  </li>
            <li>this is a good spoolie, but the one you can get at target is just as good and cheaper.  </li>

            <li>Nice eyebrow wand.</li>
            <li>It does a good job but the top came off once.</li>
            <li>I think it is kind of pricey and that it could be sold somewhere else for $1</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>suggests some with bamboo handles that they love), but I honestly wanted something with a longer handle so that I could put it in my makeup brush holder.</li>
            <li>Price was right, lol.</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>The tip can be bent to a more convenient angle.  </li>
            <li>I love the length of the wand for this brush.  </li>
            <li>I am told there are even disposable wands that work better than this (and pixiwoo from Youtube</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>but I like this much better because the wand is longer.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It separates all the hairs and makes them more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to handle and use.</li>
            <li>Such a good brush for when you&#x27;re filling in your eyebrows and want to avoid clumps!</li>
            <li>Works better than most higher priced spoolies.</li>
            <li>I love using this to comb my brows while trimming, separating my lashes after applying mascara, or just combing my brows after filling them in love this little brush, great quality</li>
            <li>I purchased for a smooth application for eyebrow liner.</li>
            <li>This is a really great tool, especially when I&#x27;m combing castor/olive oil into my lashes and brows.</li>
            <li>Have to say that I was not disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much else! :)</li>
            <li>Love my products and shipping was fast and reasonable!!!</li>
            <li>I use this to shape my brow and I love it so much.</li>
            <li>This brush is much softer and does a better job for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Received item super fast and I love it for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This product is great and works extremely well....</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy, bends easily.</li>
            <li>I use this brush everyday for my brows and couldn&#x27;t love it more!</li>
            <li>Great little brush for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Great, sturdy little wand.</li>
            <li>I regret buying it to be honest and this would be the 3rd thing i regret buying.</li>
            <li>Really good to soften the look when you SLIGHTLY fill your eyebrows in.</li>
            <li>This is a very reasonably priced eyebrow brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as pictured and what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I also use this to keep lashes separated after first application of mascara to keep them from clumping.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the exact tool that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>One star, because the brush head is barely on, just flops side to side, not at all secure,  </li>
            <li>:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good for a filler until I find something better, and fairly cheap</li>
            <li>This little guy was such a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>Thanks e.l.f</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The long handle makes it comfortable to use and hold.</li>
            <li>It works okay in that respect, although the bristles are rough and thick and I feel that if they weren&#x27;t so dense, they might do a slightly better job.</li>
            <li>I like to use this little wand to help de-clump my eyelashes after I apply mascara and to help smooth out my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I ended up bending it to nearly 90 degrees when I initially pulled on the package to open it, and even though I got it back to its original position, it&#x27;s still slightly bent.</li>
            <li>Even though shipping and delivery were quick, I was not satisfied with this product.</li>

            <li> I use for my thick eyebrows mostly,just not worth ito.o.</li>
            <li> Also, I realized it is expensive after seeing a Sonia Kashuk spoolie selling for only $2.</li>
            <li> You might even get away with using it to brush the hair of a very, very small doll, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for, say, grooming your dog, or raking the lawn.</li>
            <li> When it gets dirty I just wash it with dish soap and let it dry.</li>
            <li> The price on here is ridiculous, just go to ELF website and get it for $1..</li>
            <li> I bought a simi expensive one at Sephora and it was stiff and hard and almost hurt to groom my eyebrows.</li>

            <li> Even though shipping and delivery were quick, I was not satisfied with this product. The metal connecting the handle and the brush looked scratched on mine. The brush itself does not pick up well on my eyelashes. Also, I realized it is expensive after seeing a Sonia Kashuk spoolie selling for only $2.</li>
            <li> works great, good quality</li>

            <li> Nice eyebrow wand. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a very reasonably priced eyebrow brush.  Does what it needs to do to keep eyebrows groomed.  The tip can be bent to a more convenient angle.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Works great, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, I use this to condition my eyelashes, I dip it in some coconut oil and apply to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to handle and use. I use it every morning for make-up prep and now I can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> This product is great and works extremely well....BUT GET IT AT WALMART. Its $1 there</li>
            <li> Very flimsy, bends easily.</li>

            <li> Great, sturdy little wand.</li>
            <li> Such a good brush for when you&#x27;re filling in your eyebrows and want to avoid clumps! It also helps even out the color. Loveeee this brush!</li>
            <li> Does a great job, I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the length of the wand for this brush.  It works great. I recommend it, it is a quality brush.</li>
            <li> Love the brush and got it for a great price.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by a friend and it&#x27;s the exact tool that I was looking for. Thanks e.l.f</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s meant to do. I can&#x27;t say much else! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this after having one by Anastasia and the elf brush is way easier and softer on my skin. It does a good job but the top came off once. You could fix that with glue though so its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> This is a really great tool, especially when I&#x27;m combing castor/olive oil into my lashes and brows.</li>
            <li> This little guy was such a great deal.  It&#x27;s lasted through many eyebrow and eyelash combs and it&#x27;s still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> this is a good spoolie, but the one you can get at target is just as good and cheaper.  would recommend if you can&#x27;t get at target</li>
            <li> I love using this to comb my brows while trimming, separating my lashes after applying mascara, or just combing my brows after filling them in love this little brush, great quality</li>

            <li> Works better than most higher priced spoolies.</li>
            <li> I got this to help groom my brows before filling them in. It works okay in that respect, although the bristles are rough and thick and I feel that if they weren&#x27;t so dense, they might do a slightly better job. If I find something softer, as well, I&#x27;ll definitely go for that instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when taking this out of the package, I didn&#x27;t realize the metal bit that attaches the bristles to the handle is like tin foil; it bends and curls VERY easily! I ended up bending it to nearly 90 degrees when I initially pulled on the package to open it, and even though I got it back to its original position, it&#x27;s still slightly bent. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good for a filler until I find something better, and fairly cheap (although a previous reviewer said there is cheaper).

            <li> I love this brush. It does a good job at blending, but doesn&#x27;t over blend. Would recommend to anyone. Very nice brush.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow brush ever. I bought a simi expensive one at Sephora and it was stiff and hard and almost hurt to groom my eyebrows. This brush is much softer and does a better job for a fraction of the price. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a daily eyebrow groomer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used an old(30+ years) Maybelline brow brush to tame my brows but I like this much better because the wand is longer.</li>
            <li> Works well, bristles stay intact!</li>
            <li> I love my spoolie!!  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with this brush (well, unless you count the time it escaped my brush holder and terrorized the other brushes, but whatever).  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, seems to be sturdy enough for it&#x27;s intended use - brushing your eyelashes and eyebrows.  You might even get away with using it to brush the hair of a very, very small doll, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for, say, grooming your dog, or raking the lawn.</li>
            <li> I like to use this little wand to help de-clump my eyelashes after I apply mascara and to help smooth out my eyebrows. I think it is kind of pricey and that it could be sold somewhere else for $1 but since I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores I decided to get it online.</li>
            <li> Best wand I&#x27;ve tried. Love the feel of it.</li>
            <li> The price on here is ridiculous, just go to ELF website and get it for $1.. SMH I hate when they up the prices on certain things that&#x27;s not even worth such a high price.

            <li> This is a really great eyebrow brush. It separates all the hairs and makes them more manageable. The long handle makes it comfortable to use and hold. I like to hold the brush up against my eyebrows (pushing the hairs up), so that I can trim the long hairs and create a neat look. A+ product. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> One star, because the brush head is barely on, just flops side to side, not at all secure,  Too bad because the rest of it is fine.  I also purchased Jane Iredale&#x27;s Delux Spoolie Brush and it&#x27;s GREAT!  My recommendation is Jane&#x27;s.</li>
