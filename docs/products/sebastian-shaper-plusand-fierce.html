            <li>great price and delevery</li>

            <li>Have been using this brand for fifteen years and was happy to get a GREAT deal on this amazing spray.</li>
            <li>I have used Sebastian Shaper Plus hairspray for years and consider it perfect for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Because it is a wonderful product for fine hair.</li>
            <li>This product is the perfect  balance between the hold wanted from a hair spray and the lightness needed for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work Amazon.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s so good at doing its job that I&#x27;ve said goodbye to gels and mousses.</li>
            <li>For some reason the company decided to change the formula and it is no longer the hairspray I loved.  </li>
            <li>For some reason though, it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the one they use at the salon, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold as well either.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason the company decided to change the formula and it is no longer the hairspray we all knew and loved.  </li>
            <li>REALLY NICE GREAT FOR THE HUMIDITY,</li>
            <li>This was a good buy for 10 oz cans</li>
            <li>Price is good.</li>
            <li>Has anyone found a good alternative?</li>
            <li>Good price at Amazon</li>
            <li>Loved getting a bargain 3 pack</li>
            <li>I have used shaper plus hairspray since 2000 and have loved it, but they changed the formula.</li>
            <li>and I really loved the price.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, but none are as good as Shaper Plus.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find I could order it online</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>

            <li>Good vendor.</li>

            <li>All three hairspray cans came in perfect condition and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li>WORKED SUPER ON MY HAIR EXCELLENT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>If cost is the issue then charge more - don&#x27;t change the formula and take away a great product that works.  </li>
            <li>This holds great without stiffness and it even gets better.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with delivery and product.  </li>
            <li>Have been very pleased with the product, but have never purchased it through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Pricing is great and I love product.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray because it holds great</li>
            <li>the more I use!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair spray!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I sure hope not!</li>
            <li>love this product!</li>
            <li>I love shaper plus!  </li>
            <li>well, off to the Dollar Store to find something better!</li>
            <li>&amp; I still LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great for curly hair - holds strong in humidity.</li>
            <li>It sprays on very light and holds fairly well.  </li>
            <li>i have fine hair &amp; it works just great.</li>
            <li>great for fine or colored hair.</li>
            <li>Great for baby fine hair...</li>
            <li>The product itself is amazing and holds your hair without looking like you sprayed it in place.</li>
            <li>This spray is amazing for humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Shaper Plus for 20+ years and was very upset when this wonderful product had changed and no longer works at all.</li>
            <li>It is nice to get the 3 bottles</li>
            <li>it has a nice smell, since i have an allergy to scents.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a user of Sebastian Shaper Plus hairspray for many years and have loved the product.  </li>
            <li>this is really the best hairspray ever.  </li>
            <li>It is just absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>Not the original formula!!</li>
            <li>And I am now exceptionally happy that I couldn&#x27;t find the old one and am really happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and I was so happy to find this product.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to brush or comb thru.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t buy it unless you have the kind of hair that can handle a very light hold.</li>
            <li>Best hair spray made and leaves hair soft bouncy and not sticky</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is the best hairspray on the market.</li>
            <li>It is not an easy product to find, therefore, I was delighted to be able to find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and IT WORKS.....</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this hair spray!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair spray and hair styling product I use, and have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I was worried about the price of a full size can, but it looks like there is a good deal here on amazon.com - three 10oz cans for $25.  </li>
            <li>If cost is the issue then for pete&#x27;s sake just charge more - don&#x27;t take away a tried and true product!!</li>
            <li>I love Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Thank you amazon.com for finding these dealers and passing the savings on to your satisfied customers.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I am also pleased with all my purchases from Amazon also.  </li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t use this product, I would never be able to keep my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>I Love this hairspray and the thinner that my hair gets as I &amp;#34;age&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray.</li>
            <li>and I love the product.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this supplier.  </li>
            <li>Most stores and beauty supply houses don&#x27;t carry the product.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t sticky or gooey, like most sprays.</li>
            <li>completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Nice light spray that allows you to finger style your hair.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of hairspray.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but when we received the cans with 30% more, (13.8 Oz) that was a plus.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairspray...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairspray because you can get a brush/comb through it if you need to restyle/shape your hair</li>
            <li>Sure, it will cost you more than another brand, but with hair spray, you get what you pay for, and I for one can not handle that lingering hair spray stink.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Excellent shaper - my wife uses it to style her hair daily</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>We just love it and love the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Shaper continues to be my favorite hairspray.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Shaper Plus after a 20 year love affair.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Now that I can get it through Amazon it is more than affordable.</li>
            <li>Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>I love that I can buy it online.  </li>

            <li>Love the product hope I can continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li>If you look at the ingredients, there are many changes to the formula.  </li>
            <li>Looks better than picture.</li>
            <li>I have used this hairspray for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this hairspray and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>But the more I used it the more</li>
            <li>I have been a faithful user of this product for more than years.</li>
            <li>Much better than make up beauty stores.</li>

            <li>-gladly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>and I still will be able to get it through amazon.com.</li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for fifteen years.  </li>
            <li>I love this one...</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone that wants soft good hold.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years</li>
            <li>Then you can brush it right out and your hair is shinny and bright.  </li>
            <li>My barber was the first to show it to me, and that&#x27;s where the good stuff should be, in the hands of pros.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair spray, combs out easily</li>
            <li>Keep the nozzle clean--the nozzle gets clogged easily and if you don&#x27;t use the product often, it seems to clog more.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Great product and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I first discovered it about12 years ago on a visit to New Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have not found another Hairspray as perfect.  </li>
            <li>I like it because although it holds very good, yet you can brush it out and your hair is not left with that sort of wiry effect.  </li>
            <li>It was a simple purchase, 3 bottles at one time and at very good pricing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not stiff not sticky  just a great hold</li>
            <li>They wanted me to pull the receipt, mail it with a 3 x 5 card, detailed problem history which would cost more than a buck and about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Amazon offers a great price.</li>
            <li>Its not heavy, and is a great styling tool.</li>
            <li>It holds your hair well, but most importantly, it can be combed out easily.</li>
            <li>I got the product right away-within 2 days, which was also nice.</li>
            <li>I live in a very windy state and with the fine hair that I have, this hair spray holds my hair in place perfectly.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the original version of Shaper Plus, but I wanted to warn others about ordering online sight unseen.  </li>
            <li>IT ALSO BRUSHES OUT EASILY, BUT DOES BUILD UP BY THE END OF THE WEEK.  </li>
            <li>I got my 3 cans of hairspray very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have used Sebastian shaper plus hairspray for many years, and have always loved the soft hold.</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>Love my hair spray, this one is not gooey sticky, my hair dresser calls it clean</li>
            <li>Easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t get tacky.</li>
            <li>Used to just fall l out easily.</li>
            <li>I can even touch up if I am going out at night and somehow  easily l brush through my thickish hair yet  </li>
            <li>but its not that strong</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve definitely changed the formulation, as is the case with so many things so many of us have been using forever and loved.</li>
            <li>At first I liked this hair spray, because it is not sticky and you can brush out your hair, without washing it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and this product helps it keep its style in the summer humidity.  </li>
            <li>Finding hairspray for fine textured hair is a challenge.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is the only Hairspray that I have found, which I have used for many years, which I find pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>HUGE Shaper Plus fan, here.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy shopping with you.    </li>
            <li>I am so happy I didn&#x27;t put it back on the shelf!  </li>
            <li>This hairspray goes on light but holds so well.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic deal on this hair spray that I have used for years.</li>
            <li>It is light but does the job...</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this product, as it is no longer in my local stores.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it at amazon this month for $12.47 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good&lt;</li>
            <li>Light hold.</li>
            <li>If they stop making it available again, or it changes again, I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li>It is such a great spray.</li>
            <li>but it does not work as good as the spray in the old container.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and purchase it from Amazon as I have found the most reasonable prices here!</li>
            <li>My hair stylist suggested I use this hairspray, and I&#x27;ve been doing so for several successful years.  </li>
            <li>and it does not perform like the original Shaper.  </li>
            <li>This spray does not work as well as the original.</li>
            <li>It allows me to achieve the look of more volume than is really there!</li>
            <li>This stuff is unique from my perspective, cause it holds my hair in place, yet when the day is over, my hair feels clean, not dirty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair holds really well, but brushes out easily!</li>
            <li>This hair spray is not sticky, holds my curls very well, and is easy to comb through!</li>
            <li>This is the only hairspray I will use and this is by far the best price I could find.</li>
            <li>The hold is fantastic, especially in high humidity, and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>This really helps it look like it has more volume than it does</li>
            <li>I searched for it on line ... and found the price to be the most reasonable through Amazon.com...</li>
            <li>the holding power of the cans I received was not the true shaper plus feel-more like just the &amp;#34;shaper.com&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is the third time ordered and all is good.</li>
            <li>, I try to find a \\&quot;good deal\\&quot; on line as I start getting low on product.  </li>
            <li>AMAZINGLY, I FOUND JUST THE OPPOSITE TO BE TRUE!</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I live in a state that still allows the old formula, so I&#x27;m a happy customer again.</li>
            <li>Holds pretty well and can easily comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>On a day when my hair is flat or not looking so good, I style it ..</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly...</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, so you can still shape after spraying.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the original product is still legal to sell in FL.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray does not make your hair sticky or stiff, but holds it beautifully.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I love this product and came back for second order after receiving great value and service on my first order.</li>
            <li>It is great for thin, fine hair!  </li>
            <li>Since one of her primary missions in life appears to be to disagree with me, her endorsement really does speak volumes about the product.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have used Shaper Plus for years and love the OLD formula.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>After many trials of everything from cheap to super-expensive, I think I finally found a replacement!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have ordered it twice; was packed carefully and received in good condition.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and was delighted to be able to purchase this on line for such a terrific price</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and find this product to be very effective in holding hair in place without leaving the hair sticky or real stiff.  </li>
            <li>It is not sticky like a lot of other hair sprays and smells good too.</li>
            <li>I have used this spray for years - it is non-sticky and brushes right out when you want to re-style your hair.  </li>
            <li>The price was right too.</li>
            <li>ITEMS ARRIVED RIGHT ON TIME!&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>I own a small business and would never change items that my customer&#x27;s love and order all the time.  </li>
            <li>Plus it makes my hair so healthy, unlike many other brands I have tried!  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for value and a quick delivery of your favorite product then look no further.</li>
            <li>I use this spray on my hair right before I wrap it in the hot roller.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the old Shaper Plus, but it&#x27;s the only thing that comes close.</li>
            <li>I have used this same hairspray for the last 20 years and I will never stop using it because it has a great hold but is not too sticky.  </li>
            <li>and it arrives well packaged and within a very reasonable amount of shipping time.</li>
            <li>The Original formula, and 2)The new version that is VOC compliant in all 50 states and Canada.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hairspray - especially for fine hair - it has been amazing as far as hairspray goes.</li>
            <li>Thanks Sebastian!  </li>
            <li>First of all I ordered Sebastian Plus and received Sebastian (not the Plus).  </li>
            <li>The smell is different, but most of all, there is no hold to it.  </li>
            <li>Beat any other buy two, get one free deal in town!!</li>
            <li>I was glad to find the 3-pack at Amazon as I could not find this brand locally.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the first can and started to use it</li>
            <li>I would encourage anyone who is interested, to call and find out what their state will permit.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product a few months ago and although I have used Shaper Plus for many years and always loved it, THIS PRODUCT HERE IS NOT THE SAME!</li>
            <li>Efficient purchase; fast and economical.</li>
            <li>I do not know why it is required to say so much about the things you ask me to review and grade on, this is good hairspray, I couldn&#x27;t get it for a lot less if I had bought it in a store</li>
            <li>You will do better buying something much cheaper than buying this current formulation.  </li>
            <li>Need very little for a good hold.</li>
            <li>This was such a bargain, as I generally pay for 1 what I was able to buy 3 for!</li>
            <li>It is easy to comb out and restyle the next day.</li>
            <li>I have ordered from this Vendor several times and the Hairspray comes very quickly</li>
            <li>Does not seem to be as strong as what I buy locally.</li>
            <li>Got here on time and as long as I know it will be good, just as the last time.</li>
            <li>IT MUST LACK CERTAIN INGREDIENT, BECAUSE</li>
            <li>In writing this review I noted that I am required to use a certain number of words.  </li>
            <li>certainly would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality hairspray.</li>
            <li>My new boyfriend is Big Sexy Hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is white and fine like spider webs.  </li>
            <li>A little heavy on the shipping, but a great price!</li>
            <li>I know the product has changed from the original and is not quite as good, but this is definitely much worse and not even the new formula</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and comes well packaged.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find another hairspray I like as much.</li>
            <li>I find it reasonably priced and a convenient way to order.  </li>
            <li>Shaper Plus has been the only hairspray that works for me -- it goes on light</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This was a much cheaper price than buying it in a retail store.  </li>
            <li>It has a gentle spray, is not sticky or gooey and holds well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this hair spray ...</li>
            <li>Very aggravating.</li>
            <li>Holds well and has a reasonable fragrance.</li>
            <li>I realized it doesn&#x27;t do much to hold your hair in place either.</li>
            <li>Even worse is that since this item is combustible, it is not eligible for return, meaning I&#x27;m the proud owner of $30 hair spray that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>This is from someone who has very curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>With this spray, I can style my hair so that it looks much fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I bounce around from one brand to the next but have not found another one I like as much as the original Shaper.</li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t know if that is actually something worth bragging about!)</li>
            <li>Thank you Sebastian, for bringing the Original back!</li>
            <li>I brush it out every night and my hair feels clean the next morning...</li>
            <li>However, due to popular demand, they are putting it back on the market at the beginning of the year in the states that will allow the higher percentage.</li>
            <li>A quick blow-dry with a round brush and a light spray of Shaper Plus is all I need to get me through the day.)</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>For those of us with thin, fine hair Shaper Plus is magic.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to buy something new!</li>
            <li>This new hairspray is garbage!</li>
            <li>I like it better than Shaper, but not as much as Sebastian previous Brushable before they changed to the new product</li>
            <li>For me this hair spray has everything I need for my difficult type of hair...which is fine and straight..I have been using this product for many years, and it does exactly what I want it to do ...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The cost of the item is high on line.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE &amp;#</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is a light spray that holds hair in place, and at the same time allows it to look natural, not stiff.</li>
            <li>It is the only hair spray that has the staying qualities with my fine hair without it being too stiff or too light.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as the old formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shared this product tip with my sister and a few friends who noticed how much better my hair was performing.</li>
            <li>The result is long lasting, soft beautiful curls that last and last.  </li>
            <li>but you can still brush your hair as normal.</li>
            <li>I used to love this product but the formula has changed and it now makes my hair stiff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve literally been through dozens of different professional hair sprays -- some insanely expensive ones, too -- and in my opinion, Sebastian&#x27;s Shaper Plus is by far the best on the market.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh down my hair and brushes out easily,</li>
            <li>One time the spray did not operate and they sent me a new one-no questions asked.</li>
            <li>I did that and the 3 new cans I got</li>
            <li>If you order, know that you run the risk of getting the new, crappy version.    </li>
            <li>so they had to decrease it in order to abide by the new guidelines.  </li>
            <li>and I live in a humid climate, so</li>
            <li>I did&#x27;t like the New Coke either..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have used this hairspray for years and love it, it never flakes and never leaves your hair hard as a board to touch, but very manageable and keeps your hair in place all day.  </li>
            <li>Most of the sprays that hold well are also heavy, and basically crush my hair flat under their weight, then look like a helmut  despite using as light an amount as possible.</li>
            <li>Now, I am stuck with three more bottles of expensive, but cheap hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As I have short, fine, limp hair, I mostly use it on the underside of my hair and near the roots, manipulating my hair as I spray, with just a small amount on the top, or outside layers of my hair.</li>
            <li>plus) leaves hair looking very natural.</li>
            <li>were exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other hairsprays, but always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>This holds my hair without making it stiff or sticky and can easily brush through.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair -- so I need hold and body, but I don&#x27;t want sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li>Nothing else works well on my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>no frizz, but yet, my hair is not stiff.</li>
            <li>Admittedly you have to use quite a bit on humid days, but your hair is not stiff or tacky.</li>
            <li>Sebastian Shaper Plus (not plain Shaper or plus</li>
            <li>Fantastic price for 3, but shipping takes a little longer.....</li>
            <li>The 3 big 10 oz cans for under $28 more than makes up for the little can price.  </li>
            <li>Excellent hairspray but a little expensive for me.</li>
            <li>You can hardly find it on shelves any more and then to get three for this price</li>
            <li>Holds your hair in place, but you can brush through it after it&#x27;s dry -- without ripping your hair out -- &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave a coating on your hair like many other hairsprays do.  </li>
            <li>This is clearly a counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li>I think this was old product as it doesn&#x27;t spray correctly</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sticky at all.</li>
            <li>and I do not have to order it so frequently.</li>
            <li>Watch when you are ordering on Amazon because the regular Sebastian Shaper looks very close to this one</li>
            <li>So much so, that when I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores ..</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m trying to find a haispray that works like the old shaper plus.</li>
            <li>and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>And, the hold is soft and durable.</li>
            <li>Florida...happens to be one that will allow the old formula to be sold....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still soft.</li>
            <li>I could never figure out why, until I found some in Walmart&#x27;s salon, marked the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;  and it &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34;.......</li>
            <li>Since then, I have read up on the change they made to the old version and why they had to do it.</li>
            <li>Shipping is timely and the ladies are always surprised to receive something in the mail.</li>
            <li>Does not hold at all like the old product.  </li>
            <li>Never in my life have I had a hairspray do that, and I&#x27;ve used everything from low-end drugstore to high-end salon professional products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be seen to be more expensive to some of you, but for me it&#x27;s worth the difference.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair spray for me heavy and coarse hair, I don&#x27;t need to add any weight or volume to my hair and this is the ticket.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t think it brushes out quite as nicely as the old Shaper Plus, but at least I get that smooth/no frizzy hold.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved this hairspray for my casual hair style because it lets my hair keep</li>
            <li>A light spray of this product offers terrific hold without the downsides of other fixatives.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much spray either and a large can last a long time.</li>
            <li>I was getting the old Shaper Plus for about the last year thru Amazon, but now when I order it they are sending the new stuff, even when the picture is showing the old can.  </li>
            <li>Have had to throw away several half filled spray cans because the spray nozzle clogs.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like some other high-end hair sprays have, and after more than a year of regular use, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a light  hold, firm enough, but never stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>I have only two cans left of the original Shaper Plus and after they are empty will need to find a substitute but so far, that&#x27;s not going well.  </li>
            <li>Sebastian&#x27;s Shaper Plus has been the only hair spray that works for my fine, limp, stick-straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It is the only hairspray I buy, and at $11 a can, you will be hard pressed to find a better deal elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The new look container is supposed to have the same ingredients</li>
            <li>When I look back up in the mirror the spray holds the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; in a very natural way.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t cake like other sprays do in higher</li>
            <li>I needed a small hairspray while on a trip that would fit in my purse and held my breath as I paid $7 for a tiny can.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would bring back the old formula.</li>
            <li>I own three cans of useless spray (NOT hairspray).  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of hold and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>Have used this for years as it does the job and does not leave my hair as hard or sticky as many other sprays do.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day, it is the only hair spray that works the whole day long!!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered whatever I could find of the old formula, as long as I could, through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I will have to pay full price in my salon, but at least I know it works.  </li>
            <li>In the past few weeks since I&#x27;ve started using this hairspray - I have gotten many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Good Product, wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li>While a number of hair sprays on the market seem to totally weigh down my hair, Shaper Plus keeps its soft, natural style intact.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine so the slightest breeze with destroy it, with this product it still looks natural and doesn&#x27;t feel hard to the touch.  </li>

            <li> Was so happy to find Sebastian Shaper Plus hairspray on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Great on humid days</li>
            <li> great price and delevery</li>

            <li> It is the best hairspray that I have used for years for our very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this brand for fifteen years and was happy to get a GREAT deal on this amazing spray.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian Shaper Plus hairspray for years and consider it perfect for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Because it is a wonderful product for fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product is the perfect  balance between the hold wanted from a hair spray and the lightness needed for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work Amazon.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s so good at doing its job that I&#x27;ve said goodbye to gels and mousses.</li>
            <li> For some reason the company decided to change the formula and it is no longer the hairspray I loved.  </li>
            <li> For some reason though, it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the one they use at the salon, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold as well either.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason the company decided to change the formula and it is no longer the hairspray we all knew and loved.  </li>
            <li> REALLY NICE GREAT FOR THE HUMIDITY,</li>
            <li> This was a good buy for 10 oz cans</li>
            <li> Price is good.</li>
            <li> Has anyone found a good alternative?</li>
            <li> Good price at Amazon</li>
            <li> Loved getting a bargain 3 pack</li>
            <li> I have used shaper plus hairspray since 2000 and have loved it, but they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> and I really loved the price.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, but none are as good as Shaper Plus.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find I could order it online</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> Everything went smoothly and my husband is very happy to get some of this hair spray.</li>
            <li> and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.  </li>
            <li> Good vendor.</li>
            <li> Have used Shaper for years and I will continue to use it for those days that I need a good hold that lasts</li>
            <li> Good quality hairspray.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray and when I found a good deal on it, I grabbed it!</li>
            <li> All three hairspray cans came in perfect condition and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> WORKED SUPER ON MY HAIR EXCELLENT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> If cost is the issue then charge more - don&#x27;t change the formula and take away a great product that works.  </li>
            <li> This holds great without stiffness and it even gets better.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with delivery and product.  </li>
            <li> Have been very pleased with the product, but have never purchased it through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Pricing is great and I love product.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray because it holds great</li>
            <li> the more I use!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair spray!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I sure hope not!</li>
            <li> love this product!</li>
            <li> I love shaper plus!  </li>
            <li> well, off to the Dollar Store to find something better!</li>
            <li> &amp; I still LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair - holds strong in humidity.</li>
            <li> It sprays on very light and holds fairly well.  </li>
            <li> i have fine hair &amp; it works just great.</li>
            <li> great for fine or colored hair.</li>
            <li> Great for baby fine hair...</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing and holds your hair without looking like you sprayed it in place.</li>
            <li> This spray is amazing for humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Shaper Plus for 20+ years and was very upset when this wonderful product had changed and no longer works at all.</li>
            <li> It is nice to get the 3 bottles</li>
            <li> it has a nice smell, since i have an allergy to scents.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Sebastian Shaper Plus hairspray for many years and have loved the product.  </li>
            <li> this is really the best hairspray ever.  </li>
            <li> It is just absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> Not the original formula!!</li>
            <li> And I am now exceptionally happy that I couldn&#x27;t find the old one and am really happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and I was so happy to find this product.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to brush or comb thru.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t buy it unless you have the kind of hair that can handle a very light hold.</li>
            <li> Best hair spray made and leaves hair soft bouncy and not sticky</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is the best hairspray on the market.</li>
            <li> It is not an easy product to find, therefore, I was delighted to be able to find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and IT WORKS.....</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this hair spray!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair spray and hair styling product I use, and have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the price of a full size can, but it looks like there is a good deal here on amazon.com - three 10oz cans for $25.  </li>
            <li> If cost is the issue then for pete&#x27;s sake just charge more - don&#x27;t take away a tried and true product!!</li>
            <li> I love Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Thank you amazon.com for finding these dealers and passing the savings on to your satisfied customers.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I am also pleased with all my purchases from Amazon also.  </li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t use this product, I would never be able to keep my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> I Love this hairspray and the thinner that my hair gets as I &amp;#34;age&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.</li>
            <li> and I love the product.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this supplier.  </li>
            <li> Most stores and beauty supply houses don&#x27;t carry the product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.  </li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t sticky or gooey, like most sprays.</li>
            <li> completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Nice light spray that allows you to finger style your hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of hairspray.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but when we received the cans with 30% more, (13.8 Oz) that was a plus.  </li>
            <li> I love this hairspray...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this hairspray because you can get a brush/comb through it if you need to restyle/shape your hair</li>
            <li> Sure, it will cost you more than another brand, but with hair spray, you get what you pay for, and I for one can not handle that lingering hair spray stink.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Excellent shaper - my wife uses it to style her hair daily</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> We just love it and love the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Shaper continues to be my favorite hairspray.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Shaper Plus after a 20 year love affair.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Now that I can get it through Amazon it is more than affordable.</li>
            <li> Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> I love that I can buy it online.  </li>
            <li> I love thus products.  </li>
            <li> Love the product hope I can continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> If you look at the ingredients, there are many changes to the formula.  </li>
            <li> Looks better than picture.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this hairspray and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> But the more I used it the more</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful user of this product for more than years.</li>
            <li> Much better than make up beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray ...</li>
            <li> I order this hairspray all the time because I love how it works.</li>
            <li> Love this product will order again.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical.</li>
            <li> -gladly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> and I still will be able to get it through amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for fifteen years.  </li>
            <li> I love this one...</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone that wants soft good hold.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years</li>
            <li> Then you can brush it right out and your hair is shinny and bright.  </li>
            <li> My barber was the first to show it to me, and that&#x27;s where the good stuff should be, in the hands of pros.  </li>
            <li> Love this hair spray, combs out easily</li>
            <li> Keep the nozzle clean--the nozzle gets clogged easily and if you don&#x27;t use the product often, it seems to clog more.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Great product and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I first discovered it about12 years ago on a visit to New Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have not found another Hairspray as perfect.  </li>
            <li> I like it because although it holds very good, yet you can brush it out and your hair is not left with that sort of wiry effect.  </li>
            <li> It was a simple purchase, 3 bottles at one time and at very good pricing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not stiff not sticky  just a great hold</li>
            <li> They wanted me to pull the receipt, mail it with a 3 x 5 card, detailed problem history which would cost more than a buck and about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Amazon offers a great price.</li>
            <li> Its not heavy, and is a great styling tool.</li>
            <li> It holds your hair well, but most importantly, it can be combed out easily.</li>
            <li> I got the product right away-within 2 days, which was also nice.</li>
            <li> I live in a very windy state and with the fine hair that I have, this hair spray holds my hair in place perfectly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the original version of Shaper Plus, but I wanted to warn others about ordering online sight unseen.  </li>
            <li> IT ALSO BRUSHES OUT EASILY, BUT DOES BUILD UP BY THE END OF THE WEEK.  </li>
            <li> I got my 3 cans of hairspray very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian shaper plus hairspray for many years, and have always loved the soft hold.</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love my hair spray, this one is not gooey sticky, my hair dresser calls it clean</li>
            <li> Easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t get tacky.</li>
            <li> Used to just fall l out easily.</li>
            <li> I can even touch up if I am going out at night and somehow  easily l brush through my thickish hair yet  </li>
            <li> but its not that strong</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve definitely changed the formulation, as is the case with so many things so many of us have been using forever and loved.</li>
            <li> At first I liked this hair spray, because it is not sticky and you can brush out your hair, without washing it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and this product helps it keep its style in the summer humidity.  </li>
            <li> Finding hairspray for fine textured hair is a challenge.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only Hairspray that I have found, which I have used for many years, which I find pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> HUGE Shaper Plus fan, here.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy shopping with you.    </li>
            <li> I am so happy I didn&#x27;t put it back on the shelf!  </li>
            <li> This hairspray goes on light but holds so well.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic deal on this hair spray that I have used for years.</li>
            <li> It is light but does the job...</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product, as it is no longer in my local stores.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it at amazon this month for $12.47 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good&lt;</li>
            <li> Light hold.</li>
            <li> If they stop making it available again, or it changes again, I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> It is such a great spray.</li>
            <li> but it does not work as good as the spray in the old container.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and purchase it from Amazon as I have found the most reasonable prices here!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist suggested I use this hairspray, and I&#x27;ve been doing so for several successful years.  </li>
            <li> and it does not perform like the original Shaper.  </li>
            <li> This spray does not work as well as the original.</li>
            <li> It allows me to achieve the look of more volume than is really there!</li>
            <li> This stuff is unique from my perspective, cause it holds my hair in place, yet when the day is over, my hair feels clean, not dirty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair holds really well, but brushes out easily!</li>
            <li> This hair spray is not sticky, holds my curls very well, and is easy to comb through!</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I will use and this is by far the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> The hold is fantastic, especially in high humidity, and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This really helps it look like it has more volume than it does</li>
            <li> I searched for it on line ... and found the price to be the most reasonable through Amazon.com...</li>
            <li> the holding power of the cans I received was not the true shaper plus feel-more like just the &amp;#34;shaper.com&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is the third time ordered and all is good.</li>
            <li> , I try to find a \\&quot;good deal\\&quot; on line as I start getting low on product.  </li>
            <li> AMAZINGLY, I FOUND JUST THE OPPOSITE TO BE TRUE!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I live in a state that still allows the old formula, so I&#x27;m a happy customer again.</li>
            <li> Holds pretty well and can easily comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> On a day when my hair is flat or not looking so good, I style it ..</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly...</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, so you can still shape after spraying.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the original product is still legal to sell in FL.  </li>
            <li> This hairspray does not make your hair sticky or stiff, but holds it beautifully.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I love this product and came back for second order after receiving great value and service on my first order.</li>
            <li> It is great for thin, fine hair!  </li>
            <li> Since one of her primary missions in life appears to be to disagree with me, her endorsement really does speak volumes about the product.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have used Shaper Plus for years and love the OLD formula.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> After many trials of everything from cheap to super-expensive, I think I finally found a replacement!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered it twice; was packed carefully and received in good condition.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and was delighted to be able to purchase this on line for such a terrific price</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and find this product to be very effective in holding hair in place without leaving the hair sticky or real stiff.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky like a lot of other hair sprays and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have used this spray for years - it is non-sticky and brushes right out when you want to re-style your hair.  </li>
            <li> The price was right too.</li>
            <li> ITEMS ARRIVED RIGHT ON TIME!&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> I own a small business and would never change items that my customer&#x27;s love and order all the time.  </li>
            <li> Plus it makes my hair so healthy, unlike many other brands I have tried!  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for value and a quick delivery of your favorite product then look no further.</li>
            <li> I use this spray on my hair right before I wrap it in the hot roller.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the old Shaper Plus, but it&#x27;s the only thing that comes close.</li>
            <li> I have used this same hairspray for the last 20 years and I will never stop using it because it has a great hold but is not too sticky.  </li>
            <li> and it arrives well packaged and within a very reasonable amount of shipping time.</li>
            <li> The Original formula, and 2)The new version that is VOC compliant in all 50 states and Canada.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hairspray - especially for fine hair - it has been amazing as far as hairspray goes.</li>
            <li> Thanks Sebastian!  </li>
            <li> First of all I ordered Sebastian Plus and received Sebastian (not the Plus).  </li>
            <li> The smell is different, but most of all, there is no hold to it.  </li>
            <li> Beat any other buy two, get one free deal in town!!</li>
            <li> I was glad to find the 3-pack at Amazon as I could not find this brand locally.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the first can and started to use it</li>
            <li> I would encourage anyone who is interested, to call and find out what their state will permit.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago and although I have used Shaper Plus for many years and always loved it, THIS PRODUCT HERE IS NOT THE SAME!</li>
            <li> Efficient purchase; fast and economical.</li>
            <li> I do not know why it is required to say so much about the things you ask me to review and grade on, this is good hairspray, I couldn&#x27;t get it for a lot less if I had bought it in a store</li>
            <li> You will do better buying something much cheaper than buying this current formulation.  </li>
            <li> Need very little for a good hold.</li>
            <li> This was such a bargain, as I generally pay for 1 what I was able to buy 3 for!</li>
            <li> It is easy to comb out and restyle the next day.</li>
            <li> I have ordered from this Vendor several times and the Hairspray comes very quickly</li>
            <li> Does not seem to be as strong as what I buy locally.</li>
            <li> Got here on time and as long as I know it will be good, just as the last time.</li>
            <li> IT MUST LACK CERTAIN INGREDIENT, BECAUSE</li>
            <li> In writing this review I noted that I am required to use a certain number of words.  </li>
            <li> certainly would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality hairspray.</li>
            <li> My new boyfriend is Big Sexy Hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is white and fine like spider webs.  </li>
            <li> A little heavy on the shipping, but a great price!</li>
            <li> I know the product has changed from the original and is not quite as good, but this is definitely much worse and not even the new formula</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and comes well packaged.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find another hairspray I like as much.</li>
            <li> I find it reasonably priced and a convenient way to order.  </li>
            <li> Shaper Plus has been the only hairspray that works for me -- it goes on light</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This was a much cheaper price than buying it in a retail store.  </li>
            <li> It has a gentle spray, is not sticky or gooey and holds well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair spray ...</li>
            <li> Very aggravating.</li>
            <li> Holds well and has a reasonable fragrance.</li>
            <li> I realized it doesn&#x27;t do much to hold your hair in place either.</li>
            <li> Even worse is that since this item is combustible, it is not eligible for return, meaning I&#x27;m the proud owner of $30 hair spray that doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> This is from someone who has very curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> With this spray, I can style my hair so that it looks much fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I bounce around from one brand to the next but have not found another one I like as much as the original Shaper.</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t know if that is actually something worth bragging about!)</li>
            <li> Thank you Sebastian, for bringing the Original back!</li>
            <li> I brush it out every night and my hair feels clean the next morning...</li>
            <li> However, due to popular demand, they are putting it back on the market at the beginning of the year in the states that will allow the higher percentage.</li>
            <li> A quick blow-dry with a round brush and a light spray of Shaper Plus is all I need to get me through the day.)</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> For those of us with thin, fine hair Shaper Plus is magic.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to buy something new!</li>
            <li> This new hairspray is garbage!</li>
            <li> I like it better than Shaper, but not as much as Sebastian previous Brushable before they changed to the new product</li>
            <li> For me this hair spray has everything I need for my difficult type of hair...which is fine and straight..I have been using this product for many years, and it does exactly what I want it to do ...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The cost of the item is high on line.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE &amp;#</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a light spray that holds hair in place, and at the same time allows it to look natural, not stiff.</li>
            <li> It is the only hair spray that has the staying qualities with my fine hair without it being too stiff or too light.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much as the old formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shared this product tip with my sister and a few friends who noticed how much better my hair was performing.</li>
            <li> The result is long lasting, soft beautiful curls that last and last.  </li>
            <li> but you can still brush your hair as normal.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product but the formula has changed and it now makes my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve literally been through dozens of different professional hair sprays -- some insanely expensive ones, too -- and in my opinion, Sebastian&#x27;s Shaper Plus is by far the best on the market.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh down my hair and brushes out easily,</li>
            <li> One time the spray did not operate and they sent me a new one-no questions asked.</li>
            <li> I did that and the 3 new cans I got</li>
            <li> If you order, know that you run the risk of getting the new, crappy version.    </li>
            <li> so they had to decrease it in order to abide by the new guidelines.  </li>
            <li> and I live in a humid climate, so</li>
            <li> I did&#x27;t like the New Coke either..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years and love it, it never flakes and never leaves your hair hard as a board to touch, but very manageable and keeps your hair in place all day.  </li>
            <li> Most of the sprays that hold well are also heavy, and basically crush my hair flat under their weight, then look like a helmut  despite using as light an amount as possible.</li>
            <li> Now, I am stuck with three more bottles of expensive, but cheap hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As I have short, fine, limp hair, I mostly use it on the underside of my hair and near the roots, manipulating my hair as I spray, with just a small amount on the top, or outside layers of my hair.</li>
            <li> plus) leaves hair looking very natural.</li>
            <li> were exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other hairsprays, but always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> This holds my hair without making it stiff or sticky and can easily brush through.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair -- so I need hold and body, but I don&#x27;t want sticky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Nothing else works well on my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> no frizz, but yet, my hair is not stiff.</li>
            <li> Admittedly you have to use quite a bit on humid days, but your hair is not stiff or tacky.</li>
            <li> Sebastian Shaper Plus (not plain Shaper or plus</li>
            <li> Fantastic price for 3, but shipping takes a little longer.....</li>
            <li> The 3 big 10 oz cans for under $28 more than makes up for the little can price.  </li>
            <li> Excellent hairspray but a little expensive for me.</li>
            <li> You can hardly find it on shelves any more and then to get three for this price</li>
            <li> Holds your hair in place, but you can brush through it after it&#x27;s dry -- without ripping your hair out -- &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave a coating on your hair like many other hairsprays do.  </li>
            <li> This is clearly a counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li> I think this was old product as it doesn&#x27;t spray correctly</li>
            <li> Not heavy or sticky at all.</li>
            <li> and I do not have to order it so frequently.</li>
            <li> Watch when you are ordering on Amazon because the regular Sebastian Shaper looks very close to this one</li>
            <li> So much so, that when I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores ..</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m trying to find a haispray that works like the old shaper plus.</li>
            <li> and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> And, the hold is soft and durable.</li>
            <li> Florida...happens to be one that will allow the old formula to be sold....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still soft.</li>
            <li> I could never figure out why, until I found some in Walmart&#x27;s salon, marked the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;  and it &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34;.......</li>
            <li> Since then, I have read up on the change they made to the old version and why they had to do it.</li>
            <li> Shipping is timely and the ladies are always surprised to receive something in the mail.</li>
            <li> Does not hold at all like the old product.  </li>
            <li> Never in my life have I had a hairspray do that, and I&#x27;ve used everything from low-end drugstore to high-end salon professional products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be seen to be more expensive to some of you, but for me it&#x27;s worth the difference.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair spray for me heavy and coarse hair, I don&#x27;t need to add any weight or volume to my hair and this is the ticket.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t think it brushes out quite as nicely as the old Shaper Plus, but at least I get that smooth/no frizzy hold.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved this hairspray for my casual hair style because it lets my hair keep</li>
            <li> A light spray of this product offers terrific hold without the downsides of other fixatives.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much spray either and a large can last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was getting the old Shaper Plus for about the last year thru Amazon, but now when I order it they are sending the new stuff, even when the picture is showing the old can.  </li>
            <li> Have had to throw away several half filled spray cans because the spray nozzle clogs.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like some other high-end hair sprays have, and after more than a year of regular use, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a light  hold, firm enough, but never stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have only two cans left of the original Shaper Plus and after they are empty will need to find a substitute but so far, that&#x27;s not going well.  </li>
            <li> Sebastian&#x27;s Shaper Plus has been the only hair spray that works for my fine, limp, stick-straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It is the only hairspray I buy, and at $11 a can, you will be hard pressed to find a better deal elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The new look container is supposed to have the same ingredients</li>
            <li> When I look back up in the mirror the spray holds the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; in a very natural way.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t cake like other sprays do in higher</li>
            <li> I needed a small hairspray while on a trip that would fit in my purse and held my breath as I paid $7 for a tiny can.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would bring back the old formula.</li>
            <li> I own three cans of useless spray (NOT hairspray).  </li>
            <li> Just the right amount of hold and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years as it does the job and does not leave my hair as hard or sticky as many other sprays do.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day, it is the only hair spray that works the whole day long!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered whatever I could find of the old formula, as long as I could, through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I will have to pay full price in my salon, but at least I know it works.  </li>
            <li> In the past few weeks since I&#x27;ve started using this hairspray - I have gotten many compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Good Product, wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> While a number of hair sprays on the market seem to totally weigh down my hair, Shaper Plus keeps its soft, natural style intact.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine so the slightest breeze with destroy it, with this product it still looks natural and doesn&#x27;t feel hard to the touch.  </li>
            <li> The product I received is missing the round &#x27;Original Formula&#x27; label from the front and the ingredients listed are different.    </li>
            <li> The new stuff does not work and is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Does not get sticky or stiff but at the end of the day the curl is still in even though my hair is normally straight and does not hold a curl.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> mainly, keep my hair in place without making it stiff &amp; unnatural looking ...  </li>
            <li> I really needed hairspray that day - and I couldn&#x27;t find my usual got2b hairspray</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thick and long hair which has a hard time holding a curl.  </li>
            <li> LAST ALL DAY LONG EVERY SEASON OF THE YEAR,   </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not just lying flat against my head.</li>
            <li> These three cans will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only one that seems to be light enough for my very thin hair.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product in its new formula.</li>
            <li> When sprayed it spits instead of spraying out fine like the norm, smells atrocious and my hair is like the helmet cheap hairsprays usually create.</li>
            <li> I changed to Tigi Bed Head Hard Head and really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I really like Hard Head by Tigi a lot.</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the high price but with the deal you get here @</li>
            <li> My hair stays in shape all day long</li>
            <li> quality same as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a long time</li>
            <li> When I had long hair, and wanted curls, I used to spray this on each piece of hair</li>
            <li> so my curls would stay in for a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and fine</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 cans from a local authorized retailer and quickly discovered that there was something wrong with them.  </li>
            <li> This hair spray is the only one that will hold my hair without the spray build up that other sprays create.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  reviewed this one other time, and the product is still the same.  </li>
            <li> Can be combed through when dry without damaging hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the type of spray that when dry, you can restyle with a comb or brush.  </li>
            <li> The only way to tell what you are getting is this round label or by looking at the back of the can to see if it is VOC compliant in all 50 states.  </li>
            <li> This is a product I can not live without.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive at the salon, so I decided to try my FAVORITE on line store.....</li>
            <li> Seemed to have less holding power than the same named spray bought at the salon.</li>
            <li> I found this Hairspray to be the same quality as the ones at the store, but for less.  </li>
            <li> The seller was very professional and got this to me on time and this product was far less expensive at amazon.com than at the local stores.  </li>
            <li> Product what  Was expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sebastian Shaper Plus for years and have had trouble finding it at my local stores.</li>
            <li> now I barely get out of my car in the morning and my hair is in my face!!as usual</li>
            <li> Shippers service was as expected.</li>
            <li> I also dry my hair while bending over with my hair hanging down towards the floor aiming the dryer at the roots, then I turn the dryer off, staying bent over until my hair cools.</li>
            <li> There is no other Hairspray that I know of that you can use 2 or 3 days in a row and not leave your hair dull or sticky etc.</li>
            <li> After trying other hairsprays and buying another bottle of this from my salon, I decided to order it online again.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased Sebastian Shaper plus from other non-salon retailers before with no problems.  </li>
            <li> you can wash your hair every other day when using this spray</li>
            <li> If anyone else tries it and likes it, please let me know!</li>
            <li> It holds longer than any other I have used.  </li>
            <li> and when I can&#x27;t find it on sale (usually buy one get one at a discounted price at one of my local stores or salons)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s style all day long without a stiff, sprayed look.  </li>
            <li> this product does not leave a heavy build up and a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY HAIR WET AND LIMP.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> This hairspray holds your hair in place however it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> I was told about this hairspray by a hairdresser when we were vacationing down south.  </li>
            <li> spray the front then lean a bit forward and slightly upside down to let the spray set.  </li>
            <li> a previous reviewer, I also have baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair spray online because this in the brand my beauty salon uses, and it cost much less online than at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s why these cans are $6.00 less than can purchased at salons.</li>
            <li> so there is way less stuff in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have to use half a can to get even a little bit of hold</li>
            <li> You can hardly find it in local stores and if you do, it usually runs $14 to $15 per can.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the lousy reviews on-line regarding the new ingredients that NY allows to be used in Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray I admit I was a little dubious.</li>
            <li> This spray is a little lighter hold than I had remembered . . .</li>
            <li> but you can make it as heavy as you want.  </li>
            <li> and you can reapply through out the day without a heavy build up.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, and I like it for its a firm hold.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who likes a firm hold for you hair style</li>
            <li> Even with my natural curly hair, there are times when I want my hair to stay in place but not feel fake after spraying on.  </li>
            <li> The newer version is missing the round label on the front.  </li>
            <li> Then when dried and styled give it another spray.</li>
            <li> I can write a few words and get my point across.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27; usually not available except I beauty supply shops &amp; you</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ve changed the formula and now I notice after an hour or so my hair appears oily and limp.</li>
            <li> Does not leave hair feeling/looking stiff.</li>
            <li> It holds your style without being stiff or sticky.  </li>
            <li> Instead of making hair sticky and stiff, it leaves you with a style you can run your fingers through without getting your digits stuck or trashing your &#x27;do.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep it because I have used the plain Sebastian as well as Sebastian</li>
            <li> Does not make your hair feel stiff with just a lite spray.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset to have lost the only hairspray that actually worked with my very difficult hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the texture of my hair changed or the formula changed, but I had to break up with</li>
            <li> This product is a fake because it has a completely different fragrance</li>
            <li> this is not the Shaper Plus of the past</li>
            <li> I usually pay  fifteen dollars a bottle</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!</li>
            <li> you get the body of a little daily dirt without the oily dirty look.</li>
            <li> it loses the little bit of hold it gives altogether!  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff but keeps hair in place all day!  </li>
            <li> everyone has to mess with perfection!!</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, Shaper does not weigh it down and hold my style all day.</li>
            <li> B002RS6JW6 TIGI Bed Head Hard Head Hair Spray, 10.6 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or hard to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I panic whenever I have a hard time finding Sebastian Hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Shaper Plus for at least 25 years..</li>
            <li> My complaint is the company.  </li>
            <li> Amazon, I no longer have that complaint.  </li>
            <li> A can at the salon will cost at least 18.00.</li>
            <li> Hold container at least four inches from hair when spraying.&lt;br /&gt;Mommasko</li>
            <li> I HAVE MEDIUME LENGTH THICK HAIR.  </li>
            <li> The container was different, the ingredients were different, and it worked horribly.  </li>
            <li> SEBASTIAN SHAPER PLUS HAIRSPRAY IS NOT GOOD.  </li>
            <li> Never realized they had changed it, so I&#x27;ve wasted ALOT of money, not realizing it was the hairspray, rather than something else wrong.</li>
            <li> I have longish straighter hair that is very very hard to hold a style.</li>
            <li> Have to order on line now because of now living in a small town where it is not available in any of our stores. :(</li>
            <li> With the newer version, I could use a whole can and still have my hair look HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN YOUR CUSTOMER FOR A FEW YEARS AND HAD NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN ANY MANNER.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li> They shipped the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> and I am still waiting for my refund for the erroneous purchase.  </li>
            <li> YOU FAILED TO INCLUDE MY INVOICE AND A RETURN LABEL THIS TIME.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it will be a Sebastian product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Amazon seller I purchased this from sent the newer formula.  </li>
            <li> I have been unable to find it at a competitive price</li>
            <li> It is so expensive in the stores</li>
            <li> I depended on the &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34; to get me through the day, but this stuff is absolutely useless on my hair!</li>
            <li> I called the number on the can, told them they were bad</li>
            <li> I had a bad 10.6 oz.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have used any any Sebastian formula you will be disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in the product not the company who sent it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to Sebastian Shaper Plus making your hair behave the way you want it to you will be disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing!  </li>
            <li> (stupid me relied on the picture) and couldn&#x27;t return them.</li>
            <li> I also hate the smell now.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I tried it with the formula change and... hate it.  </li>
            <li> (I really hate the smell, too.)</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the results!</li>
            <li> Completely disgusted!</li>
            <li> Very annoying.  </li>
            <li> I had never heard they had changed the formula, but when I started using these cans of it, I hated it!</li>

            <li> Product what  Was expected.</li>
            <li> Best hair spray made and leaves hair soft bouncy and not sticky</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Does not leave hair feeling/looking stiff.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS &amp; IT HELPS HOLD MY HAIR IN PLACE.  IT ALSO BRUSHES OUT EASILY, BUT DOES BUILD UP BY THE END OF THE WEEK.  I HAVE MEDIUME LENGTH THICK HAIR.  IT CAME WELL PACKAGED.</li>
            <li> GUD STUFF. YOU CAN COMB THROUGH YOUR HAIR THE NEXT DAY!!!!</li>
            <li> Cans came with no dents.  Packaged well.</li>
            <li> I love Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray.  It holds your style without being stiff or sticky.  It is easy to comb out and restyle the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bre using this spray for years.  I&#x27;ve tried cheaper alternatives, but nothing comes close to the great hold I get with this spray without heaviness and tackiness.  My hair is fine and this product helps it keep its style in the summer humidity.  You can&#x27;t beat this price anywhere either.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for value and a quick delivery of your favorite product then look no further. You cannot beat receiving three bottles of Sebastian Shaper Plus hairspray through this company with their great price deal. All three hairspray cans came in perfect condition and shipped quickly. I will definitely be purchasing further items from you. Thank you amazon.com for finding these dealers and passing the savings on to your satisfied customers.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.  I am also pleased with all my purchases from Amazon also.  I recommend Amazon to friends and family.  I will always shop with Amazon.  Keep up the good work Amazon.  I really enjoy shopping with you.    [...]</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this product by accident.  I needed a small hairspray while on a trip that would fit in my purse and held my breath as I paid $7 for a tiny can.  I am so happy I didn&#x27;t put it back on the shelf!  This hairspray goes on light but holds so well.  On a day when my hair is flat or not looking so good, I style it .. spray the front then lean a bit forward and slightly upside down to let the spray set.  When I look back up in the mirror the spray holds the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; in a very natural way.  I wish I&#x27;d had this spray years ago.  It also fights humidity, and being from Tennessee .. humidity is a big hairday killer.  Thanks Sebastian!  The 3 big 10 oz cans for under $28 more than makes up for the little can price.  I&#x27;ve shared this product tip with my sister and a few friends who noticed how much better my hair was performing.</li>
            <li> My hair is white and fine like spider webs.  If I didn&#x27;t use this product, I would never be able to keep my hair in place.  I&#x27;ve been using the Shaper Plus for at least 25 years..</li>
            <li> I think this was old product as it doesn&#x27;t spray correctly I tried cleaning nozzle but it didn&#x27;t help. Will buy locally next time</li>
            <li> Thank you for delivering my hairspray even quicker than the shipping speed that I chose! I Love this hairspray and the thinner that my hair gets as I &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; the more I use! (Don&#x27;t know if that is actually something worth bragging about!)</li>
            <li> This holds my hair without making it stiff or sticky and can easily brush through.  I have recommended this to others.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic deal on this hair spray that I have used for years. You can hardly find it in local stores and if you do, it usually runs $14 to $15 per can.  I buy the three and it last for months. Fast delivery and comes well packaged. Love the price!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray. I live in a very windy state and with the fine hair that I have, this hair spray holds my hair in place perfectly. It is not sticky like a lot of other hair sprays and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have ordered from this Vendor several times and the Hairspray comes very quickly and I love the product. One time the spray did not operate and they sent me a new one-no questions asked. Highly recommend. Price is great.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 cans from a local authorized retailer and quickly discovered that there was something wrong with them.  I called the number on the can, told them they were bad and they said to exchange them at the retailer.  I did that and the 3 new cans I got were exactly the same.  No hold, No humidity control.  I called again and this time the person I spoke to told me that the CO2 content had changed therefore the formula is different.  She said they were getting lots of complaints and recommended trying Wella Dynamic Fix Hairspray.      I have been using Shaper Plus for 20+ years and was very upset when this wonderful product had changed and no longer works at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and a great product. You can hardly find it on shelves any more and then to get three for this price and it arrives well packaged and within a very reasonable amount of shipping time. I will definitely use this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this hair spray!  :)  I have been using Shaper Plus for several years now, it holds my hair in place, no frizz, but yet, my hair is not stiff. Works great with my straightener, also.  I never have flakey residue particles in my hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Never makes my hair feel sticky. Holds pretty well and can easily comb through my hair. I have yet to find another hairspray I like as much. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got my 3 cans of hairspray very quickly.  I am pleased with this supplier.  I will do business with them again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my periodic order of Sebastian Shaper hairspray.  I find it reasonably priced and a convenient way to order.  Most stores and beauty supply houses don&#x27;t carry the product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.  It holds your hair but can easily be brushed out with no obvious residue.  Not heavy or sticky at all. It is the best I have found</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years.  I like it because although it holds very good, yet you can brush it out and your hair is not left with that sort of wiry effect.  It doesn&#x27;t take much spray either and a large can last a long time.</li>
            <li> Seemed to have less holding power than the same named spray bought at the salon. Probably won&#x27;t need to order this again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Sebastian Hair spray before and I am very happy with the product. I especially like that I can order 3 at the time and this allows me to have the product longer and I do not have to order it so frequently. I got the product right away-within 2 days, which was also nice.</li>
            <li> Great product and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair spray!  The hold is fantastic, especially in high humidity, and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> My complaint is the company.  I had a bad 10.6 oz. can which 3 of us could not make work--bad nozzle.  They wanted me to pull the receipt, mail it with a 3 x 5 card, detailed problem history which would cost more than a buck and about 20 minutes.  All this for a $10 can of Regular Sebastian Shaper.  Seems incredibly overkill for $10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I found this Hairspray to be the same quality as the ones at the store, but for less.  I would buy the again.</li>
            <li> I have used this spray for years - it is non-sticky and brushes right out when you want to re-style your hair.  It is nice to get the 3 bottles so I am not looking everywhere for it so often.</li>
            <li> Shaper Plus has been the only hairspray that works for me -- it goes on light but you can make it as heavy as you want.  I have fine hair -- so I need hold and body, but I don&#x27;t want sticky or heavy.  There is no comparison on the market that I know of.</li>
            <li> Hello. HUGE Shaper Plus fan, here. A light spray of this product offers terrific hold without the downsides of other fixatives. Instead of making hair sticky and stiff, it leaves you with a style you can run your fingers through without getting your digits stuck or trashing your &#x27;do. It also doesn&#x27;t cake like other sprays do in higher humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a previous reviewer, I also have baby-fine hair. While a number of hair sprays on the market seem to totally weigh down my hair, Shaper Plus keeps its soft, natural style intact. (It&#x27;s so good at doing its job that I&#x27;ve said goodbye to gels and mousses. A quick blow-dry with a round brush and a light spray of Shaper Plus is all I need to get me through the day.) It also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like some other high-end hair sprays have, and after more than a year of regular use, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve literally been through dozens of different professional hair sprays -- some insanely expensive ones, too -- and in my opinion, Sebastian&#x27;s Shaper Plus is by far the best on the market. Even my mother has converted to Shaper Plus. Since one of her primary missions in life appears to be to disagree with me, her endorsement really does speak volumes about the product.</li>
            <li> IT HOLDS YOUR HAIR IN PLACE AND YOUR HAIR IS NEVER STICKY AND LAST ALL DAY LONG EVERY SEASON OF THE YEAR,   I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND WOULD NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE.</li>
            <li> It is a light spray that holds hair in place, and at the same time allows it to look natural, not stiff.</li>
            <li> I love this product and came back for second order after receiving great value and service on my first order.</li>
            <li> love this product. i&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 yrs. it isn&#x27;t sticky or gooey, like most sprays. i have fine hair &amp; it works just great. it has a nice smell, since i have an allergy to scents.  can&#x27;t always find it at the stores or salons. but now i found it on Amazon...Great ! received the product in alloted time, in excellent condition. completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is the only one that will hold my hair without the spray build up that other sprays create.  It is not an easy product to find, therefore, I was delighted to be able to find it through Amazon.  I have often said -- if you can&#x27;t find it on Amazon, in all likelihood it is not to be found.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray and when I found a good deal on it, I grabbed it!</li>
            <li> First of all I ordered Sebastian Plus and received Sebastian (not the Plus).  They shipped the wrong product.  I decided to keep it because I have used the plain Sebastian as well as Sebastian Plus.  If you have used any any Sebastian formula you will be disappointed in this product. For some reason the company decided to change the formula and it is no longer the hairspray I loved.  Companies should never change a formula that works.  If cost is the issue then charge more - don&#x27;t change the formula and take away a great product that works.  I own a small business and would never change items that my customer&#x27;s love and order all the time.  Quality of the product you are selling, repeat business, and word of mouth is what matters when you are selling anything.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair spray online because this in the brand my beauty salon uses, and it cost much less online than at the salon.  For some reason though, it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the one they use at the salon, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold as well either.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 25, 2014 Update:  After trying other hairsprays and buying another bottle of this from my salon, I decided to order it online again.  Well, same thing happened.  The smell is different, but most of all, there is no hold to it.  It must be counterfeit.  Now, I am stuck with three more bottles of expensive, but cheap hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned my lesson.  If I want this product again, I will buy it from my local salon, not online.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian shaper plus hairspray for many years, and have always loved the soft hold. The 3 cans I ordered from amazon did not hold in any way, shape, or form (no pun) like the cans I purchased from local salons. Even the smell was different.I was very disappointed with the results! Perhaps that&#x27;s why these cans are $6.00 less than can purchased at salons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  reviewed this one other time, and the product is still the same.  This stuff is unique from my perspective, cause it holds my hair in place, yet when the day is over, my hair feels clean, not dirty.&lt;br /&gt;It may be seen to be more expensive to some of you, but for me it&#x27;s worth the difference.  My barber was the first to show it to me, and that&#x27;s where the good stuff should be, in the hands of pros.  Jeff</li>
            <li> I found the travel size at Target in the \\&quot;Salon Care\\&quot; section and thought I&#x27;d give it a try even though it was $5 for a 1.5oz can.  I really needed hairspray that day - and I couldn&#x27;t find my usual got2b hairspray so I splurged.  And I am now exceptionally happy that I couldn&#x27;t find the old one and am really happy with this product.  In the past few weeks since I&#x27;ve started using this hairspray - I have gotten many compliments on my hair.  I was worried about the price of a full size can, but it looks like there is a good deal here on amazon.com - three 10oz cans for $25.  I highly recommend this hairspray - especially for fine hair - it has been amazing as far as hairspray goes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sebastian Shaper Plus for years and have had trouble finding it at my local stores. Nice light spray that allows you to finger style your hair. Can be combed through when dry without damaging hair.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and I was so happy to find this product.  It seems it is off the market, however the product has changed.  I have been using this hair spray for 20+ years and this spray is different.  Why do they do that?  Really disappointed in the product not the company who sent it.</li>
            <li> Great seller and item.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to Sebastian Shaper Plus making your hair behave the way you want it to you will be disappointed in this product.  For whatever reason the company decided to change the formula and it is no longer the hairspray we all knew and loved.  You will do better buying something much cheaper than buying this current formulation.  Why do companies always have to change things that work?  If cost is the issue then for pete&#x27;s sake just charge more - don&#x27;t take away a tried and true product!!</li>
            <li> I MYSELF AND MY THREE DAUGHTERS USE THIS HAIRSPRAY I EVEN SEE MY HUSBAND SNEAK AND USE IT BECAUSE IT REALLY IS GREAT HAIRSPRAY,KEEPS YOUR HAIR LOOKING REALLY NICE GREAT FOR THE HUMIDITY,WINDY DAYS AND SMELLS GREAT. THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO PURCHASE SEBASTIAN SHAPER PLUS THE PRICE YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT IT.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray. I have been using it for over 10 years and have YET to find another brand that can even compare to it. It is light but does the job...and you can reapply through out the day without a heavy build up. This is my favorite brand of hairspray. Both the Shaper and the Shaper Plus work just as well.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is not off the market, I buy it locally at my hairdresser.  Take a look at one of your local hairdressers that carry the line.  I paid $13.95 for a 10.6 oz can.      I hope what&#x27;s being sold here isn&#x27;t a knock off??  The can I am looking at is 10.6 oz, not 10 oz.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product, as it is no longer in my local stores.  I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> this seems to be the best deal I can get on this product.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray. $20 in my local drug store. Three for $30 through Amazon. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is clearly a counterfeit product.  The container was different, the ingredients were different, and it worked horribly.  Completely disgusted!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  This was a good buy for 10 oz cans but when we received the cans with 30% more, (13.8 Oz) that was a plus.  Will order again at this savings.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent, the best hair spry ever. My hair stays in shape all day long</li>
            <li> Item was not as described. Cans are regular shaper not shaper plus. 1 can only worked for one week now not spraying at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years and love it, it never flakes and never leaves your hair hard as a board to touch, but very manageable and keeps your hair in place all day.  I will continue to use this product and purchase it from Amazon as I have found the most reasonable prices here!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray...won&#x27;t use anything else. It holds your hair well, but most importantly, it can be combed out easily.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law asks for this every Christmas, and this is an excellent price for these cans.  This was a much cheaper price than buying it in a retail store.  They arrived in excellent shape and I was very pleased with not having to shop around for them. Kudos to Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> excellent product, we use it every day, and it travels well.Would recommend it to any one to try. We repeat order often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same results with shaper plus. They&#x27;ve definitely changed the formulation, as is the case with so many things so many of us have been using forever and loved. I changed to Tigi Bed Head Hard Head and really like it a lot. As I have short, fine, limp hair, I mostly use it on the underside of my hair and near the roots, manipulating my hair as I spray, with just a small amount on the top, or outside layers of my hair. I also dry my hair while bending over with my hair hanging down towards the floor aiming the dryer at the roots, then I turn the dryer off, staying bent over until my hair cools. This really helps it look like it has more volume than it does so it&#x27;s not just lying flat against my head. Oh, the things we do to get our hair to behave! LOL! I really like Hard Head by Tigi a lot. I purchased it at amazon this month for $12.47 with free shipping. Shipped by Kaufman Fragrance. I&#x27;m inserting a link below to the same one I purchased.  [[ASIN:B002RS6JW6 TIGI Bed Head Hard Head Hair Spray, 10.6 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> quality same as I expected.  I have been using this product for many years.  The cost of the item is high on line.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It has a gentle spray, is not sticky or gooey and holds well.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair spray ...it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff but keeps hair in place all day!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love my hair spray, this one is not gooey sticky, my hair dresser calls it clean dirt cause you get the body of a little daily dirt without the oily dirty look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other hairsprays, but always come back to this one.  It holds, but you don&#x27;t pull your hair out when you want to brush through it.  Guess I will always be a shaper plus girl.  Price is good.</li>
            <li> Beat any other buy two, get one free deal in town!!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray because you can get a brush/comb through it if you need to restyle/shape your hair and you don&#x27;t look like a helmet head.  My hair is fine so the slightest breeze with destroy it, with this product it still looks natural and doesn&#x27;t feel hard to the touch.  Watch when you are ordering on Amazon because the regular Sebastian Shaper looks very close to this one and I am still waiting for my refund for the erroneous purchase.  But this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> We have not used any of the hairspray as yet..we had some on hand.  This is the same brand that we use all the time so I don&#x27;t expect this order to be any different. It was packaged very good and shipped in a timely manner and we encountered no problems.</li>
            <li> It has to be the \\&quot;Plus\\&quot;.  If you get the Shaper spray, it&#x27;s not the same.  The Plus is the best ever because it doesn&#x27;t have an offensive stinky or perfumed smell and it doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel.  It&#x27;s the type of spray that when dry, you can restyle with a comb or brush.  Sure, it will cost you more than another brand, but with hair spray, you get what you pay for, and I for one can not handle that lingering hair spray stink.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product but the formula has changed and it now makes my hair stiff. I also hate the smell now. I just can&#x27;t use it anymore. Has anyone found a good alternative? I bounce around from one brand to the next but have not found another one I like as much as the original Shaper.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  Good price at Amazon</li>
            <li> Excellent shaper - my wife uses it to style her hair daily</li>
            <li> Cheap and good&lt;br /&gt;no comlaints at all</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  Holds your hair in place, but you can brush through it after it&#x27;s dry -- without ripping your hair out -- &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leave a coating on your hair like many other hairsprays do.  I just hope Sebastian never discontinues it...</li>
            <li> For me this hair spray has everything I need for my difficult type of hair...which is fine and straight..I have been using this product for many years, and it does exactly what I want it to do ... mainly, keep my hair in place without making it stiff &amp; unnatural looking ...  The price is a little high but it is worth it.... So much so, that when I couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores ..I searched for it on line ... and found the price to be the most reasonable through Amazon.com...</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray, combs out easily</li>
            <li> Great product and timely delivery!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  It is great for thin, fine hair!  Loved getting a bargain 3 pack</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years.  So has my husband.  We just love it and love the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> There is no other Hairspray that I know of that you can use 2 or 3 days in a row and not leave your hair dull or sticky etc. except Sebastian Shaper. I use the Plus, my hair needs all the help it can get. Someone in a Mall beauty store, that did not have any, said she thought it was being discontinued! I sure hope not! On that gossip or fact, don&#x27;t know, I ordered 3 cans from Amazon. Do not want to be without product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have used Shaper Plus for years and love the OLD formula.  The new stuff does not work and is not worth the money.  I was getting the old Shaper Plus for about the last year thru Amazon, but now when I order it they are sending the new stuff, even when the picture is showing the old can.  I wish they would bring back the old formula.</li>
            <li> I have used shaper plus hairspray since 2000 and have loved it, but they changed the formula. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. Now I&#x27;m trying to find a haispray that works like the old shaper plus.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I really loved the price. In fact I have ordered almost 20 cans of this to date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for a number of years.  In my opinion this is the very best hairspray on the market.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Received quickly.</li>
            <li> Shaper continues to be my favorite hairspray. My hair is thin, Shaper does not weigh it down and hold my style all day.</li>
            <li> Good Service, great product!!</li>
            <li> Light hold. Easy to comb through. Hold lasts all day. I was glad to find the 3-pack at Amazon as I could not find this brand locally. These three cans will last me a long time. The price was right too.</li>
            <li> Terrific Product !! I Accidentally Fell Into Using It And Now I Can Not Get Enough OF It To Last My Lifetime !!</li>
            <li> Great product. Does not make your hair feel stiff with just a lite spray. It will keep your hair in place and touchable. can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and intact. Easier to order online than to hunt for this product in stores. I have been using Sebastion Plus hairspray for years.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product but I now buy it in the store. My last delivery none of them sprayed. Very aggravating.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, and I like it for its a firm hold.  I would recommend this for anyone who likes a firm hold for you hair style</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for years. I&#x27;ve tried others, but none are as good as Shaper Plus. I&#x27;m sticking with it for now on.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair spray that I use.  Why?? because it is the BEST..Not stiff not sticky  just a great hold and it looks natural. This was my second order and I will be ordering again and again... TKS Amazon for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and wouldn&#x27;t change.  Not a bit sticky and gives me plenty of time to \\&quot;finger set\\&quot; my hair before finished.</li>
            <li> Have used this hairspray for years.  My only complaint was the high price but with the deal you get here @ Amazon, I no longer have that complaint.  I have very fine, thick and long hair which has a hard time holding a curl.  I use this spray on my hair right before I wrap it in the hot roller.  The result is long lasting, soft beautiful curls that last and last.  Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or hard to the touch.  Great product at a very good price.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian Shaper Plus hairspray for years and consider it perfect for my fine hair. I was delighted to find I could order it online and it arrived promptly.  As soon as I opened the first can and started to use it I realized it was spraying air but not hairspray. I tried the second can, same thing.  I tried the third can, same problem.  I own three cans of useless spray (NOT hairspray).  I couldn&#x27;t tell I had sprayed my hair at all after using it.  I think someone has figured out how to sell cans of air under the Sebastian name.  I will not be ordering it again online.  Fool me once, shame on you -- fool me twice, shame on me!  It ain&#x27;t happening.</li>
            <li> its great for the wigs.... but its not that strong</li>
            <li> Not sure if the texture of my hair changed or the formula changed, but I had to break up with Shaper Plus after a 20 year love affair.  My new boyfriend is Big Sexy Hair.  It&#x27;s not as good as the old Shaper Plus, but it&#x27;s the only thing that comes close.</li>
            <li> Only hairspray I use!  Been using it for a long time and I love it.</li>
            <li> love this product! I use it every day, it is the only hair spray that works the whole day long!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist suggested I use this hairspray, and I&#x27;ve been doing so for several successful years.  I can purchase it cheaper on Amazon than I can buy it locally wholesale.</li>
            <li> It is the only hairspray that my wife has found that holds her hair without it being &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; in place.</li>
            <li> Styles perfectly without being sticky and controls frizz in humid weather</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful hair spray.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Best Hairspray around!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair spray and hair styling product I use, and have been using it for many years. Have to order on line now because of now living in a small town where it is not available in any of our stores. :(</li>
            <li> not an overpowering scent, brushable hold, like this a lot. Admittedly you have to use quite a bit on humid days, but your hair is not stiff or tacky.</li>
            <li> Great bargain and product</li>
            <li> Best hairspray anywhere!</li>
            <li> Excellent hairspray but a little expensive for me. Now that I can get it through Amazon it is more than affordable.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Sebastian Shaper plus from other non-salon retailers before with no problems.  This product is a fake because it has a completely different fragrance and it does not perform like the original Shaper.  Do NOT buy it from this site!!</li>
            <li> Shaper + hairspray is the ONLY hairspray I will use. Nothing else works well on my fine, limp hair.  I love that I can buy it online.  With shipping cost, it&#x27;s probably the same and buying it locally but I don&#x27;t have to drive around to find it.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever.  Have been using this brand for fifteen years and was happy to get a GREAT deal on this amazing spray.</li>
            <li> This spray is a little lighter hold than I had remembered . . . great for fine or colored hair. Easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t get tacky.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years and think it is the best you can buy. Holds well and has a reasonable fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray that I will use.  I have been using it for years.  It is not sticky and brushes out well, yet it holds hair in place.</li>
            <li> Sebastian Shaper Plus (not plain Shaper or plus plus) leaves hair looking very natural. The product itself is amazing and holds your hair without looking like you sprayed it in place. If you overspray, you might get some flaking. When I had long hair, and wanted curls, I used to spray this on each piece of hair I was curling before rolling it so my curls would stay in for a long time. This spray is amazing for humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of caveats:&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t get it on your skin--if you do, wipe it because I find it clogs facial pores&lt;br /&gt;2. Keep the nozzle clean--the nozzle gets clogged easily and if you don&#x27;t use the product often, it seems to clog more. I wipe the nozzle often and if it gets clogged, I just pull off the crusting.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Good price.</li>
            <li> I received the package of the 3 hairsprays but one of them doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love thus products.  Holds my hair without the stiffness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much as the old formula. It doesn&#x27;t hold as well. I have to repeatedly spray my hair with it.</li>
            <li> Been using this hairspray for years now and it&#x27;s the only one that seems to be light enough for my very thin hair.  It sprays on very light and holds fairly well.  I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the price on this product.</li>
            <li> This shipment did not meet my expectations. my prior order included 3 cans that were 30% larger and had the holding power of the shaper plus I was used to. the holding power of the cans I received was not the true shaper plus feel-more like just the &amp;#34;shaper.com&amp;#34;. I do not feel that I received any value.</li>
            <li> great delivery and product</li>
            <li> Does not seem to be as strong as what I buy locally.</li>
            <li> Love the product hope I can continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> I always buy this product but when the can changed its appearance so did the spray inside the can. It no longer holds my hair at all!!!! Can&#x27;t wait to buy something new! don&#x27;t waste your money on this product in its new formula.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly...Great price !!! Only hair spray I have used for years .</li>
            <li> Not the original formula!! This spray does not work as well as the original.</li>
            <li> Very good hair spray.</li>
            <li> ITEMS ARRIVED RIGHT ON TIME!&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AGAIN,  BRAD</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN YOUR CUSTOMER FOR A FEW YEARS AND HAD NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN ANY MANNER.&lt;br /&gt;THIS SEBASTIAN SHAPER PLUS HAIRSPRAY IS NOT GOOD.  IT MUST LACK CERTAIN INGREDIENT, BECAUSE IT&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT HELP ME STYLE MY HAIR.  IT&#x27;S AS IF INSTEAD OF HAIRSPRAY, WATER WAS BOTTLED IN THESE&lt;br /&gt;CONTAINERS.  IT MAKES MY HAIR WET AND LIMP.  I RETURNED IT ON 5/1/15 AND HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING  YET.  AND BY  THE WAY,.YOU FAILED TO INCLUDE MY INVOICE AND A RETURN LABEL THIS TIME.  THIS HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE!  I MENTIONED IT TO YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE MARITZA.  I ADVISE YOU NOT TO DEAL WITH &amp;#34;PLANET BEAUTY&amp;#34; AGAIN. COULD IT BE THAT AMAZON DOES NOT NEED MY BUSINESS ANYMORE?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Sebastian Shaper Plus hairspray for many years and have loved the product.  Recently the look of the can changed.  I was assured by the salon I purchase the product from, that the change was in the look only and that the formula was the same.  NOT SO!  If you look at the ingredients, there are many changes to the formula.  This new hairspray is garbage! I have to use half a can to get even a little bit of hold and when I go out in the wind or the humidity it loses the little bit of hold it gives altogether!  So disappointing!  If this was an inexpensive product it wouldn&#x27;t be so upsetting but I pay close to $20.00 a can.  I&#x27;m so upset to have lost the only hairspray that actually worked with my very difficult hair.  The hunt is on for a replacement!  Unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it will be a Sebastian product.</li>
            <li> Sebastian&#x27;s Shaper Plus has been the only hair spray that works for my fine, limp, stick-straight hair.  That is until they changed the formula from 80% to 55%.  I have only two cans left of the original Shaper Plus and after they are empty will need to find a substitute but so far, that&#x27;s not going well.  I&#x27;ve tried several brands and nothing works as well as 80% Shaper Plus.  This product went from a five star, unbeatable product to a one star run-of-the-mill hairspray.  Buyer beware...this is not the Shaper Plus of the past so don&#x27;t buy it unless you have the kind of hair that can handle a very light hold.</li>
            <li> Good Product, wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray for me heavy and coarse hair, I don&#x27;t need to add any weight or volume to my hair and this is the ticket.  It also protects my hair from humidity to keep it from getting even bigger!  And, the hold is soft and durable. I hope Sebastian never quits making this formula.  IT is the BEST!</li>
            <li> Well made, sturdy. Looks better than picture. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> For those of us with thin, fine hair Shaper Plus is magic. It allows me to achieve the look of more volume than is really there!</li>
            <li> The product is great. The transaction was terrific. This is the third time ordered and all is good. What else is there to say.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years and love it.  It holds without being tacky and sticky.  Very easy to brush or comb thru.</li>
            <li> WORKED SUPER ON MY HAIR EXCELLENT PRODUCT! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE &amp;#60;IT IS A GREAT TO GET VOLUME!</li>
            <li> This hairspray holds your hair in place however it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  It has a pleasant smell, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this as well as me and several of my friends.  Even with my natural curly hair, there are times when I want my hair to stay in place but not feel fake after spraying on.  This works.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray and can use it couple of days without shampooing and no flakes. Holds great</li>
            <li> this is really the best hairspray ever.  you get great hold with out the helmet head.  your hair actually moves.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray and have used it for years.  It dries quickly, so you can still shape after spraying.  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I use. The reason....even Houston humidity will not wipe out your hair style if you are wearing this!</li>
            <li> I panic whenever I have a hard time finding Sebastian Hairspray.  I first discovered it about12 years ago on a visit to New Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have not found another Hairspray as perfect.  It has a light  hold, firm enough, but never stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> Have had to throw away several half filled spray cans because the spray nozzle clogs.  Very annoying.  Will not buy anymore because I do not like throwing away money.  I have tried everything to unclog the nozzle.</li>
            <li> The new look container is supposed to have the same ingredients but it does not work as good as the spray in the old container.  Even my hair dresser noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jannis</li>
            <li> I do not know why it is required to say so much about the things you ask me to review and grade on, this is good hairspray, I couldn&#x27;t get it for a lot less if I had bought it in a store</li>
            <li> At first I liked this hair spray, because it is not sticky and you can brush out your hair, without washing it.  But the more I used it the more I realized it doesn&#x27;t do much to hold your hair in place either.</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful user of this product for more than years. It is e best! Amazon offers a great price. Much better than make up beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the original version of Shaper Plus, but I wanted to warn others about ordering online sight unseen.  Unfortunately, the Amazon seller I purchased this from sent the newer formula.  It is not as pictured on Amazon.  The product I received is missing the round &#x27;Original Formula&#x27; label from the front and the ingredients listed are different.    From what I can tell, Sebastian is still manufacturing 2 versions of this hair spray:  1) The Original formula, and 2)The new version that is VOC compliant in all 50 states and Canada.  The newer version is missing the round label on the front.  The only way to tell what you are getting is this round label or by looking at the back of the can to see if it is VOC compliant in all 50 states.  Even worse is that since this item is combustible, it is not eligible for return, meaning I&#x27;m the proud owner of $30 hair spray that doesn&#x27;t work.  I would NEVER have purchased these if I had known I was getting the newer version (stupid me relied on the picture) and couldn&#x27;t return them. Fortunately, the original product is still legal to sell in FL.  I will have to pay full price in my salon, but at least I know it works.  If you order, know that you run the risk of getting the new, crappy version.    I have uploaded photos that will hopefully help others.</li>
            <li> After finding out that Sabastian did indeed change the formula of their Shaper Plus hairspray, I contacted the company and was given this explanation.  They said that SOME states have put a limit of &#x27;Volatile Organic Compounds&#x27; that can be used in their product....something like from 80% to 55%....so they had to decrease it in order to abide by the new guidelines.  However, due to popular demand, they are putting it back on the market at the beginning of the year in the states that will allow the higher percentage. My state...Florida...happens to be one that will allow the old formula to be sold....thank goodness.  I would encourage anyone who is interested, to call and find out what their state will permit.  800-935-5273&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> The ONLY she will use.  Price about what you can get at Walmart etc. if you can catch it on sale.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray ... I brush it out every night and my hair feels clean the next morning...you can wash your hair every other day when using this spray</li>
            <li> This is the only Hairspray that I have found, which I have used for many years, which I find pleasant to use.  It does not leave my hair sticky while still controlling it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price for 3, but shipping takes a little longer.....</li>
            <li> I love shaper plus!  It is the best hairspray that I have used for years for our very fine hair.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> For some reason this product was not the same as the one I&#x27;m accustomed to buying in a larger can. That&#x27;s a bummer.</li>
            <li> Great buy.  A little heavy on the shipping, but a great price!</li>
            <li> Good price.  Best hair spray out there.</li>
            <li> Thank you for letting us order this.  Everything went smoothly and my husband is very happy to get some of this hair spray.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is the best hairspray on the market. Just the right amount of hold and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff or sticky. This is from someone who has very curly, frizzy hair. When the day is done you can run a brush or comb through your hair and it&#x27;s still soft. The price can&#x27;t be beat either. A can at the salon will cost at least 18.00. This is my second purchase of the 3 cans and I recommended it to a friend and she also purchased it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago and although I have used Shaper Plus for many years and always loved it, THIS PRODUCT HERE IS NOT THE SAME! I had never heard they had changed the formula, but when I started using these cans of it, I hated it! My hair is very thin and fine and I live in a humid climate, so I depended on the &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34; to get me through the day, but this stuff is absolutely useless on my hair! I could never figure out why, until I found some in Walmart&#x27;s salon, marked the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;  and it &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34;.......once I used it, I was jumping for joy!  Since then, I have read up on the change they made to the old version and why they had to do it. Fortunately, I live in a state that still allows the old formula, so I&#x27;m a happy customer again. Never realized they had changed it, so I&#x27;ve wasted ALOT of money, not realizing it was the hairspray, rather than something else wrong. Wish someone would have told me, but now I know. If they stop making it available again, or it changes again, I&#x27;m done with it. Don&#x27;t like the Fierce or the Re-Shaper; they&#x27;re too drying and don&#x27;t wash out well for me. With the newer version, I could use a whole can and still have my hair look HORRIBLE! Thank you Sebastian, for bringing the Original back!</li>
            <li> Best hair spray around works good and smell wonderful have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I order this hairspray all the time because I love how it works. Its not heavy, and is a great styling tool.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this hairspray for my casual hair style because it lets my hair keep it&#x27;s style all day long without a stiff, sprayed look.  Plus it makes my hair so healthy, unlike many other brands I have tried!  I like the shine that it adds, too!  This was such a bargain, as I generally pay for 1 what I was able to buy 3 for!</li>
            <li> OMG!!! what happened to my great shaper plus!!!It used to hold through wind storms,rain storms and blizzards.....now I barely get out of my car in the morning and my hair is in my face!!as usual everyone has to mess with perfection!! I did&#x27;t like the New Coke either..well, off to the Dollar Store to find something better!</li>
            <li> Love this product will order again.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray for YEARS!  I have thick, coarse, wavy hair.  It smoothed the frizzies, I could hot-tool-style with it, and still brush it out.  Yeah, I tried it with the formula change and... hate it.  It&#x27;s just an ughy hairspray now. (I really hate the smell, too.) I ordered whatever I could find of the old formula, as long as I could, through Amazon.  After many trials of everything from cheap to super-expensive, I think I finally found a replacement!  Frederic Fekkai Sheer Hold Hairspray.  Personally, I don&#x27;t think it brushes out quite as nicely as the old Shaper Plus, but at least I get that smooth/no frizzy hold.  The price on Amazon is comparable to Sebastian Shaper Plus.  I picked up a 5.8 oz bottle locally, but I&#x27;m going to order the 11.6 oz on Amazon. If anyone else tries it and likes it, please let me know!</li>
            <li> This is a product I can not live without.  Nor can it be purchased anywhere for these prices.  It has been a product I have to use daily.  Not sticky or stiff.  No build up.  Great for your hair.  Have been using this for over 20 years and this is the only place I will buy it from.  Please continue to carry this 3 pack!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray on the market.  I have used this same hairspray for the last 20 years and I will never stop using it because it has a great hold but is not too sticky.  You can still brush through your hair after it is styled but it continues to keep the hold.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and they work great!</li>
            <li> love it!!!!! thank-you excellent shipping  regards cathy</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, I have used it for over 10 years.  I have been unable to find it at a competitive price so I use amazon.com for this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Great value for the dollar</li>
            <li> Found this at a lower price on Amazon than anywhere else.  Bought it for my wife, daughter and mother-in-law.  The three pack is perfect for them.  They&#x27;re happy so I am happy.  Shipping is timely and the ladies are always surprised to receive something in the mail.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. Like its name suggests, it allows me to &#x27;shape&#x27; my hairstyle. I have very fine, straight, thin hair.  With this spray, I can style my hair so that it looks much fuller and thicker. It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical. My hair finally met it&#x27;s match.  I have used this for several  years. Whenever I try another product  Aveeda, Big head, Chi etc.. I always return to this shaper spray. I usually pay  fifteen dollars a bottle -gladly. So,  I was  really happy to see this bulk offer on Amazon, Now about this product. It is just absolutely the best. Period!  I carry this everywhere I travel.  I can&#x27;t live without it. I have longish straighter hair that is very very hard to hold a style. Used to just fall l out easily. This holds great without stiffness and it even gets better.  You can also  use at the same time to style and even restyle  your hair too so there is way less stuff in your hair. You won&#x27;t need a bunch of products if you use this. I can even touch up if I am going out at night and somehow  easily l brush through my thickish hair yet  keep my hair shape somehow. It&#x27;s magic. I love, love, love this product. Can you tell.  I also  spray on when my hair is almost finished drying as a styler and shaper. Then when dried and styled give it another spray. Them my hair knows to behave.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the lousy reviews on-line regarding the new ingredients that NY allows to be used in Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray I admit I was a little dubious. AMAZINGLY, I FOUND JUST THE OPPOSITE TO BE TRUE! Great hold, non sticky, leaves hair lustrous and shiny after comb out etc, etc, etc. Now that I revealed the truth about this product I only hope that the price doesn&#x27;t go up and I still will be able to get it through amazon.com.</li>
            <li> In writing this review I noted that I am required to use a certain number of words.  It&#x27;s a crock.  I can write a few words and get my point across.  I will never write another review unless the policy in reviewed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! This is the only hairspray I will use! Gives perfect all day flexible hold even in the heat and humidity!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is the only hair spray that has the staying qualities with my fine hair without it being too stiff or too light.  The hair spray keeps my hair in place all day.  When my drug store quit carrying this product I went to the internet.  This is about the 8th or 9th time I have ordered this.  The product is always delivered as promised and packed just right.  Lois S</li>
            <li> Very pleased with delivery and product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  I have fine hair and find this product to be very effective in holding hair in place without leaving the hair sticky or real stiff.  Hold container at least four inches from hair when spraying.&lt;br /&gt;Mommasko</li>
            <li> This hairspray was just what I was looking for. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The Sebastian Shper Plus Hairspray is a product that I have been using for several&lt;br /&gt;years.  Have been very pleased with the product, but have never purchased it through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  It was a simple purchase, 3 bottles at one time and at very good pricing.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly would recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have been using this spray to 10 years +.  It&#x27;s the best!  I only wish I had thought of ordering online before, I would have saved a bundle.</li>
            <li> I choose this hair spray because it holds my hair in place all day, and never gets sticky, I&#x27;ve used it for years. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was told about this hairspray by a hairdresser when we were vacationing down south.  I decided to try it and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.  It&#x27;s very expensive at the salon, so I decided to try my FAVORITE on line store.....AMAZON.  This hairspray does not make your hair sticky or stiff, but holds it beautifully. Then you can brush it right out and your hair is shinny and bright.  I have very fine hair and IT WORKS.....LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray.  Works well but brushes out without breaking hair.  This is the only hairspray I will use and this is by far the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> Was so happy to find Sebastian Shaper Plus hairspray on Amazon.  I love this product and have used it for fifteen years.  It is the best hairspray ever.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased.  Excellent price.  Good vendor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used .  It&#x27; usually not available except I beauty supply shops &amp; you need a license to shop there.</li>
            <li> Like this hairspray., have been using for several years. Cheaper than buying at local beauty shop.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years as it does the job and does not leave my hair as hard or sticky as many other sprays do.  I have ordered it twice; was packed carefully and received in good condition.</li>
            <li> Hope I never have to change hair sprays.. I love this one...Have used it for years..  Great for baby fine hair...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to others. It is such a great spray. You can fix your hair well with this.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping. Would def buy again</li>
            <li> Because it is a wonderful product for fine hair. It does not weigh down my hair and brushes out easily,</li>
            <li> Have used Shaper for years and I will continue to use it for those days that I need a good hold that lasts</li>
            <li> The seller was very professional and got this to me on time and this product was far less expensive at amazon.com than at the local stores.  This product is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone that wants soft good hold.  Does not get sticky or stiff but at the end of the day the curl is still in even though my hair is normally straight and does not hold a curl. Love this product and have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> All three were checked as they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;All were in excellent condition - pressure was good on all.</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian shaper Plus for years &amp; I still LOVE it! My hair holds really well, but brushes out easily!</li>
            <li> Efficient purchase; fast and economical.</li>
            <li> 2nd order and another cap was broke in a couple of pieces.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray! It is the only hairspray I buy, and at $11 a can, you will be hard pressed to find a better deal elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is not sticky, holds my curls very well, and is easy to comb through!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and was delighted to be able to purchase this on line for such a terrific price</li>
            <li> Finding hairspray for fine textured hair is a challenge.  Most of the sprays that hold well are also heavy, and basically crush my hair flat under their weight, then look like a helmut  despite using as light an amount as possible. This product is the perfect  balance between the hold wanted from a hair spray and the lightness needed for fine hair. My hair stays where I want it to stay, retains it&#x27;s ability to move when I do, and can&#x27;t be seen once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair - holds strong in humidity.</li>
            <li> Excellent deal! I&#x27;ll be BACK!</li>
            <li> Need very little for a good hold. No build up when you comb through hair. Great on humid days</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> This is very good hairspray.  It holds longer than any other I have used.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Pricing is great and I love product. Please don&#x27;t ask me to review and then tell me I am not using enough words.  You get what I give</li>
            <li> Got here on time and as long as I know it will be good, just as the last time.</li>
            <li> Does not hold at all like the old product.  I figured out this is the product that is making my scalp feel like it is sunburned.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Shaper, but not as much as Sebastian previous Brushable before they changed to the new product</li>
            <li> This appears to be a knockoff!!! I have been using this product for many years and when I can&#x27;t find it on sale (usually buy one get one at a discounted price at one of my local stores or salons), I try to find a \\&quot;good deal\\&quot; on line as I start getting low on product.  When this order arrived, it was not as pictured on this ad, it looked entirely different. Although the can said 10.6 oz which is the norm, it was larger (the can not the amount) in size and the material used for the cap and can were of a different quality. Since I still had product left, I compared the entire packaging, the wording is different content and type, and is printed in a different direction, even the manufacturing information is different. When sprayed it spits instead of spraying out fine like the norm, smells atrocious and my hair is like the helmet cheap hairsprays usually create. I know the product has changed from the original and is not quite as good, but this is definitely much worse and not even the new formula--it is definitely a ripoff!!!  I have not investigated returning it for a refund, but wanted to warn everyone to beware....</li>
            <li> Good quality hairspray. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray because it holds great but you can still brush your hair as normal. It is so expensive in the stores I don;t but it there but buying this 3 pack is a great deal!  Shippers service was as expected.</li>
            <li> I luv this product does not leave a heavy build up and a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Great hairspray - great value!!!</li>
            <li> great price and delevery</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine hair. I&#x27;ve been using this for YEARS. they&#x27;ve changed the formula and now I notice after an hour or so my hair appears oily and limp. Never in my life have I had a hairspray do that, and I&#x27;ve used everything from low-end drugstore to high-end salon professional products. Waste of my money!</li>
