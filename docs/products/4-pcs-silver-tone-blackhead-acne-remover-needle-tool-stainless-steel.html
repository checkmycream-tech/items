            <li>Also excellent for First Aide: stitches &amp; splinter removal, pets,</li>
            <li>They are very fine and pointy.</li>
            <li>An instrument where the end is more of an oval and curved works much better.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li>Awesome double ended tools.</li>
            <li>The smaller hoop ends are perfect for pimples or clogged pore extraction.</li>
            <li>These are way better than using a needle.</li>
            <li>+ Strong and sturdy metal throughout</li>
            <li>I got them before expected time and was surprisingly happy.</li>

            <li>/&gt;+ works well and on some skin and certain blemishes</li>
            <li>A must-have; some blackheads are not in places which are easily popped, and ingrown hairs are hard to get out; these tools solve these problems and more; highly recommend.</li>

            <li>Many of the different heads were the same thing (size, depth) and while it does have a nice weight, I find them to be too much for my skin often making it worse.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many high reviews for this one.</li>
            <li>I personally can&#x27;t seem to get them to work very well.</li>
            <li>At least on the tip of my nose where I am most wanting to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li>I take a really hot towel put it over my nose to open pores once skin is dampened and pores are open</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try something new</li>
            <li>I give a three because the needles are very sharp and useful in breaking open whiteheads.  </li>

            <li> The loop ends are small and straight.  </li>
            <li> I chose the tool with the loop at the end and slowly scrape it over my affected area applying pressure to really bring the blackheads up.</li>

            <li> Works as expected, Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Everything just as expected</li>
            <li> The tools were just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The delivery time was a bit longer than I expected, though.  </li>

            <li> My face was red for about a day (went a little overboard poking and pressing)</li>
            <li> Along the side of my nose they half way seem to work.</li>
            <li> I got these for my face due to small blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> I may use them as sculpting tools so it&#x27;s not all gone to waste.</li>
            <li> If your black heads are really bad you can gently use your fingers to get rid of some.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with a small bag or wrap to keep them in&lt;br</li>
            <li> The needle ends are tough &amp; helpful for pulling out clogged pores or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are addicted to using them.</li>
            <li> Very small, difficult to grasp.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using them wrong, I don&#x27;t know.</li>

            <li> Works as expected, Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many high reviews for this one. Many of the different heads were the same thing (size, depth) and while it does have a nice weight, I find them to be too much for my skin often making it worse.  I know someone that bought a different set on Amazon, one with a carrying case, and those were much better. If I saw this kit in person I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. I may use them as sculpting tools so it&#x27;s not all gone to waste.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these tools for getting his ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  The loop ends are small and straight.  An instrument where the end is more of an oval and curved works much better.  Very small, difficult to grasp.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast.although no instructions are included it&#x27;s common knowledge &amp; there are a bunch of help full utube videos. My face was red for about a day (went a little overboard poking and pressing) but these got rid of my tiny whiteheads that seemed to wanna reside on my cheeks no matter what cleanser I attacked them with.great price great buy 8 tools with 4 pieces. Super simple after steaming your face.</li>
            <li> Everything just as expected</li>
            <li> Ok. This stuff is ok.</li>
            <li> These tools will get the job done, but don&#x27;t work on everything.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work well for me. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use them without actually hurting my nose. I&#x27;d recommend just getting a Pixar brush to exfoliate or nose strips... If your black heads are really bad you can gently use your fingers to get rid of some.</li>
            <li> Great tools. Awesome double ended tools. The smaller hoop ends are perfect for pimples or clogged pore extraction. The needle ends are tough &amp; helpful for pulling out clogged pores or ingrown hairs. Invaluable tools for skincare use. My husband and I are addicted to using them. Excellent buy. Pleased!</li>
            <li> great value, works great</li>
            <li> I got them before expected time and was surprisingly happy.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me these and when my daughter lost them she was devastated. So we bought them again.They help pop zits without marring your skin like fingernails do because it equally pressured around the pimple.</li>
            <li> I personally can&#x27;t seem to get them to work very well. I&#x27;m trying to use them on my nose, and even after opening my pores with steam I just can&#x27;t seem to get the gunk out of my blackheads. At least on the tip of my nose where I am most wanting to get rid of them.  Along the side of my nose they half way seem to work. I give a three because the needles are very sharp and useful in breaking open whiteheads.  Other than that, I&#x27;m kind of disappointed. I wish there were different sizes to the wire hoops. Or instructions.  Maybe I&#x27;m using them wrong, I don&#x27;t know. I just don&#x27;t seem to have good luck with it.</li>
            <li> These are way better than using a needle.</li>
            <li> Perfect set. I got these for my face due to small blackheads on my nose. Ive tried everything from home remedies to store bought strips and scrubs. I finally decided to try something new and I am thankful for my venture. I found this set and it shipped fast. I take a really hot towel put it over my nose to open pores once skin is dampened and pores are open I chose the tool with the loop at the end and slowly scrape it over my affected area applying pressure to really bring the blackheads up. May take a few scrapes in each area but really works. The nest thing to do is watch extraction for blackheads on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use every feature to this set, but the set is well made and is good quality. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> A must-have; some blackheads are not in places which are easily popped, and ingrown hairs are hard to get out; these tools solve these problems and more; highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The tools were just what I expected.  The delivery time was a bit longer than I expected, though.  I am highly satified with the produt. i will recommend this item.  I rate this item a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for having it available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Birdie Gilmer</li>
            <li> + Strong and sturdy metal throughout&lt;br /&gt;+ Is as pictured and described.&lt;br /&gt;+ works well and on some skin and certain blemishes is great.&lt;br /&gt;+ Also excellent for First Aide: stitches &amp; splinter removal, pets, ingrown hairs etc.  (Not substitute for doctor)&lt;br /&gt;- Wish it came with a small bag or wrap to keep them in&lt;br /&gt;- The pieces with the wire loop-end were a bit big and yet the two included were identical in size.&lt;br /&gt;- it would be better if the simular/same pieceswerealtered in size slightly.</li>
            <li> They are very fine and pointy. They&#x27;re ok for black heads.</li>
