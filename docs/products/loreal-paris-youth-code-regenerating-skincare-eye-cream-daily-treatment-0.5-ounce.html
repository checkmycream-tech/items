            <li>Love this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li>I have to say I am VERY impressed with the youth code line, never have I seen better results around my eyes</li>
            <li>, I still use retin-A at night, but I have to say this line is on top of my list as one of the best products out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is non-irritating, has a pleasant scent, but I could tell no difference using it.</li>
            <li>And it is a huge understatement when I say I&#x27;m tremendously impressed with the results!!</li>
            <li>aunt didnt say a word about it, maybe good</li>
            <li>I had read really good reviews about this product and have been underwhelmed by it.  </li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Not a miracle worker, but good for the price.  </li>
            <li>my wife said it is good for her skin.</li>
            <li>price was good and it came on time</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Good under eye serum and moisurizers</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT I WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE IT ONLINE..</li>
            <li>I wish I could have liked this product</li>
            <li>Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also easily stressed,and we all know what kind of havoc stress has on the skin!</li>
            <li>These cream works great and love the cool metal tip!</li>
            <li>The box also kind of leads you to believe that after a month of using the eye cream twice a day, your fine lines and crows feet will &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; to be gone-period!</li>
            <li>I really love this effective product and it helps me with my skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>and I think this is the best, so far.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best, so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at WalMart and it was more pricey</li>
            <li>The balm is much better.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly using fingertip(the applicator kind of drags and pulls on the skin).</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over the years</li>
            <li>I have been using L&#x27;Oreal products for many years.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it moisturizes, but I didn&#x27;t feel there was some underlying code for youth in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>So, it may be better to just buy something else.  </li>
            <li>Overall I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with this cream</li>
            <li>does a better job than some creams i used that cost 4 times the price</li>
            <li>The skin feels smmoother, softer and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see some results with continued use.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll give more time to see the difference.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyes look so much better.  </li>
            <li>If it could be richer and more hydrating it would be a five-star product in my book.</li>
            <li>That applicator is great in itself, as it feels very cool and soothing as you gently rub it around under and beside your eye.</li>
            <li>I used it for the 5th time this morning, and right now-5 hrs after that application-those fine lines and crows feet around my eyes are 100% NOT VISABLE!!</li>
            <li>Very good, My wife, when I felt good effect, and the next a discount activity, also bought，very very good,we love it</li>
            <li>I was pretty upset to find out that it&#x27;s not made anymore, but I guess I&#x27;m glad I found out before I bought any and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>I am almost 55 and have fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>When I get up in the morning, the fine lines look quite diminished.</li>
            <li>I love the metal tip, super soothing.</li>
            <li>i love this eye cream, absorbs quickly, non greasy.</li>
            <li>It is very light and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>This cream is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I think it is good so far.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting tremendous results from this eye cream at all, and I certainly didn&#x27;t expect to see anything at all after the very first application!</li>
            <li>So my bottom line is this: I am impressed beyond words with the results of this eye cream after only my 5th application, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>was excited when I read the hype and the reviews about Loreal&#x27;s Youth Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like how the cool metal tip feels</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post an update after I&#x27;ve been using the eye cream for a full month and let you know.</li>
            <li>They say that applicator will help with puffiness under the eye because of its coolness, and I know that to be true as well.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I use it every day.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I use it every day.</li>
            <li>It was ok didn&#x27;t really do much</li>
            <li>I like the applicator, it feels cool on your skin.</li>
            <li>This is pretty cool!</li>
            <li>I wanted something that would smooth and lighten my undereye area and although I don&#x27;t have much in the way of fine lines or wrinkles I do have some bumpy skin under my eyes and purply, sallow circles that are always there.</li>
            <li>And if that&#x27;s what happens, that will be ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC, and quite fine by me!!</li>
            <li>Product is actually pretty good if you use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>This is first time use it ,I like it!</li>
            <li>I noticed quite a difference in the appearance of the fine lines and crows feet around my eyes shortly after the very first application, which amazed me!!</li>
            <li>I decided to try it out, and so far great daily  skin care treatment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the metal tip, but I just put the cream on my finger and wipe it on...seems to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>The box promises more improved, and longer lasting results with each application, and that&#x27;s EXACTLY what I&#x27;m experiencing!!</li>
            <li>I also used the serum, and while it felt good &#x27;going on&#x27; I could see no positive results with it</li>
            <li>Tried it and right away did not like it.  </li>
            <li>On any given day,I will stay up until 2 am or maybe even 4 if I&#x27;m in the right mood.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price for products.</li>
            <li>I am an Esthetician who has tried many products for the last 20 years.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how mind-boggling it is for me to see that what the product promises will happen is actually happening!!</li>
            <li>As of right now though I&#x27;d say that it looks promising.</li>
            <li>First let me say I am NOT a 21 yr old writing a review about an anti-wrinkle product, I am 55 yrs old, and have the fine lines and crows feet around my eyes to prove it!</li>
            <li>But thanks to the ingredients in this eye cream they absolutely cannot be seen!</li>
            <li>After the very first application they were not invisible, but they were hugely improved, so as to be not nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very oily espeically in the summer months when it is hot and humid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first thing I&#x27;ve found that really seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li>It got rid of puffiness,dark circles and those tiny fine lines.</li>
            <li>The metal tip gave a nice cooling effect but dragged a little while I was trying to spread the product.</li>
            <li>Along with this, I use the Serum Intense, Day Lotion and Day/Night Lotion in addition to exfoliating three times a week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the youthcode texture serum and moisturizer (pink ones)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason this isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore, it takes forever to blend into the skin, and it really has NO affect on the eye area at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see too much difference</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin very well and leaves a residue when it dries.  </li>
            <li>an to tell you the truth this really work on my skin no rash or bump on my skin..</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much results from using this product.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t very moisturizing at all</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>, I think it really helps.</li>
            <li>I guess other people had better luck with the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li>Really work i&#x27;ve been using this product since i was in high school..</li>
            <li>Seeing this new product on the shelf, I decided $20.00 wasn&#x27;t too much money</li>
            <li>This company sent product out quickly and I would definitely use them again!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone wishing to improve and maintain their appearance.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have normal skin.</li>
            <li>cream comes in a nice tube, has an odd little metal tip (used to keep the under eye circles cool and reduce swelling?</li>
            <li>like Olay Regenerist MUCH better, and even though I found it made my face red for the first week and a half, I could see a visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try new things all of the time, not just for my skin, but everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if your skin is young and under-eye circles are your main concern</li>
            <li>Those of you who are fragrance sensitive, I highly recommend you avoid this product.</li>
            <li>so prices are higher even at our local WalMart compared to Amazon.</li>
            <li>It really works and it barely even has a scent (I can&#x27;t stand perfumey lotions).</li>
            <li>After what I&#x27;ve had happen so far I take that to mean that the effects of the eye cream will have continued to become more dramatic and longer lasting, so that those fine lines and crows feet appear to be invisible most of the time.</li>
            <li>And with each application since the results have become a bit more dramatic, and have lasted a bit longer, which is exactly what it says on the box will happen.</li>
            <li>I actually like the whole line so far (3 weeks of use)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because I had been playing with my 2 year old granddaughter a couple of days before receiving the product, and she bumped her head against the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li>I see that others mentioned that the product they got was old or out of date</li>
            <li>After a first few tries of it I saw a huge difference under my eye.</li>
            <li>Using that cool (almost cold) applicator on the areas that were swollen &amp; bruised felt very soothing, and today the swelling is almost completely gone, and the bruised area has faded a tremendous amount.</li>
            <li>The eye cream comes in a small tube with a smooth metal applicator on the tip.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m only 22 years old and have no legit reason to use an anti-aging cream,my habits place me for a risk of premature wrinkling and early aging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back later and update my review in a month, but for now, my fine lines are less noticeable, puffiness is gone</li>
            <li>That resulted in a black eye and a swollen area under my right eye.</li>
            <li>The under-eye skin is definitely more hydrated, shows less wrinkles and less puffy.</li>
            <li>The jar is almost empty and I&#x27;m ready for another jar.</li>
            <li>The Youth Code line is a step up and also a little more expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could write a useful review as to whether this product works, but after two days I returned it b/c the fragrance was strong and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this product really does improve dark under-eye circles.</li>
            <li>For me, it truly is a Huge Miracle in a Small Tube!!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It got rid of puffiness,dark circles and those tiny fine lines.</li>
            <li> The metal tip gave a nice cooling effect but dragged a little while I was trying to spread the product.</li>
            <li> Along with this, I use the Serum Intense, Day Lotion and Day/Night Lotion in addition to exfoliating three times a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the youthcode texture serum and moisturizer (pink ones)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore, it takes forever to blend into the skin, and it really has NO affect on the eye area at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see too much difference</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin very well and leaves a residue when it dries.  </li>
            <li> an to tell you the truth this really work on my skin no rash or bump on my skin..</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much results from using this product.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t very moisturizing at all</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> , I think it really helps.</li>
            <li> I guess other people had better luck with the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really work i&#x27;ve been using this product since i was in high school..</li>
            <li> Seeing this new product on the shelf, I decided $20.00 wasn&#x27;t too much money</li>
            <li> This company sent product out quickly and I would definitely use them again!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone wishing to improve and maintain their appearance.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have normal skin.</li>
            <li> cream comes in a nice tube, has an odd little metal tip (used to keep the under eye circles cool and reduce swelling?</li>
            <li> like Olay Regenerist MUCH better, and even though I found it made my face red for the first week and a half, I could see a visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try new things all of the time, not just for my skin, but everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if your skin is young and under-eye circles are your main concern</li>
            <li> Those of you who are fragrance sensitive, I highly recommend you avoid this product.</li>
            <li> so prices are higher even at our local WalMart compared to Amazon.</li>
            <li> It really works and it barely even has a scent (I can&#x27;t stand perfumey lotions).</li>
            <li> After what I&#x27;ve had happen so far I take that to mean that the effects of the eye cream will have continued to become more dramatic and longer lasting, so that those fine lines and crows feet appear to be invisible most of the time.</li>
            <li> And with each application since the results have become a bit more dramatic, and have lasted a bit longer, which is exactly what it says on the box will happen.</li>
            <li> I actually like the whole line so far (3 weeks of use)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because I had been playing with my 2 year old granddaughter a couple of days before receiving the product, and she bumped her head against the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> I see that others mentioned that the product they got was old or out of date</li>
            <li> After a first few tries of it I saw a huge difference under my eye.</li>
            <li> Using that cool (almost cold) applicator on the areas that were swollen &amp; bruised felt very soothing, and today the swelling is almost completely gone, and the bruised area has faded a tremendous amount.</li>
            <li> The eye cream comes in a small tube with a smooth metal applicator on the tip.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m only 22 years old and have no legit reason to use an anti-aging cream,my habits place me for a risk of premature wrinkling and early aging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back later and update my review in a month, but for now, my fine lines are less noticeable, puffiness is gone</li>
            <li> That resulted in a black eye and a swollen area under my right eye.</li>
            <li> The under-eye skin is definitely more hydrated, shows less wrinkles and less puffy.</li>
            <li> The jar is almost empty and I&#x27;m ready for another jar.</li>
            <li> The Youth Code line is a step up and also a little more expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could write a useful review as to whether this product works, but after two days I returned it b/c the fragrance was strong and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this product really does improve dark under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> For me, it truly is a Huge Miracle in a Small Tube!!  </li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing even with regular long term use and in fact clogged my pores and gave me little acne bumps on my undereyes.</li>
            <li> This product really works, I usually wake up with puffy eyes, but as soon as I apply this cream, it&#x27;s gone in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to tell if it will do as it says it will.</li>
            <li> This item has expired for a long time！！！And</li>
            <li> it was a long time.</li>
            <li> Strange..  </li>
            <li> You see,I have this habit of staying up way past the normal bedtime for humans.</li>
            <li> Then I use the metal applicator to slowly pat over the application area for a very cooling effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time and it is only one of two eye products that I have found help with the dark circles.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not much of a moisturizer (at least, it doesn&#x27;t do much for me).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to confirm the claims of less wrinkles etc</li>
            <li> Now that I know it works for me, I will buy at Amazon next time since it cost $7 less.</li>
            <li> My past experiences with every other product I&#x27;ve ever tried has been that they didn&#x27;t come anywhere near close to the promised results.</li>
            <li> My location though is quite remote</li>
            <li> This is not really a review, but I just wanted to let everyone know that Loreal no longer makes this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost a year and about a week after using this product, it wasn&#x27;t working as expected.</li>
            <li> Helps with wrinkles and even lightens up the dark circles if you remember to use the metal tips to soothe the eyes after putting on the cream.  </li>
            <li> usually post over-the-top, very positive reviews.</li>
            <li> BUT THEN I WAS UNABLE TO FIND IT IN ANY OF MY REGULAR STORES SUCH AS WALMART, CVS AND KROGER.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles were less noticable but not gone the way I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disgusted because I bought the Serum from this line for my face and really love it!  </li>
            <li> The cream was a little greasy</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often take the time to comment on things I don&#x27;t like, unless I feel like I can save someone the trouble or wasted money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money (you get what you pay for)</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy this again a waste of money</li>
            <li> Its burning around my eyes every time I use this, not sure what to do, must be having an allergic reaction to a product in the merchandise.</li>
            <li> not sure yet</li>
            <li> The circles were still visible after weeks of use, and the worst part was eventually the skin under my eyes started to hurt the more I used it.</li>
            <li> and but you can really hardly see the difference</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and cakey and I have seen no difference in my under eye area.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but a lot less when purchased from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but overall wasn&#x27;t a bad texture and consistency.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> out of date,i feel very angry</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed using L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone will be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> aunt didnt say a word about it, maybe good</li>
            <li> Decided to try this item, because I recievd a coupon from a magazine subscription. I decided to try it out, and so far great daily  skin care treatment.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price for products. I continue to be baffled by the grocery store prices every time I am in the store.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I have noticeable changes under my eye. The under-eye skin is definitely more hydrated, shows less wrinkles and less puffy. I bought this product at WalMart and it was more pricey but I needed to try ASAP. My location though is quite remote so prices are higher even at our local WalMart compared to Amazon. Now that I know it works for me, I will buy at Amazon next time since it cost $7 less.</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician who has tried many products for the last 20 years. I have to say I am VERY impressed with the youth code line, never have I seen better results around my eyes, I still use retin-A at night, but I have to say this line is on top of my list as one of the best products out there.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Eye Cream Daily Treatment packagings had been opened.I do not know whether the product was used.</li>
            <li> I like how the cool metal tip feels but I didn&#x27;t find it hydrating enough to prevent those under eye creases you can get with your makeup. The balm is much better.</li>
            <li> I really love this effective product and it helps me with my skincare routine.  Along with this, I use the Serum Intense, Day Lotion and Day/Night Lotion in addition to exfoliating three times a week.  This product is expensive, but a lot less when purchased from Amazon.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone wishing to improve and maintain their appearance.</li>
            <li> I have been using \\&quot;Youth Code Regenerating Skincare Eye Cream Daily Treatment\\&quot; for three weeks. I am almost 55 and have fine lines around my eyes. This product goes on smoothly using fingertip(the applicator kind of drags and pulls on the skin). Then I use the metal applicator to slowly pat over the application area for a very cooling effect. When I get up in the morning, the fine lines look quite diminished. I have tried so many products over the years and I think this is the best, so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal products for many years.  The Youth Code line is a step up and also a little more expensive, but worth it.  You will not be disappointed using L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> Very good, My wife, when I felt good effect, and the next a discount activity, also bought，very very good,we love it</li>
            <li> This item has expired for a long time！！！And it was a long time.So,next time I will only choose the products sold by Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could write a useful review as to whether this product works, but after two days I returned it b/c the fragrance was strong and unpleasant.  Also triggered eye itching (allergies). Those of you who are fragrance sensitive, I highly recommend you avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Just started using but I&#x27;m satisfied..</li>
            <li> Its burning around my eyes every time I use this, not sure what to do, must be having an allergic reaction to a product in the merchandise. May work well for others but I will not buy again. I am going to contact L&#x27;Oreal Paris about this problem.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie. I try new things all of the time, not just for my skin, but everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I read the hype and the reviews about Loreal&#x27;s Youth Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually post over-the-top, very positive reviews. I don&#x27;t often take the time to comment on things I don&#x27;t like, unless I feel like I can save someone the trouble or wasted money. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m posting this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes in a nice tube, has an odd little metal tip (used to keep the under eye circles cool and reduce swelling? You&#x27;d have to hold it on there for a while)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is non-irritating, has a pleasant scent, but I could tell no difference using it. I also used the serum, and while it felt good &#x27;going on&#x27; I could see no positive results with it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream felt like an inexpensive facial cream. No bells and whistles. I&#x27;m sure it moisturizes, but I didn&#x27;t feel there was some underlying code for youth in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Olay Regenerist MUCH better, and even though I found it made my face red for the first week and a half, I could see a visible difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Youth Code, nada.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream and got it last week.  Tried it and right away did not like it.  It is not moisturizing and does not dissolve into the skin well at all.   I&#x27;m disgusted because I bought the Serum from this line for my face and really love it!  Strange..  Also, the seller wouldn&#x27;t allow me to return it because it was opened.  If you buy this in a store and open it, and for whatever reason it doesn&#x27;t work out, you can return it with the receipt.  My mistake.</li>
            <li> First let me say I am NOT a 21 yr old writing a review about an anti-wrinkle product, I am 55 yrs old, and have the fine lines and crows feet around my eyes to prove it! I received the product on Saturday, just 48 hrs after I ordered it, and this is Monday afternoon, so I&#x27;ve used the eye cream 5 times now. And it is a huge understatement when I say I&#x27;m tremendously impressed with the results!! I noticed quite a difference in the appearance of the fine lines and crows feet around my eyes shortly after the very first application, which amazed me!! I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting tremendous results from this eye cream at all, and I certainly didn&#x27;t expect to see anything at all after the very first application! My past experiences with every other product I&#x27;ve ever tried has been that they didn&#x27;t come anywhere near close to the promised results. Not so with this eye cream!! I used it for the 5th time this morning, and right now-5 hrs after that application-those fine lines and crows feet around my eyes are 100% NOT VISABLE!! No, I&#x27;m not trying to mislead you into believing they&#x27;re gone-I still have them. But thanks to the ingredients in this eye cream they absolutely cannot be seen! After the very first application they were not invisible, but they were hugely improved, so as to be not nearly as noticeable. And with each application since the results have become a bit more dramatic, and have lasted a bit longer, which is exactly what it says on the box will happen. I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how mind-boggling it is for me to see that what the product promises will happen is actually happening!! The box promises more improved, and longer lasting results with each application, and that&#x27;s EXACTLY what I&#x27;m experiencing!! The box also kind of leads you to believe that after a month of using the eye cream twice a day, your fine lines and crows feet will &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; to be gone-period! Notice it DOES NOT say they will be gone--it says they will &amp;#34;appear to be gone&amp;#34;. (Big Difference!) After what I&#x27;ve had happen so far I take that to mean that the effects of the eye cream will have continued to become more dramatic and longer lasting, so that those fine lines and crows feet appear to be invisible most of the time. And if that&#x27;s what happens, that will be ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC, and quite fine by me!! But that remains to be seen. I&#x27;ll post an update after I&#x27;ve been using the eye cream for a full month and let you know. As of right now though I&#x27;d say that it looks promising. :)  The eye cream comes in a small tube with a smooth metal applicator on the tip. That applicator is great in itself, as it feels very cool and soothing as you gently rub it around under and beside your eye. They say that applicator will help with puffiness under the eye because of its coolness, and I know that to be true as well. That&#x27;s because I had been playing with my 2 year old granddaughter a couple of days before receiving the product, and she bumped her head against the bridge of my nose. That resulted in a black eye and a swollen area under my right eye. Using that cool (almost cold) applicator on the areas that were swollen &amp; bruised felt very soothing, and today the swelling is almost completely gone, and the bruised area has faded a tremendous amount. (I used the applicator on those areas several times a day, without squeezing out any cream) So my bottom line is this: I am impressed beyond words with the results of this eye cream after only my 5th application, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY/TRY THIS PRODUCT YOURSELF!! In fact I cannot recommend it highly enough!! I don&#x27;t think anyone will be disappointed. For me, it truly is a Huge Miracle in a Small Tube!!  :)  (I will post a results update after 30 days of use)</li>
            <li> This product really works, I usually wake up with puffy eyes, but as soon as I apply this cream, it&#x27;s gone in 5 minutes. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now and I actually think I&#x27;m starting to see a difference under the eye area which it takes sometime to use before you see any results.</li>
            <li> This is not really a review, but I just wanted to let everyone know that Loreal no longer makes this product.  That may explain why some of you received expired products. So, it may be better to just buy something else.  I was pretty upset to find out that it&#x27;s not made anymore, but I guess I&#x27;m glad I found out before I bought any and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> I know why the price is so reduced..because it doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s just a cold wand with a nice shape and that&#x27;s about it. Waste of money (you get what you pay for)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the youthcode texture serum and moisturizer (pink ones) so i tried to find the eye cream. There&#x27;s a reason this isn&#x27;t sold in stores anymore, it takes forever to blend into the skin, and it really has NO affect on the eye area at all. I&#x27;ll stick to olay for eye creams from now on.</li>
            <li> i HAVE ALREADY BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR SOMETIME, BUT THEN I WAS UNABLE TO FIND IT IN ANY OF MY REGULAR STORES SUCH AS WALMART, CVS AND KROGER.  sO i LOOKED ON THE INTERNET ANDWAS DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT I WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE IT ONLINE..</li>
            <li> They seem to be used and the boxes damage and are open. one of the box has pen scratches on it.Product batch number is 20 GD00, it seem that the product expire.</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic. Although I&#x27;m only 22 years old and have no legit reason to use an anti-aging cream,my habits place me for a risk of premature wrinkling and early aging. You see,I have this habit of staying up way past the normal bedtime for humans. On any given day,I will stay up until 2 am or maybe even 4 if I&#x27;m in the right mood. I&#x27;m also easily stressed,and we all know what kind of havoc stress has on the skin! Well,I purchased this after reading the reviews on here and I thought \\&quot;the skin around the eyes is the fastest part of the face to show signs of aging,might as well prevent this now\\&quot; and it does! It really works and it barely even has a scent (I can&#x27;t stand perfumey lotions). It got rid of puffiness,dark circles and those tiny fine lines. I also wear contacts and haven&#x27;t had any irritation or redness. This is pretty cool!</li>
            <li> Seemed drying to me, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see too much difference but I like the smell and the feel of this cream.  This company sent product out quickly and I would definitely use them again!</li>
            <li> I had read really good reviews about this product and have been underwhelmed by it.  It doesn&#x27;t soak into the skin very well and leaves a residue when it dries.  I see that others mentioned that the product they got was old or out of date and I wonder too if that might be the case with the tube I received.  In any case won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good. Also, I used it around the mouth.</li>
            <li> Product is actually pretty good if you use it regularly.  It&#x27;s a thicker cream, which I like... I&#x27;m not crazy about the metal tip, but I just put the cream on my finger and wipe it on...seems to get the job done.  Not a miracle worker, but good for the price.  I actually like the whole line so far (3 weeks of use)</li>
            <li> not sure yet but I think it is good so far.</li>
            <li> I do not like this eye cream. It&#x27;s thick and cakey and I have seen no difference in my under eye area.</li>
            <li> Okay...I bought this product two days ago, but I have already seen results. I&#x27;ve had under eye wrinkles and puffiness for about 4 months and it&#x27;s been driving me crazy. Concealers (I&#x27;ve tried several) had settled into the lines. Seeing this new product on the shelf, I decided $20.00 wasn&#x27;t too much money and if I didn&#x27;t like it, I still had the receipt. I&#x27;ll come back later and update my review in a month, but for now, my fine lines are less noticeable, puffiness is gone and I&#x27;m estatic about it. I&#x27;m going to order the day/night cream from Amazon.  Update: November 26, 2011  It&#x27;s been almost a year and about a week after using this product, it wasn&#x27;t working as expected. My wrinkles were less noticable but not gone the way I wanted. I decided to buy Dermae Peptide Plus Wrinkle Reverse Eye Cream. I love it so much that I use it every day. The jar is almost empty and I&#x27;m ready for another jar. It&#x27;s inexpensive (about the same price as Youth Code). It HAS kept my wrinkles at bay for a year. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m asking!</li>
            <li> Really work i&#x27;ve been using this product since i was in high school..an to tell you the truth this really work on my skin no rash or bump on my skin..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to it.  :|</li>
            <li> I bought this product two days ago, but I have already seen results.I love it so much that I use it every day.I think this is the best, so far.</li>
            <li> One of the best eye creams ever.  Helps with wrinkles and even lightens up the dark circles if you remember to use the metal tips to soothe the eyes after putting on the cream.  I&#x27;ve used this for a long time and it is only one of two eye products that I have found help with the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I wish I could have liked this product but it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I wanted something that would smooth and lighten my undereye area and although I don&#x27;t have much in the way of fine lines or wrinkles I do have some bumpy skin under my eyes and purply, sallow circles that are always there. This product did absolutely nothing even with regular long term use and in fact clogged my pores and gave me little acne bumps on my undereyes. The cream was a little greasy but overall wasn&#x27;t a bad texture and consistency.The metal tip gave a nice cooling effect but dragged a little while I was trying to spread the product. Overall I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with this cream but you can&#x27;t beat the price for a basic cream.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, I do not recommend this product. It makes your skin very oily espeically in the summer months when it is hot and humid. I have not seen much results from using this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product worked as well as Regenerist Eye cream. The circles were still visible after weeks of use, and the worst part was eventually the skin under my eyes started to hurt the more I used it. I guess other people had better luck with the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Truly firms and takes away puffiness.</li>
            <li> Product batch number is 20 gd00 and 20 g800, if not understand correctly is in 2010 the production of such words must have expired, the shelf life of eye cream should be 3 years.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t very moisturizing at all &amp; I have normal skin. I threw it away when only halfway through the tube. I believe Loreal has discontinued this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Awesome! After a first few tries of it I saw a huge difference under my eye. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love the metal tip, super soothing.</li>
            <li> my wife said it is good for her skin.</li>
            <li> These cream works great and love the cool metal tip!</li>
            <li> i love this eye cream, absorbs quickly, non greasy. does a better job than some creams i used that cost 4 times the price</li>
            <li> It is very light and easily absorbed. No tears or allergic reactions at all. The skin feels smmoother, softer and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see some results with continued use.</li>
            <li> It was ok didn&#x27;t really do much doesn&#x27;t work with the tip of the item. Won&#x27;t buy this again a waste of money</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to tell if it will do as it says it will. price was good and it came on time</li>
            <li> out of date,i feel very angry</li>
            <li> Nice product, you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> Good product and but you can really hardly see the difference but I was using it for only 6 weeks so I&#x27;ll give more time to see the difference.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!  This stuff really works.  It makes my eyes look so much better.  Love this stuff!!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product really does improve dark under-eye circles. It&#x27;s the first thing I&#x27;ve found that really seems to make a difference. However, it&#x27;s not much of a moisturizer (at least, it doesn&#x27;t do much for me). If it could be richer and more hydrating it would be a five-star product in my book. But if your skin is young and under-eye circles are your main concern, I think it really helps.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal has always been well known for their skin products.  Good under eye serum and moisurizers</li>
            <li> I like the applicator, it feels cool on your skin. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to confirm the claims of less wrinkles etc</li>
            <li> This is first time use it ,I like it!</li>
