            <li>I am excited to have received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It is getting better, but I am going to have to be more patient (not my strong suit) on my thumbs.  </li>
            <li>I did receive this product at a discount, however the options in this review are true and my own.</li>
            <li>Fast mailing service, &amp; sincerely concerned product seller that really knows they have provided a very, very, wonderful product to &amp; for you.</li>

            <li>I used the emu oil on my chin for acne and the dry skin on my face and it worked great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had excellent results on a dry patch on one of my elbows.</li>
            <li>really feels good.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh emu oil.  </li>
            <li>Right now, 4 stars might be most appropriate as &amp;#34;liking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much for making such a great product!</li>
            <li>and I am noticing a difference on my face and neck in that it stays well moisturized and seems to help with fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>but there is definitely a huge difference in consistency.</li>
            <li>But, a huge difference in my hands, nails &amp; cuticles.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and would probably work on all hair textures.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product.  </li>
            <li>It feels lightly greasy when you rub it on</li>
            <li>I have read a lot about the benefits of Emu oil and have to say so far so good.</li>
            <li>Got it for a couple days, so far so good.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!!!  </li>
            <li>So made a blend of this emu oil with jojoba and for the first time ever, he is healing and his skin looks much better.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that it will work when I get it rubbed into the exact area of discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light with no scent and easy to put on damp skin right after the shower.</li>
            <li>Oil has a great consistency, and goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li>It might prove more cost effective than having to deal with the occasional leakage issues.</li>
            <li>Also great for any dry skin, cuts, scrapes, burn or scars.  </li>
            <li>I will gladly change my review if I see any positive changes.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to be able to use Emu Oil, and so far I&#x27;m loving it in my recipes.</li>
            <li>I can honestly compare it to another, but with the great prices of the company, I&#x27;m able to purchase new additives for my small business.</li>
            <li>I like that this product is 100% pure, and safe for use on skin.</li>
            <li>They even sent me a full product pdf via email.</li>
            <li>and I am a true believer.  </li>
            <li>This oil is quite thick and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Have used it on my dry and cracked hands and see a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li>And other great brands of emu oil for 3 years</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and pains, quickly.</li>
            <li>the company quickly replaced it.</li>
            <li>It helps with the irritation and overall am very satisfied with product.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised at how big the pump was and thought that it would dispense too much but to my surprise it was perfect.</li>
            <li>good for my dry skin</li>
            <li>Guess what, the body wins over the&lt;br /&gt;mind. &amp;#34;Ouch&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil is kind of thick and feels nice on skin...</li>
            <li>I also rubbed some onto a fresh contusion on my leg that was bruised and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own and as a carrier oil for healing essential oil formulations.</li>
            <li>Next time i&#x27;ll get him his own bottle.</li>
            <li>Great product definitely helped clear up my piercings.</li>
            <li>Love the size of the bottle and a great asset in making products with other essential oils....</li>
            <li>Emu oil soaks into my scalp right away and helps my aches</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, if you use the right amount.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering each of them a bottle right now they share</li>
            <li>Just the right weight.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, or under other moisturizers for anti-aging and excellent long lasting moisture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Emu Oil Pure Premium Golden Powerful Skin and Hair Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>As for the product, I love it , the pump is great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>They ship very fast also....</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for a stellar product!</li>
            <li>I use it after bathing to seal in moisture and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>and I recently bought and are currently working on (and doing most of&lt;br /&gt;the work ourselves as is mostly cosmetic) restoration of a home built in 1892 in&lt;</li>
            <li>I use this oil on my face &amp; neck daily and LOVE the results.</li>
            <li>The pic is of me on day 3 of using the oil (in hot, humid weather....</li>
            <li>This is my first time using emu oil</li>
            <li>I use it to speed recovery from bruising, I am a cross-fitter  and manage to get pretty bruised up during my workouts I have been applying the Emu oil to my bruises and the seem to heal with in about a week.  </li>
            <li>It is a must have for our first aid kits and cupboard in the house and the barn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, communication was great, the company was nice enough to forward me extra instructions with usage information, seems to be a wide variety of uses.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture and not too oily!</li>
            <li>No odor, very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much and please do not ever discontinue this product!</li>
            <li>we do enjoy working on the home even more, with less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve only had this product for 1 week, I&#x27;ve not really noticed any wrinkles or fine lines disappearing YET !!!</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this package because I have paid way more for less amount of emu oil that claimed to be 100%.</li>
            <li>:) my hair is usually super frizzy and this oil tones it down.</li>
            <li>It does exactly as you say and the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>I mix it with pure aloe vera and use it on my face morning and night.  </li>
            <li>When arrived damaged ( large crack in the bottle)</li>
            <li>I used it in a sunscreen and have been using it on a large scar on my chest from surgery.</li>
            <li>I am mixed white and black, so this is perfect for my hair type.</li>
            <li>Not too thick like most other oil products and very smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is HUGE and will last forever.</li>
            <li>~ thanks &amp; good-day ~</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It came really fast which is a plus</li>
            <li>We did not think the home needed so much &#x27;attention&#x27; until we began&lt;br</li>
            <li>this anyone who wants to try an hopes helps others as well as did</li>
            <li>Anything can be greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>I just got it, so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to really put it to the test, but I did use it on my arms, legs and chest.  </li>
            <li>It is really a win-win.</li>
            <li>and I am really liking it.  </li>
            <li>but i try not to use to much.</li>
            <li>A luxurious, very high-quality texture.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helping heal the muscles and scars.</li>
            <li>my scars are healing really well</li>
            <li>This products really work my mom who is 81 used it on her knee with</li>
            <li>As I enter my 7th decade, this keeps my skin supple and whole.</li>
            <li>I use it straight and in my skin care products.</li>
            <li>I ordered this Emu oil because I have read so much about</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I will be ordering another bottle so that I can add some of it to my lotions.  </li>
            <li>but it coats very will.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it does not have a scent so that I can add it to my other moisture products.  </li>
            <li>I have read that Emu oil penetrates deeper into the skin and if used on top of your regular lotion, it will help that product penetrate past the epidermis producing greater benefits.  </li>
            <li>I have a small rash on my foot that it has made so much better!</li>
            <li>I use it daily and my skin looks and feels so rich</li>
            <li>We thought that both of us being retired and bored it would be a great&lt;br /&gt;idea and the northwest part of Arkansas we found to be so beautiful.</li>
            <li>We have a friend who produces his own and is usually my supplier.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast, but because the package sat for several  hours in the hot July sun, there was some leakage onto the label.</li>
            <li>and I use it mainly on my face as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I highly anticipate quality results from this oil.</li>
            <li>In all likelihood it is a result of auto immune disease and for two years I&#x27;ve used powerful steroid creams and various creams with no impact.</li>
            <li>The bottle was broken I don&#x27;t is good</li>
            <li>Makes your hands so very soft.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>Put on a pair of socks and you won&#x27;t believe how soft your feet feel in the morning!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The oil is nice and slippery and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;shampoo was always very effective and did slow down considerably the hair loss</li>
            <li>it seems like a lovely moisturizer for those hard winter months.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin noticeably soft and</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m rather using it in a  natural formula for fading spider-veins in my legs.</li>
            <li>this heals it completely.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>often tells our bodies, &amp;#34;You are too old for this.&amp;#34;  Our mind though says</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used it enough to notice if there are any benefits to it yet.</li>
            <li>As a lady who has natural hair (type 4), I use a lot of oils.</li>
            <li>I have recently been rubbing it on my underarm stretch marks and my skin feels much tighter also.</li>
            <li>I use the emu oil on my scalp and naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to report on growth, however I will be purchasing this item again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally natural this oil penetrate my hair</li>
            <li>I even use it on my 3 year old scraps when she fall this</li>
            <li>so far even used it on my daughters skin.</li>
            <li>I like the pump bottle which makes application, especially after showering much easier.  </li>
            <li>Wow, in three days it changed completely.</li>
            <li>Since many of the reviews said the oil was extremely thick</li>
            <li>The other brand is much thicker and this one is thinner and much runnier.</li>
            <li>oil absorbed easier into our skin somehow than other Emu oils</li>
            <li>(getting older is a challange) a some pain with inflammation on my two middle toes, what the heck, it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase as it also makes my skin vibrant too.</li>
            <li>For the ones that are skeptical, it truly does work and usually I never write comments unless it is very worth doing so!!</li>
            <li>I got this because i am pregs and new that i would have back pain.</li>
            <li>The bottle neck was shrink-wrapped and the bottle itself was wrapped in styrofoam, so no other items in the box were affected.</li>
            <li>I had bought this to help fight dark marks (and Jamaican Black castor Oil for my edges) but the products just happened to work better &amp;</li>
            <li>You can depress it fully for a squirt, or just slightly for a single drop, which is handy for treating bug bites, scars and such.</li>
            <li>After one week of daily putting the Emu Oil on the spots they have almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong or unpleasant scent, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant subtle scent and not too thick</li>
            <li>The oil is very dense, a little hard to smooth it out on the skin.</li>
            <li>some with great success and others left my hair feeling awful.</li>
            <li>have 2 young children and find that I wash my hands all the time, leaving them dry and looking scaly.</li>
            <li>Have not used it long enough to give a complete review, stars may stay or some may fizzle.</li>
            <li>It is slightly thicker, and feels somehow more greasy, but not in a negative way.</li>
            <li>kids got a little too much sun while snorkeling last week, so mixed up some different oils for their skin.</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that my skin in that area is so much more moisturized  than the rest of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> It is better to me for night use.</li>

            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with quick shipping.</li>
            <li> again, I think I might get very excited if that fading should continue.</li>
            <li> I am excited to have received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It is getting better, but I am going to have to be more patient (not my strong suit) on my thumbs.  </li>
            <li> I did receive this product at a discount, however the options in this review are true and my own.</li>
            <li> Fast mailing service, &amp; sincerely concerned product seller that really knows they have provided a very, very, wonderful product to &amp; for you.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful on my skin, and my daughter who has very long curly hair loves using it on her curls.</li>
            <li> I used the emu oil on my chin for acne and the dry skin on my face and it worked great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had excellent results on a dry patch on one of my elbows.</li>
            <li> really feels good.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh emu oil.  </li>
            <li> Right now, 4 stars might be most appropriate as &amp;#34;liking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very much for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> and I am noticing a difference on my face and neck in that it stays well moisturized and seems to help with fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> but there is definitely a huge difference in consistency.</li>
            <li> But, a huge difference in my hands, nails &amp; cuticles.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and would probably work on all hair textures.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product.  </li>
            <li> It feels lightly greasy when you rub it on</li>
            <li> I have read a lot about the benefits of Emu oil and have to say so far so good.</li>
            <li> Got it for a couple days, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!!!  </li>
            <li> So made a blend of this emu oil with jojoba and for the first time ever, he is healing and his skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that it will work when I get it rubbed into the exact area of discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is light with no scent and easy to put on damp skin right after the shower.</li>
            <li> Oil has a great consistency, and goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> It might prove more cost effective than having to deal with the occasional leakage issues.</li>
            <li> Also great for any dry skin, cuts, scrapes, burn or scars.  </li>
            <li> I will gladly change my review if I see any positive changes.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to be able to use Emu Oil, and so far I&#x27;m loving it in my recipes.</li>
            <li> I can honestly compare it to another, but with the great prices of the company, I&#x27;m able to purchase new additives for my small business.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is 100% pure, and safe for use on skin.</li>
            <li> They even sent me a full product pdf via email.</li>
            <li> and I am a true believer.  </li>
            <li> This oil is quite thick and wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Have used it on my dry and cracked hands and see a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li> And other great brands of emu oil for 3 years</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and pains, quickly.</li>
            <li> the company quickly replaced it.</li>
            <li> It helps with the irritation and overall am very satisfied with product.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised at how big the pump was and thought that it would dispense too much but to my surprise it was perfect.</li>
            <li> good for my dry skin</li>
            <li> Guess what, the body wins over the&lt;br /&gt;mind. &amp;#34;Ouch&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil is kind of thick and feels nice on skin...</li>
            <li> I also rubbed some onto a fresh contusion on my leg that was bruised and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own and as a carrier oil for healing essential oil formulations.</li>
            <li> Next time i&#x27;ll get him his own bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product definitely helped clear up my piercings.</li>
            <li> Love the size of the bottle and a great asset in making products with other essential oils....</li>
            <li> Emu oil soaks into my scalp right away and helps my aches</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, if you use the right amount.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering each of them a bottle right now they share</li>
            <li> Just the right weight.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, or under other moisturizers for anti-aging and excellent long lasting moisture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Emu Oil Pure Premium Golden Powerful Skin and Hair Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As for the product, I love it , the pump is great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They ship very fast also....</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for a stellar product!</li>
            <li> I use it after bathing to seal in moisture and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> and I recently bought and are currently working on (and doing most of&lt;br /&gt;the work ourselves as is mostly cosmetic) restoration of a home built in 1892 in&lt;</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my face &amp; neck daily and LOVE the results.</li>
            <li> The pic is of me on day 3 of using the oil (in hot, humid weather....</li>
            <li> This is my first time using emu oil</li>
            <li> I use it to speed recovery from bruising, I am a cross-fitter  and manage to get pretty bruised up during my workouts I have been applying the Emu oil to my bruises and the seem to heal with in about a week.  </li>
            <li> It is a must have for our first aid kits and cupboard in the house and the barn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, communication was great, the company was nice enough to forward me extra instructions with usage information, seems to be a wide variety of uses.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and not too oily!</li>
            <li> No odor, very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much and please do not ever discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> we do enjoy working on the home even more, with less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only had this product for 1 week, I&#x27;ve not really noticed any wrinkles or fine lines disappearing YET !!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this package because I have paid way more for less amount of emu oil that claimed to be 100%.</li>
            <li> :) my hair is usually super frizzy and this oil tones it down.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as you say and the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> I mix it with pure aloe vera and use it on my face morning and night.  </li>
            <li> When arrived damaged ( large crack in the bottle)</li>
            <li> I used it in a sunscreen and have been using it on a large scar on my chest from surgery.</li>
            <li> I am mixed white and black, so this is perfect for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Not too thick like most other oil products and very smooth and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is HUGE and will last forever.</li>
            <li> ~ thanks &amp; good-day ~</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It came really fast which is a plus</li>
            <li> We did not think the home needed so much &#x27;attention&#x27; until we began&lt;br</li>
            <li> this anyone who wants to try an hopes helps others as well as did</li>
            <li> Anything can be greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li> I just got it, so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to really put it to the test, but I did use it on my arms, legs and chest.  </li>
            <li> It is really a win-win.</li>
            <li> and I am really liking it.  </li>
            <li> but i try not to use to much.</li>
            <li> A luxurious, very high-quality texture.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really helping heal the muscles and scars.</li>
            <li> my scars are healing really well</li>
            <li> This products really work my mom who is 81 used it on her knee with</li>
            <li> As I enter my 7th decade, this keeps my skin supple and whole.</li>
            <li> I use it straight and in my skin care products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Emu oil because I have read so much about</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I will be ordering another bottle so that I can add some of it to my lotions.  </li>
            <li> but it coats very will.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it does not have a scent so that I can add it to my other moisture products.  </li>
            <li> I have read that Emu oil penetrates deeper into the skin and if used on top of your regular lotion, it will help that product penetrate past the epidermis producing greater benefits.  </li>
            <li> I have a small rash on my foot that it has made so much better!</li>
            <li> I use it daily and my skin looks and feels so rich</li>
            <li> We thought that both of us being retired and bored it would be a great&lt;br /&gt;idea and the northwest part of Arkansas we found to be so beautiful.</li>
            <li> We have a friend who produces his own and is usually my supplier.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast, but because the package sat for several  hours in the hot July sun, there was some leakage onto the label.</li>
            <li> and I use it mainly on my face as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I highly anticipate quality results from this oil.</li>
            <li> In all likelihood it is a result of auto immune disease and for two years I&#x27;ve used powerful steroid creams and various creams with no impact.</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken I don&#x27;t is good</li>
            <li> Makes your hands so very soft.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> Put on a pair of socks and you won&#x27;t believe how soft your feet feel in the morning!  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The oil is nice and slippery and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;shampoo was always very effective and did slow down considerably the hair loss</li>
            <li> it seems like a lovely moisturizer for those hard winter months.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin noticeably soft and</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m rather using it in a  natural formula for fading spider-veins in my legs.</li>
            <li> this heals it completely.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> often tells our bodies, &amp;#34;You are too old for this.&amp;#34;  Our mind though says</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it enough to notice if there are any benefits to it yet.</li>
            <li> As a lady who has natural hair (type 4), I use a lot of oils.</li>
            <li> I have recently been rubbing it on my underarm stretch marks and my skin feels much tighter also.</li>
            <li> I use the emu oil on my scalp and naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to report on growth, however I will be purchasing this item again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally natural this oil penetrate my hair</li>
            <li> I even use it on my 3 year old scraps when she fall this</li>
            <li> so far even used it on my daughters skin.</li>
            <li> I like the pump bottle which makes application, especially after showering much easier.  </li>
            <li> Wow, in three days it changed completely.</li>
            <li> Since many of the reviews said the oil was extremely thick</li>
            <li> The other brand is much thicker and this one is thinner and much runnier.</li>
            <li> oil absorbed easier into our skin somehow than other Emu oils</li>
            <li> (getting older is a challange) a some pain with inflammation on my two middle toes, what the heck, it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase as it also makes my skin vibrant too.</li>
            <li> For the ones that are skeptical, it truly does work and usually I never write comments unless it is very worth doing so!!</li>
            <li> I got this because i am pregs and new that i would have back pain.</li>
            <li> The bottle neck was shrink-wrapped and the bottle itself was wrapped in styrofoam, so no other items in the box were affected.</li>
            <li> I had bought this to help fight dark marks (and Jamaican Black castor Oil for my edges) but the products just happened to work better &amp;</li>
            <li> You can depress it fully for a squirt, or just slightly for a single drop, which is handy for treating bug bites, scars and such.</li>
            <li> After one week of daily putting the Emu Oil on the spots they have almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong or unpleasant scent, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant subtle scent and not too thick</li>
            <li> The oil is very dense, a little hard to smooth it out on the skin.</li>
            <li> some with great success and others left my hair feeling awful.</li>
            <li> have 2 young children and find that I wash my hands all the time, leaving them dry and looking scaly.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to give a complete review, stars may stay or some may fizzle.</li>
            <li> It is slightly thicker, and feels somehow more greasy, but not in a negative way.</li>
            <li> kids got a little too much sun while snorkeling last week, so mixed up some different oils for their skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich &amp; thick!</li>
            <li> The first one was about little more than half full when I got it, they sent another, the other wasn&#x27;t as bad but still leaked oil.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but it really penetrates the skin well and leaves my face</li>
            <li> My hair is natural, but I assume it would work with other hair, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American women  and have grown my hair very long with the help of emu oil</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s emu oil, but it very well could be.</li>
            <li> The product has a long shelf life so it will last you forerver.  </li>
            <li> now I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 year and use emu oil as a everyday oil</li>
            <li> Mixed well with my other ingredients.</li>
            <li> The texture is different than other oils I have used.</li>
            <li> I use it for my dry skin on backs of my arms.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my dry skin on my legs as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my dry hands in the Winter too.</li>
            <li> I also have used it to help my daughter dry skin from the weather we have been having and the swimming in the pools and lakes.  </li>
            <li> It works well against my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with what I am seeing so far.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry skin</li>
            <li> but the oil I received is clear, there isn&#x27;t even a white tint to it, and I extremely thin.</li>
            <li> I put the mixture on them twice that day, once before going to bed, and in the morning neither one was even pink anymore.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Emu Oil for a few days on my face (under my makeup).....</li>
            <li> Used on my scalp to heal some dry patches, works but be careful as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> AromaOils Emu Oil was a last ditch effort to try to fix my dry, dark and ashy elbow that I have tried everything on from high end, extremely expensive designer creams, to exfoliating peels on.</li>
            <li> just a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Just remember, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As always, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Have only applied this formula for past 3 days  (consisting of witch hazel, horsetail oil, topped with 2 drops of the Emu oil rubbed onto the other 2 on my legs) - -and</li>
            <li> barely helped relieve lately the aches and pains we had from overworking our&lt;</li>
            <li> Emu oil, from my experience with it, usually thicker and yellowish white.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to help diminish my stretch marks on my stomach, due to childbirth and also to use on my face to maintain my youthful appearance,  </li>
            <li> I add a small pump to my facial moisturizer every morning and evening.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it has something to do with with how its processed who knows, but I will use this to take down my twists since its lighter and use the other thicker brand when I want to seal the moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t like moisturizers and especially oils because they feel heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> However, the oil I received is thin and clear.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or give it a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> My hands are extremely chapped, and applying a few drops of this oil softened and soothed them.  </li>
            <li> After&lt;br /&gt;one shampoo, much less hair in my comb.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;bodies, as we typically do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have already noticed a little fading, so</li>
            <li> but it leaked a little on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It had leaked a little during shipping.</li>
            <li> too a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> it takes away the inflammation in a few mins.</li>
            <li> Even after washing a few times, you can still feel the benefits.</li>
            <li> seemed to help, only make it worse.</li>
            <li> It is not to heavy</li>
            <li> This is a very thin clear oil.</li>
            <li> , I hate when I am working on my computer and my hands feel tight and dry, and this oil has completely fixed this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps with muscle aches as I put this on my husband after a bad muscle cramp in his leg.</li>
            <li> I have purchased in the past years for shampoos and&lt;br /&gt;conditioners</li>
            <li> I said, I have used Emu oil in the past.</li>
            <li> And in the past, I had bought&lt;br /&gt;concentrate, like this product, and when I applied to my scalp the oil just sat&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> Not sure if it changes its effectiveness but both claim to be 100%.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed ;)</li>
            <li> To thin out a thicker oil like castor oil you would usually use a lighter carrier to think it out and make it less thick and that is what this one reminds of.</li>
            <li> my leg has been hurting me lately.</li>
            <li> Reviews here have also stated that this oil was thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure if Emu Oil should be thick or thin</li>
            <li> but if it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll conclude its fake and rate it down.</li>
            <li> Received it leaking and half empty :(</li>
            <li> This oil is very thick and odorless.</li>
            <li> Emu oil is VERY expensive.  </li>
            <li> I used coconut oil as a base, adding the emu oil, some vitamin E oil, and some jojoba.</li>
            <li> but I rank this oil as number one!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used the emu oil on my chin for acne and the dry skin on my face and it worked great!</li>
            <li> nice product, makes my skin smoother and softer</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Very pleased with purchase, price and quality.  Very pleased with quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs quickly into my skin.  I use it on my face.  It leaves my skin noticeably soft and moisturised.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it does not have a scent so that I can add it to my other moisture products.  I&#x27;ve used it on my scalp before washing and my scalp and hair appear cleaner.  I plan on applying to a sore shoulder to see it helps.</li>
            <li> This has become a favorite in our house. It feels wonderful on my skin, and my daughter who has very long curly hair loves using it on her curls.</li>
            <li> Received it leaking and half empty :( All in all good oil. I do like Aromaoils and the deals they have. I use as a moisturizer just a little goes a long way but theres tons of uses for it.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because I havent&#x27; tried the oil alone yet</li>
            <li> This oil is very thick and odorless. It&#x27;s a good sealant and moisturizer. I use it after bathing to seal in moisture and it leaves my skin soft and smooth. I would recommend emu oil especially in the winter time and during pregnancy on stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to be able to use Emu Oil, and so far I&#x27;m loving it in my recipes. I can honestly compare it to another, but with the great prices of the company, I&#x27;m able to purchase new additives for my small business. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Giving this item 5 stars ahead of time, because I think I&#x27;m going to be more pleased with some results as time moves along. ..Right now, 4 stars might be most appropriate as &amp;#34;liking&amp;#34; this product, but because I&#x27;m not needing to use it for a pain-relieving rub (thankfully)- - I&#x27;m rather using it in a  natural formula for fading spider-veins in my legs. Have only applied this formula for past 3 days  (consisting of witch hazel, horsetail oil, topped with 2 drops of the Emu oil rubbed onto the other 2 on my legs) - -and have already noticed a little fading, so again, I think I might get very excited if that fading should continue. Another reason for the 5 stars is because I&#x27;m very pleased with the distributor of this product who shipped it in good condition in quick timing, and has also offered helpful bonus coupons. ~ thanks &amp; good-day ~</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not too thick like most other oil products and very smooth and easy to apply.  I would have given it 5 stars except that I received the product with some oil spilled on the label.  You can do better on packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my parents and they love it!!</li>
            <li> Oh how I love Emu oil. This is  a great deal for  a quality product.  The healing properties of the emu oil is WONDERFUL.  Check it out on the web and see all the ways you an use this  oil.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!  I use it for my dry skin on backs of my arms. Also, my nose dries out &amp; gets red...this heals it completely. I have been using it on my dry skin on my legs as well. I put some in my palms of hands &amp; massaged my scalp...really feels good. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Arrived promptly. Noticed immediate change in eye area. My son has eczema. So made a blend of this emu oil with jojoba and for the first time ever, he is healing and his skin looks much better. Will buy this regularly.</li>
            <li> Love this Emu Oil.  Makes my hair soft, shiny and manageable. Works wonders!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a friend undergoing radiation therapy and was told using Emu Oil would protect the skin at the site of the treatment.  It helps with the irritation and overall am very satisfied with product.  Have used it on my dry and cracked hands and see a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li> I got mine last week and I love this stuff. I have some scars on my legs and it sure makes them feel better, I can&#x27;t wait to see if it will also reduce some of the scars. I also use it on my scalp and hair before I shampoo and it makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> I just recently received my AromaOils Emu Oil.  This oil is amazing!  I use it when applying oils as a change.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Along with a Derma Roller, this product is working miracles at helping to restore more bald edges which have diminished after years of over processing. I had bought this to help fight dark marks (and Jamaican Black castor Oil for my edges) but the products just happened to work better &amp;#34;for me&amp;#34; in the reverse manner. I also use the emu oil soap, however, and it is the Best beauty regimen I&#x27;ve ever used on my face</li>
            <li> very good product, easy application</li>
            <li> I got this because i am pregs and new that i would have back pain. I am a massage therapist and have used this on one of my clients that has plantar fascitis. It worked wonders for her. As soon as i put this on my aching back and feet it takes away the inflammation in a few mins. LOVE this product and will def be purchasing more. Thank you so much for a stellar product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now.  I mix it with pure aloe vera and use it on my face morning and night.  It&#x27;s a very nice oil and I am noticing a difference on my face and neck in that it stays well moisturized and seems to help with fine lines and wrinkles.  Good quality product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good stuff well priced</li>
            <li> Love the Emu Oil - does not leave a greasy feeling and hydrates my skin perfectly.  Package was received on time and was well wrapped to prevent any damage.  Will purchase again as it has been beneficial with my excezma.</li>
            <li> I just got this oil. It came really fast which is a plus but it leaked a little on the bottle. Since many of the reviews said the oil was extremely thick I thought that was what I was getting but the oil I received is clear, there isn&#x27;t even a white tint to it, and I extremely thin. My olive oil is thicker than this. I will use it for about a month, and if it helps in growing my edges I&#x27;ll give it more stars but if it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;ll conclude its fake and rate it down.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff will be buying this again</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  My hands are extremely chapped, and applying a few drops of this oil softened and soothed them.  I can&#x27;t wait to incorporate it into my face lotion.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve read quite a bit about the product and I plan to use it in several recipes (arthritis rub, eczema rub, scalp tonic, and facial serum). Delivery was very fast, but because the package sat for several  hours in the hot July sun, there was some leakage onto the label. The bottle neck was shrink-wrapped and the bottle itself was wrapped in styrofoam, so no other items in the box were affected. The pump seems to work well. You can depress it fully for a squirt, or just slightly for a single drop, which is handy for treating bug bites, scars and such. Aroma Oils might wish to consider shipping their product in a bottle with a regular secure-sealing cap with the pump separate. It might prove more cost effective than having to deal with the occasional leakage issues.</li>
            <li> I have read a lot about the benefits of Emu oil and have to say so far so good. It leaves my skin feeling soft and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I have read that Emu oil penetrates deeper into the skin and if used on top of your regular lotion, it will help that product penetrate past the epidermis producing greater benefits.  This product moisturizes great without leaving my skin feeling greasy or oily. Just remember, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The advantages of this oil are amazing. I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my dry hands in the Winter too. They even sent me a full product pdf via email. Great people to do business with</li>
            <li> I love this oil!!!  It&#x27;s rich &amp; thick! Glides on with ease and coats my strains without clogging my pores as well as absorbs into my skin without that greasy feeling/look.  Shipping was fast!!!  I was away when my package arrived but was notified upon its arrival.  This product is well worth it! Not to mention, the price is perfect!!!  Emu oil is VERY expensive.  A little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Emu Oil for years. I have purchased in the past years for shampoos and&lt;br /&gt;conditioners for my occasional thinning hair that happens with stress. The&lt;br /&gt;shampoo was always very effective and did slow down considerably the hair loss&lt;br /&gt;and an added bonus I and my hairdresser noticed is that my hair grew faster. The&lt;br /&gt;cost is not inexpensive though for the shampoo and conditioner and so I decided&lt;br /&gt;to buy concentrate as is this bottle and add to my shampoo and it worked. After&lt;br /&gt;one shampoo, much less hair in my comb. My hair also looked healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I recently bought and are currently working on (and doing most of&lt;br /&gt;the work ourselves as is mostly cosmetic) restoration of a home built in 1892 in&lt;br /&gt;Arkansas. We did not think the home needed so much &#x27;attention&#x27; until we began&lt;br /&gt;the work. We thought that both of us being retired and bored it would be a great&lt;br /&gt;idea and the northwest part of Arkansas we found to be so beautiful. But the&lt;br /&gt;work has created lots of sore and achy muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving instructions on how to use Emu for aches and pains my&lt;br /&gt;husband and I immediately applied to our neck, shoulders, arms and wrist. Aspirin&lt;br /&gt;had barely helped relieve lately the aches and pains we had from overworking our&lt;br /&gt;bodies, as we typically do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 60 and my husband is 64 and so arthritis&lt;br /&gt;now often tells our bodies, &amp;#34;You are too old for this.&amp;#34;  Our mind though says&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;But I like thinking that I can do this.&amp;#34;  Guess what, the body wins over the&lt;br /&gt;mind. &amp;#34;Ouch&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will tell you my husband is very impressed with the&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;immediate&#x27; results of how fast the oil reduced his pain and stiffness after one&lt;br /&gt;application of this Emu oil. And I suffer from degenerative disc and also noticed&lt;br /&gt;lots of decrease of pain and stiffness as well after one application. We are&lt;br /&gt;both pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil absorbed easier into our skin somehow than other Emu oils I tried.&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I have used Emu oil in the past. And in the past, I had bought&lt;br /&gt;concentrate, like this product, and when I applied to my scalp the oil just sat&lt;br /&gt;on my scalp and did not absorb, so did nothing to help hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;And I had before tried for my aches and pains but did not help.&lt;br /&gt;This Emu oil soaks into my scalp right away and helps my aches&lt;br /&gt;and pains, quickly. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Emu oil has worked on my thinning hair (as the stress is&lt;br /&gt;from our home repairs, that go on and on) and now as an added bonus will relieve&lt;br /&gt;our pains and aches. I now call it &amp;#34;Our masseuse in a bottle&amp;#34; :)&lt;br /&gt;And we do enjoy working on the home even more, with less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this anyone who wants to try an hopes helps others as well as did us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meg &amp; Greg&lt;br /&gt;Eureka Springs, Arkansas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it enough to notice if there are any benefits to it yet. But I do like the consistency and the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Goes on light and makes my skin feel fantastic. Usually I don&#x27;t like moisturizers and especially oils because they feel heavy on my skin. This oil absorbs immediately and feels great. Even under makeup there is no greasy feel or look. I absolutely love this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 young children and find that I wash my hands all the time, leaving them dry and looking scaly. I have started using a couple drops of emu oil after I wash and my hands are in much better condition now, I hate when I am working on my computer and my hands feel tight and dry, and this oil has completely fixed this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids got a little too much sun while snorkeling last week, so mixed up some different oils for their skin. I used coconut oil as a base, adding the emu oil, some vitamin E oil, and some jojoba. I put the mixture on them twice that day, once before going to bed, and in the morning neither one was even pink anymore. A week later and neither one peeled except for a tiny flake or two on their noses. Great stuff!  *I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This oil smells good and works great! I use it for so many things</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of Emu Oil that I Have purchased. The other brand is much thicker and this one is thinner and much runnier. I&#x27;m honestly not sure if Emu Oil should be thick or thin but there is definitely a huge difference in consistency. Not sure if it changes its effectiveness but both claim to be 100%. To thin out a thicker oil like castor oil you would usually use a lighter carrier to think it out and make it less thick and that is what this one reminds of. Not saying that this is the case. Maybe it has something to do with with how its processed who knows, but I will use this to take down my twists since its lighter and use the other thicker brand when I want to seal the moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I can see improvement on a scar in two days.</li>
            <li> feels great what a difference</li>
            <li> great product has many uses</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, great product. Mixed well with my other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have used emu oil for many years.  We have a friend who produces his own and is usually my supplier.  However, when he has a shortage, I sometimes need to order elsewhere.  I was very happy with the quality and price of this product.  As always, a little goes a long way.  It is an excellent silky-smooth serum.  I use all over the face and neck either on it&#x27;s own, or under other moisturizers for anti-aging and excellent long lasting moisture.  Also great for any dry skin, cuts, scrapes, burn or scars.  If you are looking for an emu oil, I would definitely recommend this brand/product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !!!  Non-greasy, if you use the right amount. Anything can be greasy if you use too much. Just one pump is good for my hands, nails &amp; cuticles and then I even have to rub up into my arms. Makes your hands so very soft. Even after washing a few times, you can still feel the benefits. I&#x27;ve also been adding it to my oil concoction I use on my face every nite. Since I&#x27;ve only had this product for 1 week, I&#x27;ve not really noticed any wrinkles or fine lines disappearing YET !!! But, a huge difference in my hands, nails &amp; cuticles. It&#x27;s a great oil, buy it ... you won&#x27;t be disappointed ;)</li>
            <li> I love this Emu Oil. The bottle is HUGE and will last forever. I was a bit surprised at how big the pump was and thought that it would dispense too much but to my surprise it was perfect. I use this oil on my face &amp; neck daily and LOVE the results. A little goes a long way, but it really penetrates the skin well and leaves my face so soft.&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I purchased this in the first place is because I have 2 small patches of eczema on my scalp, I have been applying a tiny bit to each spot twice a day and I am amazed at how well this is clearing up. This bottle will probably last quite a while but I will defiantly be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I just got it, so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to really put it to the test, but I did use it on my arms, legs and chest.  It was odorless, and absorbed nicely - two pluses!  It had leaked a little during shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Seems to make my hair more manageable. I will buy it again when I run out! Great stuff:) my hair is usually super frizzy and this oil tones it down. I expect it to help even more after I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and my hair gets healthier. I am mixed white and black, so this is perfect for my hair type. The pic is of me on day 3 of using the oil (in hot, humid weather.... So it&#x27;s doing well!). My hair is natural, but I assume it would work with other hair, too.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have a small rash on my foot that it has made so much better! I bet in a week it will be gone!</li>
            <li> This is a very, very light weight oil. Used on my scalp to heal some dry patches, works but be careful as a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve been having some hip pain (getting older is a challange) a some pain with inflammation on my two middle toes, what the heck, it can&#x27;t hurt. Voila, it has almost disappeared in four days!!  I am also trying it on some arthritis pain in my thumbs.  It is getting better, but I am going to have to be more patient (not my strong suit) on my thumbs.  All in all, a good product at a good price and a wonderful company to work with.</li>
            <li> I amusing it on a poison parsnip rash and it promotes the healing process very nicely.</li>
            <li> Great customer service.  Great products.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great price and great shipping, to go along with a great product...the tri-fecta!!</li>
            <li> This oil is great, LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love emu oil. It has so many uses, and it is so moisturizing! I like that this product is 100% pure, and safe for use on skin. I use it on both my hair and skin as soon as I get out of the shower. It does not have a strong or unpleasant scent, and absorbs quickly. The texture is different than other oils I have used. It is slightly thicker, and feels somehow more greasy, but not in a negative way. This is a nice sized bottle, and a nice product. It is really a win-win. I plan to keep some emu oil around for any emergencies (muscle pain, scars, inflammation...). I received a discount to review this product, but I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> As a lady who has natural hair (type 4), I use a lot of oils. some with great success and others left my hair feeling awful. This is my first time using emu oil but I have read about its many benefits. This oil is odorless and is not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; at all, if that makes any sense. It&#x27;s light and would probably work on all hair textures. It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or give it a greasy feel. I plan to also try this as my nighttime face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this package because I have paid way more for less amount of emu oil that claimed to be 100%. Emu oil, from my experience with it, usually thicker and yellowish white. Reviews here have also stated that this oil was thick. Which is why I purchased. However, the oil I received is thin and clear. There is nothing on the packaging that convinces me that this is even in fact emu oil. Im going use it and will post my updated results if any. I will gladly change my review if I see any positive changes.</li>
            <li> I had used a cosmetic that burned my face and nothing I&lt;br /&gt;used  seemed to help, only make it worse. So I thought of the Emu Oil and it&lt;br /&gt;took away  the dryness, pealing skin in only three days. It works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Emu Oil for about a month now and I am really liking it.  I use it to speed recovery from bruising, I am a cross-fitter  and manage to get pretty bruised up during my workouts I have been applying the Emu oil to my bruises and the seem to heal with in about a week.  I have recently been rubbing it on my underarm stretch marks and my skin feels much tighter also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had excellent results on a dry patch on one of my elbows. In all likelihood it is a result of auto immune disease and for two years I&#x27;ve used powerful steroid creams and various creams with no impact. After one week of daily putting the Emu Oil on the spots they have almost completely disappeared.We use it on our dogs and horses on their scrapes and scratches and see excellent results for them as well. It is a must have for our first aid kits and cupboard in the house and the barn.</li>
            <li> Received emu oil with no problems.  I love emu oil and I use it mainly on my face as a moisturizer.  This oil is kind of thick and feels nice on skin...Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it, it leaves my hair oily but i try not to use to much. Still giving more time to see if i see any hair growth</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Emu oil and am very,  very happy with it.  It is so great for my skin and arthritis problems.  I will be purchasing more!!</li>
            <li> I use the emu oil on my scalp and naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I just received my oil yesterday and I can&#x27;t stop using it. I purchased it to help diminish my stretch marks on my stomach, due to childbirth and also to use on my face to maintain my youthful appearance,  lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unaware of its healing properties when I bought it, but upon doing additional research, I learned that it helps with aches and pains. I went into overdrive, rubbing it on my hips, knees, back and neck.  I also rubbed some onto a fresh contusion on my leg that was bruised and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up this morning, there was no more pain anywhere except my hips, but I&#x27;m thinking that I just didn&#x27;t rub it into the exact area of pain.  I&#x27;m not discouraged, though!  I&#x27;m confident that it will work when I get it rubbed into the exact area of discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> love this product. When arrived damaged ( large crack in the bottle) the company quickly replaced it. A+ for them.  As for the product, I love it , the pump is great and a little goes a long way. I used it in a sunscreen and have been using it on a large scar on my chest from surgery. While its not making the scar go away it is softening it up and easing alot of the skin tightness and the pain with the pulling skin. I also have used it to help my daughter dry skin from the weather we have been having and the swimming in the pools and lakes.  I did receive this product at a discount, however the options in this review are true and my own. However I would buy this product at full price once i run out!!</li>
            <li> Have heard about this product from my niece. Used it for the first time last night. Love the feeling on my skin! Thanks for allowing us to see all the great ways in which we can use it.</li>
            <li> my skin has never been softer... love it</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful texture. Just a very beautiful texture. The highest quality emu oil I&#x27;ve ever found. Fast mailing service, &amp; sincerely concerned product seller that really knows they have provided a very, very, wonderful product to &amp; for you. A luxurious, very high-quality texture.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great you checked in&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t change my reviwe when I went back,&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product several times a day because it works!!!&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s all that matters 😀😀😀&lt;br /&gt;About to order again,</li>
            <li> It works well against my dry scalp. I mixed some on my shampoo and codintioner as well</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Got it for a couple days, so far so good. The oil is very dense, a little hard to smooth it out on the skin. So I add it in my body lotion to make it easier to put on the skin evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on an injury I have and it&#x27;s really helping heal the muscles and scars. Great product.  Update: my scars are healing really well and it healed my athletes foot that I&#x27;ve tried every over the counter med on with no result. I love this oil!</li>
            <li> Great product It feels great on the skin.  Issues with a leaky bottle but the company took care of me and sent another ASAP. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product and respect the honesty of the makers. It&#x27;s refreshing to order an oil that&#x27;s authentic and top quality! Thank you- I will be ordering more! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
            <li> Great quality, super moisturizing/healing.</li>
            <li> my leg has been hurting me lately. I rub the Emu Oil on my leg and the pain is gone. Love it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great oil. Love having it on hand.</li>
            <li> Love-Love this Oil...it should be something everyone keep on hand. It is good for so-so many things!!!</li>
            <li> This oil has been incredible.  It helped eliminate leg cramps and muscle spasms and I am a true believer.  This is a &amp;#34;must-have&amp;#34; oil and will be a part of my core oils from now on.</li>
            <li> Oil has a great consistency, and goes a very long way.  It leaves my skin moisturized and soft.  I am finding multiple uses for the oil, both on it&#x27;s own and as a carrier oil for healing essential oil formulations. I am so happy to have found this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many emu oils but I rank this oil as number one!  After only using it for a couple days, I can see a difference in the appearance of wrinkles on my face and neck.  I also use this on my feet after using a pumice stone in the shower.  Put on a pair of socks and you won&#x27;t believe how soft your feet feel in the morning!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> works great on hemoroids</li>
            <li> This products really work my mom who is 81 used it on her knee with in two days she noticed a difference I did not tell her anything about the oil  so my husband who had a stroke and has a lot of back pain used it he too saw a difference in a couple of day.  I plan on ordering each of them a bottle right now they share</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my emu oil. It has a pleasant subtle scent and not too thick so it doesn&#x27;t need a carrier oil. Shipping was fast, communication was great, the company was nice enough to forward me extra instructions with usage information, seems to be a wide variety of uses. It&#x27;s too early to report on growth, however I will be purchasing this item again it seems like a lovely moisturizer for those hard winter months.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel like silk</li>
            <li> As I enter my 7th decade, this keeps my skin supple and whole. Good for injuries, too!</li>
            <li> Love the size of the bottle and a great asset in making products with other essential oils....</li>
            <li> Love it... As described leaves skin smooth not greasy! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> excellent service!  Product is nice!</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken I don&#x27;t is good o but the product, I lost my money</li>
            <li> This oil is quite thick and wonderful.  I love the feeling of it on my skin.  I use this on my face to help fight aging.  I will be using it in my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product. So great for skin. Just the right weight. Absorbs quickly and makes your skin feel wonderful. I use it straight and in my skin care products. Love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Emu oil because I have read so much about it&#x27;s beneficial properties to assist in scar healing.  I have only been using this product for a few days so I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in the appearance of my scar but I have noticed that my skin in that area is so much more moisturized  than the rest of my skin.  I knew that the emu oil is a great moisturizer so I appreciate the added benefit.  I like it so much that I will be ordering another bottle so that I can add some of it to my lotions.  The oil is nice and slippery and a little goes a long way.  The product has a long shelf life so it will last you forerver.  I am excited to have received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This emu oil has been used for insect bites, rashes and in hair.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh emu oil.  It is great for sunburns.  This bottle is very nice and the top allows you to leave the lid on while dispensing the oil.  Overall, a great product.  We always keep some around the house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Emu Oil for a few days on my face (under my makeup)..... I have had several compliments of how my skin is glowing.... I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great Quality! My knee pain is decreasing</li>
            <li> Wow!  I had never heard of Emu oil. Amazed at what it is used for.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It made my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally natural this oil penetrate my hair would deff order again great on skin as well</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry skin I used this oil for her arms and they began to heal within a week. It is not to heavy but it coats very will. It is better to me for night use.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture and not too oily! Will let you know more, since i just started using it! Also, my husband loves the way it feels on his skin, so now i have to be sharing! Next time i&#x27;ll get him his own bottle.</li>
            <li> What a great product. I have never used Emu oil but have heard so many great things about it. I can&#x27;t wait to try this out on my face. I like the pump bottle too a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I highly anticipate quality results from this oil. Have not used it long enough to give a complete review, stars may stay or some may fizzle.</li>
            <li> It really helps with muscle aches as I put this on my husband after a bad muscle cramp in his leg. Yes this is a great product and I will be ordering more. This is my second purchase as it also makes my skin vibrant too. Received several compliments on my glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product for a week now and I don&#x27;t see any progress . I am not satisfied with what I am seeing so far.</li>
            <li> Awesome oil for damaged skin. I was expecting a greasy feeling but this oil is not greasy at all.  It leaves your skin looking nourished and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is a very thin clear oil. I&#x27;ve been buying Emu Oil Pure Premium Golden Powerful Skin and Hair Moisturizer. And other great brands of emu oil for 3 years now I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 year and use emu oil as a everyday oil I&#x27;m an African American women  and have grown my hair very long with the help of emu oil I even use it on my 3 year old scraps when she fall this I can truly say is to oily for emu oil it feels more like I&#x27;m putting avocado oil or grape seed oil in my hair&lt;br /&gt;That the last time I put a cheaper brand in my hair.</li>
            <li> very nice product i will buy many more bottles</li>
            <li> I use Aromaoils Emu Oil to make whipped body butter great for you skin. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This product is great. This oil is not scented and is perfect to add into your favorite lotion. I havebeen using it about a week and realy like it so far even used it on my daughters skin. Realy like Aroma Oil products and will keep using the products. They ship very fast also....</li>
            <li> This oil is the BEST.  It feels lightly greasy when you rub it on (I put it all over my arms and legs after I shower), but then just seeps into your skin.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of skin problems, and they seem much better.  Not sure if it&#x27;s emu oil, but it very well could be.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the quality of product and service, I ordered a second bottle for a friend.  I suffer from multiple health issues, but cannot take oral medication for inflammation.  I find that emu oil helps with pain and I can function better.  The benefits to skin and hair growth are an added plus for me.  While emu oil is not a cure it all, it greatly increases my quality of life.  I like the pump bottle which makes application, especially after showering much easier.  I am most satisfied with the company and their product, and am seldom moved to recommend things online.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product definitely helped clear up my piercings. The shipping of it was a bit tricky. The first one was about little more than half full when I got it, they sent another, the other wasn&#x27;t as bad but still leaked oil.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It is light with no scent and easy to put on damp skin right after the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The oil relieves my muscle pain and keeps the pain away most of the day. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> No odor, very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> AromaOils Emu Oil was a last ditch effort to try to fix my dry, dark and ashy elbow that I have tried everything on from high end, extremely expensive designer creams, to exfoliating peels on. Wow, in three days it changed completely. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I use it daily and my skin looks and feels so rich I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I add a small pump to my facial moisturizer every morning and evening.  I love how my face feels when I put this on. I also use it on my thinning edges. Haven&#x27;t seen a difference there yet but it&#x27;s only been a week so I will give it more time. I also love the fact that the company sent me an email to see I like the product and told me  ways in which I could use it. I will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> Oh my, I have to say that I absolutely love this stuff!!! :D Thank you so much and please do not ever discontinue this product! It does exactly as you say and the price is so reasonable. I will be ordering again as soon as this runs out. For the ones that are skeptical, it truly does work and usually I never write comments unless it is very worth doing so!! Amazing Oil! I am so happy with it. I could go on and on..... Thank you again  :D</li>
            <li> I used it for a month. good for my dry skin, I mixed it with my facial cream. not grease. love it.</li>
