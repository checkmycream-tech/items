            <li>Awesome!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t started using the diamond abrasion yet, but I have used the pore cleaner suction which works great!  </li>
            <li>Using with 40% glycolic peels every 7 days and seeing great result!</li>
            <li>have done just one, but it already feels so good!!!</li>
            <li>I reviewed every machine that was affordable and the Kendal is supposed to be the best.</li>
            <li>And I am very happy with Shining Image&#x27;s customer service !!  </li>
            <li>That being said, the machines does seem to have very good suction and probably works if you do it correctly and do not over do it or you will suffer from abrasions.</li>
            <li>This works great</li>
            <li>and therefore we are greatly raises</li>
            <li>This Dermabration Machine is great it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look great</li>
            <li>Well peeps, it a great machine.</li>
            <li>I have experienced work of it and its results.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the SI-BM02 Diamond Dermabrasion unit I purchased....</li>
            <li>so she was able to help me set it up and go over the do&#x27;s and don&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>VERY GOOD PRODUCT, EXCELLENT QUALITY, IS TOTALLY WHAT I ASKED, 100% SATISFIED</li>
            <li>I truly giv five star because this product works amazing on ur skin</li>
            <li>It was shipped in a week which was nice</li>
            <li>Kind of like my face and pores said,...</li>
            <li>my own at home and focusing on the areas I WANT focused on and saving the cash...</li>
            <li>Otherwise product is good and easy to use</li>
            <li>I will start using the diamond abrasion the end of this week and will post another review on it, but so far so good!!</li>
            <li>paid it self off in one day  :) very easy to use</li>
            <li>: It is OK.</li>
            <li>I would love to review the product, but it never worked.  </li>
            <li>if you want it to have more suction buy a diffrent one.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>For more aggressive dermabrasion, I go with a lower number, like 180.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>better afterwards too, like a deeper freshness than washing.</li>
            <li>sure I received the item.  </li>
            <li>I will wait a couple days and let you know how things have improved, (and I&#x27;m sure they will).&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the money yea its a deal... if it lasts more than 7 sessions cuz thats about the equivalent of 2 or 3 spa derma sessions with better diamond</li>
            <li>YEA I WOULD :)</li>
            <li>thanks my wife loved it. :)</li>
            <li>like the product, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it has easily paid for itself in just one use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love this 100% satisfaction  Worth to spend money</li>
            <li>I found that the parts didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Happy with this, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at the smooth texture of my skin after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>free to use this response as you wish.&lt;br /&gt;For recommendations .....</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this machine based off of the reviews and the price.</li>
            <li>As a Licensed esthetician who recently started their own skin service, I must say that I am in love with the kendal 3 in 1 diamond.</li>
            <li>Light skin toned people will have bright red skin for 1-3 hours after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clearly I should have waited till I had more money for a better machine :/&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Everything looked great, sturdy, clean, smooth finishes on stainless, and all the accessories were present,.... except the power cord....</li>
            <li>, THE DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND SAFE ON YOUR ESTIMATED TIME FOR DELIVERY, THANKS FOR THE SERVICE</li>
            <li>The machine came quickly.  </li>
            <li>Some of aquintances are very interested, are thinking of buying one these too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast !!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much !!</li>
            <li>There is a disclaimer saying it may take a while to warm up because of a rubber flap or something, but I left it for 30 minutes and nothing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the investment and takes minutes out of your day.</li>
            <li>WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning: follow the directions as it&#x27;s easy to overdue your treatment and make your face raw/scab-ish; start out on the lower settings and be sure to watch some youtube videos of spa treatments, so you know to stretch your skin tight whilst using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m facing the first wrinkles already but acne is still there :</li>
            <li>,I try it first to the elbow...</li>
            <li>Watch YouTube videos first before using it so that you don&#x27;t practice on your face and make BooBoo.</li>
            <li>The higher the number on the dermabrasion head, the *finer*</li>
            <li>We would really like to know more about how to use the product, and is there right instructions for it anywhere?(english or russian works)</li>
            <li>easy, you just put a cotton pad into the back of the metal head, then screw the head onto the metal body wand and turn the machine on.</li>
            <li>Its small and table top, we already upgraded, but its works great as a back up for basic dermabrasion.</li>
            <li>the whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Shelley bear</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>By sucking my pores out with the machine and then misting afterwards, I&#x27;ve cleared my skin SO much.</li>
            <li>This product really helped me.  </li>
            <li>However, I was so very</li>
            <li>and, YES, I would absolutely recommend this product, and this company....</li>
            <li>Consider: Put the package or box measures, since many buyers are not from USA and we have difficulty calculating costs to other countries, that in measures by volume, also considered to be placed in another box for protection, is that we make a volume exes</li>
            <li>unit is tough, easy to clean, powerful.</li>
            <li>In the box, there was a book of information, but none of which pertained to this particular machine.  </li>
            <li>but once I figured out how to put the machine together, (which took forever since the information provided, had nothing to do with this particular machine)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact model microdermabrasion machine weekly since I purchased this for $85 with free shipping via another auction website, just a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>Your SI-BM02 Diamond Dermabrasion is quite, powerful, and amazingly low priced.  </li>
            <li>So is there admin or representative person for New Shining Image?</li>
            <li>it makes fine wrinkles go away as well as dark spots.</li>
            <li>tips, will they get the job done well enough but certainly</li>
            <li>The amount of suction the unit provides removes dead skin cells (and other crud) quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>the suction device clean out black heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It never instructs you on how to set up which I had to spend over an hour trying to figure out myself and while it works very well- for the price I would expect set up instructions for the actual machine that I purchased.  </li>
            <li>If this machine is professional grade it could cause a lot of damage to your skin.</li>
            <li>Were far from.</li>
            <li>Despite other poor review I searched far and wide and this seemed the best for derma and mister AT MY PRICE POINT.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads and filters are available also via auction site for very little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like so far is that there is no any brand-packaging for this machine.</li>
            <li>The misting action is the finest mist I&#x27;ve ever had in my life, and delivers constant spray, cooling the skin off after using the machine&#x27;s vacuum/exfoliating dermabrasion.</li>
            <li>Mine could be faulty BUT the design looks to my husband and adult kids to have no possible way to disperse they liquid in the bottle...</li>

            <li> Mine could be faulty BUT the design looks to my husband and adult kids to have no possible way to disperse they liquid in the bottle...</li>
            <li> Kendal: it has low-to-medium power for vacuum.</li>
            <li> but i didn´t feel much vacuum or suction from the machine</li>
            <li> I watched every u tube video and none of them seems to show the vacuum suction.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even feel any vacuum or suction from the machine</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the manual wasn&#x27;t for the machine I bought, but good thing I have a sister who is a licensed cosmetologist who used the same system in college</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re free.... not trapped under a layer of tough dead skin....</li>
            <li> did break out a little after the first use, which is to be expected due to the resurfacing and exposure of the newer skin.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected?  </li>
            <li> Dont understand why instructions which came with this machine are not clear or user</li>
            <li> I have not tried the vacuum suction yet the paper insert with the very sparse instruction is very confusing.</li>
            <li> I had some pretty painful abrasions on my face for about three days after my first use.</li>
            <li> few days later, my skin was still smoother, and the few blemishes I did have from the treatment disappeared.... and much quicker than usual.  </li>
            <li> I got two empty bottles with no clue how to hook up or use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just did not arrived the day when expected which is 3 days after purchased .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used diamond tip before and they are usually rough to the touch.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try it before a wedding that I was to attend.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are poor although it was suggested I find a u-tube instruction video which I did and it was very helpful.</li>
            <li> Ive never had anyone use anything other than Diamond in my clinic.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;manual\\&quot; tells you what you received and a small diagram of the machine only.</li>
            <li> so that makes me wounder about the other reviewers, and how the mister worked for them ~ curious.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s kind of disappointing that instructions are wrong, according to both previous girls...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a healthy glow through the abrasions.my face actually looked horrible for three days.</li>
            <li> The highest notch, should typically be the lowest.</li>
            <li> My sister was confused about the spray bottles that it came with, but she said the one that was used at her school was only used for a spray toner which I have already</li>
            <li> I have only tired to use the machine once.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are very few pages about how to use this machine in the instruction, but it&#x27;s really not that hard to figure it</li>
            <li> I emailed shining image to try to get a Manuel and they sent me the same useless paper insert that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to return it ,my money doesn&#x27;t worth with this piece of a crap machine.</li>
            <li> I  was disappointed, very,</li>
            <li> Hello, I didn&#x27;t buy the machine yet, but seriously considering to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review in a few months if anything fails or if I have any surprises.</li>
            <li> I just received my shipment and I was confused on how to set up the machine.  </li>
            <li> Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about a half of an inch off which makes it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> , I just feel I little bit disappointed it does works</li>
            <li> The little holes on the base were not line up with the holes on the plastic tray that holds the utensils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sad that you need to have done 6-8 procedures (every 3 or 7 days each) to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> followed instructions purposfully and still the suction was very poor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ir wasn&#x27;t a bad choice.</li>
            <li> I am sorely disappointed and will be returning.</li>
            <li> Frustrated!</li>
            <li> I was very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> The suction on the machine is terrible.</li>
            <li> the sucking is pathetic and I saw the you tube video they posted</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the product does not work well</li>
            <li> This works great Ive never had anyone use anything other than Diamond in my clinic. Its small and table top, we already upgraded, but its works great as a back up for basic dermabrasion.</li>
            <li> Kendal: it has low-to-medium power for vacuum. I like its accessories&lt;br /&gt;Timex: It is OK. I would like it to include a chronometer.</li>
            <li> I would love to review the product, but it never worked.  I attached the hose and end piece as instructed,plugged it in, flipped the switch and nothing.  There is a disclaimer saying it may take a while to warm up because of a rubber flap or something, but I left it for 30 minutes and nothing.  I am sorely disappointed and will be returning.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> I Sonica Sharma order this kendal 3 in one I truly giv five star because this product works amazing on ur skin I love this 100% satisfaction  Worth to spend money</li>
            <li> I just received my shipment and I was confused on how to set up the machine.  Disappointed that the manual wasn&#x27;t for the machine I bought, but good thing I have a sister who is a licensed cosmetologist who used the same system in college so she was able to help me set it up and go over the do&#x27;s and don&#x27;t!  I haven&#x27;t started using the diamond abrasion yet, but I have used the pore cleaner suction which works great!  My sister was confused about the spray bottles that it came with, but she said the one that was used at her school was only used for a spray toner which I have already so I wont need to use it!  I will start using the diamond abrasion the end of this week and will post another review on it, but so far so good!!</li>
            <li> The machine came quickly.  It was smaller than I expected?  In the box, there was a book of information, but none of which pertained to this particular machine.  There was even a peice of paper stuck in the box that said \\&quot;Since SI-BM02 has the same machine structure, appearance, adn functions as NV-108 described in the manual.  Please read pages 9-10 for its basic description and operation.  The \\&quot;manual\\&quot; tells you what you received and a small diagram of the machine only. It never instructs you on how to set up which I had to spend over an hour trying to figure out myself and while it works very well- for the price I would expect set up instructions for the actual machine that I purchased.  When purchased, I think the description said that it came with the spray solution- I got two empty bottles with no clue how to hook up or use.  Using with 40% glycolic peels every 7 days and seeing great result!</li>
            <li> Hello, I didn&#x27;t buy the machine yet, but seriously considering to. That&#x27;s kind of disappointing that instructions are wrong, according to both previous girls... So is there admin or representative person for New Shining Image? We would really like to know more about how to use the product, and is there right instructions for it anywhere?(english or russian works) Do&#x27;s and don&#x27;t-s as creolediva said. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Consider: Put the package or box measures, since many buyers are not from USA and we have difficulty calculating costs to other countries, that in measures by volume, also considered to be placed in another box for protection, is that we make a volume exes and therefore we are greatly raises the costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend all users</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just did not arrived the day when expected which is 3 days after purchased . Otherwise product is good and easy to use</li>
            <li> As a Licensed esthetician who recently started their own skin service, I must say that I am in love with the kendal 3 in 1 diamond. The clients rave about it.</li>
            <li> I have never done any spa-procedures before.&lt;br /&gt;It is sad that you need to have done 6-8 procedures (every 3 or 7 days each) to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;I have done just one, but it already feels so good!!! Skin is softer, cleaner and shining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are very few pages about how to use this machine in the instruction, but it&#x27;s really not that hard to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like so far is that there is no any brand-packaging for this machine. I wish they had some box to keep it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been having acne since I was 10yo. I&#x27;m 28 for now. I&#x27;m facing the first wrinkles already but acne is still there :-(&lt;br /&gt;I hope this machine will help me to get rid of it finally.&lt;br /&gt;I will update as soon as I get any results.</li>
            <li> the whole family uses it. paid it self off in one day  :) very easy to use</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT, EXCELLENT QUALITY, IS TOTALLY WHAT I ASKED, 100% SATISFIED, THE DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND SAFE ON YOUR ESTIMATED TIME FOR DELIVERY, THANKS FOR THE SERVICE</li>
            <li> does not have a lot of pull though.. if you want it to have more suction buy a diffrent one.</li>
            <li> the diamonds do their job but i didn´t feel much vacuum or suction from the machine, I just feel I little bit disappointed it does works but it´s not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> I have only tired to use the machine once. There are no intructions. There should be a DVD instructional video. I emailed shining image to try to get a Manuel and they sent me the same useless paper insert that came with the machine. I have not tried the vacuum suction yet the paper insert with the very sparse instruction is very confusing. I watched every u tube video and none of them seems to show the vacuum suction.If this machine is professional grade it could cause a lot of damage to your skin. I had some pretty painful abrasions on my face for about three days after my first use. If there would have been an instructional video I probably would have avoided that. That being said, the machines does seem to have very good suction and probably works if you do it correctly and do not over do it or you will suffer from abrasions. I am going to try it again in seven days. I didn&#x27;t notice a healthy glow through the abrasions.my face actually looked horrible for three days. I reviewed every machine that was affordable and the Kendal is supposed to be the best. We will see.</li>
            <li> I just brought this 2 days ago, and I just receive it yesterday... I was so excited and I can&#x27;t wait to used it.when I open it up from the box and assemble the accessories,I try it first to the elbow... I don&#x27;t even feel any vacuum or suction from the machine even I put it on a max level....&lt;br /&gt;Then I check the hose and everything still the same nothing is just a piece of a junk,... So I just pack it and put everything on the box.Now I&#x27;m going to return it ,my money doesn&#x27;t worth with this piece of a crap machine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the investment and takes minutes out of your day. It takes about 2 weeks to see results. Watch YouTube videos first before using it so that you don&#x27;t practice on your face and make BooBoo.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this machine based off of the reviews and the price. It was shipped in a week which was nice but once I figured out how to put the machine together, (which took forever since the information provided, had nothing to do with this particular machine) I was very very disappointed. The suction on the machine is terrible. The highest notch, should typically be the lowest. I&#x27;ve used diamond tip before and they are usually rough to the touch. These tips. Were far from. Even with pressure added, I didn&#x27;t see anything or feel anything happening. Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> This Dermabration Machine is great it. It makes my skin look great it makes fine wrinkles go away as well as dark spots. My husband likes it as well he has oily skin with acne the suction device clean out black heads.&lt;br /&gt; Also Your Customer service is great!!&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks Shelley bear</li>
            <li> We used this machine at our day spa and it scarred two faces. do not use, the tips were all damaged.</li>
            <li> recieved just in time for valentines day thanks my wife loved it. :)</li>
            <li> Well peeps, it a great machine. I received it as specified.&lt;br /&gt;Ir wasn&#x27;t a bad choice. I have experienced work of it and its results. Some of aquintances are very interested, are thinking of buying one these too.&lt;br /&gt;So hope they keep improvinG.</li>
            <li> I was so excitied about this purchase. Wanted to try it before a wedding that I was to attend.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions are poor although it was suggested I find a u-tube instruction video which I did and it was very helpful. Dont understand why instructions which came with this machine are not clear or user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;I followed instructions purposfully and still the suction was very poor. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I bough this machine but can&#x27;t work out how to set it up! Where do the plastic bottles attach ? And what am I supposed to put in them??  Frustrated! Someone please help......</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  Works really well.</li>
            <li> when putting it together I found that the parts didn&#x27;t fit. The little holes on the base were not line up with the holes on the plastic tray that holds the utensils. It&#x27;s about a half of an inch off which makes it impossible to use.</li>
            <li> Happy with this, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product. The misting action is the finest mist I&#x27;ve ever had in my life, and delivers constant spray, cooling the skin off after using the machine&#x27;s vacuum/exfoliating dermabrasion. The higher the number on the dermabrasion head, the *finer* the grit. So, for face, I use head no. 220. For more aggressive dermabrasion, I go with a lower number, like 180.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy, you just put a cotton pad into the back of the metal head, then screw the head onto the metal body wand and turn the machine on. By sucking my pores out with the machine and then misting afterwards, I&#x27;ve cleared my skin SO much. This product really helped me.  My skin just *felt* better afterwards too, like a deeper freshness than washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact model microdermabrasion machine weekly since I purchased this for $85 with free shipping via another auction website, just a few weeks ago.  Replacement heads and filters are available also via auction site for very little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: follow the directions as it&#x27;s easy to overdue your treatment and make your face raw/scab-ish; start out on the lower settings and be sure to watch some youtube videos of spa treatments, so you know to stretch your skin tight whilst using.  Light skin toned people will have bright red skin for 1-3 hours after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review in a few months if anything fails or if I have any surprises.</li>
            <li> Well, I received my SI-BM02 Diamond Dermabrasion unit in about 3 days.... Fast !!&lt;br /&gt;Everything looked great, sturdy, clean, smooth finishes on stainless, and all the accessories were present,.... except the power cord.... OOPS.... I  was disappointed, very, I had wanted to give the unit a try as soon as I received it.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so, I didn&#x27;t have the power cord.... I thought it was going to be a giant hassle.... However, I was so very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I just emailed the company, Shining Image, and told them the situation.  Without questions, or hesitation, Shining Image sent me the power cord Priority Mail, and it was in my mail box in 3 days...!!  No questions asked...!!&lt;br /&gt;The company followed up with an email making sure I received the item.  And then again, to find out if everything worked okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I would have to say, YES !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following is my response to their last email.... !!&lt;br /&gt;... and, YES, I would absolutely recommend this product, and this company.... and already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, thank you I received the AC adapter. Your SI-BM02 Diamond Dermabrasion is quite, powerful, and amazingly low priced.  I&#x27;ve used it twice since I received the power cord.  The amount of suction the unit provides removes dead skin cells (and other crud) quickly and smoothly.  I am amazed at the smooth texture of my skin after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;I did break out a little after the first use, which is to be expected due to the resurfacing and exposure of the newer skin. Kind of like my face and pores said,... \\&quot;Yeah, we&#x27;re free.... not trapped under a layer of tough dead skin.... time to get all of this junk outa here\\&quot;... and that&#x27;s what happened.&lt;br /&gt;A few days later, my skin was still smoother, and the few blemishes I did have from the treatment disappeared.... and much quicker than usual.  So, I used your product for the second time last night, not just on my face, but, my neck, and chest too.  I will wait a couple days and let you know how things have improved, (and I&#x27;m sure they will).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much, I&#x27;m very satisfied with the SI-BM02 Diamond Dermabrasion unit I purchased.... it has easily paid for itself in just one use.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is tough, easy to clean, powerful. And I am very happy with Shining Image&#x27;s customer service !!  Thank you so much !!&lt;br /&gt;Jami Conroy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to use this response as you wish.&lt;br /&gt;For recommendations .....</li>
            <li> Despite other poor review I searched far and wide and this seemed the best for derma and mister AT MY PRICE POINT. Clearly I should have waited till I had more money for a better machine :/&lt;br /&gt;The misters DON NOT SUCK UP WHAT YOU PUT INT THE BOTTLE. they just blow out air. Mine could be faulty BUT the design looks to my husband and adult kids to have no possible way to disperse they liquid in the bottle... so that makes me wounder about the other reviewers, and how the mister worked for them ~ curious.&lt;br /&gt;The tips, will they get the job done well enough but certainly not Spa AND NO WAY med grade.&lt;br /&gt;at max the sucking is pathetic and I saw the you tube video they posted ~ NO the suction is not that strong.&lt;br /&gt;so for the money yea its a deal... if it lasts more than 7 sessions cuz thats about the equivalent of 2 or 3 spa derma sessions with better diamond tips.&lt;br /&gt;Would I have bought it knowing hat I now know ~ YEA I WOULD :)&lt;br /&gt;doing my own at home and focusing on the areas I WANT focused on and saving the cash... WORTH IT.</li>
