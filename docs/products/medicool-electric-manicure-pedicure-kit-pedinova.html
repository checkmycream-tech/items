            <li>Works great but over heats and shut off quick</li>
            <li>very easy to operate.</li>
            <li>This kit is very easy to use and has plenty of power, unlike the battery powered ones.</li>
            <li>My problem cuticles and caloused feet have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>the pieces all have to be replaced which adds more expense...</li>
            <li>Probably more than I needed</li>
            <li>am able now to use the  Pedicure Kit  after a knee injury&lt;br /&gt;reaching</li>
            <li>glad I did.</li>
            <li>There is a list for more attachments, however it does not say what are the attachemnts</li>

            <li>I will buy one more for a family member.</li>
            <li>Thanks Body Tools for a great product.</li>
            <li>This is the best kit I have ever purchased and I have purchased several.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, first class, high quality, easy to use!</li>
            <li>Its best to use this on dry feet so</li>
            <li>It works very well with excellent power to do a professional job...</li>
            <li>a strong \\&quot;5\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This kit also has a metal collet that the shafts fit into so it doesn&#x27;t crack either.  </li>
            <li>my toes comfortably and do my pedicure</li>
            <li>I only wish I had more guidance in how to use it more effectively; without this, I am stuck with trial and</li>
            <li>and I loved my old one.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I do foot care for a living and this product has been used many hours by me and has never failed to be reliable and dependable.</li>
            <li>attachments are easy to change and useful</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect really when I ordered this</li>
            <li>This is the most powerful kit I have ever owned and the various attachments are nice.</li>
            <li>As a person with advanced arthritis of hands and wrists, I must rely on something this pricey to do basic nail care, so I&#x27;m happy with the high (and adjustable) levels of power the tool supplies.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with this item, I only used it for a total of 5-6 times ... but went to go use it today ...</li>
            <li>This device is easy to use, and works very well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, really works well.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I had hoped it would be, a good tool that not only works on my nails but deals with stubborn heel callouses as well.</li>
            <li>My feet look great after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li>The different attachments are handy.</li>
            <li>I like it better than my old one</li>
            <li>It is worth</li>
            <li>then they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>is because the instructions could be better, also many complaints of trouble removing the buffer.</li>
            <li>consider it as good purchase because the similar salon procedures took regularly during a year could cost far more than the price for that tool.</li>
            <li>My wife wanted a pedicure kit exactly like the one her pedicurist uses.  </li>
            <li>It is solidly built and has plenty of attachments - more than you&#x27;ll probably need.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and it appears to be very durable.</li>
            <li>and I loved it for 13 months of every week usage on hands and feet (conventional manicure and pedicure).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s covered with only 12 months warranty; so, now I only have a good set of bits and I have to search for new tool.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to file product that needs smoothing on nails.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for this type of product that had a reasonable price and found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It would of been very helpful if some type of product instructions were included as I didn&#x27;t automatically know what each tool was for...</li>
            <li>Can be done very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I bought it a year ago and didn&#x27;t use it much because I go to spa for pedicure.</li>
            <li>I am very upset.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Mine was very well built and for home use</li>
            <li>The replacement works very well.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what the professional use.</li>
            <li>It appears to live up to my expectations but the printed material is not as legible as I would like.</li>
            <li>how many treatments&lt;br /&gt;the different surfaces last.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this kit to everyone.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>The reviews I read were very helpful in reporting that the machine is professional quality, and that a non-professional receives precious little help from the &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; that come with it.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I&#x27;d give this Pedicure kit</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should have been pointed out only useful for USA.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It definitely was worth the cost though</li>
            <li>I have never found a set like this and overall, I have spent far more on cheaper devices and they are junk.</li>
            <li>I have had an earlier version of a Medicool drill for many years which finally died (out of the blue</li>
            <li>I am able to use the Pedicure  Kit  after an electronic centre had replaced the the very heavy and unusable transformer&lt;br /&gt;into Australian standards, for $28.00, very helpful firm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tool gets hot very fast, and I had burn myself on a few occasions.  </li>
            <li>your feet are like soft baby feet.</li>
            <li>This replaced an older one I had that finally wore out.</li>
            <li>but it has been a nice tool for simple to complicated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure the cost is really worth it?</li>

            <li> First of all, one of the kit tool seems to have been used by someone else because I could clearly see one spots on the tool itself, the handle also seems to be dirty which give me another indication this was used by someone before.</li>
            <li> Everything you need for a great manicure and to get rid of nasty foot calluses.</li>
            <li> Room to keep a few extra things that I use all the time when using the unit.</li>
            <li> This purchase was what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I am not recommending this to other people.</li>
            <li> I can give no higher recommendation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchase other kits that had plastic shafts on the sanding discs and they always cracked and broke.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product based on a lot of the good reviews and was very disappointed when I received it.     </li>
            <li> not impressed, not very powerful and the tools don&#x27;t really do the job...waste of money</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t expend the energy on my difficult feet due to health issues, so it has to be fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> This dermal is not powerful at all.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time holding my legs out that long as well.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product I was terribly disappointed and gave it a bad review because the very first time I used it, it stopped working after only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I think they should have a little chart in it that says what each of the tools are for.</li>
            <li> This is a little power house.  </li>
            <li> I had foot surgery a few years ago and this helps with the calluses  that I get.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t worse it to pay such money for it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it stopped working after I used it for a few times.</li>
            <li> Just wasted my money</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> They are common place in Europe but hard to find in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> There is not even one piece of paper/instruction with the product, which makes it very confusing to use.     </li>
            <li> poor quality, plug kept overheating</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> (sometimes, painful) error as my learning mechanism.</li>
            <li> But it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> This replaced an older one I had that finally wore out. This one has a longer cord which was detachable from unit, that is nice. It is strong enough to file product that needs smoothing on nails. The different attachments are handy. I like it better than my old one and I loved my old one. Nicer case too. Room to keep a few extra things that I use all the time when using the unit.</li>

            <li> My wife wanted a pedicure kit exactly like the one her pedicurist uses.  This is it and she absolutely loves it.  I can give no higher recommendation.  My wife loves it and we ended up buying one for her mother for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  It is solidly built and has plenty of attachments - more than you&#x27;ll probably need.  But it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect really when I ordered this but it has been an incredible purchase. I use it on my diabetic mother&#x27;s feet and toenails and it works wonders! I highly recommend this kit to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this type of product that had a reasonable price and found it on Amazon. I had foot surgery a few years ago and this helps with the calluses  that I get. The cord is a great length and the power is perfect. I have tried others but this one fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> I must be getting old because all of a sudden my feet are so dry and rough and I have tried every lotion, cream and \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; product and nothing works. Then I came across this and bought it. It works great! All you do is use it once a month and your feet are like soft baby feet. It is super easy to use. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I think they should have a little chart in it that says what each of the tools are for. I actually found something on the internet and printed it out and put it in my case so when I am using it I know what to grab for the job I need it to do. This is exactly what the professional use. Its best to use this on dry feet so no soaking your feet prior.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this item, I only used it for a total of 5-6 times ... but went to go use it today ... and it won&#x27;t start/work .... maybe a short in the wiring ? &#x3D;</li>
            <li> This device is easy to use, and works very well. My problem cuticles and caloused feet have never looked better. I wish I had bought this thing years ago.</li>
            <li> excellent quality. exceeded my expectations. very easy to operate. highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  I&#x27;ve purchase other kits that had plastic shafts on the sanding discs and they always cracked and broke.  This kit also has a metal collet that the shafts fit into so it doesn&#x27;t crack either.  My feet look great after just a few uses.  I won&#x27;t give up my pedicures, but I can get by with not going so often.</li>
            <li> This product is great.... even for getting your nails done at home. SAVE MONEY. I love this product! It is worth it&#x27;s price !</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and have been using it for several months. Overall I like the product. I like how it smooths callouses and nail-beds. I have used it to buff my nails and the results are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey and the pieces all have to be replaced which adds more expense... I&#x27;m not sure the cost is really worth it? The case is nice and helpful in keeping everything together and organized. It would of been very helpful if some type of product instructions were included as I didn&#x27;t automatically know what each tool was for...</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, first class, high quality, easy to use! I stopped spending money on the cheaper ones and bought this one, I now have something that works and will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> It appears to live up to my expectations but the printed material is not as legible as I would like. I anticipate many years of good service from this product.</li>
            <li> This dermal is not powerful at all. it doesn&#x27;t worse it to pay such money for it. I am not satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Normally, I&#x27;d give this Pedicure kit a strong \\&quot;5\\&quot; but we can&#x27;t seem to remove one of the interchangeable &#x27;heads&#x27; used to buff foot callouses. It works very well with excellent power to do a professional job...but we&#x27;re STUCK on only one functional head. It won&#x27;t unscrew out of the electric socket. Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Probably more than I needed but it has been a nice tool for simple to complicated. I am happy.</li>
            <li> I am able to use the Pedicure  Kit  after an electronic centre had replaced the the very heavy and unusable transformer&lt;br /&gt;into Australian standards, for $28.00, very helpful firm.&lt;br /&gt;It should have been pointed out only useful for USA.&lt;br /&gt;The switch  on and off is not working and has to be done by pulling&lt;br /&gt;out the electric cord on the handheld connection. Can be done very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I am able now to use the  Pedicure Kit  after a knee injury&lt;br /&gt;reaching my toes comfortably and do my pedicure my self.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are easy to change and useful it remains to be seen for how many treatments&lt;br /&gt;the different surfaces last.</li>
            <li> The best set I have ever had. I have never found a set like this and overall, I have spent far more on cheaper devices and they are junk. I can&#x27;t expend the energy on my difficult feet due to health issues, so it has to be fast and efficient. I would have bought a set like this years ago. They are common place in Europe but hard to find in the U.S. I expect to save a bundle in pedicures and I have a hard time holding my legs out that long as well. If you want to keep your feet on good shape and can&#x27;t sit in a spa or afford the visits, invest in a set. You will save time and money.</li>
            <li> there is no printed material in this kit, no guarantee, no electrical cautions, and no identification of the various tools.  this is all do-it-yourself.</li>
            <li> This is essential for fungus toe nails care...this kit has everything you need to do à good job on sick toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;I paid almost haft the price for it,(on sale),very glad I did.</li>
            <li> Works great. I gave a four.The reason  it got a four star is because the instructions could be better, also many complaints of trouble removing the buffer. I have decided not to use it to avoid the problem, but would be nice if I could.</li>
            <li> The tool gets hot very fast, and I had burn myself on a few occasions.  The attachements are okey, however for removal of dry skin not powerfull enough.  There is a list for more attachments, however it does not say what are the attachemnts for???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I would like to order some more attachments, but I dont know which one is doing what...</li>
            <li> I wish it had some attachments that were smaller than the largest and larger than the smallest.  Otherwise its a very good instrument.</li>
            <li> poor quality, plug kept overheating</li>
            <li> Works very well. Use it on medium speed for best results.</li>
            <li> I love this manicure/pedicure kit!  This kit is very easy to use and has plenty of power, unlike the battery powered ones.</li>
            <li> It worked good and I loved it for 13 months of every week usage on hands and feet (conventional manicure and pedicure).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s covered with only 12 months warranty; so, now I only have a good set of bits and I have to search for new tool.&lt;br /&gt;I consider it as good purchase because the similar salon procedures took regularly during a year could cost far more than the price for that tool. But I prefer to own a drill that will work longer than its warranty term.</li>
            <li> I can now do my nails myself!!!!</li>
            <li> This Pedicure Kit is just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is very good ,easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One question I have where was this kit made?</li>
            <li> not impressed, not very powerful and the tools don&#x27;t really do the job...waste of money</li>
            <li> I loved that machine but it broke after 3 times of use. I bought it a year ago and didn&#x27;t use it much because I go to spa for pedicure.I wanted to use it today and it does not work. I can&#x27;t believe it stopped working after I used it for a few times.I also can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s too late.I am very upset.Just wasted my money</li>
            <li> This purchase was for me. I will buy one more for a family member. Thanks Body Tools for a great product.</li>
            <li> This purchase was what I had expected. Product works great!. The price was right and it appears to be very durable.</li>
            <li> The reviews I read were very helpful in reporting that the machine is professional quality, and that a non-professional receives precious little help from the &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; that come with it.  As a person with advanced arthritis of hands and wrists, I must rely on something this pricey to do basic nail care, so I&#x27;m happy with the high (and adjustable) levels of power the tool supplies.  I only wish I had more guidance in how to use it more effectively; without this, I am stuck with trial and (sometimes, painful) error as my learning mechanism.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  Best product like this out there!  This product has the power and tips to keep those calluses from building up on your feet.</li>
            <li> I have had an earlier version of a Medicool drill for many years which finally died (out of the blue it just had no power at all when I tried it last). It definitely was worth the cost though and I plan to purchase another. However, this looks to be actually made by and identical to the Medicool Pedinova Pro sold on Amazon for $85.00. The page has a picture of the 12 attachment bits and a description of what they are for, which is helpful. Mine was very well built and for home use I can&#x27;t imagine why you would need anything else. If these are as good then they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great tool. Easy to use, really works well.</li>
            <li> This is the best kit I have ever purchased and I have purchased several.  This is the most powerful kit I have ever owned and the various attachments are nice.</li>
            <li> This is a little power house.  Everything you need for a great manicure and to get rid of nasty foot calluses.</li>
            <li> I do foot care for a living and this product has been used many hours by me and has never failed to be reliable and dependable.</li>
            <li> Works great but over heats and shut off quick</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product I was terribly disappointed and gave it a bad review because the very first time I used it, it stopped working after only a few minutes. However, as soon as Amazon saw the review one of their staff called me, asked me what problems I had had and immediately arranged for a replacement to be sent. The replacement works very well. It is exactly what I had hoped it would be, a good tool that not only works on my nails but deals with stubborn heel callouses as well. Thank you Amazon for the exceptional customer service.</li>
