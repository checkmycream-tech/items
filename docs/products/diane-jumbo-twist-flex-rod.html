    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works perfect anyway</li>
            <li>The rods are great.</li>
            <li>I got these rollers in hopes that I could get some good curls overnight.</li>
            <li>I put these in and my hair has never looked more beautiful.</li>
            <li>I use them all the time and love the curls they make.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>but I wish for the money, that there were more in the pack.</li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>Soo dissatisfied i bought 3 packs very excited to get my curls popping...</li>
            <li>The kind of curls you will get from this jumbo size is the Amy Adams hair in &amp;#34;American Hustle&amp;#34; they are beautiful big curls.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t the most comfortable sleeping in though</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I sleep in them with lightly damp hair.</li>
            <li>and they create a really nice spiral curl that last for days.  </li>
            <li>Smaller size might work better.</li>
            <li>Too big to be practical even if you want large curls because the width to length ratio does not allow for a secure hold.</li>
            <li>Very disapppointed.</li>
            <li>Is just what i expect, I just like the white top be the same size off the foam.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they sell flexi rods this large if you can&#x27;t bend them properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no hairstylist, but I found the large size of these--which I was hoping would give me big soft ringlet curls--were non-functional.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the rollers are stiff as a board and do not want to bend and shape to stay on your head in the first place.</li>
            <li>- usually my hair is extremely easy to style and holds curl</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to bend and keep it closed</li>
            <li>If you want tightly curled hair then use more of them, loser hair, less of them.</li>
            <li>Third, they were ineffective at curling my hair, and that&#x27;s not a typical thing for me</li>
            <li>My hair looks exactly like that when I put these in for a few hours.  </li>

            <li> spent about an hour struggling to make them stay!</li>
            <li> They could not bend and stay in place due to the thickness of the foam.</li>
            <li> These rods do not even bend, they are in fact as the other reviewer wrote - stiff as a board.</li>

            <li> Soo dissatisfied i bought 3 packs very excited to get my curls popping...spent about an hour struggling to make them stay! Very stiff hardly bends wouldn&#x27;t even stay in my hair! Waste of time and money highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get them to bend and stay in place. Too big to be practical even if you want large curls because the width to length ratio does not allow for a secure hold. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Entirely too stiff to bend. I had to use a rubber band to hold the ends together.  I truly hate them.</li>
            <li> These rods do not even bend, they are in fact as the other reviewer wrote - stiff as a board. I wanted bigger curls so I got the largest size but these don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> They are not even bend.  They are stiff  cannot hold my hair.  I do not know how others can use them.  I returned them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend these. You can&#x27;t even bend them enough to stay on your head. If you want big curls, just get rollers. I don&#x27;t know why they sell flexi rods this large if you can&#x27;t bend them properly. I read the reviews about them not bending and ignored them. Don&#x27;t ignore them, they were correct.</li>
            <li> The kind of curls you will get from this jumbo size is the Amy Adams hair in &amp;#34;American Hustle&amp;#34; they are beautiful big curls.  My hair looks exactly like that when I put these in for a few hours.  You have to know how to wrap your hair in these to get the results.  Go to youtube and find a tutorial.  I do a wet roller set on big magnetic rollers and then when I take those out I put these in and my hair has never looked more beautiful.</li>
            <li> They would not bend and hold the hair and were completely useless.  This was a total waste of my money.  Do not buy these!!!</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to bend and keep it closed so your hair can stay wrapped around it. It gives a bit of curl.</li>
            <li> Very disapppointed. The rod does not hold its shape and is therefore pointless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no hairstylist, but I found the large size of these--which I was hoping would give me big soft ringlet curls--were non-functional. They could not bend and stay in place due to the thickness of the foam. I like them in the smaller sizes.</li>
            <li> They are prefect for making big curls!! I use them all the time and love the curls they make. I sleep in them with lightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> I got these rollers in hopes that I could get some good curls overnight. Firstly, the rollers are stiff as a board and do not want to bend and shape to stay on your head in the first place. I had curlers falling out before I even got in bed. Secondly, they smell AWFUL! I don&#x27;t even know how to explain it, it&#x27;s like a plastic-y, chemical-y smell and that transfers over to your hair as well. Third, they were ineffective at curling my hair, and that&#x27;s not a typical thing for me - usually my hair is extremely easy to style and holds curl all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short - hard to use, smell terrible, and do not work.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay in your hair.  I have long hair, all the way to the middle of my back, and they will not stay.  I have the smaller ones that you twist together at the end to close and they create a really nice spiral curl that last for days.  I wanted larger curls, but they don&#x27;t stay and when I used clips to hold them in, they still did not produce a curl.</li>
            <li> I love them but I wish for the money, that there were more in the pack.</li>
            <li> The rods are great. Easy to use. If you want tightly curled hair then use more of them, loser hair, less of them. They aren&#x27;t the most comfortable sleeping in though</li>
            <li> Beware that these larger rods are stiff, too large to twist and flex. Waste of money. Smaller size might work better.</li>
            <li> Is just what i expect, I just like the white top be the same size off the foam. Works perfect anyway</li>
            <li> Im sure its user error but I am having a hard time using these rods. I could not get them to stay in my hair while I slept.</li>
