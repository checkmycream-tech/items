            <li> It is exactly as it says it is.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, lovely aroma.</li>
            <li> Great company, good oil.</li>
            <li> I got this oil because of my allergies. My girlfriend can&#x27;t wear perfumes because of them. But,this please very pleasent smell on Her is Very Nice(where ever she puts it). And my nose doesn&#x27;t mind it,and it also makes my mouth water sometimes :-) Win,Win!!</li>
            <li> This is a happy scent. I gave it four instead of five because there is a bit of a bite to the smell that I wasn&#x27;t expecting and I haven&#x27;t tried another brand in Mandarin, so have nothing to compare it with.  It isn&#x27;t quite as appealing aromatically as their other citrus oils, but still very nice. It may be that I just don&#x27;t care for the Mandarin scent as much as the others. The aroma is calming when diffused, and even has that effect when I put it on my feet. I&#x27;m not 100% on this yet, but it also seems to act as a mild diuretic for me personally.</li>
            <li> Works well smells nice</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  I used it in soap I was making. Will order this again.  Did not affect the soap except to make it smell heavenly!</li>
            <li> What can I say, since my first order I ever placed with Plant Therapy...Ive been addicted to ordering oils from them. They have the fastest shipping and the BEST customer service.I have and will continue to order from them...Quality oils, great prices and awesome customer service! I ordered from another company on Amazon and it took forever to get my oils.(they said they were lost in mail but and resent the order out. but if that were the case wouldnt i have gotten the other order eventually so I wont order from them again) When you order an oil and your like me you can wait for it to get here so you can take that first whiff of it....ahhhhh amazing (most of the time)...lol Also LOVE the label on the cap of oil so its easier to find.</li>
            <li> I buy all different brands but I have to say I have never got an oil from them that I did not like and when I compare different brands I will prefer Plant Therapy&#x27;s Oils over the other brand.</li>
            <li> A wonderful essential oil.  Mandarin has a nice, light fruity scent that blends well with many other essential oils.  I use it in my diffuser at night sometimes mixing it with Cinnamon, Petitigrain or Neroli and it smells so good and is so relaxing to the senses and it really helps to put me at ease and not feel so stressed out or depressed.  A very good all around essential oil to use in your home.</li>
            <li> Perfect: it&#x27;s pure, smells wonderful and is CRUELTY FREE.</li>
            <li> A gentle orange fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this Mandarin oil as I recently returned from India where I had purchased a small vial of the essential oil from another manufacturer. The aroma was completely different, so much more beautiful. The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai actually infuses their lobby with it which is so fresh and welcoming. This one smells like a cleaning product or some industrial rancid smell. Too bad the product from India is not available internationally.</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent but not very strong.</li>
            <li> I enjoy all the Plant Therapy products I purchase.  The aroma is captivating, I enjoy putting it in my diffuser at night.</li>
            <li> Great product, smells great and met my expectations and beyond!  Good Company good product!</li>
            <li> i like it , I used for a antibug/mosquitoes mix and traveling anti- bug  for the materass I slepp (You nevr kow). It did the job, it moxed well ans is reasonabley priced. However I prefer buyin organic oils, they are worth paying a bit more..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KarlaC</li>

            <li> I seen on pinterest that you can use it for stretch marks on your stomach can you run this on your skin?</li>
            <li> Does not smell like mandarin. . but will find something to do with it</li>
