            <li> I loved the feel of this soap on my skin, but the smell of the soup was so strong that it lingered all day and mixed with my perfume.

            <li> My daughter and I discovered Scottish Fine Soap products in Europe this past spring.  She expanded her horizons and did an internet search and purchased several additional items in the line.  While visiting her in Vail this fall, she gave me a bar of soap to try.  It is so creamy that I can use it on my face.  Scottish Fine Soap products will be my go-to-gift this holiday season.</li>

I came to amazon.com and found them, of course! I bought these and they arrived promptly with no problem. I really loved smelling them again as I had run out of the previous bars about a month or two before buying these. It is my favorite soap now. I highly recommend them!</li>
