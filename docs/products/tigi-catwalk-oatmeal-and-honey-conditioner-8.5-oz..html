            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> instead of sending it back I transfered it to a new bottle.</li>
            <li> and I live in a very dry area.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my hair had become so dry due to the hardness of the water when I moved to this new area.</li>
            <li> but Ulta had this on sale for $9.99 for the same size bottle not too long ago.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li> This conditioner helps my hair all year long.</li>
            <li> I really like the pump on the bottle because the conditioner is extremely thick.</li>
            <li> My hair was totally dry and lifeless and it seemed nothing would help even tons of conditioner.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in the packaging as expected, but the contents seem to be thinner, almost watery compared to the same product I have received from other stores....</li>
            <li> INGREDIENTS  Disodium Oleamido PEG-2, Sulfosuccinate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucmber) Fruit Extract, Actinidia Chinesis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Coriandrum Sativum (Coriander) Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using any other shampoo ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It was too heavy for the summer.</li>
            <li> Also the last bottle of conditioner I ordered from Amazon came broken in the mail...</li>
            <li> I am so sad it turned out this way, I sent it back requesting a refund because im scared if I exchange it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this in the stores</li>
            <li> This product must have been sitting on selves collecting dust for a very long time because the product had settled so badly that no matter what I did</li>
            <li> It is getting difficult to find around my area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will keep buying it because it is expensive but buying from amazon saved me a ton of money- my 25 ounce bottle is cheaper than the 8 ounce bottles I see in the store!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product for years and loved it because it moisturized my beard very well. They changed the formula and now it&#x27;s not any better than lesser expensive products.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle! The pump makes it convenient to get the product out. The first thing I noticed was the smell....wow! Yummy!! The first time I used it, I was not disappointed. It&#x27;s a thick conditioner, spreads well, smells great and leaves my hair very soft. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 months now. No complaints.</li>
            <li> this product smell greats and really mosturizes, i will probably use this as my winter conditioner.  It was too heavy for the summer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see either in the ingredients...    INGREDIENTS  Disodium Oleamido PEG-2, Sulfosuccinate, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucmber) Fruit Extract, Actinidia Chinesis (Kiwi) Fruit Extract, Coriandrum Sativum (Coriander) Extract, Jasminum Officinale (Jasmine) Extract, Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Flower Extract, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Parfum (Fragrance), Cocos nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Gardenia Tahitensis Flower, Santalum Album (Sandalwood) Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Juniperus Communis Fruit Extract, Cananga Odorata Flower Extract, Aleurites Moluccana Seed Oil, Macadamia Ternifolia Seed Oil, Polyquaternium-11, Retinyl Palmitat, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Citric Acid, Benzyl Benzoate, Coumarin, Eugenol</li>
            <li> I have very fine, curly, natural AA hair that needs a lot of protein to stay healthy and this conditioner works really well for me. It has protein but yet it is very moisturizing, so I could easily use it as often as I like if I wanted to wash my hair more than once a week. The smell is strong and not my taste but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad so I can&#x27;t complain. I really like the pump on the bottle because the conditioner is extremely thick. I don&#x27;t know if I will keep buying it because it is expensive but buying from amazon saved me a ton of money- my 25 ounce bottle is cheaper than the 8 ounce bottles I see in the store!</li>
            <li> I have always liked Oatmeal &amp; Honey conditioner. It is getting difficult to find around my area. I hope it&#x27;s not going to be discontinued.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this for Christmas and I checked EVERYWHERE for it! It was being discontinued so no one had it in stock. I thought I would type it in Google and Amazon showed up! I was thrilled! I ordered 3 days before Christmas and just told her she would be getting it after the fact. But then!! To my amazement, it came the day before!! Thank you so much Amazon!! I will be seeing you in the near future!! :)</li>
            <li> I am surprised that I haven&#x27;t heard more people reccommend this Conditioner! It is wonderful! You do not need alot of conditioner... I have used two bottles of shampoo to every 1 bottle of conditioner. I started using it around Dec. 2007 and here it is nearing the end of Feb 2008 and I still LOVE it! It smells wonderful and leaves your hair silky soft! Works great to repair hair! My hair is not Dyed or permed but I had alot of split ends, this shampoo and conditioner helped ALOT! I can&#x27;t imagine using any other shampoo ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This is a good price but Ulta had this on sale for $9.99 for the same size bottle not too long ago. Also the last bottle of conditioner I ordered from Amazon came broken in the mail... instead of sending it back I transfered it to a new bottle.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  I am getting amazing results.  I am definitely a repeat buyer.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the money and it performs just as it should Just for an example, it increased the growth of my hair in thickness, length and volume by 4&amp;#34; over a 16 month period!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Great smell and allergy friendly!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my type of hair. It keeps my curls looking fabulous....</li>
            <li> My favorite! Does awesome on dry hair! Smells just like an oatmeal cookie! Long lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner and a great price.  It&#x27;s hard to find this in the stores and I was thrilled getting this so quickly.</li>
            <li> I received this in a used bottle (you could tell!) refilled with a different product. I have been purchasing Catwalk Oatmeal and Honey for years! It smells AMAZING! And this was defiantly NOT IT. I am so sad it turned out this way, I sent it back requesting a refund because im scared if I exchange it I will probably still not get the product, Just another refilled bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelf and was very relieved to find it in Amazon. It smells like cake icing. It is the only conditioner that truly feels like it goes into my hair. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is amazing, but it arrived with a cracked bottle and lost some of the product because of that.</li>
            <li> Love the Catwalk Oatmea &amp; Honey Treatment Shampoo and Condiitioner.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well. Not heavy, but not quite enough to calm the frizzies, either. I&#x27;m going to use this bottle and maybe try something else.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in the packaging as expected, but the contents seem to be thinner, almost watery compared to the same product I have received from other stores....</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted ! The old formula :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I ordered this because my hair had become so dry due to the hardness of the water when I moved to this new area. I definitely recommend.. I ordered standard shipping and the seller shipped it priority 2 day and I recieved within 48 hours from California to South Texas. Great product, fantastic service.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It leaves my hair smelling so good and it does help my hair.  I have my hair colored and I live in a very dry area. This conditioner helps my hair all year long.</li>
            <li> This product must have been sitting on selves collecting dust for a very long time because the product had settled so badly that no matter what I did to mix it, it just ended up separated again. I thought this was going to be a great deal because I have used Tigi Catwalk Oatmeal and Honey before and absolutely loved it (purchased from my hairdresser) but this did not even smell the same. After a couple days, it went into the trash!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Most of all it really works.  My hair was totally dry and lifeless and it seemed nothing would help even tons of conditioner. I used this with the Catwalk conditioner and my locks are flowing with life and vitality again.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for over a year and my color treated hair is pretty much restored. I totally recommend it.</li>
