            <li> My favorite of all time and hard to get where i live.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair with natural light curls</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and does not leave my hair stiff feeling or oily.</li>
            <li> If you want a dry look, put it on when your hair is almost dry.</li>
            <li> If you want a wet look, put it on wet.</li>
            <li> You can put it on thick and not get the white residue.</li>
            <li> I use a little everyday.</li>
            <li> Is thick and requires little product to work.  </li>
            <li> With a small amount it holds my hair in place and gives it the piecey textured look that I like so well.</li>
            <li> It holds hair without making it hard.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this product which gave body and definition to my limp, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Have thin hair and this gives it bulk and life.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive to buy in the salon, so I found it online!</li>

            <li> luv this product.  Washes out of your hair easy, wish i could by it at the local store. You can put it on thick and not get the white residue. Dissolves with water easily.  No wax residue.  I have tried many from salons and local stores.  I returned to this product</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a strong hold without that gelled up wet look this is the product. My hairdresser used it and I have been using ever since.</li>
            <li> If you are really going to use any kind of transforming paste, this is the one to buy.&lt;br /&gt;The additional free oz. made it even more attractive. Great Product. J Stokes</li>

            <li> I love this product.  Have been using it for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about 3 years. I have very thick hair with natural light curls and I prefer short hair styles. The Aquage product is great. With a small amount it holds my hair in place and gives it the piecey textured look that I like so well. It leaves my hair very soft and does not leave my hair stiff feeling or oily. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Holds and shines hair very well.  Excellent product.  Have recommended it to family and friends.  I enjoy using it daily.</li>

            <li> Is what it is: great styling product for hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for my hair.  It allows me to have two good hair days before I need to wash again and provides&lt;br /&gt;great body.  Only wish they&#x27;d had this stuff 30 years ago continuously.&lt;br /&gt;C</li>
            <li> Smells great! Never stiff! Holds wonderfully well..creates body. My favorite of all time and hard to get where i live.</li>
