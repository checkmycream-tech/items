            <li>This is the greatest product ever for bleached, dry damaged hair-</li>
            <li>It is so strong and full of bounce and shine!</li>
            <li>I used it maybe once a week when I first got it and have since switched over to once every 2-4 weeks since I want to make sure that I don&#x27;t over-do it.</li>

            <li>I then can wear my curly hair natural.</li>
            <li>so I anticipate it lasting quite a few more months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Up until now, I was clear coating my hair after the coloring process but due to a recent disaster of unmitigated proportions, I went to my current stylist, absolutely despondent.</li>
            <li>People say this product makes your hair stronger , but to me it make so hard to manage , you really need to be under the water for a long time , to rinse this product very will and then apply a lot of conditioner ...</li>

            <li> I get noticeably fewer tangles and overall feel like my hair is less fragile.</li>
            <li> I also have at least half a bottle left (I&#x27;ve got waist-length hair and really soak it with product when I use it)</li>

            <li> I love this product I have been using it for years for my curly hair. I used to pay between $45-$55 for a 16.9 oz bottle and I started buying this from amazon for almost 2 years now, you can&#x27;t beat the prices on here. and I love that it works better than gel and it helps my hair shine and when I get it blown out its so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product ever for bleached, dry damaged hair- I leave it on longer than instructed 45 min and rinse it off.  It feels slimy and takes several shampoos to take off the excess after application and follow up with a hair mask- and hair feels amazing- it is a miracle in a bottle. i only use it once or twice a month so one bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever come across! My entire life, I have had very weak, thin, brittle hair. My hair is a very light blonde and it gets even more damaged by being in the sun/ocean/pool/etc. I have tried numerous other deep conditioning and restorative products, and always thought that they did a good job restoring some strength and moisture to my hair, until I tried this. I used the top comments as a guide and barely recognize my hair after using this! It is so strong and full of bounce and shine! I get noticeably fewer tangles and overall feel like my hair is less fragile. The difference is even noticeable to people just looking at my hair, without even touching it! I would highly recommend this product! I used it maybe once a week when I first got it and have since switched over to once every 2-4 weeks since I want to make sure that I don&#x27;t over-do it. It&#x27;s been about 6 months so far, and I still really love it! I also have at least half a bottle left (I&#x27;ve got waist-length hair and really soak it with product when I use it) so I anticipate it lasting quite a few more months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: try it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This is my go to protien treatment.  I use it twice a month and it is amazing what it does!  Don&#x27;t forget to follow up with a deep conditioning treatment afterwards.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the basics, you have to treat your hair right, and this is perfect for it ! you can see better results the second time you wash your hair after using nexus. I love it</li>
            <li> Awesome!, excellent experience with this product.! i really recommended at all! i love it!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fulfill my expectations at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good Package</li>
            <li> I have relaxed thick, shoulder length hair. I am over 40. I noticed my hair was shedding terribly. It appeared to be overprocessed and damaged from heat. I decided to style my hair without heat, use deep conditioners at least twice a week, and use this product every other week. I am amazed!!! After 2 months of consistent use, I trimmed 3 inches off my hair. My hair now looks wonderful! My thickness and health has returned. I use this product as instructed. Although I thought about using it weekly, I did not. I do not use any other protein type products in my hair since this is in my regimen. I was patient and I do not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shedding and breakage is minimal for me now. If you had a lot of breakage/shedding and your hair looked unhealthy, I recommend eventually trimming the damaged hair. This product works, but it will not revive the damaged ends. For me, It helped me retain my length long enough for new healthy hair to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;Other tips you may find helpful- use a really good deep conditioner. I prefer the salon or high end brands. To balance out the protein, I co wash on Wednesdays and every other Sunday. I only use a Sulfate Free shampoo on the alternate Sunday when I use this treatment. After heavy workouts or buildup, I will co wash as needed. I use a deep conditioner after every co wash or wash.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep this product in my regimen for years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice in a month span with a silver dollar size of coconut oil to deep condition. My hair is definitely healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li> Restores limp lifeless hair.  Always worked.  Used twice in 20 years and never fails!</li>
            <li> The jury is still out but I think it&#x27;s too hard &amp; harsh in the hair.</li>
            <li> this is like botox to my hair!!!! It has strengthened my hair so much and has revitalized it by a lot. If you have damaged hair, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a former owner of a hair salon and never heard of this product until recently. Up until now, I was clear coating my hair after the coloring process but due to a recent disaster of unmitigated proportions, I went to my current stylist, absolutely despondent. She used this product, and I then tried it myself. I now have more hair than I&#x27;ve had in YEARS.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Ive only used this product three times and so far so good! I bleached the top of my hair and it damaged it extremly bad! It was very dry and brittle..i couldnt brush my hair when it was wet bec it would just break off :( using this has helped so much. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I leave in my hair overnight or all day and leaves my hair feeling healthier and shinny.  I sometimes use dilute with water and use as a type of gel to help with my frizzies.  I then can wear my curly hair natural.</li>
            <li> I used to pay$15 extra each time my hairdresser would put this treatment on me at salon for $30 you can buy full bottle here!</li>
            <li> This is the product to get you hair looking healthy and beautiful. Stick with it and you will see the amazing and vitalizing change in your hair!</li>
            <li> My hair was fried from highlights. I was told by my hairdresser that this may work and boy did it. In just two uses I felt a tremendous improvement in my hair. It become shiny soft and i couldnt be any happier!!!  a must try!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my beautician to control breakage in my hair. So FAR SO GOOD!!! Love the look and the feel</li>
            <li> I have used the product three times. I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference yet. Maybe time will tell.</li>
            <li> People say this product makes your hair stronger , but to me it make so hard to manage , you really need to be under the water for a long time , to rinse this product very will and then apply a lot of conditioner ... Not that great to me</li>
            <li> I havent seen any change yet. I hope this is the real product and nit fraudulent. I have used this product in the past.  I would.say anout five years ago and had.a better response.</li>
