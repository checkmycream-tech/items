            <li>Good product and it works.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t hear any complaints it must be good.</li>
            <li>I thought that mineral oil as first ingredient sounded not that great, but this product had very good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, feels good, smells great, I use on my hair and beard, keeping both healthy, thick and smelling and looking good!</li>
            <li>I used this years ago and it was great, but when i ordered it, it was very liquidy</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Its smell, texture, color, and presentation.</li>
            <li>I love palmers, but I think it is cheaper in the hair store than the internet</li>
            <li>This is the best hair product I have ever known and I had been searching frantically for it and finally saw it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love The Smell, My Hair Is Growing &amp;</li>
            <li>Its one of the best hair oil for hair because not only isn&#x27;t it greasy but it absorbs and keeps in moister.</li>
            <li>No smell and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>In my areas (Bronx NY)it used to be sort of cheap</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t feel like it was the true stuff.  </li>
            <li>Not \\&quot;bouncy, full of life, moisturized coated\\&quot;, but \\&quot;I&#x27;ve just spread a stick of butter over my hair coated\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommened using Palmer&#x27;s Hair Success because it has Vitamin E.  </li>
            <li>This combination was a recipe for success.  </li>
            <li>Worth it esp for hair growth and strength.</li>
            <li>Well, when I first got the package I took a shower and used it right away.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more bottles before I actually found out.</li>
            <li>Well, I thought it would work better as a rinse out treatment, so I tried it a couple of days later (rinse out application is recommended on weekly basis)...</li>
            <li>Now, I use this everyday and shampoo every two weeks with Optimum Oil Therapy shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I currently have natural twists and this works perfectly to moisturize my scalp and to keep my baby hairs and new growth down.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys, I have it now.</li>
            <li>it really does work.</li>
            <li>it made my hair look very oily, so I had to wash it again.</li>
            <li>Shiny And New.</li>
            <li>Also the water is very soft in my area.</li>
            <li>I began using this product on my then 1 year old who was BALD!  </li>
            <li>it really makes it soft and for people who have relaxed hair it really does promote growth especially if your hair is relaxed and</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my niece who swore by this product, so I decided that I will try it and to my surprise it makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li>my mother used this in my hair about 5yrs old...</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for people who have natural hair</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to go natural, especially for little girls.  </li>
            <li>My hair is chin long, natural, had highlights done one year ago, no hair color, so the product couldn&#x27;t be affected by chemicals or etc..</li>
            <li>Went to straight to the bin as shipping it back from outside the states is not worth it.</li>

            <li> Well, my little one is now 4 years old and she has long ponytails!  </li>
            <li> This makes your hair very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Hoping it will stop the breakage of my long black hair.</li>

            <li> I have tried a lot of hair conditioning products, this is the biggest disappointment so far, it actually caused trouble in my case.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Used a bit after washing and drying my hair, as the instructions recommend for everyday use -</li>
            <li> and I used just a little bit of the product!</li>
            <li> I think I will use this everyday!!</li>
            <li> Zero stars as the product is fake.</li>

            <li> I used this years ago and it was great, but when i ordered it, it was very liquidy and i don&#x27;t feel like it was the true stuff.  will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I began using this product on my then 1 year old who was BALD!  My stylist recommened using Palmer&#x27;s Hair Success because it has Vitamin E.  Well, my little one is now 4 years old and she has long ponytails!  Now, I use this everyday and shampoo every two weeks with Optimum Oil Therapy shampoo and conditioner.

            <li> Best product my wife has been using it as a treatment, it works for her .&lt;br /&gt; Now I have  ordered it for 3rd times .</li>
            <li> No smell and glides on smoothly. Hoping it will stop the breakage of my long black hair. Package was received perfectly in bubble wrap. Will recommend product and seller.</li>
            <li> Well, when I first got the package I took a shower and used it right away. Then after about a week or two I noticed that my hair was actually staring to get longer. Because everyone was like your hair looks longer!! I love this product!! I think I will use this everyday!!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair I could have bought it at Sally&#x27;s and saved some money but it&#x27;s ok it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product for over 40 years..!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my niece who swore by this product, so I decided that I will try it and to my surprise it makes my hair feel so soft and it brings a lot of body to my hair. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to go natural, especially for little girls.  Wish it was in all the beauty supplies stores I had to go online to find it.</li>
            <li> I love it. I love Its smell, texture, color, and presentation. This hair cream it&#x27;s very pleasant.  I&#x27;ll continue buying it.</li>
            <li> I love palmers, but I think it is cheaper in the hair store than the internet and you get a bigger jar</li>
            <li> Zero stars as the product is fake. The package arrived broken, the prints on the jar are fake and are different than the original packaging. the consistency is like glue and smells like glue. Went to straight to the bin as shipping it back from outside the states is not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever known and I had been searching frantically for it and finally saw it on Amazon. Thanks guys, I have it now. Great for all hair types</li>
            <li> Love The Smell, My Hair Is Growing &amp; It Keeps My Hair Shiny And New. Will Be Buying Forever And Ever</li>
            <li> my hair actually grew faster it used to grow an inch every month or so now it grows about 3 every week it really does work.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for two weeks no results. My baby hair hasn&#x27;t crowed yet</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet....</li>
            <li> Since I was younger my mother used this in my hair about 5yrs old... I am 26 now. Its one of the best hair oil for hair because not only isn&#x27;t it greasy but it absorbs and keeps in moister. I would definitely recommend for people who have natural hair it really makes it soft and for people who have relaxed hair it really does promote growth especially if your hair is relaxed and you corn row it. One of the best growth oil. In my areas (Bronx NY)it used to be sort of cheap but now its like 12.00 a jar. Worth it esp for hair growth and strength.</li>
            <li> Good product and it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and I don&#x27;t know what she thought about it I didn&#x27;t hear any complaints it must be good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, feels good, smells great, I use on my hair and beard, keeping both healthy, thick and smelling and looking good!</li>
            <li> This product works great for my daughters hair it holds their ponytails in place, gives hair shine and doesn&#x27;t make hair greasy.</li>
            <li> This makes your hair very dry and brittle. I ordered 2 more bottles before I actually found out.</li>
            <li> I thought that mineral oil as first ingredient sounded not that great, but this product had very good reviews, so I decided to give it a try. Used a bit after washing and drying my hair, as the instructions recommend for everyday use - it made my hair look very oily, so I had to wash it again. Well, I thought it would work better as a rinse out treatment, so I tried it a couple of days later (rinse out application is recommended on weekly basis)... The stuff didn&#x27;t rinse out with water and I used just a little bit of the product! I shampooed hair four times to get it off. My hair still felt coated. Not \\&quot;bouncy, full of life, moisturized coated\\&quot;, but \\&quot;I&#x27;ve just spread a stick of butter over my hair coated\\&quot;. I literally had to stay inside all weekend. Washing it again, twice with clarifying shampoo the other day didn&#x27;t help, the stuff came off a little, but I still had to wear a head scarf to work - that is how oily my hair looked. The only positive thing I noticed is that the treatment conditions my nail cuticles - at least I can use it for something. I have tried a lot of hair conditioning products, this is the biggest disappointment so far, it actually caused trouble in my case. My hair is chin long, natural, had highlights done one year ago, no hair color, so the product couldn&#x27;t be affected by chemicals or etc.. Also the water is very soft in my area. This treatment might work for someone with long hair, applying just to dry ends very little and very carefully.</li>
            <li> I currently have natural twists and this works perfectly to moisturize my scalp and to keep my baby hairs and new growth down. Def recommend this for upkeep on braids or twists.</li>
