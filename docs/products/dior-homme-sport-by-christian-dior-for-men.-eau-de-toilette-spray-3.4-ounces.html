            <li> This cologne is okay, i guess its not for me. The smell is really citrusy, and i mean it lol. It smells like lemon.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells gorgeous. I purchased for my son for Christmas. He always gets compliments. Will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Bought Dior Homme Sport by Christian Dior Eau De Toilette Spray as a gift for my husband. Smell very good. Resistance too great. Advise!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent cologne from a well known trademark.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using since 3 years and it is one of my favorites, their citric smell is very nice and last much time in my skin.</li>
            <li> It soft but a good Eau. It is perfect for the day.</li>
            <li> great, works very well me i always get complements on it.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of lemons/oranges mixed with ginger than this is for you. The dry down on this cologne is excellent and very versatile. I dont get the best longevity out of this on my skin (maybe 6hrs max) however if i spray my clothes it somewhat counters that. Overall great purchase and decent price for the amount</li>
            <li> This was a knock-off of the original scent.  It was really strong and actually gave me a headache.  Buyers beware!!!!! Since this is classified as a hazardous material from Amazon, they would not let me return it.  Unfortunately, I bought 2 bottles and now and out $155.  Live and learn......</li>
            <li> VERY MEAN AND SELFISH COMPANY, THEY DIDN&#x27;T MEET MY SATISFACTION AND I ALSO GOT THE WRONG PRODUCT . GO TO FRAGRANCE.NET INSTEAD</li>
            <li> A fantastic fragrance! Ginger, lemon, iris. Smooth long lasting fragrance that will fit almost every occasion. Very versatile fragrance and a COMPLIMENT GETTER for sure!</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> was supposed to order the Dior Homme but ordered this by mistake I can say I am not disappointed as well as the person who received it. Great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell only lasts for 2 or 3 hours. It doesn&#x27;t look like the original one</li>
            <li> Good fragrance. I was looking for Dior Homme, not sport.&lt;br /&gt;Dior Homme it&#x27;s better but this it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shiping and good service.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered.  Fast shipping!  Perfect Christmas gift ans my son was thrilled when he opened the package. He was one happy camper!</li>

            <li> My husband loves this cologne.  I bought this instead of intense and he was glad he had another bottle to last him because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Not the one I wanted . I am not of fan of citrusy . I love the original one though! I get compliments all day and stays on for the whole day</li>
