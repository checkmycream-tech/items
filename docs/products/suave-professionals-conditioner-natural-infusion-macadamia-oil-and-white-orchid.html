            <li>This is a great conditioner in terms of providing hydration and helping to keep my hair tangle-free.</li>
            <li>I had to guess, this product could be great for someone with severely damaged hair.</li>
            <li>but they are for me now - they are great used together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is amazing considering how great the product is.</li>
            <li>And a good price.</li>
            <li>In sum, the formula is good, but I can&#x27;t get over the scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and absolutely wonderful and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The good thing with Suave is the price along with the performance of the products.</li>
            <li>It does smell good and does a good job of detangling and conditioning, but I do have to use a lot of it at a time.</li>
            <li>This line of shampoos and conditioners is exceptional.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Wonderful combination, best for dry and/or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is delightful with just the right aroma of floral and sophistication.  </li>

            <li>It conditions, makes my hair very soft and has excellent slip - good for wash and go&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Amazing value.</li>
            <li>It’s good, just needs more improvement.</li>
            <li>This conditioner allowed me to comb through my hair after washing and conditioning my hair, which was nice.  </li>
            <li>After I run out of this bottle, I will continue to purchase this line of conditioner, because it smells so nice.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, this conditioner smells wonderful and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>They rinse out nicely and leave the hair well conditioned.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the new Suave Professionals line.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so good and at a price that I can easily afford.  </li>
            <li>I thought it did a good job conditioning my fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t liked them, but this one is much better than the others.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of strong floral fragrances you will love this!</li>
            <li>Good price, quickly came</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>macadamia oil and white orchid scent smells wonderful without being over-powering and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair smelling of perfume -</li>
            <li>When I used it, it was okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of all of the Suave conditioners I was able to use this was my favorite</li>
            <li>While I enjoy this one because it has a nice scent, it does not provide the amount of moisture that I need.  </li>
            <li>(I love in Florida)</li>
            <li>I found that my hair didn&#x27;t have a lot of static after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is an ok conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the conditioner itself is luxuriant and like most Suave products the price is not high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but this would not be my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love the Suave Professionals line of conditioner.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I enjoyed any greater moisturization</li>
            <li>It is so lovely.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, relatively rich conditioner that leaves hair smooth and smelling nice.</li>
            <li>just a nice clean</li>
            <li>Great product, fast easy shipping.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, smells great though it&#x27;s a bit strong, detangling, and helps with the frizz caused by the summer humidity.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light scent that is refreshing.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle, the scent was pleasant with a sweet aroma.</li>
            <li>I love using Suave conditioner as shaving cream for my legs because it is cheaper and more effective than normal shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It rinses easily and I haven&#x27;t noticed any buildup.</li>
            <li>Suave&#x27;s Professionals line has been making some great hair products recently, with my favorite color care conditioner being their Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and this conditioner is very inexpensive and the best for my hair type.</li>
            <li>feel strong and manageable.</li>
            <li>While this Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil conditioner is good, I like their Moroccan Infusion conditioner even better.</li>
            <li>Of note, the scent is a bit strong</li>
            <li>I LIKE strong hair fragrance, so I like this a lot.  </li>
            <li>It works fine to soften</li>
            <li>Some may find it too strong, but I like great-smelling hair products and this fit the bill with me.</li>
            <li>This works for days when you want to do no-poo  and lightly condition.</li>
            <li>i cannot believe it&#x27;s this cheap as add-on item.</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus I use with a Light Leave-In Cream.  </li>
            <li>I have waist-length hair, and conditioner is an important part of my haircare regime.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner also has a nice detangling effect, which has made combing my hair out much easier.</li>
            <li>This is such a great find for the price.</li>
            <li>This a fantastic addition.  </li>
            <li>If you have to use a ton of it, it really isn&#x27;t worth it because you are using it up faster and buying it more often.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this conditioner from Suave.  </li>
            <li>I have a feeling that it could genuinely work wonders.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does a good job of getting my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The floral scent is pretty, and I was pleased at how quickly and easily it washed out since a lot of &amp;</li>
            <li>This works for my long hair style and I&#x27;m basically quite happy with it except for the scent.  </li>
            <li>first of all, i love the smell.</li>
            <li>I original buy this set for the guest to use.</li>
            <li>If you have hair, this product will help you get it clean-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my daughter&#x27;s fine semi-curly hair as well, with success.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is true.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my frizzy, coarse hair though I really liked the warm vanilla scent lingering on my hair for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>It does work well as a detangler and the price is certainly reasonable but for me there are better options out there.</li>
            <li>I have liked almost all of the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion conditioners.</li>
            <li>They are much nicer than most discount conditioners.</li>
            <li>So, all in all, I think this Macadamia Oil with White Orchid conditioner performed best on finer hair than very thick hair and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different varieties and they have all been great for my hair!</li>
            <li>I have now begun shopping for a new favorite product.  </li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and rinses cleanly, leaving hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great fragrance - it&#x27;s a sweet floral with green notes.  </li>
            <li>My entire family uses this conditioner and I am so glad I found this product line!</li>
            <li>I can certainly feel the change in my hair after using it, to really make the product stand out for me, I think it needs to offer more features.</li>
            <li>Love Suave Professional conditioners</li>
            <li>This natural infusion conditioner does and it is safe for color treated hair (a MUST for me).</li>
            <li>We have enjoyed trying the Suave Natural Infusion conditioners.</li>
            <li>I am currently using this conditioner with the shampoo of its kind</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy, it leaves me hair looking and feeling great, and I also really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>For me I have hair that goes through allot of styling, coloring and other chemical procedures and this helped my hair feel soft, look great</li>
            <li>Obviously, it&#x27;s aimed more for women while we guys will probably prefer Axe products.</li>
            <li>Hair really feels hydrated after i finish showering!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>The smell is okay, if you like floral scents (I&#x27;m not a big fan of the fragrance).</li>
            <li>Those who enjoy the scent of white orchids and musk-like florals will enjoy the scent of this product, but those who don&#x27;t really won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would try to smell it first-</li>
            <li>white orchid is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>The White Orchid smell is very strong and reminiscent of cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and feeling nice throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most of them, this one conditioned my hair, not too heavy, not too light.</li>
            <li>While I consider the usual Suave just what it is, inexpensive shampoo, I&#x27;ve long been impressed by the Suave Professionals line.  </li>
            <li>and I am enjoying the shine and silkiness of my hair &amp;#34;again&amp;#34; after a long winter.  </li>
            <li>the company site is good to give out samples, and they usually have them in sample bins.  </li>
            <li>It works in easily, and left my hair feeling silky.  </li>
            <li>and it makes her hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I actually DO like the scent, but it&#x27;s too strong for my hair, and definitely too strong for the shower.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>but i like it so much that i&#x27;m using it myself.</li>
            <li>The real test though will be after leaving the beach at the ocean in the warmer months as I always put conditioner in my hair for the ride home to help restore some of the moisture that has been taken out from the sun and sand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing with optimism this has to do with the oil craze going on (which so far, in my experience, is a craze worth it.)</li>
            <li>youngest daughter who has finer, oily hair really likes this conditioner and she says she loves the smell</li>
            <li>but it was gentle and conditioned well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The conditioner works very well for it&#x27;s price range.  </li>
            <li>Both are nice options for an everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is listed as being for normal to dry hair and is also safe for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>product came taped up which is a HUGE plus as I&#x27;ve had Amazon items like this come to me, sans tape, in a huge mess!  </li>
            <li>This new line tries to keep in step with the new oil craze that is sweeping through hair products and does work nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products to help repair the damage.</li>
            <li>in mind I live in Florida and this really does seem to help with the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish it had more moisturizing properties i end up using the deep conditioning mask from this same line instead.</li>
            <li>I have used various lines of Pureology for many years now and this Suave is not even remotely similar to any that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner does have a heavy scent that lingers, so those who are sensitive to that kind of fragrance might want to stay away from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has decent conditioning and detangling properties.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the floral fragrance, however it did not linger in my hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, it works better than some a bit more expensive than it is.  </li>
            <li>What I really enjoyed about it was the light scent, which did seem to last longer than some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the Suave professionals line of haircare products.</li>
            <li>If I had to recommend a product under $3 I would recommend this one, but under normal circumstances I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li>The ends are very prone to drying out and splitting, so when I saw that this White Orchid conditioner was supposed to be very moisturizing, I decided to try</li>
            <li>Even close to 2 days later, it still smelled very nice when I took it down, and my rather dry ends continued to feel soft and conditioned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am growing out layers in my fine, color treated hair and it was not weighed down.</li>
            <li>that said, this is a little thicker/more rich than typical Suave conditioners - you can tell it is slightly better than the 99cent varieties.</li>
            <li>I have very soft, but</li>
            <li>The scent is described as macadamia and white orchid, but it&#x27;s much more of the former than the latter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally a fan of these Suave products, but this conditioner makes my hair smell like it has been drenched in an old lady&#x27;s perfume, that has been sitting on her dresser for over 40 years.</li>
            <li>This works very well - leaves my hair feeling very conditioned but not overly greasy or flat.</li>
            <li>The Black Raspberry + White Tea Shampoo &amp; Conditioner seems to smell better but doesn&#x27;t help with frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a generous amount of conditioner, in a simple bottle that is easy to use with wet hands,</li>
            <li>It leaves it feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried someone of the Suave Professional Natural line</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel pampered and silky soft like what you would get from a salon.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I think it makes my hair TOO soft, compared to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and it seems to work just as good as my expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the thick feel of this product.</li>
            <li>It smelled lovely all day but subtly so.</li>
            <li>It does condition decently, even if it doesn&#x27;t have any lasting results or improvements on the hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know WHAT it is about this conditioner, but it makes my hair soft as no other.</li>
            <li>my long hair uniformly well conditioned, with lots of volume, and very silky.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair (3b), that is also very long.  </li>
            <li>They are thick and spread easily through the hair.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving this conditioner four stars instead of five is because the White Orchid scent is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I have a mixed Caribbean hair (extremely wavy at roots and unruly at the tips), and you can just feel the softness of this right after you apply it.</li>
            <li>As long as I rinse my hair extra well, it leaves my hair soft and clean looking, but not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>that’s enough to detangle my hair and keep the natural bounce.  </li>
            <li>This Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid conditioner works well on my hair type.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it seems as though this conditioner is a bit too effective, perhaps?</li>
            <li>It is also wavy like, so I have to be careful with too much oil in a shampoo or a conditioner, therefore, I only use a dab of this conditioner -</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and I have a hard time finding conditioners that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down, or make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li>But like the other Macadamia Oil and White Orchid scented products from this line, it&#x27;s just a little too strong in the scent department.</li>
            <li>My other daughter who has thick, dryer hair says it works okay on her locks.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this conditioner and how it moisturizes my hair all the way down to the ends.  </li>
            <li>Pureology is highly concentrated, so I only have to use a tiny bit of it, whereas with this Suave I have to use probably at least 4 times more - we are talking a heaping handful compared to a small blob in my palm.</li>

            <li> /&gt;However, the conditioner itself is luxuriant and like most Suave products the price is not high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this would not be my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love the Suave Professionals line of conditioner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I enjoyed any greater moisturization</li>
            <li> It is so lovely.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, relatively rich conditioner that leaves hair smooth and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> just a nice clean</li>
            <li> Great product, fast easy shipping.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, smells great though it&#x27;s a bit strong, detangling, and helps with the frizz caused by the summer humidity.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a light scent that is refreshing.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle, the scent was pleasant with a sweet aroma.</li>
            <li> I love using Suave conditioner as shaving cream for my legs because it is cheaper and more effective than normal shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It rinses easily and I haven&#x27;t noticed any buildup.</li>
            <li> Suave&#x27;s Professionals line has been making some great hair products recently, with my favorite color care conditioner being their Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this conditioner is very inexpensive and the best for my hair type.</li>
            <li> feel strong and manageable.</li>
            <li> While this Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil conditioner is good, I like their Moroccan Infusion conditioner even better.</li>
            <li> Of note, the scent is a bit strong</li>
            <li> I LIKE strong hair fragrance, so I like this a lot.  </li>
            <li> It works fine to soften</li>
            <li> Some may find it too strong, but I like great-smelling hair products and this fit the bill with me.</li>
            <li> This works for days when you want to do no-poo  and lightly condition.</li>
            <li> i cannot believe it&#x27;s this cheap as add-on item.</li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus I use with a Light Leave-In Cream.  </li>
            <li> I have waist-length hair, and conditioner is an important part of my haircare regime.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner also has a nice detangling effect, which has made combing my hair out much easier.</li>
            <li> This is such a great find for the price.</li>
            <li> This a fantastic addition.  </li>
            <li> If you have to use a ton of it, it really isn&#x27;t worth it because you are using it up faster and buying it more often.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this conditioner from Suave.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling that it could genuinely work wonders.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does a good job of getting my hair soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The floral scent is pretty, and I was pleased at how quickly and easily it washed out since a lot of &amp;</li>
            <li> This works for my long hair style and I&#x27;m basically quite happy with it except for the scent.  </li>
            <li> first of all, i love the smell.</li>
            <li> I original buy this set for the guest to use.</li>
            <li> If you have hair, this product will help you get it clean-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my daughter&#x27;s fine semi-curly hair as well, with success.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is true.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my frizzy, coarse hair though I really liked the warm vanilla scent lingering on my hair for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It does work well as a detangler and the price is certainly reasonable but for me there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> I have liked almost all of the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion conditioners.</li>
            <li> They are much nicer than most discount conditioners.</li>
            <li> So, all in all, I think this Macadamia Oil with White Orchid conditioner performed best on finer hair than very thick hair and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different varieties and they have all been great for my hair!</li>
            <li> I have now begun shopping for a new favorite product.  </li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and rinses cleanly, leaving hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great fragrance - it&#x27;s a sweet floral with green notes.  </li>
            <li> My entire family uses this conditioner and I am so glad I found this product line!</li>
            <li> I can certainly feel the change in my hair after using it, to really make the product stand out for me, I think it needs to offer more features.</li>
            <li> Love Suave Professional conditioners</li>
            <li> This natural infusion conditioner does and it is safe for color treated hair (a MUST for me).</li>
            <li> We have enjoyed trying the Suave Natural Infusion conditioners.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this conditioner with the shampoo of its kind</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy, it leaves me hair looking and feeling great, and I also really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> For me I have hair that goes through allot of styling, coloring and other chemical procedures and this helped my hair feel soft, look great</li>
            <li> Obviously, it&#x27;s aimed more for women while we guys will probably prefer Axe products.</li>
            <li> Hair really feels hydrated after i finish showering!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, if you like floral scents (I&#x27;m not a big fan of the fragrance).</li>
            <li> Those who enjoy the scent of white orchids and musk-like florals will enjoy the scent of this product, but those who don&#x27;t really won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would try to smell it first-</li>
            <li> white orchid is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> The White Orchid smell is very strong and reminiscent of cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and feeling nice throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like most of them, this one conditioned my hair, not too heavy, not too light.</li>
            <li> While I consider the usual Suave just what it is, inexpensive shampoo, I&#x27;ve long been impressed by the Suave Professionals line.  </li>
            <li> and I am enjoying the shine and silkiness of my hair &amp;#34;again&amp;#34; after a long winter.  </li>
            <li> the company site is good to give out samples, and they usually have them in sample bins.  </li>
            <li> It works in easily, and left my hair feeling silky.  </li>
            <li> and it makes her hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I actually DO like the scent, but it&#x27;s too strong for my hair, and definitely too strong for the shower.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> but i like it so much that i&#x27;m using it myself.</li>
            <li> The real test though will be after leaving the beach at the ocean in the warmer months as I always put conditioner in my hair for the ride home to help restore some of the moisture that has been taken out from the sun and sand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing with optimism this has to do with the oil craze going on (which so far, in my experience, is a craze worth it.)</li>
            <li> youngest daughter who has finer, oily hair really likes this conditioner and she says she loves the smell</li>
            <li> but it was gentle and conditioned well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The conditioner works very well for it&#x27;s price range.  </li>
            <li> Both are nice options for an everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is listed as being for normal to dry hair and is also safe for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> product came taped up which is a HUGE plus as I&#x27;ve had Amazon items like this come to me, sans tape, in a huge mess!  </li>
            <li> This new line tries to keep in step with the new oil craze that is sweeping through hair products and does work nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other products to help repair the damage.</li>
            <li> in mind I live in Florida and this really does seem to help with the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish it had more moisturizing properties i end up using the deep conditioning mask from this same line instead.</li>
            <li> I have used various lines of Pureology for many years now and this Suave is not even remotely similar to any that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner does have a heavy scent that lingers, so those who are sensitive to that kind of fragrance might want to stay away from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has decent conditioning and detangling properties.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the floral fragrance, however it did not linger in my hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, it works better than some a bit more expensive than it is.  </li>
            <li> What I really enjoyed about it was the light scent, which did seem to last longer than some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the Suave professionals line of haircare products.</li>
            <li> If I had to recommend a product under $3 I would recommend this one, but under normal circumstances I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> The ends are very prone to drying out and splitting, so when I saw that this White Orchid conditioner was supposed to be very moisturizing, I decided to try</li>
            <li> Even close to 2 days later, it still smelled very nice when I took it down, and my rather dry ends continued to feel soft and conditioned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am growing out layers in my fine, color treated hair and it was not weighed down.</li>
            <li> that said, this is a little thicker/more rich than typical Suave conditioners - you can tell it is slightly better than the 99cent varieties.</li>
            <li> I have very soft, but</li>
            <li> The scent is described as macadamia and white orchid, but it&#x27;s much more of the former than the latter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a fan of these Suave products, but this conditioner makes my hair smell like it has been drenched in an old lady&#x27;s perfume, that has been sitting on her dresser for over 40 years.</li>
            <li> This works very well - leaves my hair feeling very conditioned but not overly greasy or flat.</li>
            <li> The Black Raspberry + White Tea Shampoo &amp; Conditioner seems to smell better but doesn&#x27;t help with frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a generous amount of conditioner, in a simple bottle that is easy to use with wet hands,</li>
            <li> It leaves it feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried someone of the Suave Professional Natural line</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel pampered and silky soft like what you would get from a salon.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I think it makes my hair TOO soft, compared to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and it seems to work just as good as my expensive shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the thick feel of this product.</li>
            <li> It smelled lovely all day but subtly so.</li>
            <li> It does condition decently, even if it doesn&#x27;t have any lasting results or improvements on the hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know WHAT it is about this conditioner, but it makes my hair soft as no other.</li>
            <li> my long hair uniformly well conditioned, with lots of volume, and very silky.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair (3b), that is also very long.  </li>
            <li> They are thick and spread easily through the hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this conditioner four stars instead of five is because the White Orchid scent is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I have a mixed Caribbean hair (extremely wavy at roots and unruly at the tips), and you can just feel the softness of this right after you apply it.</li>
            <li> As long as I rinse my hair extra well, it leaves my hair soft and clean looking, but not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> that’s enough to detangle my hair and keep the natural bounce.  </li>
            <li> This Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid conditioner works well on my hair type.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems as though this conditioner is a bit too effective, perhaps?</li>
            <li> It is also wavy like, so I have to be careful with too much oil in a shampoo or a conditioner, therefore, I only use a dab of this conditioner -</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and I have a hard time finding conditioners that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down, or make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> But like the other Macadamia Oil and White Orchid scented products from this line, it&#x27;s just a little too strong in the scent department.</li>
            <li> My other daughter who has thick, dryer hair says it works okay on her locks.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this conditioner and how it moisturizes my hair all the way down to the ends.  </li>
            <li> Pureology is highly concentrated, so I only have to use a tiny bit of it, whereas with this Suave I have to use probably at least 4 times more - we are talking a heaping handful compared to a small blob in my palm.</li>
            <li> While pureology is too expensive for me to buy on a regular basis, it does have a tendency to give my fair, limp hair bounce.  </li>
            <li> I rotate my hair products, typically Paul Mitchell, L&#x27;oreal, Pantene, Tresemme and Suave and while people wont normally put Suave in that category for me it is.</li>
            <li> conditioner is a bit thicker than other Suave conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, but it is not heavy.  </li>
            <li> And, the overall effect was completely flat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the more expensive salon brands (Tres, Pantene, Sebastian), but I&#x27;m 100% for this one as long as they don&#x27;t change the formula.</li>
            <li> right now, it appears a bit dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and this conditioner works pretty well on it.</li>
            <li> it feeling very soft and shiny without feeling greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Even after only using a quarter sized bead of this conditioner my hair got oily quicker than with any other product I&#x27;ve used with the exception of a spray and leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> have very long hair and this leaves</li>
            <li> My hair requires conditioner during the winter months because of thow dry</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner that I have used for the last few years has recently changed their formula and it no longer provides the moisture that I need.  </li>
            <li> But, for slightly weather-worn or normal hair, this may be much to heavy.</li>
            <li> I smell a lot of nuts, and not very much orchid.  </li>
            <li> Also a conditioner that is only a condition produces less split ends one that is part of a 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fascinating to learn about some of the stuff that goes into these products searching gave me this info from the web: Behentrimonium chloride is a slightly flammable yellow waxlike organic compound used as an antistatic agent and a disinfectant.</li>
            <li> The polar vortex seems to have wreaked havoc on my hair ...</li>
            <li> In the past I have shied away from Suave shampoos and conditioners, I have thick wavy hair and they jut didn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair feeling as soft and nourished as some more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a heavier than expected conditioner.</li>
            <li> The final result was a bit heavy ...</li>
            <li> my thick curly highlighted 50 year old hair, enabling me to run a comb or brush through it for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The texture is somewhat thinner than other conditioners I have used, but it is Suave.</li>
            <li> It definitely does not compare to Pureology, so I am not sure how they can even bring themselves to state that it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other conditioners in the Suave Professionals line, and I&#x27;ll keep using them, but this one I&#x27;ll have to pass on due to the scent overload.</li>
            <li> #34;moisturizing&amp;#34; conditioners tend to weigh hair down and make it feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using this for very long, but the ends of my hair do feel softer and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It is commonly found in cosmetics such as conditioners, hair dye, mousse and  detergents.</li>
            <li> fragrance is rather feminine though, and it is stronger than your average hair product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, nor does it straighten out my curls.</li>
            <li> I have dry, color treated hair and am past fifty</li>
            <li> , my hair was slightly greasy.</li>
            <li> I have less hair breakage today</li>
            <li> Not much more than I would have expected from Suave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wash my hair everyday and use dry shampoo in between washes because otherwise I get split ends, but with this conditioner, I would have to wash everyday.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a little oily by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff still made my hair a little oilier feeling than I like.  </li>
            <li> I also leave a little in my hair before styling.</li>
            <li> would prefer a fresher scent and one that was not so heavy.</li>
            <li> at the roots, my hair was limp and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a heavy conditioner.</li>
            <li> thick hair (it&#x27;s not coarse, but is thick).</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s pretty bad.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is with the scent.  </li>
            <li> It performs just as well if not better in some cases.</li>
            <li> It helped get the tangles out of my hair that had been braided and was left a bit twisted together still when I shampooed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Try it, it&#x27;s really affordable (and about $2.50 at Walmart too) and you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t totally awful, although I have never heard a stylist recommend or even speak well of Suave (or various other low end brands).</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve seen some conditions just leave my very thick hair just... limp).</li>
            <li> My medium length hair isn&#x27;t too thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but not lotion-y; and it spreads evenly through my hair.</li>
            <li> This is not an exaggeration; I seriously cannot handle it.</li>
            <li> In water treatment, it acts as an algaecide, irritating, toxic to aquatic organisms.</li>
            <li> I have over-processed, baby-fine thin, loosly curly hair hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a freezing, brutal winter.</li>
            <li> Read about it anywhere - it is awful for hair and hair health</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, fast easy shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. And a good price.</li>
            <li> Love Suave Professional conditioners</li>
            <li> I can certainly feel the change in my hair after using it, to really make the product stand out for me, I think it needs to offer more features. It’s good, just needs more improvement.</li>
            <li> Wish it had more moisturizing properties i end up using the deep conditioning mask from this same line instead. This works for days when you want to do no-poo  and lightly condition.</li>

            <li> Great conditioner at a great price. Hair really feels hydrated after i finish showering!</li>
            <li> first of all, i love the smell. it&#x27;s the mix of floral and shea butter smell. neither is too over powering, that&#x27;s what I like. it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy.  nourish my hair well. i cannot believe it&#x27;s this cheap as add-on item. I original buy this set for the guest to use. but i like it so much that i&#x27;m using it myself.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing conditioner works well on my hair.  It leaves it feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The macadamia oil and white orchid scent smells wonderful without being over-powering and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair smelling of perfume - just a nice clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is listed as being for normal to dry hair and is also safe for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the new Suave Professionals line. I have tried several different varieties and they have all been great for my hair! In the past I have shied away from Suave shampoos and conditioners, I have thick wavy hair and they jut didn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair feeling as soft and nourished as some more expensive brands. This natural infusion conditioner does and it is safe for color treated hair (a MUST for me). The only reason I am giving this conditioner four stars instead of five is because the White Orchid scent is a little too strong for me. If you are a fan of strong floral fragrances you will love this!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle, the scent was pleasant with a sweet aroma. The texture is somewhat thinner than other conditioners I have used, but it is Suave. When I used it, it was okay. It definitely conditioned my hair, but I felt like it left a film and the next day, my hair was slightly greasy. I don&#x27;t usually wash my hair everyday and use dry shampoo in between washes because otherwise I get split ends, but with this conditioner, I would have to wash everyday. I have very soft, but thick hair (it&#x27;s not coarse, but is thick).</li>
            <li> My medium length hair isn&#x27;t too thick but I sometimes still have problems with conditioners not leaving it &amp;#34;comb-ready,&amp;#34; so to speak.  This conditioner allowed me to comb through my hair after washing and conditioning my hair, which was nice.  It left my hair soft and feeling nice throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light scent that is refreshing. I didn&#x27;t expect it to last and it didn&#x27;t.  I didn&#x27;t take a star off because of my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all of the Suave conditioners I was able to use this was my favorite and I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came taped up which is a HUGE plus as I&#x27;ve had Amazon items like this come to me, sans tape, in a huge mess!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of conditioners out there. Like most of them, this one conditioned my hair, not too heavy, not too light. What I really enjoyed about it was the light scent, which did seem to last longer than some I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Leave for 1-3 minutes. Rinse.  Plus I use with a Light Leave-In Cream.  I have less hair breakage today then I did decades ago before I started using a conditioner after shampooing. Also a conditioner that is only a condition produces less split ends one that is part of a 2 in 1 shampoo/conditioner combo. It works fine to soften my thick curly highlighted 50 year old hair, enabling me to run a comb or brush through it for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fascinating to learn about some of the stuff that goes into these products searching gave me this info from the web: Behentrimonium chloride is a slightly flammable yellow waxlike organic compound used as an antistatic agent and a disinfectant. It is commonly found in cosmetics such as conditioners, hair dye, mousse and  detergents. In water treatment, it acts as an algaecide, irritating, toxic to aquatic organisms.</li>
            <li> I have waist-length hair, and conditioner is an important part of my haircare regime.  The ends are very prone to drying out and splitting, so when I saw that this White Orchid conditioner was supposed to be very moisturizing, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is a bit thicker than other Suave conditioners I&#x27;ve tried, but it is not heavy.  The floral scent is pretty, and I was pleased at how quickly and easily it washed out since a lot of &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; conditioners tend to weigh hair down and make it feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using this for very long, but the ends of my hair do feel softer and less frizzy.  The conditioner also has a nice detangling effect, which has made combing my hair out much easier.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner that I have used for the last few years has recently changed their formula and it no longer provides the moisture that I need.  I have now begun shopping for a new favorite product.  While I enjoy this one because it has a nice scent, it does not provide the amount of moisture that I need.  I have tried almost this entire line because it is comparable to pureology within their description.  I don&#x27;t know if that is true.  While pureology is too expensive for me to buy on a regular basis, it does have a tendency to give my fair, limp hair bounce.  This does not.  This one is heavier than others within the same line.  It leaves my hair a little oily by the end of the day.  I don&#x27;t think it is meant for day to day use.</li>
            <li> This line of shampoos and conditioners is exceptional. I&#x27;m a fan of the Macadamia Oil and White Orchid conditioner by Suave. It works well with my 4A hair (I use it for deep conditioning) and it smells great. After I run out of this bottle, I will continue to purchase this line of conditioner, because it smells so nice.</li>
            <li> I love using Suave conditioner as shaving cream for my legs because it is cheaper and more effective than normal shaving cream. The White Orchid smell is very strong and reminiscent of cheap perfume. I would not purchase this scent again.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and it seems to work just as good as my expensive shampoo. I like to change up my shampoo and conditioner once in awhile and to get different treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind I live in Florida and this really does seem to help with the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I also bought the conditioner I believe in not splitting up the set and I am really really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside I&#x27;m NOT too happy about the smell until it dries or maybe I get use to it. The Black Raspberry + White Tea Shampoo &amp; Conditioner seems to smell better but doesn&#x27;t help with frizz. (I love in Florida)</li>
            <li> I love the thick feel of this product. It coats every strand of my hair and helps lock in moisture. I found that my hair didn&#x27;t have a lot of static after using this conditioner. I found it to be moisturizing without leaving my hair greasy. The price is amazing considering how great the product is. I would highly recommend the Suave professionals line of haircare products. Amazing value.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does a good job of getting my hair soft and smooth.  It works in easily, and left my hair feeling silky.  My only real complaint is with the scent.  The scent is described as macadamia and white orchid, but it&#x27;s much more of the former than the latter.  I smell a lot of nuts, and not very much orchid.  I&#x27;m not a fan of a conditioner that smells like a snack.  In sum, the formula is good, but I can&#x27;t get over the scent.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair (3b), that is also very long.  I got this after reading the reviews on Amazon and I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;ve tried someone of the Suave Professional Natural line and I haven&#x27;t liked them, but this one is much better than the others. Very moisturizing, smells great though it&#x27;s a bit strong, detangling, and helps with the frizz caused by the summer humidity.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this back-to-back, but I would recommend it and I plan on purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li> If you have hair, this product will help you get it clean-</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my frizzy, coarse hair though I really liked the warm vanilla scent lingering on my hair for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This Suave Conditioner is wonderful.  It makes your hair feel pampered and silky soft like what you would get from a salon.  The fragrance is light and absolutely wonderful and lasts all day.  My hair has never felt so good and at a price that I can easily afford.  The real test though will be after leaving the beach at the ocean in the warmer months as I always put conditioner in my hair for the ride home to help restore some of the moisture that has been taken out from the sun and sand.  Summer where are you.</li>
            <li> I have over-processed, baby-fine thin, loosly curly hair hair. I&#x27;ve tried so many other products to help repair the damage. This is such a great find for the price. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, nor does it straighten out my curls. I love it!</li>
            <li> Boo. Has sulfates. Number one killer of a shampoo. Read about it anywhere - it is awful for hair and hair health</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a fan of these Suave products, but this conditioner makes my hair smell like it has been drenched in an old lady&#x27;s perfume, that has been sitting on her dresser for over 40 years. This is not an exaggeration; I seriously cannot handle it.</li>
            <li> While I consider the usual Suave just what it is, inexpensive shampoo, I&#x27;ve long been impressed by the Suave Professionals line.  This a fantastic addition.  It conditions just as one dreams a conditioner can do with wonderful shine and softness as the result (I&#x27;ve seen some conditions just leave my very thick hair just... limp). I&#x27;m guessing with optimism this has to do with the oil craze going on (which so far, in my experience, is a craze worth it.) The smell is delightful with just the right aroma of floral and sophistication.  Some may find it too strong, but I like great-smelling hair products and this fit the bill with me. Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Good price, quickly came</li>
            <li> We have enjoyed trying the Suave Natural Infusion conditioners. This is a nice, relatively rich conditioner that leaves hair smooth and smelling nice. The good thing with Suave is the price along with the performance of the products. This new line tries to keep in step with the new oil craze that is sweeping through hair products and does work nicely. I tend to switch around conditioners and this one has worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My youngest daughter who has finer, oily hair really likes this conditioner and she says she loves the smell and it makes her hair super soft. My other daughter who has thick, dryer hair says it works okay on her locks. I thought it did a good job conditioning my fine hair. So, all in all, I think this Macadamia Oil with White Orchid conditioner performed best on finer hair than very thick hair and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> This is an ok conditioner. Not much more than I would have expected from Suave. It definitely does not compare to Pureology, so I am not sure how they can even bring themselves to state that it does. I have used various lines of Pureology for many years now and this Suave is not even remotely similar to any that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, this is a little thicker/more rich than typical Suave conditioners - you can tell it is slightly better than the 99cent varieties. It does smell good and does a good job of detangling and conditioning, but I do have to use a lot of it at a time. If you have to use a ton of it, it really isn&#x27;t worth it because you are using it up faster and buying it more often. Pureology is highly concentrated, so I only have to use a tiny bit of it, whereas with this Suave I have to use probably at least 4 times more - we are talking a heaping handful compared to a small blob in my palm. So, that gives an idea of the comparison between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t totally awful, although I have never heard a stylist recommend or even speak well of Suave (or various other low end brands). It does condition decently, even if it doesn&#x27;t have any lasting results or improvements on the hair. It rinses easily and I haven&#x27;t noticed any buildup. If I had to recommend a product under $3 I would recommend this one, but under normal circumstances I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and I definitely would never compare it to Pureology.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this conditioner from Suave.  It&#x27;s not too heavy, it leaves me hair looking and feeling great, and I also really like the smell.  I&#x27;m a fan of orchid as a scent, so I like that the smell lasts.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and this conditioner works pretty well on it. The smell is okay, if you like floral scents (I&#x27;m not a big fan of the fragrance). Suave&#x27;s Professionals line has been making some great hair products recently, with my favorite color care conditioner being their Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner. While this Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil conditioner is good, I like their Moroccan Infusion conditioner even better. Very similar, so if I couldn&#x27;t get my Suave Moroccan Infusion, I&#x27;d definitely get this Macadamia Oil instead. Both are nice options for an everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a heavier than expected conditioner. My hair requires conditioner during the winter months because of thow dry it is and how staticy my hair gets. Even after only using a quarter sized bead of this conditioner my hair got oily quicker than with any other product I&#x27;ve used with the exception of a spray and leave in conditioner. So that&#x27;s pretty bad. I had to switch back to Tresseme and this went in the closet as an emergency backup conditioner. The smell, though, is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I really like the scent of this conditioner and how it moisturizes my hair all the way down to the ends.  I am currently using this conditioner with the shampoo of its kind and I am enjoying the shine and silkiness of my hair &amp;#34;again&amp;#34; after a long winter.  My hair is fine-med texture and a couple of inches below my shoulders.  It is also wavy like, so I have to be careful with too much oil in a shampoo or a conditioner, therefore, I only use a dab of this conditioner - that’s enough to detangle my hair and keep the natural bounce.  Wonderful combination, best for dry and/or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does have a heavy scent that lingers, so those who are sensitive to that kind of fragrance might want to stay away from it.&lt;br /&gt;However, the conditioner itself is luxuriant and like most Suave products the price is not high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair and this leaves it feeling very soft and shiny without feeling greasy and heavy. It helped get the tangles out of my hair that had been braided and was left a bit twisted together still when I shampooed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer a fresher scent and one that was not so heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner in terms of providing hydration and helping to keep my hair tangle-free. It&#x27;s thick, but not lotion-y; and it spreads evenly through my hair. But like the other Macadamia Oil and White Orchid scented products from this line, it&#x27;s just a little too strong in the scent department. I actually DO like the scent, but it&#x27;s too strong for my hair, and definitely too strong for the shower. Those who enjoy the scent of white orchids and musk-like florals will enjoy the scent of this product, but those who don&#x27;t really won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other conditioners in the Suave Professionals line, and I&#x27;ll keep using them, but this one I&#x27;ll have to pass on due to the scent overload.</li>
            <li> I like the macademia and white orchid scent but this would not be my favorite conditioner.  I have dry, color treated hair and am past fifty but this stuff still made my hair a little oilier feeling than I like.  In my younger and greaser day this stuff would have been a disaster for me.  It does work well as a detangler and the price is certainly reasonable but for me there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> I love the Suave Professionals line of conditioner. I have natural hair and this conditioner is very inexpensive and the best for my hair type. It conditions, makes my hair very soft and has excellent slip - good for wash and go&#x27;s. I also leave a little in my hair before styling. My entire family uses this conditioner and I am so glad I found this product line!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a freezing, brutal winter. The polar vortex seems to have wreaked havoc on my hair ... right now, it appears a bit dry and dull. So, I thought this product could provide the shine and moisture that I need. Unfortunately, it seems as though this conditioner is a bit too effective, perhaps? The final result was a bit heavy ... at the roots, my hair was limp and greasy looking. And, the overall effect was completely flat hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to guess, this product could be great for someone with severely damaged hair. I have a feeling that it could genuinely work wonders. But, for slightly weather-worn or normal hair, this may be much to heavy.</li>
            <li> This product has decent conditioning and detangling properties. It applies smoothly and rinses cleanly, leaving hair feeling soft and smooth. I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the floral fragrance, however it did not linger in my hair. I am growing out layers in my fine, color treated hair and it was not weighed down. I can&#x27;t say I enjoyed any greater moisturization but it was gentle and conditioned well.  An inexpensive option, this product is an excellent detangler and a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> This works very well - leaves my hair feeling very conditioned but not overly greasy or flat. Of note, the scent is a bit strong so don&#x27;t use it if you are going to be in a meeting with coworkers for an hour or you&#x27;ll likely annoy them.  I don&#x27;t use this all the time as a result.</li>
            <li> I LIKE strong hair fragrance, so I like this a lot.  It&#x27;s a great fragrance - it&#x27;s a sweet floral with green notes.  When I used it with the seaweed and lotus shampoo, my hair ended up smelling a lot like Calyx.  I know they aren&#x27;t a &#x27;matched set&#x27; but they are for me now - they are great used together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner works very well for it&#x27;s price range.  In fact, it works better than some a bit more expensive than it is.  I like it a lot.  It&#x27;s a generous amount of conditioner, in a simple bottle that is easy to use with wet hands, even though it&#x27;s not fancy at all, it&#x27;s basic packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left my long hair uniformly well conditioned, with lots of volume, and very silky.  Even close to 2 days later, it still smelled very nice when I took it down, and my rather dry ends continued to feel soft and conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is rather feminine though, and it is stronger than your average hair product.  I would try to smell it first- the company site is good to give out samples, and they usually have them in sample bins.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and I have a hard time finding conditioners that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down, or make it look greasy.  This Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid conditioner works well on my hair type.  As long as I rinse my hair extra well, it leaves my hair soft and clean looking, but not weighed down.  I&#x27;ve used this on my daughter&#x27;s fine semi-curly hair as well, with success.  As a bonus, this conditioner smells wonderful and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have liked almost all of the Suave Professionals Natural Infusion conditioners. They are much nicer than most discount conditioners. They are thick and spread easily through the hair. They rinse out nicely and leave the hair well conditioned. This isn&#x27;t a heavy conditioner. It is a lighter conditioner but detangles nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white orchid is my favorite scent. It is so lovely. It smelled lovely all day but subtly so.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know WHAT it is about this conditioner, but it makes my hair soft as no other. I have a mixed Caribbean hair (extremely wavy at roots and unruly at the tips), and you can just feel the softness of this right after you apply it. I&#x27;ve been using the more expensive salon brands (Tres, Pantene, Sebastian), but I&#x27;m 100% for this one as long as they don&#x27;t change the formula. Try it, it&#x27;s really affordable (and about $2.50 at Walmart too) and you wont be disappointed. Sometimes I think it makes my hair TOO soft, compared to what I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The best product I ever used!</li>
