            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>Good product-I use it all the time</li>
            <li>This helps reduce the inflammation you incur while playing and it tastes and smells great too and is a nice substitute from chapstick that can leave your lips all greasy and have the mouthpiece slide everywhere.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the taste, I think it is a really good product and recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I can feel good about using it.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not as good as any of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>my son is a commited trupet player and thus needs a good lip miosturizer.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my dermatologist, really a good product.</li>
            <li>Great scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell how many hours balm can stay after application, the reason that I have the habit of bitting my lips!</li>
            <li>so wether you play an instument or not this product is amazing</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the best lip-balm you will ever buy.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant and light citrus smell and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of grease on your chops.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed really great.  </li>
            <li>no balm can stay more than 2 hours for me.</li>
            <li>I know many people, musicians and otherwise, who use this stuff without problems though.</li>
            <li>I love it, as it helps my lips feel better after playing for a while, and it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li>As the title states it&#x27;s better than Chap Stick.  </li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a trumpet player and teacher, and I love this product.</li>
            <li>If you treasure you lips and your playing, you will be glad you got this balm.</li>
            <li>I love ChopSaver.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth feel.  </li>
            <li>All of the trumpet players in my section love it.</li>
            <li>just okay .</li>
            <li>It seems to be a musicians best friend as it is the only lip balm that she can use is she is planning to play her trumpet.  </li>
            <li>Even better in the winter if you are prone to severely chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>It is better than even Burt&#x27;s Bees and prevents my brass-player lips from chapping and cracking during the winter.  </li>
            <li>Chop Saver is pretty good lip stuff.</li>
            <li>Even though the all natural aspect of this product sounds great, I can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Because I didn&#x27;t feel it absorbed, it didn&#x27;t leave a nice feeling on.</li>
            <li>I can not say that this better than regular lip balm for your lips; but this product is a joy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an unflavored variety which this one was right on the mark, however I am sure there are better lip-balms out there for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>It also soaks in more quickly than petroleum-based balms.  </li>
            <li>also good to know that the ingredients all 100% natural, like Arnica and Vitamin E: help to repair damaged tissue and speed the natural process of regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;Has pleasant citrus smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; when it touches your lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as, like, unabsorbent as Burt&#x27;s Bees, but not as smooth as Chapstick.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this because it was a $3 add on item, and I wanted to get free shipping, but now I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li>Very useful, like the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve played trumpet for many years and have always used high quality lip balm and have been satisfied.</li>
            <li>I used Cop Saver Original</li>
            <li>I originally bought this at a music store</li>
            <li>Completely worth the price!</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>and I am very picky about smells; but that is my favorite aspect of Chop-Saver.  </li>
            <li>It really helps reduce the swelling that occurs when playing, and it isn&#x27;t as oily as most lip balms.</li>
            <li>Just read the ingredients, and it&#x27;s clear why it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend esp if you are a flutist and don&#x27;t want your precious (silver or gold which are soft metal) flute scratched up by chaffed lips!</li>
            <li>it smells nice,is soothing,and does its job well for about 10 minutes, but still worth it.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>These are closely spaced, and getting it just right can be tricky.</li>
            <li>Delivery on time and right product.  </li>
            <li>Good lip balm that&#x27;s an alternative to some of the stuff out there that can really swell up or dry out a brass player&#x27;s lips.</li>
            <li>I can only say I have a enjoy a smotther texture, but I love this product so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be sure to pass this on to care providers at the Cancer center so others can enjoy the relief</li>
            <li>Like most people, I tend to lose my chapsticks/lip products, so I like to buy extra for that reason.  </li>
            <li>I definitely wanted more when I finished the first tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my lips are actually 90% better.</li>
            <li>I found it works better then all the regular companies for chapped lips</li>
            <li>stuff is pretty soft and goes quickly, so</li>
            <li>Normally I feel very stiff when I play the next day, but Chop-Saver does an excellent job of preventing swelling and bruising in the chops.</li>
            <li>It also has arnica in it which has healing properties, so I recover more quickly when I start off a little chapped.  </li>
            <li>a very soothing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Practiced my horn this morning and realized that my lips weren&#x27;t drying out as much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and after practicing on my trumpet chop saver soothes my chops</li>
            <li>Thanks so much Dan Gosling for inventing this</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Due to all the great reviews and my intent to try out a natural chapstick, this one fell short of my expectations.</li>
            <li>was given a sample of this a while back and the original tube lasted a while.</li>
            <li>Better than other lip balms.</li>
            <li>It may be imagination or that the product was concocted by a trumpet player, it feels better than any other balm I have used.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes it as it does not have fragrance like many other products.</li>
            <li>Using ChopSaver has definitely made this much easier so that I can form the notes more cleanly and with less hiss.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone playing a brass instrument.</li>
            <li>highly recommend giving it a try if your thinking about it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ChopSaver for brass musicians.</li>
            <li>I am the lead trumpet player for my high school&#x27;s jazz band, and after a 3 hr rehearsal my lips are just shredded.</li>
            <li>It is marketed to musicians which is how I found it, but I highly recommend it to anyone who asks.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really did make me able to play longer than usual.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are unsatisfied with your current chapstick.</li>
            <li>I normally use Blistex DCT or Carmex.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I like Chapstick better; it&#x27;s less expensive and more readily available.</li>
            <li>Perhaps we are both sensitive to an ingredient in the mix.</li>
            <li>Chop Saver can be purchased cheaper and my chops have a natural and supple feel to them.</li>
            <li>I keep 2 tubes of lip balm: 1 regular one for days when I don&#x27;t do much playing, and 1 ChopSaver for days when I do.</li>
            <li>I just wanted a chapstick with natural ingredients that worked.  </li>
            <li>My professional trumpet-playing boyfriend introduced me to it, and I&#x27;ve found nothing comparable since.</li>
            <li>It is a terrific product, though, and well worth the minor expense.</li>
            <li>It is just the right amount of thickness to make it last for a long time without being sticky.  </li>
            <li>The herbal additions to ChopSaver soothe the inflammation and pain in my lips after a long gig or intense practice session.</li>
            <li>/&gt;With the impending winter in the Southern Hemisphere fast approaching, take care of those lips, keep them from chaffing with ChopSavers!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>ESSENTIAL FOR soft supple FLUTIST</li>
            <li>The Chopsaver is thick and stays on pretty well, however it tastes very &#x27;chemically&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference between other lip balms (ChapStick, Burt&#x27;s Bees, etc) and this one.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, but if you don&#x27;t use it soon enough, it goes bad.</li>
            <li>But there are also several waxes that make one&#x27;s lip action smoother, including carnauba wax, white beeswax, and candelilla wax.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve never used it, I&#x27;m not sure why some find it better than other lip balm, but it was the only way my child was going to use balm faithfully.</li>
            <li>The main ingredients here are shea butter and mango butter, and there is a short list of other ancillary ingredients that are supposed to reduce inflammation.  </li>

            <li> Personally, I like Chapstick better; it&#x27;s less expensive and more readily available.</li>
            <li> Perhaps we are both sensitive to an ingredient in the mix.</li>
            <li> Chop Saver can be purchased cheaper and my chops have a natural and supple feel to them.</li>
            <li> I keep 2 tubes of lip balm: 1 regular one for days when I don&#x27;t do much playing, and 1 ChopSaver for days when I do.</li>
            <li> I just wanted a chapstick with natural ingredients that worked.  </li>
            <li> My professional trumpet-playing boyfriend introduced me to it, and I&#x27;ve found nothing comparable since.</li>
            <li> It is a terrific product, though, and well worth the minor expense.</li>
            <li> It is just the right amount of thickness to make it last for a long time without being sticky.  </li>
            <li> The herbal additions to ChopSaver soothe the inflammation and pain in my lips after a long gig or intense practice session.</li>
            <li> /&gt;With the impending winter in the Southern Hemisphere fast approaching, take care of those lips, keep them from chaffing with ChopSavers!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> ESSENTIAL FOR soft supple FLUTIST</li>
            <li> The Chopsaver is thick and stays on pretty well, however it tastes very &#x27;chemically&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference between other lip balms (ChapStick, Burt&#x27;s Bees, etc) and this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, but if you don&#x27;t use it soon enough, it goes bad.</li>
            <li> But there are also several waxes that make one&#x27;s lip action smoother, including carnauba wax, white beeswax, and candelilla wax.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve never used it, I&#x27;m not sure why some find it better than other lip balm, but it was the only way my child was going to use balm faithfully.</li>
            <li> The main ingredients here are shea butter and mango butter, and there is a short list of other ancillary ingredients that are supposed to reduce inflammation.  </li>
            <li> After a few days the taste of its main ingredient, Castor oil, started to come through.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy several online to save some money in the long run.  </li>
            <li> It somewhat relieved my dry lips temporarily, but needed to be applied quite often to have the same effect.</li>
            <li> even my dry face below my lips finally got relief and</li>
            <li> At first I thought the price was ridiculous, until I realized how long a tube lasted me!  </li>
            <li> I use it whenever I practice for a long time or if I have a gig where I am just losing endurance.</li>
            <li> very strange smell.</li>
            <li> My lips dry out and stick so</li>
            <li> I have just finished radiation and chemo therapy for tongue Cancer and have suffered horrendous dry lips and blisters.</li>
            <li> normally apply this lip balm after a hard rehearsal before I go to bed, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Not particularly emollient, and the grapefruit taste is a bit plasticky.</li>
            <li> This lip balm isn&#x27;t petroleum-based, so it&#x27;s not nearly as greasy as other lip balms.  </li>
            <li> I am a trombone player in college and have been using this for a few months, buying it from the local music store.  </li>
            <li> It smells like lemons and does not really have a smell.</li>
            <li> that it is nourishing and moisturising YET non greasy on skin which distinguishes it from other OTC lip</li>
            <li> Lasting longer than ordinary lip moisturizer, it does not have a waxy or greasy feeling and does not smear or clog up the instrument.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t create a film on my lips which I&#x27;ve noticed other brands sometimes do.  </li>
            <li> I have stopped using all other balms because my preference is for this product.  </li>
            <li> The petroleum based chap sticks and those with menthol and other concoctions just burned and made it worst.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other instruments which require the use of lips will benefit from it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> In past years I&#x27;ve gotten to the last day stiff as rocks-</li>
            <li> with Chop-Saver I can make it to the end of the week with much less</li>
            <li> Playing it well requires an embouchure that is relaxed but also forms a tight seal around a hole on a diatonic harp.</li>
            <li> Yes, it may be a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you can&#x27;t stand the vicious cycle that is petroleum based &amp;#34;chapsticks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Expensive (plus S&amp;H) and not worth the extra money for the musician&#x27;s &#x27;chops&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Other lip balms seem to leave behind a residue that affects her ability to play, but not Chop-Saver Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> I live in the interior of Alaska, so winters can be dry and brutal.  </li>
            <li> but when put it its hardly taste that</li>
            <li> No more looking--this is it!  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece who is a serious trumpet player.</li>
            <li> I used to use Chop-Saver all the time, but lately it has been irritating to my lips.</li>
            <li> When I received them, all three were dried up and uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> very hard.</li>
            <li> I have dry, chapped lips but not that bad.</li>
            <li> lipS - prevents chaffed lips from scratching up your expensive lip-plate (flute speak)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product and had a bad allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> You are a bad seller</li>
            <li> All of us trumpets have that feeling, and we all hate it.</li>
            <li> do not buy it...feels terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have dry, chapped lips but not that bad. I used Cop Saver Original and it actually works. I noticed that from my 2nd day using it!&lt;br /&gt;It also good to know that the ingredients all 100% natural, like Arnica and Vitamin E: help to repair damaged tissue and speed the natural process of regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;Has pleasant citrus smell but when put it its hardly taste that (almost no taste).&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell how many hours balm can stay after application, the reason that I have the habit of bitting my lips! no balm can stay more than 2 hours for me. this one included!</li>
            <li> This product is cheaper to buy on the internet than in a local music store. This stuff really did make me able to play longer than usual.</li>
            <li> ESSENTIAL FOR soft supple FLUTIST lipS - prevents chaffed lips from scratching up your expensive lip-plate (flute speak)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the impending winter in the Southern Hemisphere fast approaching, take care of those lips, keep them from chaffing with ChopSavers!&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is nourishing and moisturising YET non greasy on skin which distinguishes it from other OTC lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend esp if you are a flutist and don&#x27;t want your precious (silver or gold which are soft metal) flute scratched up by chaffed lips!</li>
            <li> Save your money ... get your lip balm at the local Wal-Mart.  Expensive (plus S&amp;H) and not worth the extra money for the musician&#x27;s &#x27;chops&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I would like this more if it were not so expensive. Like most people, I tend to lose my chapsticks/lip products, so I like to buy extra for that reason.  At almost $4 a tube for this, I cannot buy extra.</li>
            <li> Good lip balm that&#x27;s an alternative to some of the stuff out there that can really swell up or dry out a brass player&#x27;s lips. It has a pleasant and light citrus smell and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of grease on your chops. I used to use Chop-Saver all the time, but lately it has been irritating to my lips. I have also had a student who could not use it because it irritated his lips. Perhaps we are both sensitive to an ingredient in the mix. I know many people, musicians and otherwise, who use this stuff without problems though. It&#x27;s worth a try if you are unsatisfied with your current chapstick.</li>
            <li> I used this product and had a bad allergic reaction. Even though the all natural aspect of this product sounds great, I can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am a trombone player in college and have been using this for a few months, buying it from the local music store.  I love it, as it helps my lips feel better after playing for a while, and it doesn&#x27;t have any harmful ingredients.  I decided to buy several online to save some money in the long run.  When I received them, all three were dried up and uncomfortable to use.  For the product, 5 stars.  For the seller, 0 stars.  Next time I&#x27;ll just buy it in a store.</li>
            <li> I am a trombone player and this lip balm actually does save my chops. By adding moisture to your lips, Chop Saver helps keep them supple allowing you to play for longer periods of time without dryness. Lasting longer than ordinary lip moisturizer, it does not have a waxy or greasy feeling and does not smear or clog up the instrument. It smells like lemons and does not really have a smell. I highly recommend it for anyone playing a brass instrument.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a trumpet player, and I&#x27;ve been looking for a great lip care product for years.  No more looking--this is it!  This is a great product.  This lip balm isn&#x27;t petroleum-based, so it&#x27;s not nearly as greasy as other lip balms.  It also soaks in more quickly than petroleum-based balms.  The main ingredients here are shea butter and mango butter, and there is a short list of other ancillary ingredients that are supposed to reduce inflammation.  If you&#x27;re looking for a great lip balm, this is it.</li>
            <li> As the title states it&#x27;s better than Chap Stick.  In fact it has replaced chap stick for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample of this a while back and the original tube lasted a while. I was happy to see it for sale on amazon cause I definitely wanted more when I finished the first tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; when it touches your lips.  It just feels like you are getting moisture back in your lips and has a very soothing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving it a try if your thinking about it.</li>
            <li> Better than other lip balms.</li>
            <li> The best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Not particularly emollient, and the grapefruit taste is a bit plasticky. The feel on the lips is not emollient. It&#x27;s not as, like, unabsorbent as Burt&#x27;s Bees, but not as smooth as Chapstick. Because I didn&#x27;t feel it absorbed, it didn&#x27;t leave a nice feeling on. And it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;last,&amp;#34; in terms of the moisturizing power.</li>
            <li> OK. This is the real deal.  I&#x27;ve played trumpet for many years and have always used high quality lip balm and have been satisfied. Chop Saver can be purchased cheaper and my chops have a natural and supple feel to them. Practiced my horn this morning and realized that my lips weren&#x27;t drying out as much.</li>
            <li> Good stuf for the winter band member.</li>
            <li> Very similar to what others have said (which is why I decided to buy).  It is just the right amount of thickness to make it last for a long time without being sticky.  It also doesn&#x27;t create a film on my lips which I&#x27;ve noticed other brands sometimes do.  Great scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> The product is not greasy and the taste and fragrance is fruity and aromatic. I really like this product and after practicing on my trumpet chop saver soothes my chops</li>
            <li> I can not say that this better than regular lip balm for your lips; but this product is a joy to apply.  It may be imagination or that the product was concocted by a trumpet player, it feels better than any other balm I have used.  I use it almost daily and my lips are never chapped.  This product has a pleasant citrus smell.  I do not go for perfumes and smelly candles and I am very picky about smells; but that is my favorite aspect of Chop-Saver.  One bit of warning, this does not have sunscreen.  For sunscreen get [[ASIN:B002BAW8R0 Chop-Saver Lip Balm with SPF15 Sunscreen]].  I have stopped using all other balms because my preference is for this product.  It has never given me problems while playing trumpet.  In fact, after writing this, I am going to put some on, exercise and practice trumpet.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this at a music store and I loved it, I need to buy one off of amazon still though.    I can only say I have a enjoy a smotther texture, but I love this product so much it not only helped me play my flute longer ,and didn&#x27;t need to lick my lips either. Not to mention it does wonders for your lips so wether you play an instument or not this product is amazing and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a trumpet player and teacher, and I love this product. I can really tell the difference between other lip balms (ChapStick, Burt&#x27;s Bees, etc) and this one. The herbal additions to ChopSaver soothe the inflammation and pain in my lips after a long gig or intense practice session. Yes, it may be a little pricey. I keep 2 tubes of lip balm: 1 regular one for days when I don&#x27;t do much playing, and 1 ChopSaver for days when I do. I highly recommend ChopSaver for brass musicians.</li>
            <li> Due to all the great reviews and my intent to try out a natural chapstick, this one fell short of my expectations. It somewhat relieved my dry lips temporarily, but needed to be applied quite often to have the same effect. I was looking for an unflavored variety which this one was right on the mark, however I am sure there are better lip-balms out there for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I use this for playing harmonicas.  My lips dry out and stick so this comes to my rescue every time!</li>
            <li> Good product-I use it all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working on the blues harp. Playing it well requires an embouchure that is relaxed but also forms a tight seal around a hole on a diatonic harp. These are closely spaced, and getting it just right can be tricky. Using ChopSaver has definitely made this much easier so that I can form the notes more cleanly and with less hiss. This makes a big difference not only for the ease of play but also for amping the harp with a mike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include palm and shea butter, as one reviewer pointed out. But there are also several waxes that make one&#x27;s lip action smoother, including carnauba wax, white beeswax, and candelilla wax. Remaining ingredients include castor oil, mango butter, aloe Vera, avocado oil, palm kernel oil, grapeseed oil, extract of arnica, calendula, raspberry leaf, cornfrey, white willow, vitamin E, citrus essential oils, and ginger. There are no animal fats, and it is gluten-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff is pretty soft and goes quickly, so I imagine that I will be buying a tube every month. It is a terrific product, though, and well worth the minor expense. If you treasure you lips and your playing, you will be glad you got this balm.</li>
            <li> As a trumpet player he chose this over our everloving chapstick soi couldnt deny my son his preference! Great according to my son!</li>
            <li> I love ChopSaver. I&#x27;m a music teacher and I play a lot of instruments. Regular chapstick wears away at your lips and makes it necessary to keep using it. ChopSaver doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am the lead trumpet player for my high school&#x27;s jazz band, and after a 3 hr rehearsal my lips are just shredded. All of us trumpets have that feeling, and we all hate it. I decided to buy this because it was a $3 add on item, and I wanted to get free shipping, but now I will keep buying it. It really helps reduce the swelling that occurs when playing, and it isn&#x27;t as oily as most lip balms.</li>
            <li> I have just finished radiation and chemo therapy for tongue Cancer and have suffered horrendous dry lips and blisters. IBe suffered since May. Last night my daughter asked me to try chopsaver and even my dry face below my lips finally got relief and my lips are actually 90% better. It allowed me relief to sleep through the night. The petroleum based chap sticks and those with menthol and other concoctions just burned and made it worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sure to pass this on to care providers at the Cancer center so others can enjoy the relief I finally found.&lt;br /&gt;I took a picture of my face and lips last night and this morning all the redness is gone and I can finally eat this morning. Thanks so much Dan Gosling for inventing this</li>
            <li> Description said 24 count.  I got one.</li>
            <li> This is a great lip balm. I use it whenever I practice for a long time or if I have a gig where I am just losing endurance. It does work! This helps reduce the inflammation you incur while playing and it tastes and smells great too and is a nice substitute from chapstick that can leave your lips all greasy and have the mouthpiece slide everywhere.</li>
            <li> Bought as stocking stuffer.  Delivery on time and right product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> this product is overrated. it smells nice,is soothing,and does its job well for about 10 minutes, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> Designed for musicians by musicians. My husband likes it as it does not have fragrance like many other products. Perfect for Michigan winter even if you don&#x27;t play an instrument.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my daughter (and I)...we use it all of the time.  Came on time and just in time for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I found it works better then all the regular companies for chapped lips</li>
            <li> Feels great and smells good too. It is worth the money. It leaves lip healthy and it is the best.</li>
            <li> I tried Chopsaver based on reliable testimony.  I normally use Blistex DCT or Carmex.  At first it seemed really great.  Nice smooth feel.  Not greasy like DCT and not the medicinal taste of Carmex.  After a few days the taste of its main ingredient, Castor oil, started to come through.  It is now intolerable and prompts feelings of reverse peristalsis.  If you don&#x27;t mind the taste, I think it is a really good product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not a musician.  I just wanted a chapstick with natural ingredients that worked.  I need look no further.</li>
            <li> Another trumpet player here, looking to make a career of music.&lt;br /&gt;I normally apply this lip balm after a hard rehearsal before I go to bed, and it works like a charm. Normally I feel very stiff when I play the next day, but Chop-Saver does an excellent job of preventing swelling and bruising in the chops. Every year I attend a week-long music festival that is an endurance monster. In past years I&#x27;ve gotten to the last day stiff as rocks- with Chop-Saver I can make it to the end of the week with much less swelling.&lt;br /&gt;I consider this product essential to any trumpet player or any brass musician. Other instruments which require the use of lips will benefit from it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it smells great!</li>
            <li> It did not keep the promise&lt;br /&gt; You are a bad seller</li>
            <li> Great product at a fair price. All of the trumpet players in my section love it. Completely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, but if you don&#x27;t use it soon enough, it goes bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be. Personally, I like Chapstick better; it&#x27;s less expensive and more readily available. I found that the biggest &amp;#34;use&amp;#34; I have gotten from Chop Saver is showing it off to section mates, who then chuckle.</li>
            <li> I live in the interior of Alaska, so winters can be dry and brutal.  This stuff has no petroleum in it so I can feel good about using it.  It also has arnica in it which has healing properties, so I recover more quickly when I start off a little chapped.  It is marketed to musicians which is how I found it, but I highly recommend it to anyone who asks.  If you aren&#x27;t making your own, this is the best stuff on the market to buy.</li>
            <li> Felt sticky and did not want to moisturize my lips</li>
            <li> Very useful, like the scent. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Chop Saver is pretty good lip stuff. However, it&#x27;s not as good as any of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products. The Chopsaver is thick and stays on pretty well, however it tastes very &#x27;chemically&#x27;. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> We learned about this product from our trumpet teacher. Since I&#x27;ve never used it, I&#x27;m not sure why some find it better than other lip balm, but it was the only way my child was going to use balm faithfully. I&#x27;m giving it a 5 because it does work well and my child actually uses it. We bought a second one for his stocking.</li>
            <li> my son is a commited trupet player and thus needs a good lip miosturizer.  He tried them all but this one he LOVES!!!</li>
            <li> best lip balm in every way.</li>
            <li> just okay . nothing special</li>
            <li> My daughter swears by this.  It seems to be a musicians best friend as it is the only lip balm that she can use is she is planning to play her trumpet.  Other lip balms seem to leave behind a residue that affects her ability to play, but not Chop-Saver Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> Description said 24 count. I received only one.</li>
            <li> do not buy it...feels terrible. very hard. very strange smell.</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you can&#x27;t stand the vicious cycle that is petroleum based &amp;#34;chapsticks&amp;#34;.  This does the job so well, I need not apply it daily.  Even better in the winter if you are prone to severely chapped lips.  At first I thought the price was ridiculous, until I realized how long a tube lasted me!  My professional trumpet-playing boyfriend introduced me to it, and I&#x27;ve found nothing comparable since. Just read the ingredients, and it&#x27;s clear why it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the best lip-balm you will ever buy.  It is better than even Burt&#x27;s Bees and prevents my brass-player lips from chapping and cracking during the winter.  Great for musicians and non-musicians alike.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist, really a good product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece who is a serious trumpet player. She loves it.</li>
