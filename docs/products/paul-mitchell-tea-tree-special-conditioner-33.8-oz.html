            <li>I stopped using it for sometime but decided to buy it because I loved how it made my hair feel.     </li>
            <li>Love the tingle of this shampoo/conditioner!</li>

            <li>THIS MAKES YOUR SCALP FEEL SO MINTY AND COOL AND FRESH!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed much better results with Paul Mitchell products than just about everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Excellent product the only complain was with the rapper</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I WILL BE BACK TO BUY MORE!!!</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for, after all is your hair important to you?</li>
            <li>I recently bought this conditioner and I love it!!</li>
            <li>My hair used to fall a lot before I changed to use tea tree special shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I have always loved it, but I hadn&#x27;t bought any in several years.  </li>
            <li>Immediately upon using it after I got this bottle, I remembered why I love it so much --</li>
            <li>the pump off the top of the bottle had broken off which was a very good feature of this product</li>
            <li>Seems more drying than my last shampoo/conditioner, but overall am happy.</li>
            <li>GREAT product, and gives me a little wake-up &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; in the shower each morning.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money for me.  </li>
            <li>I can not quite pinpoint what it is exactly that is not quite right.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scalp-stimulating tingle that it leaves after using it!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I bought another liter even though I still have a good amount left in my current body.    </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t grow that fast but using this conditioner</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell Tea Tree I&#x27;d say is much better than the average store stocked hair products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought it, and I have since ordered other products from the line that I can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
            <li>I REALLY ENJOY WASHING MY LONG HAIR WITH THIS!</li>
            <li>This product works as advertised and is of good quality and will last a long long time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>my natural hair color seems to come out brighter.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, shine, and stop falling.</li>
            <li>Actually, the Generic brand &amp;#34;compare to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special&amp;#34; from SALLY&#x27;S cost a little less and seems more concentrated.</li>
            <li>I had been using less expensive \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; brands for so long, I forgot what a nice shampoo/conditioner could do for my hair!  </li>

            <li> DRIES out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Want your hair to look like straw for Halloween?&lt;br /&gt;Use this!&lt;br /&gt;In the trash it goes!&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could get my money back!</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo about four years ago.  I stopped using it for sometime but decided to buy it because I loved how it made my hair feel.     I started using it again after the birth of my second son and it started to make my hair grow.  I loves how it tinkles your hair folicles which promotes hair growth.  I love it so much I bought another liter even though I still have a good amount left in my current body.    If you want your hair to grow this the product to use.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil Special Shampoo/Conditioner is amazing!  I have always loved it, but I hadn&#x27;t bought any in several years.  Immediately upon using it after I got this bottle, I remembered why I love it so much -- I really like the scalp-stimulating tingle that it leaves after using it!  Also, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, after using it for a day or two, I noticed my hair being softer and looking nice and shiny!  I had been using less expensive \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; brands for so long, I forgot what a nice shampoo/conditioner could do for my hair!  I&#x27;m really glad I bought it, and I have since ordered other products from the line that I can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Tea Tree I&#x27;d say is much better than the average store stocked hair products. I&#x27;ve noticed much better results with Paul Mitchell products than just about everything else I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve seen less hair come out in the shower and my natural hair color seems to come out brighter. I&#x27;d recommend Paul Mitchell products, yes they are more expensive but you get what you pay for, after all is your hair important to you? This is my humble opinion, I hope it was helpful to you.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this conditioner and I love it!! My hair doesn&#x27;t grow that fast but using this conditioner I feel like my hair has gotten a lot longer in such a short period of time.  It also makes my hair a lot shinier and healthier looking. And I love the minty smell of it!!! Definitely worth the money for me.  Planning on buying the big pump set of the shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> Actually, the Generic brand &amp;#34;compare to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special&amp;#34; from SALLY&#x27;S cost a little less and seems more concentrated. I will go back to the generic when this is empty.</li>
            <li> This works well with the Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo.  The fragrance is a bit off though.  I have a difficult time explaining quite what is wrong with the smell.  I can not quite pinpoint what it is exactly that is not quite right.  It is also a bit heavy on my hair.  My hair feels slightly weighted down after ample rinse time, almost like it doesn&#x27;t all rinse out.  Since the shampoo strips the hair of all oils, this does help as a follow up.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised and is of good quality and will last a long long time.  I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my stylist was sold out and I just couldn&#x27;t wait.  He had used this on my hair earlier in the week and I loved it so much I couldn&#x27;t wait for his shippment to come in.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent product the only complain was with the rapper did not lock the pomp and was spilt in side the box.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, and I enjoy the tingly feeling the tea tree oil does to my scalp.  This product does leave my hair a bit drier than it should, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner for several years now, and I will keep buying it as long as they make it. GREAT product, and gives me a little wake-up &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; in the shower each morning.</li>
            <li> Love the tingle of this shampoo/conditioner!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Seems more drying than my last shampoo/conditioner, but overall am happy. Bought for the tea tree because i thought it was moisturizing and there was a case of lice in my daughter&#x27;s kindergarten class and it is supposed to be a repellant.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I am stuck with. This conditioner does not weigh my hair volume down. It makes my hair soft, shine, and stop falling. It helps for dandruff as well. I have been using it everyday for a year. My hair used to fall a lot before I changed to use tea tree special shampoo and conditioner. It is amazing it stops falling even I use it every day. I can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> A friend had bought me a bottle for a gift and since then, I have always wanted to get another bottle but never got around to it. With another purchase, I got the pump bottle. It is great.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time however once I opened it it had leaked all over the box. The source? the pump off the top of the bottle had broken off which was a very good feature of this product</li>
            <li> THIS MAKES YOUR SCALP FEEL SO MINTY AND COOL AND FRESH!!!! I REALLY ENJOY WASHING MY LONG HAIR WITH THIS! ITS VERY RICH AND CREAMY AND PERFECT!!! MAKES MY HAIR VERY SHINY AND IS A SUPER VALUE FOR THE HUGE SIZE YOU GET!!! YES...I WILL BE BACK TO BUY MORE!!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??? LOL&lt;br /&gt;ITS AWESOME AND YOU TRULY FEEL CLEAN!!!! WOOOOTTTT&lt;br /&gt;TYVM!!&lt;br /&gt;VAL B.</li>
