    <ol>
            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly once I got the hang of opening and closing it.</li>
            <li>Fits my toothbrush perfectly and I like the idea of cleaning my toothbrush as I store it.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>They work great to keep your household toothbrushes sanitized.  </li>
            <li>And battery operated so great for travel.</li>
            <li>Im happy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH SANITIZER!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my toothbrush sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I liked knowing that my toothbrush was cleaned after using bottled water to wash with in India.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think this is very important to help keep bactira out of your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with this item.  </li>
            <li>This item keeps your toothbrush safe from that.</li>
            <li>My husband and I just love them.</li>
            <li>They really love it as do I.</li>
            <li>Keeps my toothbrush nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be the perfect solution, because it would sanitize and help dry my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to drop in a travel bag when traveling.</li>
            <li>When toilets flush, there&#x27;s a fine spray of mist that travels all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li>When I do get the case opened -- and enclose my toothbrush and shut it --- it works just fine.</li>
            <li>easy to clean</li>
            <li>guess it&#x27;s working when the light goes on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought it primarily for my cuticle  nippers...</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>trying to get my money&#x27;s worth - HA!</li>
            <li>easiest way to open the case is to squeeze lid from both sides and think good thoughts.</li>
            <li>Would be cool if it was solar powered?</li>
            <li>but my scientist found out a little soak in hydrogen peroxide is more effective and significantly cheaper, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy one otherwise!</li>
            <li>So far this product is effective and does not go through batteries too quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the idea that these holders not only sanitize the toothbrushes (or picks or flossers or whatever), but that they also keep any creepy-crawlies from touching what goes in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>A new favorite toy.</li>
            <li>Fun,</li>
            <li>THAT IT WOULD MAKE SUCH NICE CHRISTMAS STOCKING STUFFERS...</li>
            <li>That right there makes these worth their weight in gold.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as description states.  </li>
            <li>Larger size-wise than my old sanitizer, but so far works great.</li>
            <li>Works well when you first use it though.</li>
            <li>The UV light wouldn&#x27;t come on the first one that I opened, luckily the second one worked.</li>
            <li>Convenient size, easy to open.</li>
            <li>No idea if it really works or not</li>
            <li>stopped working and smells real funky</li>
            <li>I have an electric toothbrush but once in a while I enjoy using a regular one.  </li>
            <li>reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really work?&lt;br</li>
            <li>no way can you fit a tiny flossing brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to work, as the blue light goes on every time I close the lid.  </li>
            <li>AND OF COURSE, VERY PORTABLE.</li>
            <li>Works very well, it is my must have item in my travel bag.  </li>
            <li>We live in Florida, land of the turn-on-the-light-in-the-middle-of-the-night-palmetto-bug-crazy-dance.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can sanitize my toothbrush or any small brush with this product at any time.  </li>
            <li>The batteries have not needed to be replaced yet (used for four months so far).  </li>
            <li>I have heard that if you don&#x27;t keep your tooth brush clean that you can catch colds from other household members if they are all kept close together in  the traditional toothbrush holder.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it especially for those of you that keep your toothbrush out in the open in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it actually does anything but look cool for a few minutes though.</li>
            <li>Who knows if the little buggers are really being zapped by this thing.</li>

            <li> how long will this thing last before I break the plastic case trying to open</li>
            <li> Finally, after a couple of tries, my husband got it open, but when I tried a second and then a third time, I still couldn&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to use and small</li>
            <li> Every single time I open the box, I threaten to throw it in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s minor.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had purchased this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I lived in dorms at the time, and I needed a toothbrush holder but didn&#x27;t like the idea of my toothbrush staying wet all the time and then getting smelly and gross.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, so it will hold just about any toothbrush or the heads for the electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Have not had for an extremely long time, but working as expected.</li>
            <li> If you are not in the habit of putting the toilet seat cover down before flushing ..</li>
            <li> I purchased one for my daughter (pink) and one for my granddaughter (pink).</li>
            <li> I got this in the pink for my granddaughter, so, that she would know her toothbrush from her brothers</li>
            <li> I ORDERED MINE IN THE PINK...</li>
            <li> I SPENT THE NIGHT WITH MY PARENTS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink it works</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have had other brands and this unit feels sturdy and seems to be doing the job as described.</li>
            <li> Hard to open case, otherwise I like it</li>
            <li> It is SOOOOO hard to open!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The case is a little hard to open.</li>
            <li> the only issue I would have with it is that I do find it a bit difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this item is that the case is a bit difficult to open up.  </li>
            <li> To open it you have to depress and pull down on a tiny button/lever, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to do.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with these little gems.  </li>
            <li> I keep it in the bathroom and use it everyday</li>
            <li> The cover is a little difficult for me to open</li>
            <li> Sucks the battery in less than a week.</li>
            <li> small footprint</li>
            <li> , I mean really hard.</li>
            <li> bad, bad, really bad, ridiculously hard to open</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a cold or been sick since I got these.  </li>
            <li> Was definitely disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hard to open case, otherwise I like it</li>
            <li> A new favorite toy. No idea if it really works or not but I like the idea of it and use it daily in hopes that it does. Maybe a microscope experiment to test the effectiveness of it is in order? If you have the time to do so, let me know your results?</li>
            <li> Bought four of these for me and my daughters for Christmas, and one of another brand and color for my husband.  We live in Florida, land of the turn-on-the-light-in-the-middle-of-the-night-palmetto-bug-crazy-dance.  I love the idea that these holders not only sanitize the toothbrushes (or picks or flossers or whatever), but that they also keep any creepy-crawlies from touching what goes in your mouth.  That right there makes these worth their weight in gold.  The batteries have not needed to be replaced yet (used for four months so far).  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with these little gems.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great. Install 2 batteries and it lights up. I wish I had found this years ago~ will buy another for travel.</li>
            <li> Got this for a science project.  Fun, but my scientist found out a little soak in hydrogen peroxide is more effective and significantly cheaper, so I wouldn&#x27;t buy one otherwise!</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with this item.  I love the fact that I can sanitize my toothbrush or any small brush with this product at any time.  It works just as described and the only issue I would have with it is that I do find it a bit difficult to open.  But that&#x27;s minor.  Other than that..I wish I had purchased this a long time ago.  I would highly recommend it especially for those of you that keep your toothbrush out in the open in the bathroom. If you are not in the habit of putting the toilet seat cover down before flushing ..your toothbrush is exposed to a ton of bacteria.  When toilets flush, there&#x27;s a fine spray of mist that travels all over the bathroom. This item keeps your toothbrush safe from that.</li>
            <li> Sanitizer works like clock work sanitizes for 5 minutes.  Works exactly as description states.  Well pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered another sanitizer a different brand and it would not shut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these.  They work great to keep your household toothbrushes sanitized.  I haven&#x27;t had a cold or been sick since I got these.  I have heard that if you don&#x27;t keep your tooth brush clean that you can catch colds from other household members if they are all kept close together in  the traditional toothbrush holder.  I change toothbrushes about every 2 to 3 months and always use the sanitizer when I finish brushing.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Zadro UV toothbrush sanitizer. My husband and I just love them. You don&#x27;t have to worry about anything walking on them during the night. I purchased one for my daughter (pink) and one for my granddaughter (pink).</li>
            <li> If you have fingernails, do not buy this toothbrush sanitizer!  To open it you have to depress and pull down on a tiny button/lever, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to do.  I broke a nail just trying, and still couldn&#x27;t get it open.  Finally, after a couple of tries, my husband got it open, but when I tried a second and then a third time, I still couldn&#x27;t do it.  If you want to save your nails and your sanity, buy a different brand.  Violight always worked well for me.</li>
            <li> So easy to use. Convenient size, easy to open. Simple to use. And battery operated so great for travel. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> stopped working and smells real funky</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Larger size-wise than my old sanitizer, but so far works great.</li>
            <li> I got this in the pink for my granddaughter, so, that she would know her toothbrush from her brothers and she immediately put her toothbrush in it.  I am hoping this will help them from spreading their colds back and forth.</li>
            <li> I have an electric toothbrush but once in a while I enjoy using a regular one.  I like the fact that the brush is being sanitized after each use.  It is such a simple unit and not overly priced too.</li>
            <li> GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;1. doubles as a travel case&lt;br /&gt;2. won&#x27;t open accidently&lt;br /&gt;3. unlike some sanitizers this one turns itself off in 5 mins.&lt;br /&gt;4. reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;5. easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;6. small footprint&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MYSTERY:&lt;br /&gt;1. does this UV process really work?&lt;br /&gt;2. how can you tell?&lt;br /&gt;3. how long will this thing last before I break the plastic case trying to open it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD:&lt;br /&gt;1. bad, bad, really bad, ridiculously hard to open, I mean really hard. (no I don&#x27;t have arthritis)&lt;br /&gt;2. UV sanitizer holds one toothbrush, not a problem except&lt;br /&gt;  no way can you fit a tiny flossing brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:&lt;br /&gt;1. easiest way to open the case is to squeeze lid from both sides and think good thoughts.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I lived in dorms at the time, and I needed a toothbrush holder but didn&#x27;t like the idea of my toothbrush staying wet all the time and then getting smelly and gross. I thought this would be the perfect solution, because it would sanitize and help dry my toothbrush. Nope! The toothbrush was smelly within two weeks. I didn&#x27;t look up the science, but I tend to believe that smelly &#x3D; not sanitized. Was definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Every single time I open the box, I threaten to throw it in the garbage.  It is SOOOOO hard to open!  I now leave it open on the sink....trying to get my money&#x27;s worth - HA!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my toothbrush sanitizer. It&#x27;s long, so it will hold just about any toothbrush or the heads for the electric toothbrushes. It works as advertised and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> These were purchased for some members of my family after they saw mine.  They really love it as do I.</li>
            <li> Who knows if the little buggers are really being zapped by this thing. Even my dentist wasn&#x27;t sure.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s working when the light goes on.&lt;br /&gt;The case is a little hard to open.</li>
            <li> Bought it primarily for my cuticle  nippers...but they don&#x27;t fit. Bummer. Just note the size of the open space if you&#x27;re planning to use for anything besides a skinny toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have not had for an extremely long time, but working as expected. I have had other brands and this unit feels sturdy and seems to be doing the job as described.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, as the blue light goes on every time I close the lid.  I have no idea if it actually does anything but look cool for a few minutes though.</li>
            <li> i had one i found in the store, bit when i went back to purchas another they had none and didn&#x27;t remember having it.&lt;br /&gt;so when i went on line and found this one i was so ellated.&lt;br /&gt;i think this is very important to help keep bactira out of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;i think everyone should use these.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and as described.  Very convenient to use and small so it is easy to drop in a travel bag when traveling.</li>
            <li> I have been using my sanitizer for over two weeks now.  The only problem I have with this item is that the case is a bit difficult to open up.  When I do get the case opened -- and enclose my toothbrush and shut it --- it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I liked knowing that my toothbrush was cleaned after using bottled water to wash with in India. I didn&#x27;t get any GI problems, and choosing to carry my brush in this sanitizing case may have helped. It worked perfectly once I got the hang of opening and closing it.</li>
            <li> Must have in my house. Keeps my toothbrush nice and clean. I do wish it was easier to open, however.</li>
            <li> Sucks the battery in less than a week. Works well when you first use it though. But after a while it makes the toothbrush smelly because the UV isn&#x27;t working. Would be cool if it was solar powered?</li>
            <li> So far this product is effective and does not go through batteries too quickly. The cover is a little difficult for me to open but I like the overall design and function.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH SANITIZER! I ORDERED MINE IN THE PINK...I SPENT THE NIGHT WITH MY PARENTS AND THEY WERE ASKING ABOUT IT.&lt;br /&gt;HINTED THAT IT WOULD MAKE SUCH NICE CHRISTMAS STOCKING STUFFERS...I AM ORDERING ONE FOR EACH OF THEM.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS NOT BIG AND BULKY...AND OF COURSE, VERY PORTABLE.</li>
            <li> Fits my toothbrush perfectly and I like the idea of cleaning my toothbrush as I store it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink it works Im happy. I keep it in the bathroom and use it everyday</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to be kidding. You need the jaws of life to open this thing! Do NOT recommend you buy this product.</li>
            <li> Works very well, it is my must have item in my travel bag.  I have it for almost 2 yrs, have not change the battery yet.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these.  The UV light wouldn&#x27;t come on the first one that I opened, luckily the second one worked.</li>
