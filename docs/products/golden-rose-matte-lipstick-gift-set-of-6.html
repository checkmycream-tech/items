    <ol>
            <li> Best smooth matte glide. Love all the colors and for great price too!</li>
            <li> LOOOOOOOVEEEE the colors are sexy, they don&#x27;t smell bad, they last a decent amount if time. I knocked off a star because the colors aren&#x27;t labeled and they look similar in the tube but once applied they are different. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who ever wanted to wear a nice lipstick</li>
            <li> They are just like in the picture, its incredible. I highly recommend this lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I like them soooo much, the colors amizing but the one broplem is the make the lips dry , however, i still use them becouse their colors like mac !!!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colour combo. Perfect for any occasion and outfit</li>
            <li> Nice Soft shade of colors</li>
            <li> Best lipsticks ever !!!! I love Matte so these are a buy if you do too. Why did I rate 3 stars? Because the packaging was a little toover much. Each individual lip stick was wrapped with tight plastic. Yes that&#x27;s great to sanitary purposes, but you had to be extremely careful opening them because they could twist up and ruin the tip of the tube so now I have 3 that ruined. I love number 20! Other than the wrapped tubes, these things are Amazing.</li>
            <li> I liiiiiike it .....it&#x27;s sooo softly and maatüëç</li>
            <li> The set of six lipsticks was missing one lipstick. Even though it was sealed.</li>
            <li> Perfect and exactly what I wanted !!</li>
            <li> I like it there are very beautiful</li>
            <li> My wife said it was good value for money  and very nice colors</li>
            <li> Not keen. I thought I would love them but the smell was not nice, the texture, way too dense and generally not a feel good product at all. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I pretty much love it!! Just got it now and it has beautiful colours, I will order for more. Thanks alot.</li>
            <li> Really nice colors and stay for hours</li>
            <li> It is great I love it</li>
            <li> Big thanx to the seller they are really great and very nice lipsticks i love them.they are worthy.</li>
            <li> I love them! these are nice for everyday wear. I would not recommend them for heavier night make up because they do not last as long, but they are great for everyday use :(</li>
            <li> love the lipstick, would suggest clear caps to see the color at a glance.  I would by again.</li>
            <li> This rating reflects both wearability and care in packaging. The colors are nice and neutral but does not wear long, and the packaging was only a plastic cover, which was not useful to protect against handling during the shipping process. I successfully added the product back in two of the tubes with out a lot of damage, but was unsuccessful on one, which sticks up a little.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the matte finished also the price but i put it on and took a small drink of water and the color complety came off not to mention that the cup had lipstick on it and i hate that</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing and the lipstick lasts a very long time! They make me feel pretty!</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are awesome!! Last atleast 4 hours, don&#x27;t leave your lips all dry and the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love them. I thought I would be using the darker tines but in reality I&#x27;m mostly using the nude tones</li>
            <li> Nice set. Colors almost all look alike. Not exactly but very close. This was a gift for my sister she loves it. I just thought it would be a little bit more matte looking. It didn&#x27;t look glossy it anything. Just not like complete matte look.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautiful colors and go on so smooth BUT the color doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> They are VERY &amp;#34;matte.&amp;#34; Thick and dry. I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> Very good.  She likes it a lot. Thank you</li>
            <li> They are amazing! I don&#x27;t like glossy lipsticks so I was looking for matte and these are perfect! They stay on for hours and my lips feel moisturized. I&#x27;m very happy with my six new lipsticks, I will definitely order the first set.</li>
            <li> soo amazing honestly i LOVE them sooo much i wanted to tey all of them at the same timee!! If ur looking for a non-glossy lipsticks these are the ones!  &amp; their soft ‚ù§‚ù§</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM!! totally recommend them!</li>
            <li> Some of the colors darker or brighter than expected. Wear for hours, but show every flaw: ELF lip exfoliator perfect to prime lips. Plan to experiment with mixing colors.</li>
            <li> Colors all look the same. It is confusing to know the right color to wear. Waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on Matte Lipstick.  You have no idea. This lipstick is smooth, soft and glides on your lips with no problems. I love this stuff. I am buying all my girlfriends a set for Christmas presents.  This set is amazing and not as expensive as one tube from a major makeup supplier. Please take a chance and buy this set, you will not be disappointed. I promise</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the colors that were advertised. The lipsticks aren&#x27;t really thy great, dollar store quality.</li>
            <li> My product came destroyed. The lipstick is stuck to the cap as you can&#x27;t even roll it up. I want my money back now!</li>
            <li> Its not that matte and I thought it was going to me be more of the velvet look.</li>
