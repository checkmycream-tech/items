            <li>this is it i love it</li>
            <li>just the scent  was looking for, just what I remembered from many years ago.</li>
            <li>the scent is ok.</li>
            <li>Yes if you can&#x27;t afford anything better.</li>
            <li>This was such a pleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li>Used for babies but great for older ones, I love the smell of sweet violets</li>
            <li>A very pleasant fresh, clean, natural scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it&#x27;s nice to have it delivered since I no longer live in Miami.</li>
            <li>Brings back pleasant childhood memories.</li>
            <li>So refreshing and light, this is a beautiful fragrance with a delicate note of violet.</li>
            <li>as much as I do, and if I need to remove it because of someone else&#x27;s allergy or sensitivity, I think I will be able to address those problems.</li>
            <li>a true scent of violets...</li>
            <li>The cologne smelled like violets when I sniffed it from the bottle, but after I put it on, it faded quickly and almost immediately smelled like some sort of body powder--not at all like violets.</li>
            <li>fresh, luscious and flirty</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I only wish this was available in a strong perfume so it would last.......because it just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh and doesn&#x27;t last long, which is precisely what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li>I did receive this (Violetas Francesas Cologne) and 3 stars is a very generous for me to give for this Made in USA product.</li>
            <li>This is such a clean smelling cologne my Cuban friend turned me on to.</li>
            <li>I could not take my Chanel on the airplane (airline regulations) and wanted something fresh and clean for the few days I was there.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Kind of weak and not all that violet smelling for me.</li>
            <li>Used this for my kids when they were young.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS - it pours nicely in an old fashioned pump spray perfume atomizer - or in those refillable purse sticks.</li>

            <li> Used this for my kids when they were young. Now, I was able to buy it for my grandson. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Light, fresh and doesn&#x27;t last long, which is precisely what I wanted.  Not everyone loves it (or any fragrance, for that matter) as much as I do, and if I need to remove it because of someone else&#x27;s allergy or sensitivity, I think I will be able to address those problems.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this frangrance - it&#x27;s more of a splash, so you can put it on heavy on all the spots - inside of elbow, behind knees, etc. it does smell just like violets to me - and of course smells like baby powder and baby lotion because that&#x27;s the fragrance they use too! I only wish this was available in a strong perfume so it would last.......because it just doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a short-lived wonderful splash fragrance, light and floral and great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - it pours nicely in an old fashioned pump spray perfume atomizer - or in those refillable purse sticks. : - )</li>
            <li> A very pleasant fresh, clean, natural scent.  Great as a splash - on body or linens. Brings back pleasant childhood memories.</li>

            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s nice to have it delivered since I no longer live in Miami.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most wonderful scent for babies to adults! Thank you. I do wish there was a way to make the fragrance last longer. Still a wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this, fits me so well, Just what I wanted, I splash it on after bathing. Great fragrance.</li>

            <li> I really like this cologne. Used for babies but great for older ones, I love the smell of sweet violets</li>
            <li> fresh, luscious and flirty</li>
            <li> This is such a clean smelling cologne my Cuban friend turned me on to. She puts it on her grandchildren after a bath even on their hair. I do that now too. I love it!</li>
            <li> finally!  a true scent of violets...&lt;br /&gt;love it&lt;br /&gt;wish it came in lotion and spray edc</li>
            <li> The cologne smelled like violets when I sniffed it from the bottle, but after I put it on, it faded quickly and almost immediately smelled like some sort of body powder--not at all like violets.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Super fast shipping! Very pleased-just the scent  was looking for, just what I remembered from many years ago.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful stuff, smells just like violets. I couldn&#x27;t find any other product that did this. I used to buy a wonderful brand from Devonshire, England, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it vended anywhere.</li>
            <li> I found this on a recent trip to Florida.  I could not take my Chanel on the airplane (airline regulations) and wanted something fresh and clean for the few days I was there.  This was such a pleasant surprise!  So refreshing and light, this is a beautiful fragrance with a delicate note of violet. Absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> the scent is ok. Kind of weak and not all that violet smelling for me.</li>
            <li> I did receive this (Violetas Francesas Cologne) and 3 stars is a very generous for me to give for this Made in USA product. 2.5 star will be fair for it. This thing smell nothing like Violetas, Is a chip cologne for chip price. You get what you pay for. Do I recommend this product? Yes if you can&#x27;t afford anything better.</li>
