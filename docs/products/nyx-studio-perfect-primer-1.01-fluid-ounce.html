    <ol>
            <li>the best thing of all is that they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li>It is the best primer I have EVER used.</li>
            <li>best primer I hav ever used.</li>
            <li>Neutralizes any redness and is a great primer too!</li>
            <li>After watching a YouTube vid on applying foundation to cover acne, which promoted this product, I bought it, tried it, and Loved it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t care about the smoothness part and just want your redness gone, then this product would be good.</li>
            <li>Like all others that review this product, the feel is greasy at first but then blends in perfectly to the skin to leave a great satin surface for apply make-up, eyeshadow, etc.</li>
            <li>But just wearing it by itself if amazing .</li>
            <li>I really liked this product and would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have done more research on this product.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this primer</li>
            <li>This primer was ok.</li>
            <li>I love this primer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, I like</li>
            <li>so i was able to apply face powder and have it look smooth for once.</li>
            <li>It did a good job on canceling out the redness in my skin, however it felt really greasy and didn&#x27;t make my foundation go on any smoother.</li>
            <li>I love the way this primer makes my skin feel and the fact that it helps smooth out the light lines around my mouth and eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t cover my redness at all.</li>
            <li>If you are someone that is not acne prone, and your pores do not clog easily - this is the primer for you.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t find that was accurate one applied.  </li>
            <li>It is light and makes my kin feel silky.</li>
            <li>Of course, as with any primer, it makes my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work fantastic</li>
            <li>It also makes your face silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I really, really, really wanted to love this primer</li>
            <li>I love the silky feel, but my face has a lot of redness and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help a whole lot with covering it up.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s soft and does a pretty good job at getting rid of the redness, but when you put on the foundation it sort of leave crumbs on your face after the foundation is applied.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for people with mild rosacea, like me.</li>
            <li>This green primer does make my skin feel silky smooth and looks great under my foundation; however, it does absolutely nothing to cover my redness, which was my primary purpose for purchasing it.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I bought my first tube at a Nordstrom&#x27;s sale and it lasted about a year!</li>
            <li>Smooth, rate low on SkinDeep cosmetics database and cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still new at the face primer thing, so this worked for me just fine.</li>
            <li>Its pure oil!</li>
            <li>So much so that I don&#x27;t even have to use anything else on my face if I don&#x27;t want!  </li>
            <li>I really like all of the NYX products and</li>
            <li>This primer goes on smooth and evens out my red skin.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a cream really...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been an outdoor person and my Very ruddy complexion is evidence of that.</li>
            <li>It controls oil very well, makes foundation long-wearing, and gives you a matte finish.</li>
            <li>My foundation glides over it evenly and stays looking good for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old with normal to dry skin and light wrinkles, but my real problem is splotchy redness.</li>
            <li>The NYX green concealer works way better to color correct.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely red and ruddy, and this green primer toned down my redness to a great amount.</li>
            <li>As soon as this stuff touches your skin it will turn clear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t reduce the redness as much as I hoped, but it did help my face powder stay on the entire evening.</li>
            <li>I think it does cover red, not as much as I had hoped, but I am still using the product.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing other than feel soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a smaller tube but just a little of the product goes a long way so it should last a while before I have to buy more.</li>

            <li> I never like to write a bad review, but this had no effect removing or balancing the warm colors of my face.</li>
            <li> and when i put it on, i had dry patches all over my face.</li>
            <li> I would put on a thin layer and wait about 10 minutes for it to dry and then commence the rest of my makeup routine, but my cheeks were still very noticeably red.</li>
            <li> it is VERY OILY and thin.</li>
            <li> this is the name brand awarded to The Drag superstar on Ru Paul....</li>
            <li> I had heard that green primer would do that, but you can still see my red splotches.</li>
            <li> Rosacea tends to leave your skin a bit bumpy and rough looking and just plain red.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small amount, but it does last.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have very little redness it may work, if you actually need to correct and cover I would look into the green NYX concealer instead.</li>
            <li> I purchased this primer to make the red spots on my face disappear or at least look diminished.</li>
            <li> When you try to put foundation over it, it will clump together and make your face look like a mess.</li>
            <li> It comes out green, but has so little pigment it disappears when you apply to your face.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Then it will sit heavily on your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily, it doesn&#x27;t hide any redness which is why it&#x27;s green.</li>
            <li> Its less olily!</li>
            <li> Ok not wowed by it but not the worst I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Ill keep using my usual primer and use Etude House&#x27;s green sweet choux base.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, I did not.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin type and broke me out.</li>
            <li> very faint color.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the coverage, or rather the lack thereof, that this provided.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok not wowed by it but not the worst I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I have some red spots on my face. This product covered them for me. I will definitely be purchasing this item again when needed. I really like all of the NYX products and the best thing of all is that they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money. As soon as this stuff touches your skin it will turn clear. Then it will sit heavily on your face. When you try to put foundation over it, it will clump together and make your face look like a mess.</li>
            <li> This primer goes on smooth and evens out my red skin. I have large pores and fine lines. This primer helps with the pores and lines but will not work miracles! It is light and makes my kin feel silky. My foundation glides over it evenly and stays looking good for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference using this.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference. The NYX green concealer works way better to color correct. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the coverage, or rather the lack thereof, that this provided.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a cream really...it is VERY OILY and thin.</li>
            <li> Of course, as with any primer, it makes my skin feel silky smooth. What I really like about it is the green tint. After watching a YouTube vid on applying foundation to cover acne, which promoted this product, I bought it, tried it, and Loved it. I always get complements on my makeup whenever I use this (sometimes hours after applying). Definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> I really, really, really wanted to love this primer but unfortunately, I did not. A friend recommended it to me to correct the redness on my cheeks, but it did not make the slightest difference. I would put on a thin layer and wait about 10 minutes for it to dry and then commence the rest of my makeup routine, but my cheeks were still very noticeably red. Maybe if you have very little redness it may work, if you actually need to correct and cover I would look into the green NYX concealer instead.</li>
            <li> This green primer does make my skin feel silky smooth and looks great under my foundation; however, it does absolutely nothing to cover my redness, which was my primary purpose for purchasing it. I am 47 years old with normal to dry skin and light wrinkles, but my real problem is splotchy redness. I love the way this primer makes my skin feel and the fact that it helps smooth out the light lines around my mouth and eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t cover my redness at all. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love the silky feel, but my face has a lot of redness and it doesn&#x27;t seem to help a whole lot with covering it up.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have done more research on this product. It&#x27;s oily, it doesn&#x27;t hide any redness which is why it&#x27;s green. It caused me to get break outs.</li>
            <li> I love it...this is the name brand awarded to The Drag superstar on Ru Paul....it works... it works...it works....it works....it works....it works.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for people with mild rosacea, like me. Rosacea tends to leave your skin a bit bumpy and rough looking and just plain red. This product left my skin smoother so i was able to apply face powder and have it look smooth for once. It doesn&#x27;t reduce the redness as much as I hoped, but it did help my face powder stay on the entire evening. I&#x27;m still new at the face primer thing, so this worked for me just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Nordstrom Rack about 3 years ago. Ever since, I have been buying this off of Amazon. It is the best primer I have EVER used. While it does feel initially greasy upon application, the texture is supremely silky. My skin is extremely red and ruddy, and this green primer toned down my redness to a great amount. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Smooth, rate low on SkinDeep cosmetics database and cheap! I really liked this product and would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been an outdoor person and my Very ruddy complexion is evidence of that. As I&#x27;m an &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; gal (47) this is the 1st time I&#x27;ve ever bought and used Primer and it TOTALLY removes my redness!  So much so that I don&#x27;t even have to use anything else on my face if I don&#x27;t want!  It feels a little greasy when first applied but that goes away after it sets a little while. This is a smaller tube but just a little of the product goes a long way so it should last a while before I have to buy more.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work fantastic but it&#x27;s ok. it feels like it dissepears when you put it on. also the packiging is smaller than looks on the pictere</li>
            <li> If you are someone that is not acne prone, and your pores do not clog easily - this is the primer for you. It controls oil very well, makes foundation long-wearing, and gives you a matte finish. I wanted to love this primer but unfortunately, it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin type and broke me out.</li>
            <li> best primer I hav ever used. takes away redness n helps makeup stay on longer</li>
            <li> Like all others that review this product, the feel is greasy at first but then blends in perfectly to the skin to leave a great satin surface for apply make-up, eyeshadow, etc. I bought my first tube at a Nordstrom&#x27;s sale and it lasted about a year! This one was my second purchase.</li>
            <li> Neutralizes any redness and is a great primer too!</li>
            <li> This primer was ok. It&#x27;s a small amount, but it does last. It did a good job on canceling out the redness in my skin, however it felt really greasy and didn&#x27;t make my foundation go on any smoother. If you don&#x27;t care about the smoothness part and just want your redness gone, then this product would be good. I don&#x27;t think this is the primer for me.</li>
            <li> Some reviews noted this primer was oily - didn&#x27;t find that was accurate one applied.  I think it does cover red, not as much as I had hoped, but I am still using the product.  May order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It didnt help with redness AT ALL. and when i put it on, i had dry patches all over my face. Ill keep using my usual primer and use Etude House&#x27;s green sweet choux base.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that covers the redness on my face.  I love this primer.  It also makes your face silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this primer to make the red spots on my face disappear or at least look diminished. That didn&#x27;t happen. I had heard that green primer would do that, but you can still see my red splotches.</li>
            <li> very faint color. cannot tell any decrease in  visible redness</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product. Does not help with redness at all!  Does absolutely nothing other than feel soft on your skin. Does not address the reason why I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, I like that it&#x27;s soft and does a pretty good job at getting rid of the redness, but when you put on the foundation it sort of leave crumbs on your face after the foundation is applied. But just wearing it by itself if amazing .</li>
            <li> I never like to write a bad review, but this had no effect removing or balancing the warm colors of my face. It comes out green, but has so little pigment it disappears when you apply to your face.</li>
            <li> DO NOT GET THIS!! Its pure oil! Don&#x27;t get it! Buy your self baby oil instead!!! Its less olily! You can&#x27;t tell a difference in the redness it just makes you skin olily and makeup runny!</li>
            <li> this is a non-event when you put it on.  Color so translucent, it doesn&#x27;t correct red patches at all.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t show, just moisturizes somewhat.</li>
    </ol>
