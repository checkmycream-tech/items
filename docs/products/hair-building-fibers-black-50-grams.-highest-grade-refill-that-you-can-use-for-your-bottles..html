            <li>This is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality all around.</li>
            <li>good stuff!!</li>
            <li>I love who ever invented this!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, good service.</li>
            <li>but I can say that I&#x27;ve used Caboki and Topik and hadn&#x27;t experienced this reaction.</li>
            <li>This product works great and for the price is a great deal..</li>
            <li>This stuff is great</li>
            <li>What a great deal.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>What I like about this refill system is now I can custom blend a more workable color by purchasing two colors and blending them together.</li>
            <li>Buying more.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It was as expected, I found Caboki to be a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li>This may not be the case for most users, but it was a huge annoyance for me.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on scalp and even covers gray !!</li>
            <li>After compacting both containers, I filled both containers almost to shaker cap.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;Purchasing this way is economical just refill ur bottle as needed.</li>
            <li>I was able to fill both of my used Caboki containers and have extra if I did not pack the two containers.  </li>
            <li>They work really well!  </li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I have hair again haha!</li>
            <li>Fills in nicely...mixes with Caboki very well.</li>
            <li>I save over 2/3&#x27;s the money compared to buying new bottle of Cabokki and or Topix.</li>
            <li>The dark brown matches with the light brown on caboki or toppik,</li>
            <li>Started using to fill any gaps -- it covers completely and lasts until u wash out .</li>
            <li>The same exact as Toppik, the only difference is the price.</li>
            <li>actually a more natural black shade, if you&#x27;re in between a dark brown and a black.</li>
            <li>A little lighter than Caboki but not by much.</li>

            <li> A little lighter than Caboki but not by much.</li>
            <li> so when i applied the first time my hair was kinda clumsy with two tonalities.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Toppik :(</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, this is hair dust not fibers,  I&#x27;ll just go back to toppikk</li>
            <li> I have used Toppik on my hair for the last year or so due to thinking as a result of alopecia areata.  </li>
            <li> but this is not equal to toppik, caboki or other concealers, color doesn&#x27;t match and quaity of the fibers</li>
            <li> Once I pinpointed this product as the potential problem, I discontinued use and it cleared up in a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I ordered this thinking it would be crap.</li>
            <li> One person said the Dark Brown wasn&#x27;t as dark as Toppik</li>
            <li> I purchased the Black 50 gram refill for my Caboki containers.  </li>
            <li> I purchased black, to mix, because of the comment, but didn&#x27;t need to do so.  </li>
            <li> The Black, incidently, is not jet black, like the Toppik Black...</li>
            <li> Not sure what &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; material is being used</li>
            <li> We have been using  The &amp;#34;ca&amp;#34; brand stuff for several years, we thought we would try this instead based on price.&lt;br /&gt;Added and used the same bottle, unfortunately it is clumping :(</li>
            <li> are poor.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work as expected, very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Close enough to Caboki</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I purchased the Black 50 gram refill for my Caboki containers.  I was able to fill both of my used Caboki containers and have extra if I did not pack the two containers.  After compacting both containers, I filled both containers almost to shaker cap.  I see no difference in quality in the container nor once it&#x27;s applied.  I will continue to purchase this version over Caboki from now on.</li>
            <li> Just like Toppik Hair Building Fibers but with tremendously low price.  One person said the Dark Brown wasn&#x27;t as dark as Toppik but I find it to be too close in color to warrant a comment.  I purchased black, to mix, because of the comment, but didn&#x27;t need to do so.  The Black, incidently, is not jet black, like the Toppik Black...actually a more natural black shade, if you&#x27;re in between a dark brown and a black.</li>
            <li> We have been using  The &amp;#34;ca&amp;#34; brand stuff for several years, we thought we would try this instead based on price.&lt;br /&gt;Added and used the same bottle, unfortunately it is clumping :(</li>
            <li> Rash formed on scalp, hands and around neck. Once I pinpointed this product as the potential problem, I discontinued use and it cleared up in a few days. Not sure what &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; material is being used but I can say that I&#x27;ve used Caboki and Topik and hadn&#x27;t experienced this reaction. This may not be the case for most users, but it was a huge annoyance for me.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother. No complaints!</li>
            <li> They work really well!  What I like about this refill system is now I can custom blend a more workable color by purchasing two colors and blending them together.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, good service. thanks!</li>
            <li> The same exact as Toppik, the only difference is the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I ordered this thinking it would be crap. I have used Toppik on my hair for the last year or so due to thinking as a result of alopecia areata.  This product exceeded my expectations.  I could not tell the difference in this product and Toppik except in the price.  I will definitely be purchasing again for refills.</li>
            <li> This product works great and for the price is a great deal..</li>
            <li> I use it instead of Caboki. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> used toppik before, I try to save money and buy this product but it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work as expected, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Toppik :(</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive but one package</li>
            <li> This stuff is great I love who ever invented this!!!</li>
            <li> What a great deal. Buying more.</li>
            <li> It was as expected, I found Caboki to be a good product at a great price. I will re-order as my supply diminishes..</li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectations as it pertains to quality, value for the money and delivery time. I save over 2/3&#x27;s the money compared to buying new bottle of Cabokki and or Topix.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality all around. Fills in nicely...mixes with Caboki very well. A little lighter than Caboki but not by much.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> good stuff!! use it all the time!!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years in shaker form . Started using to fill any gaps -- it covers completely and lasts until u wash out . It is very gentle on scalp and even covers gray !!&lt;br /&gt;Purchasing this way is economical just refill ur bottle as needed.</li>
            <li> Going to give this a star for the lowest price but this is not equal to toppik, caboki or other concealers, color doesn&#x27;t match and quaity of the fibers are poor. The dark brown matches with the light brown on caboki or toppik, so when i applied the first time my hair was kinda clumsy with two tonalities.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, this is hair dust not fibers,  I&#x27;ll just go back to toppikk</li>
            <li> I have hair again haha! Love it!</li>
