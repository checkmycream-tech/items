            <li>Wonderful job!!</li>
            <li>I rate the product 5 stars but the seller \\&quot;webs best deals\\&quot; about 3.5 -4 stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>Very nice shade.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to find it here and have it again!</li>
            <li>Got muy lipstick today the color is not as beautiful as I thought the pic looks much better.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite color!</li>
            <li>love this color!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color from Maybelline!</li>
            <li>I love Madison Mauve!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color that goes on smoothly without being sticky.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>An amazing color I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>so it was kind of messed up but looking at it, it didn&#x27;t looked used</li>
            <li>and it couldve been an honest mistake.</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency (not slimy, not drying)</li>
            <li>Nice creamy formula, love Maybelline lipsticks.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colors</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I bought it in a brick store before and love it but couldn&#x27;t find again until now.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my lips and my item came extremely fast but... it wasn&#x27;t sealed and it looked like it was pushed up on the case&#x27;s top</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick can&#x27;t find this one in the store</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Maybelline lipsticks, they make great colors.</li>
            <li>It is more &amp;#34;mauve-y&amp;#34;, which is not a bad thing, but not as stunning as in the pic.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly..</li>
            <li>It goes well with my brown hair and light complexion.</li>
            <li>No longer available in stores--</li>
            <li>The price is great and this Madison Mauve shade goes well with all skin tones and can be woren anytime of the day, especially evening into night.</li>
            <li>I also have Lavender Voltage and that color is rich and on the matte side.</li>
            <li>the shipping was quick though.</li>
            <li>I have light skin and dark hair and this color is gorgeous for my complexion.  </li>
            <li>The color is just slightly lighter than the picture, but this is a beautiful shade and very long-lasting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great quality lipstick that I apply once in the morning and usually once after lunch, and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>I received the item super fast.</li>
            <li>Exactly the color I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it looks like - a metallic lipstick.</li>
            <li>I wish it was dark like the picture, or even more purple-y like the picture.</li>
            <li>As a person of color (with darker lips), the color is a little sheer, but this is an overall great product.</li>
            <li>These had to be old, but wearable.</li>
            <li>THE  PICTURE SHOWN IS FAR FROM WHAT</li>
            <li>much darker than expected</li>
            <li>Item is not vibrant purple as pictured it is a neutral mauve and the formula of the actual lipstick is very sticky</li>
            <li>The LS is not dry at all just not the look</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wish it was dark like the picture, or even more purple-y like the picture. It&#x27;s also a lot sheerer than I thought it would be. I also have Lavender Voltage and that color is rich and on the matte side. I was hoping this one would be that way too but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> not a lipstick at all. thought it was.</li>

            <li> Not what I thought....</li>
            <li> I order this in the color \\&quot;Madison Mauve\\&quot;. And its a purple with a little glitter shine.
