            <li> Very nice and organized comb storage, Way nicer than allover the place in the drawer. Highly recommended. Thank you so much.</li>

            <li> Organizer is a bit odd, but it does the job of keeping your clips together.  Not bad price-wise either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and it meets most of my expectations. Perfect for buzzing away the MPB fringe. Gets it nice and tight without looking shaved to the skin. Easier to use these guards than adjusting the clippers with no guard - ends up looking even all around.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some angle guides and came across this set.  Each guide is labeled with the guide number as well as the size in inches.  The rack keeps them organized much better that having them loose in a drawer.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fit for my clippers. I lost the ones that came with my trimmer when I moved. Even if I do find them these will make great additions.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for.  They fit my Wahl clippers.  The carrying case is a little odd, but works OK.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent, love them, great organizer and easy to use</li>
            <li> These guides work well. The organizer is flimsy and doesn&#x27;t hold the combs well, but you are paying for the guide combs really. For basic hair cuts this works great.</li>
            <li> great product but not yet tested, thanks.</li>
            <li> Great addition to Wahl hair clipper.  The organizer comes in handy for quickly finding the comb that you want.  The combs do a great job!</li>
            <li> It fits really well on to my Remington and Conair hair clippers. Couldn&#x27;t be any happier. You are getting all the pieces you need for a great hair cut. Good price too.</li>
            <li> Looks well made. The holder seems very flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work with Wahl Professional 8081 trimmer. These are for the full size clippers</li>
            <li> This product is a perfect fit for my Wahl clippers..has all the sizes and an organizer to help keep items straight</li>
            <li> I got these to supplement what didn&#x27;t come with my new Wahl clippers and these work great. I could have done without the organizer though and I found it more difficult to use than it was worth.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement combs for my trimmer.  I don&#x27;t know how these things get lost but somehow they do.</li>
            <li> I you have a Wahl, you should consider this for even touch ups. It&#x27;s a nice addition to have in your closet. Use it a couple of times and it&#x27;s more then paid or itself.</li>
            <li> Have used Wahl clippers for eons.  Seems I have lost one or the other of the guide combs from every set I&#x27;ve owned.  Probably, it&#x27;s another one of those &amp;#34;missing teaspoon&amp;#34; phenomena... they simply vanish.  Maybe the rack to hold the little buggers will change my luck.</li>
