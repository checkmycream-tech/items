            <li>Lucky for me!!!  </li>
            <li>All in all very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that the consistency of ketchup is ideal, and that seems accurate from my experience.</li>
            <li>I am so happy :)</li>
            <li>and i LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>(yeah its a pain but better than suffering a swollen face and itching from PPD for a month!).  </li>
            <li>one worked great for getting almost all the mix out and provides the slip for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the brown color.</li>
            <li>I switched from chemical dyes about 6 months ago and have been thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, not everything works for everyone, so use at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend stirring in warm water until it&#x27;s sorta like</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 1/30/16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using this &amp; loving it.</li>
            <li>I also noticed a nice side effect -</li>
            <li>Henna King refunded me for the unused products that I ended up returning at my own cost.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with it, and my hair really is in better shape than before with the henna.</li>
            <li>I switched to Natural Tints and it&#x27;s been the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>To every woman out there that wants to go natural...you have to use this product for your grays and to give your hair a beautiful shine and color.</li>
            <li>I have very light ash brown hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really healthy to use if it&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I get complimented all the time about how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li>so I focused more on those areas, but all my hair was coated with product.</li>
            <li>30 minutes total, smelled great, and my hair looks good.</li>
            <li>I bought so many packets</li>
            <li>even those marketed as PPD free!</li>
            <li>I had to cut my hair to get rid of most of the damage.</li>
            <li>My top layer is at ear level which is where it broke off at and the rest of my hair is at shoulder length which is where it stop being tangled.</li>
            <li>I wish I had more resistant hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Love this company.</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>all my mistakes, and the short time (1 and 1/2 hours) that I allowed it to set, my hair turned out awesome</li>
            <li>LOve this stuff.</li>
            <li>I will be using this from here on out thats&#x27; for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I start using Henna to color my hair.</li>
            <li>I believe th more u use henna</li>
            <li>the more your hair becomes healthier.</li>
            <li>The gray covers better.</li>
            <li>I will definitely use this product from now on and the best thing was no allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>By the way, the way the Henna Maiden also tells you to go through some grand palaver of mixing the henna for 30 minutes - once every 5 minutes or some circus like that.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that this dyes better on hair that has already been hennaed before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Henna maiden for 2 years now , I love it</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this product.</li>
            <li>Nice rich color.</li>
            <li>As long as you have the time and the inclination, this is the perfect alternative to color dyes.</li>
            <li>It felt good on my scalp and my hair was So shiny and full feeling right afterwards.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with with henna maiden hair dye, If it turned out this good, with all the misteaks, imagine how good it could be if I do it right, next time!</li>
            <li>It was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as easy for me to use.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and gets damaged easily.  </li>
            <li>Everything seemed fine.</li>
            <li>The color looks great and still going strong 3 wks later.  </li>
            <li>Henna is a fabulous alternative.</li>
            <li>You can leave it on for hours to achieve the precise color you want without fear of chemical burns.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit different to apply, but it turned out great.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li>Went to Walmart and bought a box of Olia hair dye (ammonia free, oil based hair color).</li>
            <li>My hair looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I put light &amp; med brown together</li>
            <li>I woke up in the middle of the night with great discomfort</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I used Henna, but it is the first time that I used Henna Maiden, and I loved it.</li>
            <li>First of all this product had very detailed and informative instructions.  </li>
            <li>I will most certainly be using this again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on me, the environment, and if I&#x27;m careful, leaves my hair looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li>My original hair color was med.</li>
            <li>First off I want to say that not every product works for everyone, however I was fairly confident that I wouldn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li>Not as much as originally</li>
            <li>My original plan was to switch to henna so that I could gradually transition to going gray.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much that I may not let myself go gray after all!  </li>
            <li>As much as I don&#x27;t want to use chemicals, I think reapplying the henna often will damage my hair a lot more.</li>
            <li>and then I stopped doing that and started doing full head henna with one color.</li>
            <li>Hair color is true to image.  </li>
            <li>I would advise ordering enough for your needs and mixing according to other reviewers&#x27; instructions (more watery consistency, add vinegar, leave on for hours etc) to get the best results.</li>
            <li>, I get lots of compliments on my hair, the main thing I like is  its natural chemical free , it&#x27;s actually good for my hair .</li>
            <li>I went from a light reddish/blond to a beautiful dark brown that is pretty close to the picture.</li>
            <li>The smell was fine because the coffee odor was pretty overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I did was get better plastic gloves :)</li>
            <li>I will miss going blonde now and then, but this is just so much more healthy.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy no longer using chemicals in my hair...and the color is lovely and soft.</li>
            <li>First, make sure you don&#x27;t add too much water.</li>
            <li>It may be a bit challenging to apply at first but really...</li>
            <li>The color looks good on the other 14 inches of my hair so not bad.</li>
            <li>This product is a great way to color your hair without applying harsh, damaging chemicals to your head.</li>
            <li>It always arrives fast and I like the deals of buy 3 and get 1 for free.</li>
            <li>Since each box has 100 grams worth of henna</li>
            <li>BUT SO WORTH IT AND</li>
            <li>The only thing I would advise is get your own plastic gloves that don&#x27;t slide around.</li>
            <li>Next, and this is the most important thing I have learned, invest in one of the those dye applicator brushes that salons use to add color.</li>
            <li>,the greys were a golden brown, right after i rinsed and shampooed it out.</li>
            <li>so I could put it up right after it</li>
            <li>The smell is fine, and it&#x27;s easy and simple.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, I dyed my hair from medium brown to &amp;#34;delicious dark brown&amp;#34; and it came out fantastic</li>
            <li>MY FIRST TIME USING HENNA</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I leave it in for the total 3 hours it will do a better job, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this over the smell of chemicals!</li>
            <li>My scalp and hair are so much happier!</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying Henna</li>
            <li>Maybe mine worked better than some of the reviews I read because I was out in the sunshine which definitely heated up the processing.  </li>
            <li>But for now on I&#x27;ll treat it like a spa day, I also read you can add essential oils to make it smell better.</li>
            <li>This is consistent with box and salon colors on my hair.  </li>
            <li>followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Henna.</li>
            <li>I know what I need to do differently; saturate the roots more don&#x27;t use shampoo.</li>
            <li>I just add hot water &amp; stir.</li>
            <li>First off this product is junk.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Henna King!</li>
            <li>There is an odor, but it goes away after the first shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used this product once and then ordered more, the 2nd time I used it</li>
            <li>Am I the first person ever who used this product and got a severe reaction to it?</li>
            <li>Believe me when I say this was merely not enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I colored my whole head all three times, plus the color faded super fast, like 1 to 2 weeks</li>
            <li>So based on positive reviews here, we gave a try.</li>
            <li>it even hurt after washing it out and even into the next day, I lost so much hair and it caused so much breakage at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I follow the directions on the package exactly, using 1/3 of a package and 1/3 tsp salt, as I have fine and relatively short hair.  </li>
            <li>The delicious dark brown hair color did not dry my Afro textured hair and hid all of my stubborn white hair.</li>
            <li>but nothing I couldn&#x27;t take for 30 mins and when I washed it out, it was fine, I started losing a little more hair then normal.</li>
            <li>and my hair is still super soft after a month.</li>
            <li>After the first time I colored with light brown henna and not liking the red at all,I started doing mixes.</li>
            <li>It gives nice dark brown results and lasts much longer then a demi hair color.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mix essential oil to mask the plant smell, your hair will smell strongly of henna.</li>
            <li>these gloves were too large for everyone in my family.</li>
            <li>If the instruction is on a piece of paper instead of the back of the packet, it would be better because the words are kind of small to read.  </li>
            <li>I recently ordered Nupur Henna (available on Amazon) which is pure and comes from India.  </li>
            <li>You do need to make sure to use a very thick coating and make sure it is comepletely covered.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really make my hair softer as some others reported.</li>
            <li>The color was much darker that I thought it would be.i read that I could lighten the color by using honey, olive oil and lemon juice.</li>
            <li>I will try a light color next time</li>
            <li>Five stars for this product, and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am very allergic to hair dye; this product worked and I suffered no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much healthier since I started using Henna color.</li>
            <li>Much kinder to your hair than dye.</li>
            <li>The goop really does seem to have improved the quality of my hair.</li>
            <li>I picked one up for like $2 from a beauty shop, and that made application so much easier.</li>
            <li>&amp; I really needed a change from store</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much to bring them out.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to save some time</li>
            <li>Light, medium- brown with red tints.</li>
            <li>Really GREEN&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it and the smell resembles tea and spinach.</li>
            <li>This sellers service is very prompt &amp; you&#x27;ll get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my roots took much longer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the whole packet.  </li>
            <li>I received a very unkind email from Henna King regarding this review.</li>
            <li>I have used Henna King for several years but the last couple of purchases it seems the formula has changed as I am not getting the nice results I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Especially not covering the gray which was not an issue before.</li>
            <li>I developed the allergic only two years ago and thought I would never be able to color the gray.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t stray too far from my natural color, just sometimes more golden or red tones when I&#x27;m in the mood for a change.</li>
            <li>Eliminates most of the red in natural henna</li>
            <li>When I was doing the colors I waited until I saw a good amount of regrowth at least 2 inches.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for the first time because I am pregnant and was looking for an alternative to regular hair color.  </li>
            <li>I always cleaned my hair with a natural shampoo right before using.</li>
            <li>I have not dyed my hair in several months, and was excited to try a henna product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had better results with other henna brands.</li>
            <li>( like I said, thought it was water, lol) applied the thick paste to my hair, section  by section, coating each small section of hair,starting with the hairline crown section, which had most of the gray.</li>
            <li>The color was nice, I mixed half dark brown and medium brown, but despite leaving it on for many hours it didn&#x27;t last for more than a month.</li>
            <li>Instructions are clear and it worked for my first trial.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally dark brown, and has been chemically dyed many times...</li>
            <li>I love the dark chicane</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product and it was very effective at covering the persistent orange and red hairs left over from a previous application of henna.</li>
            <li>I love how my grays were colored but slightly lighter than the rest of my hair</li>
            <li>Definitely gonna buy more in the future</li>
            <li>I must have put too much water in the mix because for the two hours I had this goop on my head, I had to use a whole role of tissues to mop up my face and neck from the frequent dripping of the dye.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops of your favorite scented oil, and the smell is really reduced.</li>
            <li>I twisted each coated section on top of my head, until all my hair was on top of my head.</li>
            <li>So either add fragrance or use a highly scented shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, but yes, it does have an earthy scent that stays on for a couple of days, but that&#x27;s trivial.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft straight away.  </li>
            <li>Instructions said to completely saturate, and I know I wasn&#x27;t very saturated</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have that kind of time and will have to plan for next time, so I only left it on 45 min.</li>
            <li>Used the henna the first day and it barely colored the gray hair.</li>
            <li>The green powder and the process may seem daunting at first, but it is well worth it!  </li>
            <li>and it was turning red in the light or outside.</li>
            <li>And my hair is very soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I got &amp;#34;delicious dark brown&amp;#34; and it turned out a light to medium brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now keep in mind after the initially rinse it was advised to leave hair unwashed with shampoo for the first 48 hrs.</li>
            <li>The cap was too small to fit the whole head.  </li>
            <li>usually get Henna from local India grocery and worked great, but the grocery store closed out.</li>
            <li>The second time I boxed dyed I started hurting a little on the top of my head</li>
            <li>So you can imagine how excited I would be to use something that would take a fraction of that time and require less work.</li>
            <li>I bought two boxes since my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li>natural.</li>
            <li>it keeps the hair to look as natural</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this because I feel like my scalp is allergic to what they use in the salon, and I wanted to try something all natural.  </li>
            <li>It did take 2 applications to completely cover the gray hair.  </li>
            <li>However it did leave my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is a lifesaver for someone graying early.</li>
            <li>so much, that I had to get something different.</li>
            <li>I had to use a very slippery conditioner, for me the tresemme split ends white bottle</li>
            <li>so it looked like natural highlights.  </li>
            <li>That covered my gray completely.</li>
            <li>With Lush you have to grate the blocks</li>
            <li>I like the Lush brand also</li>
            <li>It is completely natural</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny - never damaged.  </li>
            <li>I only really smell it when I am at the gym sweating</li>
            <li>I heard about Henna King natural vegan hair color.  </li>
            <li>(My Nurse Practitioner said I developed a sensitivity to it after using it the 1st time)</li>
            <li>Yes you can be allergic, despite it being &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li>but it wasnt enough for my whole head like it explained there was in the details.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty good on the eyebrows too, which seems to be very difficult to color.  </li>
            <li>Three weeks later, the color and texture of my hair is still just as vibrant and soft as day one.</li>
            <li>I have naturally medium dark brown hair with a few grays, and it enhances my hair color nicely.  </li>
            <li>The strands turned into a light blonde which doesn&#x27;t work with my hair since I have dark brown hair!Then</li>
            <li>First time user, I made a big mistake when I mixed mine up.</li>
            <li>The first difference I noticed was how it left a red stain on my fingers the moment I touched it after mixing it.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it especially since there is no mixing required to get your desired color!</li>
            <li>3 hours was a bit much to me but as long as I&#x27;m not working it was no problem.</li>
            <li>Washed my hair with a clarifying shampoo, let it dry till slightly damp, mixed the henna with warm water and added a tiny bit of perfume oil, smeared it all over my hair, put the cap on and did gardening for 3 hours.  </li>
            <li>43 year old hair has only been color treated with Clairol natural instincts, one time ever.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone that has the time (it does take an hour and a half) and wants to limit exposure to chemicals.</li>
            <li>I had to switch back to my old brand and start all over again for this month&#x27;s color!</li>
            <li>I have brown wavy hair that has natural red undertones in it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just very heard to believe... due to all the other positive reviews I wanted to give this Henna product a shot.&lt;br /&gt;First time using Henna.</li>
            <li>Never will I put harsh chemicals on my little head : )</li>
            <li>I had to wash it at least 3 times just for it to feel semi clean.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I wish they had provided more gloves for future applications, as, with my short hair, I only needed to use a third of the powder.  </li>
            <li>I tried Light, Medium, Dark, Black henna.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair as bad as chemicals, makes it full and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The light brown henna was too red, the medium brown had just a hint of red, the dark brown henna no red, and black was no red.</li>
            <li>I really like the Dark brown henna!</li>

            <li> Lucky for me!!!  </li>
            <li> All in all very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that the consistency of ketchup is ideal, and that seems accurate from my experience.</li>
            <li> I am so happy :)</li>
            <li> and i LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> (yeah its a pain but better than suffering a swollen face and itching from PPD for a month!).  </li>
            <li> one worked great for getting almost all the mix out and provides the slip for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the brown color.</li>
            <li> I switched from chemical dyes about 6 months ago and have been thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, not everything works for everyone, so use at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend stirring in warm water until it&#x27;s sorta like</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 1/30/16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using this &amp; loving it.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a nice side effect -</li>
            <li> Henna King refunded me for the unused products that I ended up returning at my own cost.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with it, and my hair really is in better shape than before with the henna.</li>
            <li> I switched to Natural Tints and it&#x27;s been the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> To every woman out there that wants to go natural...you have to use this product for your grays and to give your hair a beautiful shine and color.</li>
            <li> I have very light ash brown hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really healthy to use if it&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I get complimented all the time about how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li> so I focused more on those areas, but all my hair was coated with product.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes total, smelled great, and my hair looks good.</li>
            <li> I bought so many packets</li>
            <li> even those marketed as PPD free!</li>
            <li> I had to cut my hair to get rid of most of the damage.</li>
            <li> My top layer is at ear level which is where it broke off at and the rest of my hair is at shoulder length which is where it stop being tangled.</li>
            <li> I wish I had more resistant hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Love this company.</li>
            <li> Love the product</li>
            <li> all my mistakes, and the short time (1 and 1/2 hours) that I allowed it to set, my hair turned out awesome</li>
            <li> LOve this stuff.</li>
            <li> I will be using this from here on out thats&#x27; for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I start using Henna to color my hair.</li>
            <li> I believe th more u use henna</li>
            <li> the more your hair becomes healthier.</li>
            <li> The gray covers better.</li>
            <li> I will definitely use this product from now on and the best thing was no allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> By the way, the way the Henna Maiden also tells you to go through some grand palaver of mixing the henna for 30 minutes - once every 5 minutes or some circus like that.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that this dyes better on hair that has already been hennaed before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Henna maiden for 2 years now , I love it</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product.</li>
            <li> Nice rich color.</li>
            <li> As long as you have the time and the inclination, this is the perfect alternative to color dyes.</li>
            <li> It felt good on my scalp and my hair was So shiny and full feeling right afterwards.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with with henna maiden hair dye, If it turned out this good, with all the misteaks, imagine how good it could be if I do it right, next time!</li>
            <li> It was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and gets damaged easily.  </li>
            <li> Everything seemed fine.</li>
            <li> The color looks great and still going strong 3 wks later.  </li>
            <li> Henna is a fabulous alternative.</li>
            <li> You can leave it on for hours to achieve the precise color you want without fear of chemical burns.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit different to apply, but it turned out great.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li> Went to Walmart and bought a box of Olia hair dye (ammonia free, oil based hair color).</li>
            <li> My hair looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I put light &amp; med brown together</li>
            <li> I woke up in the middle of the night with great discomfort</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I used Henna, but it is the first time that I used Henna Maiden, and I loved it.</li>
            <li> First of all this product had very detailed and informative instructions.  </li>
            <li> I will most certainly be using this again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on me, the environment, and if I&#x27;m careful, leaves my hair looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li> My original hair color was med.</li>
            <li> First off I want to say that not every product works for everyone, however I was fairly confident that I wouldn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> Not as much as originally</li>
            <li> My original plan was to switch to henna so that I could gradually transition to going gray.  </li>
            <li> I love this so much that I may not let myself go gray after all!  </li>
            <li> As much as I don&#x27;t want to use chemicals, I think reapplying the henna often will damage my hair a lot more.</li>
            <li> and then I stopped doing that and started doing full head henna with one color.</li>
            <li> Hair color is true to image.  </li>
            <li> I would advise ordering enough for your needs and mixing according to other reviewers&#x27; instructions (more watery consistency, add vinegar, leave on for hours etc) to get the best results.</li>
            <li> , I get lots of compliments on my hair, the main thing I like is  its natural chemical free , it&#x27;s actually good for my hair .</li>
            <li> I went from a light reddish/blond to a beautiful dark brown that is pretty close to the picture.</li>
            <li> The smell was fine because the coffee odor was pretty overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I did was get better plastic gloves :)</li>
            <li> I will miss going blonde now and then, but this is just so much more healthy.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy no longer using chemicals in my hair...and the color is lovely and soft.</li>
            <li> First, make sure you don&#x27;t add too much water.</li>
            <li> It may be a bit challenging to apply at first but really...</li>
            <li> The color looks good on the other 14 inches of my hair so not bad.</li>
            <li> This product is a great way to color your hair without applying harsh, damaging chemicals to your head.</li>
            <li> It always arrives fast and I like the deals of buy 3 and get 1 for free.</li>
            <li> Since each box has 100 grams worth of henna</li>
            <li> BUT SO WORTH IT AND</li>
            <li> The only thing I would advise is get your own plastic gloves that don&#x27;t slide around.</li>
            <li> Next, and this is the most important thing I have learned, invest in one of the those dye applicator brushes that salons use to add color.</li>
            <li> ,the greys were a golden brown, right after i rinsed and shampooed it out.</li>
            <li> so I could put it up right after it</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, and it&#x27;s easy and simple.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I dyed my hair from medium brown to &amp;#34;delicious dark brown&amp;#34; and it came out fantastic</li>
            <li> MY FIRST TIME USING HENNA</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I leave it in for the total 3 hours it will do a better job, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this over the smell of chemicals!</li>
            <li> My scalp and hair are so much happier!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Henna</li>
            <li> Maybe mine worked better than some of the reviews I read because I was out in the sunshine which definitely heated up the processing.  </li>
            <li> But for now on I&#x27;ll treat it like a spa day, I also read you can add essential oils to make it smell better.</li>
            <li> This is consistent with box and salon colors on my hair.  </li>
            <li> followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Henna.</li>
            <li> I know what I need to do differently; saturate the roots more don&#x27;t use shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just add hot water &amp; stir.</li>
            <li> First off this product is junk.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Henna King!</li>
            <li> There is an odor, but it goes away after the first shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and then ordered more, the 2nd time I used it</li>
            <li> Am I the first person ever who used this product and got a severe reaction to it?</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say this was merely not enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I colored my whole head all three times, plus the color faded super fast, like 1 to 2 weeks</li>
            <li> So based on positive reviews here, we gave a try.</li>
            <li> it even hurt after washing it out and even into the next day, I lost so much hair and it caused so much breakage at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions on the package exactly, using 1/3 of a package and 1/3 tsp salt, as I have fine and relatively short hair.  </li>
            <li> The delicious dark brown hair color did not dry my Afro textured hair and hid all of my stubborn white hair.</li>
            <li> but nothing I couldn&#x27;t take for 30 mins and when I washed it out, it was fine, I started losing a little more hair then normal.</li>
            <li> and my hair is still super soft after a month.</li>
            <li> After the first time I colored with light brown henna and not liking the red at all,I started doing mixes.</li>
            <li> It gives nice dark brown results and lasts much longer then a demi hair color.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mix essential oil to mask the plant smell, your hair will smell strongly of henna.</li>
            <li> these gloves were too large for everyone in my family.</li>
            <li> If the instruction is on a piece of paper instead of the back of the packet, it would be better because the words are kind of small to read.  </li>
            <li> I recently ordered Nupur Henna (available on Amazon) which is pure and comes from India.  </li>
            <li> You do need to make sure to use a very thick coating and make sure it is comepletely covered.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really make my hair softer as some others reported.</li>
            <li> The color was much darker that I thought it would be.i read that I could lighten the color by using honey, olive oil and lemon juice.</li>
            <li> I will try a light color next time</li>
            <li> Five stars for this product, and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to hair dye; this product worked and I suffered no allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much healthier since I started using Henna color.</li>
            <li> Much kinder to your hair than dye.</li>
            <li> The goop really does seem to have improved the quality of my hair.</li>
            <li> I picked one up for like $2 from a beauty shop, and that made application so much easier.</li>
            <li> &amp; I really needed a change from store</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much to bring them out.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to save some time</li>
            <li> Light, medium- brown with red tints.</li>
            <li> Really GREEN&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it and the smell resembles tea and spinach.</li>
            <li> This sellers service is very prompt &amp; you&#x27;ll get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my roots took much longer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the whole packet.  </li>
            <li> I received a very unkind email from Henna King regarding this review.</li>
            <li> I have used Henna King for several years but the last couple of purchases it seems the formula has changed as I am not getting the nice results I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Especially not covering the gray which was not an issue before.</li>
            <li> I developed the allergic only two years ago and thought I would never be able to color the gray.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t stray too far from my natural color, just sometimes more golden or red tones when I&#x27;m in the mood for a change.</li>
            <li> Eliminates most of the red in natural henna</li>
            <li> When I was doing the colors I waited until I saw a good amount of regrowth at least 2 inches.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the first time because I am pregnant and was looking for an alternative to regular hair color.  </li>
            <li> I always cleaned my hair with a natural shampoo right before using.</li>
            <li> I have not dyed my hair in several months, and was excited to try a henna product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had better results with other henna brands.</li>
            <li> ( like I said, thought it was water, lol) applied the thick paste to my hair, section  by section, coating each small section of hair,starting with the hairline crown section, which had most of the gray.</li>
            <li> The color was nice, I mixed half dark brown and medium brown, but despite leaving it on for many hours it didn&#x27;t last for more than a month.</li>
            <li> Instructions are clear and it worked for my first trial.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown, and has been chemically dyed many times...</li>
            <li> I love the dark chicane</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product and it was very effective at covering the persistent orange and red hairs left over from a previous application of henna.</li>
            <li> I love how my grays were colored but slightly lighter than the rest of my hair</li>
            <li> Definitely gonna buy more in the future</li>
            <li> I must have put too much water in the mix because for the two hours I had this goop on my head, I had to use a whole role of tissues to mop up my face and neck from the frequent dripping of the dye.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops of your favorite scented oil, and the smell is really reduced.</li>
            <li> I twisted each coated section on top of my head, until all my hair was on top of my head.</li>
            <li> So either add fragrance or use a highly scented shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, but yes, it does have an earthy scent that stays on for a couple of days, but that&#x27;s trivial.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft straight away.  </li>
            <li> Instructions said to completely saturate, and I know I wasn&#x27;t very saturated</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that kind of time and will have to plan for next time, so I only left it on 45 min.</li>
            <li> Used the henna the first day and it barely colored the gray hair.</li>
            <li> The green powder and the process may seem daunting at first, but it is well worth it!  </li>
            <li> and it was turning red in the light or outside.</li>
            <li> And my hair is very soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I got &amp;#34;delicious dark brown&amp;#34; and it turned out a light to medium brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now keep in mind after the initially rinse it was advised to leave hair unwashed with shampoo for the first 48 hrs.</li>
            <li> The cap was too small to fit the whole head.  </li>
            <li> usually get Henna from local India grocery and worked great, but the grocery store closed out.</li>
            <li> The second time I boxed dyed I started hurting a little on the top of my head</li>
            <li> So you can imagine how excited I would be to use something that would take a fraction of that time and require less work.</li>
            <li> I bought two boxes since my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li> natural.</li>
            <li> it keeps the hair to look as natural</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because I feel like my scalp is allergic to what they use in the salon, and I wanted to try something all natural.  </li>
            <li> It did take 2 applications to completely cover the gray hair.  </li>
            <li> However it did leave my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is a lifesaver for someone graying early.</li>
            <li> so much, that I had to get something different.</li>
            <li> I had to use a very slippery conditioner, for me the tresemme split ends white bottle</li>
            <li> so it looked like natural highlights.  </li>
            <li> That covered my gray completely.</li>
            <li> With Lush you have to grate the blocks</li>
            <li> I like the Lush brand also</li>
            <li> It is completely natural</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny - never damaged.  </li>
            <li> I only really smell it when I am at the gym sweating</li>
            <li> I heard about Henna King natural vegan hair color.  </li>
            <li> (My Nurse Practitioner said I developed a sensitivity to it after using it the 1st time)</li>
            <li> Yes you can be allergic, despite it being &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li> but it wasnt enough for my whole head like it explained there was in the details.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty good on the eyebrows too, which seems to be very difficult to color.  </li>
            <li> Three weeks later, the color and texture of my hair is still just as vibrant and soft as day one.</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium dark brown hair with a few grays, and it enhances my hair color nicely.  </li>
            <li> The strands turned into a light blonde which doesn&#x27;t work with my hair since I have dark brown hair!Then</li>
            <li> First time user, I made a big mistake when I mixed mine up.</li>
            <li> The first difference I noticed was how it left a red stain on my fingers the moment I touched it after mixing it.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it especially since there is no mixing required to get your desired color!</li>
            <li> 3 hours was a bit much to me but as long as I&#x27;m not working it was no problem.</li>
            <li> Washed my hair with a clarifying shampoo, let it dry till slightly damp, mixed the henna with warm water and added a tiny bit of perfume oil, smeared it all over my hair, put the cap on and did gardening for 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> 43 year old hair has only been color treated with Clairol natural instincts, one time ever.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone that has the time (it does take an hour and a half) and wants to limit exposure to chemicals.</li>
            <li> I had to switch back to my old brand and start all over again for this month&#x27;s color!</li>
            <li> I have brown wavy hair that has natural red undertones in it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just very heard to believe... due to all the other positive reviews I wanted to give this Henna product a shot.&lt;br /&gt;First time using Henna.</li>
            <li> Never will I put harsh chemicals on my little head : )</li>
            <li> I had to wash it at least 3 times just for it to feel semi clean.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish they had provided more gloves for future applications, as, with my short hair, I only needed to use a third of the powder.  </li>
            <li> I tried Light, Medium, Dark, Black henna.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair as bad as chemicals, makes it full and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> The light brown henna was too red, the medium brown had just a hint of red, the dark brown henna no red, and black was no red.</li>
            <li> I really like the Dark brown henna!</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell, but I am familiar to weird natural smells...</li>
            <li> not anymore difficult than the other kind.</li>
            <li> I found that after I washed it thoroughly with African Black Soap and some diluted Dr. Bronners the smell was pretty much gone completely, at least when dry.</li>
            <li> I use hot water only and slowly mix it to were</li>
            <li> First treatment I left on at least 2 hours while i went about my Saturday morning house work... now for touch ups an hour is usually enough to color the grey.  </li>
            <li> It was really hard trying to figure out what mix I was using, so I played around with other mixes and did full head henna with the mixes</li>
            <li> I think it builds up over time, so next time, I will not leave it on as long -</li>
            <li> It covered the gray however does not last to long.</li>
            <li> When i purchased this product it took a long time to get here not only did it take forever</li>
            <li> My hair does not turn black but it turns a dark brown and over time it turns red as all pure hennas do.  </li>
            <li> I mean very intense.</li>
            <li> All the grey hair turned gold and my natural dark brown hair is a richer brown.  </li>
            <li> There were these black pieces flaking out of my hair for several days, several shampoos later.</li>
            <li> My grey hair also went only slightly red/orange instead of a deep red that Nuput Henna gives.  </li>
            <li> I realized about an hour and a half into it, that I had in fact used straight vinegar to mix it with, and my head was slightly burning too.</li>
            <li> I had performed a strand test to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic but it still made my head itch like crazy after using it.</li>
            <li> IS YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE HENNA IN YOUR HAIR FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> SO PLAN A LONG DAY FOR THIS</li>
            <li> It takes too long for color to set in.</li>
            <li> so once I decided to do this tonight u hadn&#x27;t realized how long you should leave it on.</li>
            <li> How long it lasts is yet to be seen, it has been a week and is still holding the color.  </li>
            <li> May need Decca d application for grey hair as stated in instructions.</li>
            <li> 3) definitely put lots of conditioner on your hair when you go to rinse out the henna (absolutely no shampoo for 24 hours).  </li>
            <li> but that was to long for my neck,</li>
            <li> If this helps anyone else with stubborn gray -- I used tea made in distilled water mixed with a tbsp white vinegar and olive oil along with a few drops of lavender essential oil.  </li>
            <li> I just wish I&#x27;d found this product a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t cover all the grey I have, considering I never did this before, the result is satisfactory and I will continue to try.</li>
            <li> The product tinted my naturally brown hair green and my grey hair orange.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, the white are still white or maybe little grey, not brown, not darker.</li>
            <li> Next time I plan to let the mixture sit as other reviewers say to do.  </li>
            <li> Typically other henna products have some color run-off onto pillowcases and towels for awhile, but this was way different.</li>
            <li> The henna made my hair thick with a vibrant color.  </li>
            <li> I tried the dark brown hair color one pack and left it on for 2 hours, it covered the gray but not all.</li>
            <li> One box will give you 3 times applicaton if you are male with average length/amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> For root touch up, I found it was so much easier, less henna, less mess,</li>
            <li> It actually has thickened my hair slightly</li>
            <li> The next day I noticed a slight itch on my scalp and</li>
            <li> I also added in essential oils and a little coconut oil for softness</li>
            <li> This product was more difficult for me to use than one other I had used in the past.  </li>
            <li> so bad, burning sensation on the top of my head</li>
            <li> I mix the dark brown &amp; the medium brown together, the only complaint I have is it doesn&#x27;t last too long, not even a month.</li>
            <li> The areas of my hair which were blonde aren&#x27;t a dark dark brown, but they are brown.</li>
            <li> I did, and I spent hours dripping while I waited to rinse out.</li>
            <li> And for days after I smelled like a cross between dirt and green tea.</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hair off for a very long time and yet all of this black dirt-type product remained in it.</li>
            <li> I add a little vinegar to the paste to help it cover the loads of grey.  </li>
            <li> Will need to experiment mixing it with other stuff (like henna)</li>
            <li> It did not color my greys as well as my other brand.</li>
            <li> Will update if I try the other color.</li>
            <li> Sometimes reapply before I&#x27;m due for coloring just for the conditioning.</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews before choosing to buy this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and normal thickness</li>
            <li> I just wanted to add to the other complaints to warn others who may want to try this.</li>
            <li> It would get a little darker the next few days</li>
            <li> It was a lot of work for very minimal staying power.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very carefully.</li>
            <li> how long I have the henna on my hair so not sure what the issue is</li>
            <li> I bought the dark brown color.  </li>
            <li> I ordered one pack of this to dye my long hair (not quite waist length but past the bust).</li>
            <li> I made a mixture of henna maiden dark brown, with a teaspoon of salt (recommended in the instructions) and about a cup of vinegar</li>
            <li> The dark brown gave all the grays the prettiest carmel colored highlights...but not at all brassy.</li>
            <li> I will say before applying my hair was a dark reddish brown with lighter tips.</li>
            <li> So now it&#x27;s a dark brown with dark auburn.</li>
            <li> Read this enhances the dark color.</li>
            <li> Hair was quite dark.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly, left it on for 2.5 hours and got green color!!</li>
            <li> Dark and black, my hair was black with dark brown tints.</li>
            <li> Lots of black specks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: After about a week and a half my hair stopped falling out.</li>
            <li> less time washing it out.</li>
            <li> My roots are still black but not so noticeable.</li>
            <li> the horrilbe smell gave me a slight headache.</li>
            <li> I used 200gms since I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> The second time I used this it turned my grey hair Green !!!!</li>
            <li> I colored my hair a little over 3 weeks ago and just started getting some grays.  </li>
            <li> I used milk and little water to mix together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used black tea in my water mix instead of plain filtered water.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of kelp powder and even a little bit like matcha green tea powder.</li>
            <li> brown with a few bleached ends.</li>
            <li> It was extremely messy to apply and there was grit in my hair for days.  </li>
            <li> I have learned a few things, however.</li>
            <li> Have even got a few compliments on the color from others.</li>
            <li> when I do it again, I&#x27;ll try for a few hours and see how that works.  </li>
            <li> air dried.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste product</li>
            <li> It turned my gray hairs green.</li>
            <li> I did not wash my hair immediatly or do anything to it for almost 48 hours to see if the green would fade out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a few days for the color to fully develop.</li>
            <li> The first time I did it, I felt a little tingling and burning, but nothing to bad.</li>
            <li> Also, if I make the paste too stiff, I have issues with coverage.  </li>
            <li> but the roots are a bit green each time now with very little coverage.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible as most henna hair dyes do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated having light colored hair, but I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out, so I needed to change to something gentler</li>
            <li> Usually after coloring my scalp is irritated because of seborrheic demerits.</li>
            <li> And i was not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> and it is very messy.</li>
            <li> In the past I had used Lush products which smelled bad and had to be on your hair for about 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I almost literally tore at my scalp from itching it so hard while washing.</li>
            <li> It was a lil messy, but not too bad since my hair is short.  </li>
            <li> I lost at least 2 handfuls of hair.</li>
            <li> So I freaked out, and jumped in the shower to rinse it all out, also, I shampooed ( which you should not do, for a least 24 hours after coloring)&lt;br /&gt;Despite</li>
            <li> Although I read it has worked for some, please be prepared that you may experience some negative affects.</li>
            <li> I just boil water and mix it slowly and then keep mixing it every 5 minutes for 30 minutes</li>
            <li> I was not very happy.</li>
            <li> What I did not expect was green hair which has never happened to me before!!</li>
            <li> It smelled so bad I had to open windows in my house</li>
            <li> The application wasn&#x27;t so bad since I used a hair coloring brush to apply the Henna which made it less messy.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible itchy rash develop within hours with redness, swelling and extreme itching, requiring a trip to my nurse practitioner prescribing topical medication along with Benadryl for days.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time.</li>
            <li> If anything it got worse.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I had an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not have the irritating scalp for chemical coloring.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about unnecessary chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> It smelled awful, but I left it on for 3 hours as per instructions.</li>
            <li> The instructions to mix are not all that complicated.  </li>
            <li> and I had a miserable day at work the next day...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is horrible once mixed with liquid.</li>
            <li> but I h8 the cutting process</li>
            <li> I have never had a bad reaction to hair color</li>
            <li> The smell from the product is really bad</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was deeply disappointed with the color turnout.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The henna is heavy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Made my hair smell terrible even three days</li>
            <li> I had a horrible headache from the weight.</li>
            <li> I cannot emphasize the horrible smell it leaves on the hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful, exactly as it says!! The only thing I did was get better plastic gloves :)</li>
            <li> I have used Henna King for several years but the last couple of purchases it seems the formula has changed as I am not getting the nice results I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Especially not covering the gray which was not an issue before. I haven&#x27;t changed how I use it or how long I have the henna on my hair so not sure what the issue is but the roots are a bit green each time now with very little coverage.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I dyed my hair from medium brown to &amp;#34;delicious dark brown&amp;#34; and it came out fantastic i&#x27;m very satisfied with the outcome! Since each box has 100 grams worth of henna I bought two boxes since my hair is pretty long (it reaches my hips) just something to keep in mind for those with longer hair!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to hair dye and am African American with short kinky hair. I developed the allergic only two years ago and thought I would never be able to color the gray. Henna is a fabulous alternative. You can leave it on for hours to achieve the precise color you want without fear of chemical burns. And an added bonus you can use to color your eyebrows! It is a hit!</li>
            <li> MY FIRST TIME USING HENNA AND IT WORKED SUPER!!!! I WOULD DO THIS AGAIN, ONLY DRAW BACK IS YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE HENNA IN YOUR HAIR FOR A LONG TIME. SO PLAN A LONG DAY FOR THIS BUT SO WORTH IT AND GENTEL ON YOUR HAIR!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Henna for years, as well as Logona products. I tried this product for the first time. What I did not expect was green hair which has never happened to me before!! I followed the instructions exactly, left it on for 2.5 hours and got green color!! Yuk! Will need to put on regular henna  tomorrow!  The product seems good quality but I did not like the color! Will need to experiment mixing it with other stuff (like henna) next time.</li>
            <li> It takes too long for color to set in. It did not color my greys as well as my other brand. I am going to try to leave it in longer next time, only left in for 1 1/2 hour thi time. Maybe if I leave it in for the total 3 hours it will do a better job, we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really healthy to use if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;as described&amp;#34; natural. beautiful colors. I liked the brown color. it keeps the hair to look as natural</li>
            <li> The color was nice, I mixed half dark brown and medium brown, but despite leaving it on for many hours it didn&#x27;t last for more than a month. I also added in essential oils and a little coconut oil for softness but it didn&#x27;t really make my hair softer as some others reported. It was a lot of work for very minimal staying power. As much as I don&#x27;t want to use chemicals, I think reapplying the henna often will damage my hair a lot more. I switched to Natural Tints and it&#x27;s been the best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used and my hair is still super soft after a month.</li>
            <li> The color was much darker that I thought it would be.i read that I could lighten the color by using honey, olive oil and lemon juice. After several days of using those items the color became lighter. I loved the feel of my hair after using henna. I will try a light color next time</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown, and has been chemically dyed many times... I really don&#x27;t stray too far from my natural color, just sometimes more golden or red tones when I&#x27;m in the mood for a change. I have not dyed my hair in several months, and was excited to try a henna product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit different to apply, but it turned out great. I am a mom to a toddler so once I decided to do this tonight u hadn&#x27;t realized how long you should leave it on. I didn&#x27;t have that kind of time and will have to plan for next time, so I only left it on 45 min. It covered my greys well though! And my hair is very soft and shiny so I am happy! I might try the wine red next time. I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell, but I am familiar to weird natural smells... The smell reminds me of kelp powder and even a little bit like matcha green tea powder. I much prefer this over the smell of chemicals! Will update if I try the other color.</li>
            <li> I left Henna on the hair for 24 hours, but the color stays only 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;Frequent use of Henna is required for the hair to stay colored.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep ordering this product</li>
            <li> Eliminates most of the red in natural henna</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m simply amazed at the results.  I was expecting to have to call my hair colorist in a panic to beg her to fit me in to undo the damage, but my first-time color attempt with this product turned out great!  I wanted to try this because I feel like my scalp is allergic to what they use in the salon, and I wanted to try something all natural.  It was easy to use.  My only complaint is I wish they had provided more gloves for future applications, as, with my short hair, I only needed to use a third of the powder.  My color came out even all over, got rid of the grays, and was simple to apply and rinse out.  Definitely use conditioner, though, to help rinse.  Five stars for this product, and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not for the faint of heart.  The green powder and the process may seem daunting at first, but it is well worth it!  I switched from chemical dyes about 6 months ago and have been thrilled with this product.  My scalp and hair are so much happier! First treatment I left on at least 2 hours while i went about my Saturday morning house work... now for touch ups an hour is usually enough to color the grey.  Sometimes reapply before I&#x27;m due for coloring just for the conditioning.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible as most henna hair dyes do.  The color processing didn&#x27;t even close to the color displayed and I have brown hair.  I followed the instructions. The smell also stays in your hair for weeks.  I had better results with other henna brands.</li>
            <li> First of all this product had very detailed and informative instructions.  It did take 2 applications to completely cover the gray hair.  However it did leave my hair shiny and soft.  Best of all,  no allergic reaction!!.  How long it lasts is yet to be seen, it has been a week and is still holding the color.  It worked pretty good on the eyebrows too, which seems to be very difficult to color.  You do need to make sure to use a very thick coating and make sure it is comepletely covered.  All in all very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought the dark brown color.  I have very light ash brown hair.  My hair is fine and gets damaged easily.  This was my first time trying Henna and i LOVE it!  I mixed it with coffee and used a 1/3 of the powder in the bag (I currently have a short hair cut).  It was a lil messy, but not too bad since my hair is short.  Wrapping your hair in plastic wrap is a must to keep the henna damp so it can color the hair.  I left it on 3 hrs and rinsed it out using conditioner only - no shampoo.  The color looks great and still going strong 3 wks later.  The smell was fine because the coffee odor was pretty overpowering.  My hair was soft straight away.  I am so happy to not be using chemicals anymore!  I will miss going blonde now and then, but this is just so much more healthy.  And the price is great too!  I am a henna convert.  :)  Next time I plan to let the mixture sit as other reviewers say to do.  Supposedly the color will be even stronger.</li>
            <li> I am very allergic to hair dye; this product worked and I suffered no allergic reaction. Be prepared for the multiple hours of having to have this product on your hair or moustache !!</li>
            <li> This product is a great way to color your hair without applying harsh, damaging chemicals to your head. My hair is so much healthier since I started using Henna color. I get complimented all the time about how healthy and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Used the henna the first day and it barely colored the gray hair. The strands turned into a light blonde which doesn&#x27;t work with my hair since I have dark brown hair!Then I used it the second day and the same results. I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li> Nice rich color. May need Decca d application for grey hair as stated in instructions. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years now,and it works great</li>
            <li> My wife reports: This product makes my hair feel great, shiny strong and the color is great.  I mix the dark brown &amp; the medium brown together, the only complaint I have is it doesn&#x27;t last too long, not even a month.</li>
            <li> I love the dark chicane it&#x27;s gorgeous!! The only thing I would advise is get your own plastic gloves that don&#x27;t slide around. The gloves they send you are too big and just get in the way. The smell is fine, and it&#x27;s easy and simple. I just got another one for later. I will update on the lasting of color. My original hair color was med. brown with a few bleached ends.</li>
            <li> I frankly did not know what I would think, but I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and i like the results.  I follow the directions on the package exactly, using 1/3 of a package and 1/3 tsp salt, as I have fine and relatively short hair.  It gives nice dark brown results and lasts much longer then a demi hair color.  It actually has thickened my hair slightly so I can use fewer styling products on it.  I think it builds up over time, so next time, I will not leave it on as long - I&#x27;ll try 1 1/2 hours instead of 3.  I have naturally medium dark brown hair with a few grays, and it enhances my hair color nicely.  The only drawback is that the color washes out of the grays faster, so I will have to touch up a bit.</li>
            <li> I ordered one pack of this to dye my long hair (not quite waist length but past the bust). I must have not read the description properly but one packet would not have been enough. According to the directions I was supposed to use about 2 - 2.5 packets of henna... but I managed with just one anyway! My hair had some blonde highlights so I focused more on those areas, but all my hair was coated with product. Instructions said to completely saturate, and I know I wasn&#x27;t very saturated but nevertheless, I loved the result! The areas of my hair which were blonde aren&#x27;t a dark dark brown, but they are brown. Think chocolate brown. I would advise ordering enough for your needs and mixing according to other reviewers&#x27; instructions (more watery consistency, add vinegar, leave on for hours etc) to get the best results. If you don&#x27;t mix essential oil to mask the plant smell, your hair will smell strongly of henna. So either add fragrance or use a highly scented shampoo and conditioner. I also find that henna can be a bit drying, so a deep conditioner is recommended after. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I had to leave it on for over 10 hours! It covered the gray however does not last to long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair as bad as chemicals, makes it full and silky smooth. Definitely gonna buy more in the future</li>
            <li> Good gift for my friend</li>
            <li> This henna hair color worked well but kept washing out every time I shampooed.  It was extremely messy to apply and there was grit in my hair for days.  The mixture probably needs to be reapplied every two or three weeks, especially for resistant gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;The one good thing about this product is that there is no chemical smell and it&#x27;s very safe to use!</li>
            <li> Much kinder to your hair than dye.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the first time because I am pregnant and was looking for an alternative to regular hair color.  The product arrived on time. I used it the same day I received it. First off I want to say that not every product works for everyone, however I was fairly confident that I wouldn&#x27;t have any issues. I read all the other reviews before choosing to buy this. I have never had a bad reaction to hair color and I have no allergies. My hair was already brown, I just wanted to cover my highlights. I mixed the powder as directed and put it on my hair. It smelled awful, but I left it on for 3 hours as per instructions. When I went to rinse it out I had a very hard time. Lots of black specks and it felt like I was washing dirt out of my hair. I had to wash it at least 3 times just for it to feel semi clean. I lost at least 2 handfuls of hair. I was not very happy. It did cover the majority of my highlights but not all of them. Now it has been 4 days. I am still losing hair. Not as much as originally but Im praying it stops. My hair looks thinner. I am very disappointed. I will NEVER use this product again. Nor will I recommend it. Like I said, not everything works for everyone, so use at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After about a week and a half my hair stopped falling out. The color lasted a total of about 3 weeks and I was back to square one. Went to Walmart and bought a box of Olia hair dye (ammonia free, oil based hair color). Worked great, my hair looks beautiful. Wish I just would have done that to begin with. 30 minutes total, smelled great, and my hair looks good. Also, no hair loss from using it.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for my roots. No matter if I leave it on for 2 or 3 hours, my roots never get the color. Totally disappointed. I bought so many packets and now I feel I am stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I must have put too much water in the mix because for the two hours I had this goop on my head, I had to use a whole role of tissues to mop up my face and neck from the frequent dripping of the dye. In order to get it out of my hair, I had to slather my head with conditioner and rinse twice. That did the trick. Three weeks later, the color and texture of my hair is still just as vibrant and soft as day one. The goop really does seem to have improved the quality of my hair. I&#x27;m never going back to commercial dye.</li>
            <li> The second time I used this it turned my grey hair Green !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Washed my hair with a clarifying shampoo, let it dry till slightly damp, mixed the henna with warm water and added a tiny bit of perfume oil, smeared it all over my hair, put the cap on and did gardening for 3 hours.  Rinsed it out after putting a generous amount of conditioner.  My hair looks fantastic.  All the grey hair turned gold and my natural dark brown hair is a richer brown.  So, here&#x27;s my suggestions:  1) buy a pair of surgical-type gloves.  Don&#x27;t use the gloves proved unless your hands are this size of a giant.  2) don&#x27;t use vinegar (the instructions specifically say not to use vinegar).  3) definitely put lots of conditioner on your hair when you go to rinse out the henna (absolutely no shampoo for 24 hours).  Maybe mine worked better than some of the reviews I read because I was out in the sunshine which definitely heated up the processing.  I&#x27;m going to do this once a month. It&#x27;s perfect for my need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always hated having light colored hair, but I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out, so I needed to change to something gentler so I could dye my hair again. This is perfect. I went from a light reddish/blond to a beautiful dark brown that is pretty close to the picture. This is not the first time I used Henna, but it is the first time that I used Henna Maiden, and I loved it. As long as you have the time and the inclination, this is the perfect alternative to color dyes. I have learned a few things, however. First, make sure you don&#x27;t add too much water. I did, and I spent hours dripping while I waited to rinse out. I&#x27;ve read that the consistency of ketchup is ideal, and that seems accurate from my experience. Next, and this is the most important thing I have learned, invest in one of the those dye applicator brushes that salons use to add color. I picked one up for like $2 from a beauty shop, and that made application so much easier. This doesn&#x27;t smell great, but neither do the chemicals. I found that after I washed it thoroughly with African Black Soap and some diluted Dr. Bronners the smell was pretty much gone completely, at least when dry. I will most certainly be using this again!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to try it and she said it worked very well at covering the few white hairs she has.  She said it was an excellent product! Lucky for me!!!  LOL</li>
            <li> I have used Henna Maiden for over a year now and am happy with the product. It always arrives fast and I like the deals of buy 3 and get 1 for free. Happy.</li>
            <li> I finally found something I could use!  I am severely allergic to PPD hair color...even those marketed as PPD free! This stuff is a lifesaver for someone graying early. I HIGHLY recommend it especially since there is no mixing required to get your desired color! All that is taken care of for you! Just a few drops of your favorite scented oil, and the smell is really reduced. Perfect!</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product &amp; I really needed a change from store bought coloring as it was damaging my hair, so much, that I had to get something different. I put light &amp; med brown together &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with it, and my hair really is in better shape than before with the henna. Have even got a few compliments on the color from others. Worked the way it says it should. 3 hours was a bit much to me but as long as I&#x27;m not working it was no problem.</li>
            <li> About my hair type and hair. I have brown wavy hair that has natural red undertones in it and it doesn&#x27;t take much to bring them out. It&#x27;s thin and normal thickness, I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair. I really like the Dark brown henna! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the wait time and the smell. But for now on I&#x27;ll treat it like a spa day, I also read you can add essential oils to make it smell better. I always cleaned my hair with a natural shampoo right before using. I use hot water only and slowly mix it to were it is like a paste, don&#x27;t want it to be dripping. I leave mine on for 4 hours, I tried for 5 but that was to long for my neck, when I do it again, I&#x27;ll try for a few hours and see how that works.  I had to use a very slippery conditioner, for me the tresemme split ends white bottle one worked great for getting almost all the mix out and provides the slip for my fine hair. I would then come in with a different conditioner to not make it as slippery so I could put it up right after it air dried. It would get a little darker the next few days and I would still smell it in my scalp when I would sweat like during a workout and when I itched my scalp I would find it under my nails. For root touch up, I found it was so much easier, less henna, less mess, less time washing it out. Very happy about that.  Why I&#x27;ll only use henna for now on. I really wanted to save some time so I boxed dyed in medium brown 3 times in a row 3 months or so in-between. I didn&#x27;t want to waste product so I colored my whole head all three times, plus the color faded super fast, like 1 to 2 weeks and it was turning red in the light or outside. The first time I did it, I felt a little tingling and burning, but nothing to bad. The second time I boxed dyed I started hurting a little on the top of my head but nothing I couldn&#x27;t take for 30 mins and when I washed it out, it was fine, I started losing a little more hair then normal. Then the last time I boxed dyed it hurt so bad, burning sensation on the top of my head it even hurt after washing it out and even into the next day, I lost so much hair and it caused so much breakage at the top of my head. Because of all the damage I caused for saving time. I had to cut my hair to get rid of most of the damage. My top layer is at ear level which is where it broke off at and the rest of my hair is at shoulder length which is where it stop being tangled. I wish I had more resistant hair, and a lot of it. So now I know that chemical dyes aren&#x27;t for me.  My experiments with henna hair dyes. For my hair. I tried Light, Medium, Dark, Black henna. The light brown henna was too red, the medium brown had just a hint of red, the dark brown henna no red, and black was no red. Mixes I tried for my hair. Light, medium- brown with red tints. Medium, Black-dark inside, red tints outside. Dark and black, my hair was black with dark brown tints. I think the tints are my white/gray hairs. When I was doing the colors I waited until I saw a good amount of regrowth at least 2 inches. After the first time I colored with light brown henna and not liking the red at all,I started doing mixes. It was really hard trying to figure out what mix I was using, so I played around with other mixes and did full head henna with the mixes and then I stopped doing that and started doing full head henna with one color.</li>
            <li> great with my hair. buy gloves from pharmacy to avoid getting it all over your wrists/hands. these gloves were too large for everyone in my family.</li>
            <li> I colored my hair a little over 3 weeks ago and just started getting some grays.  This is consistent with box and salon colors on my hair.  The best part is that my hair is still shiny.  I love how my grays were colored but slightly lighter than the rest of my hair so it looked like natural highlights.  My original plan was to switch to henna so that I could gradually transition to going gray.  I love this so much that I may not let myself go gray after all!  If this helps anyone else with stubborn gray -- I used tea made in distilled water mixed with a tbsp white vinegar and olive oil along with a few drops of lavender essential oil.  I left it on for 4 hours with the plastic cap and a turbie, before rinsing it out with conditioner.  That covered my gray completely.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product. In the past I had used Lush products which smelled bad and had to be on your hair for about 8 hours. So you can imagine how excited I would be to use something that would take a fraction of that time and require less work. With Lush you have to grate the blocks and it is very messy. This came in powder and you could mix it with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It smelled so bad I had to open windows in my house&lt;br /&gt;2) It turned my gray hairs green. Really GREEN&lt;br /&gt;3) Made my hair smell terrible even three days later.&lt;br /&gt;4) Getting it out of my hair was an experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions exactly. I did not wash my hair immediatly or do anything to it for almost 48 hours to see if the green would fade out. If anything it got worse. Please do not use this. I have since had to redye my hair with Clairol. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Love this company. Love the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve colored my hair for decades.  I just wish I&#x27;d found this product a long time ago.  It&#x27;s easy on me, the environment, and if I&#x27;m careful, leaves my hair looking and feeling great.  Highly recommended, but yes, it does have an earthy scent that stays on for a couple of days, but that&#x27;s trivial.  I add a little vinegar to the paste to help it cover the loads of grey.  Also, if I make the paste too stiff, I have issues with coverage.  I recommend stirring in warm water until it&#x27;s sorta like ketchup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome. First time user, I made a big mistake when I mixed mine up. Instead or using water, I used white distilled vinegar ! ( I mistaked it for distilled water, which I indended to use) I made a mixture of henna maiden dark brown, with a teaspoon of salt (recommended in the instructions) and about a cup of vinegar ( like I said, thought it was water, lol) applied the thick paste to my hair, section  by section, coating each small section of hair,starting with the hairline crown section, which had most of the gray. I twisted each coated section on top of my head, until all my hair was on top of my head. Then I secured the heap with a head band and the plastic cap. I put a toboggan over the plastic, and was good to go, I thought....I realized about an hour and a half into it, that I had in fact used straight vinegar to mix it with, and my head was slightly burning too. So I freaked out, and jumped in the shower to rinse it all out, also, I shampooed ( which you should not do, for a least 24 hours after coloring)&lt;br /&gt;Despite all my mistakes, and the short time (1 and 1/2 hours) that I allowed it to set, my hair turned out awesome,the greys were a golden brown, right after i rinsed and shampooed it out. but now turning darker ! I am so happy :)&lt;br /&gt;My 43 year old hair has only been color treated with Clairol natural instincts, one time ever. I swore I would never color my hair again, using chemicals. Maybe because my hair has not been chemically colored, is the reason the henna maiden took so well, in such a short amount of time. Also, I use low sulfate shampoo, and I condition my hair, once a week with coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with with henna maiden hair dye, If it turned out this good, with all the misteaks, imagine how good it could be if I do it right, next time!</li>
            <li> LOve this stuff.I had decided to quit using harmful products on my head and this was an answer from heaven in my mind.It may be a bit challenging to apply at first but really... not anymore difficult than the other kind.And what comfort knowing its&#x27; actually Good for your scalp.What a dream for a women thats&#x27; 40% gray and not wanting to be.The dark brown gave all the grays the prettiest carmel colored highlights...but not at all brassy.You have to leave it on for 2 hours so allow time for that.The smell did not bother me at all.It felt good on my scalp and my hair was So shiny and full feeling right afterwards.I will be using this from here on out thats&#x27; for sure.Never will I put harsh chemicals on my little head : ) To every woman out there that wants to go natural...you have to use this product for your grays and to give your hair a beautiful shine and color.Its&#x27; wonderful.</li>
            <li> My gray hair started turning orange within minutes of applying so I rinsed it out. To make matters worse, I had an allergic reaction to it. I am allergic to the indigo powder. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Henna. I was impressed, I didn&#x27;t get the best coverage for my gray but after reading reviews &amp; watching YouTube. I know what I need to do differently; saturate the roots more don&#x27;t use shampoo. I used milk and little water to mix together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give five  stars because of the condition of my scalp and hair. Usually after coloring my scalp is irritated because of seborrheic demerits. It has been four days &amp; no flakes or hair shedding. My hair is softer, shiny and bouncy. The color looks good on the other 14 inches of my hair so not bad. I will say before applying my hair was a dark reddish brown with lighter tips. So now it&#x27;s a dark brown with dark auburn. My roots are still black but not so noticeable. I will do again next month. I really like it and the smell resembles tea and spinach. It did not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 5/29/15 I order this again. I still like this. I like the Lush brand also but I h8 the cutting process w/ this I just add hot water &amp; stir. I&#x27;m so glad I start using Henna to color my hair. I&#x27;m not have the irritating scalp for chemical coloring. This sellers service is very prompt &amp; you&#x27;ll get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/30/16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using this &amp; loving it. Still working well for me. I believe th more u use henna the more your hair becomes healthier. The gray covers better.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. It is completely natural so I don&#x27;t have to worry about unnecessary chemicals.  My hair is so soft and shiny - never damaged.  The color is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> I just wanted to add to the other complaints to warn others who may want to try this. Although I read it has worked for some, please be prepared that you may experience some negative affects. I used and applied it as directed to cover gray hair. I left it on for the recommended time and when I washed it out, my gray hair was not colored at all. It was just as gray as before I applied it!&lt;br /&gt;My second concern is that this was the messiest henna product I have ever used! I rinsed my hair off for a very long time and yet all of this black dirt-type product remained in it. In some areas, there were clumps of it! There were these black pieces flaking out of my hair for several days, several shampoos later. It stained some of my clothing and home items. Typically other henna products have some color run-off onto pillowcases and towels for awhile, but this was way different. I had to switch back to my old brand and start all over again for this month&#x27;s color!</li>
            <li> Here are some things to note and suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a shade or two darker than you think you need.  I got &amp;#34;delicious dark brown&amp;#34; and it turned out a light to medium brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few days for the color to fully develop. Mine took three days. My roots where yellowish to start out and each time I looked in the mirror they where darker and darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like hay even after it is washed.  The smells gets lighter each day I only really smell it when I am at the gym sweating now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The henna is heavy!!!!!! I put it on in the morning, wrapped my head in plastic wrap from my kitchen and went about my day cleaning my house. I had a horrible headache from the weight. So I suggest just taking it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It colored my already color treated hair almost instantly but my roots took much longer.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to store or salon hair color products.  I was going gray and was so disheartened I could not color my hair.  I heard about Henna King natural vegan hair color.  I tried the dark brown hair color one pack and left it on for 2 hours, it covered the gray but not all. I forgot to add salt and should have left it on longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried my 2nd pack 1 month later and left it on 3 hours and I loved the color.  The henna made my hair thick with a vibrant color.  I will definitely use this product from now on and the best thing was no allergic reaction.  I added lavender oil to the mix to minimize the earthy smell.</li>
            <li> This product was more difficult for me to use than one other I had used in the past.  It wasn&#x27;t as easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> Update 4/28/13&lt;br /&gt;OK,  I think I am further along the Henna learning curve.  First off this product is junk.  Let me explain why.  I recently ordered Nupur Henna (available on Amazon) which is pure and comes from India.  The first difference I noticed was how it left a red stain on my fingers the moment I touched it after mixing it.  I had to wear gloves to apply this henna.  With the Henna Maiden there was no staining.  My grey hair also went only slightly red/orange instead of a deep red that Nuput Henna gives.  By the way, the way the Henna Maiden also tells you to go through some grand palaver of mixing the henna for 30 minutes - once every 5 minutes or some circus like that.  With Nupur you don&#x27;t need anything like this - you mix it and let it sit for several hours (I let mine sit for almost 8 hours but it left that red stain on my fingers the minute I mixed it in water not after the several hours mind you).  So, switch to Nupur, its better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this three times now.  One box will give you 3 times applicaton if you are male with average length/amount of hair.  Only grouse I have is, it took forever to be shipped to my home.  The instructions to mix are not all that complicated.  I just boil water and mix it slowly and then keep mixing it every 5 minutes for 30 minutes (yeah its a pain but better than suffering a swollen face and itching from PPD for a month!).  I leave it on overnight and wear a shower cap to bed.  My hair does not turn black but it turns a dark brown and over time it turns red as all pure hennas do.  I also noticed a nice side effect - I have dandruff and need to use Head and Shoulders atleast once a week to prevent scale formation - well, with this Henna the dandruf seems to have totally disappeared!  I also have taken to having a shower every day with a conditioner instead of a shampoo and I am now totally set.  I am going to order another supply of this product.  Thanks Henna King!</li>
            <li> Hair color is true to image.  I noticed that this dyes better on hair that has already been hennaed before.  It didn&#x27;t do the roots as well, but it still blends.  I would recommend leaving this on for 8-9 hours for best results.  See customer image.</li>
            <li> I enjoy no longer using chemicals in my hair...and the color is lovely and soft. There is an odor, but it goes away after the first shampoo. I highly recommend it for anyone that has the time (it does take an hour and a half) and wants to limit exposure to chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product and it was very effective at covering the persistent orange and red hairs left over from a previous application of henna. The delicious dark brown hair color did not dry my Afro textured hair and hid all of my stubborn white hair. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> The cap was too small to fit the whole head.  I didn&#x27;t use the whole packet.  If the instruction is on a piece of paper instead of the back of the packet, it would be better because the words are kind of small to read.  Instructions are clear and it worked for my first trial.  Although it didn&#x27;t cover all the grey I have, considering I never did this before, the result is satisfactory and I will continue to try.</li>
            <li> I applied this product according the written instructions. I was deeply disappointed with the color turnout. The product tinted my naturally brown hair green and my grey hair orange.  The smell (barnyard hay) it leaves in your hair afterward is nauseating and lingers on for several days.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Henna maiden for 2 years now , I love it , I get lots of compliments on my hair, the main thing I like is  its natural chemical free , it&#x27;s actually good for my hair .</li>
            <li> I used this product once and then ordered more, the 2nd time I used it (My Nurse Practitioner said I developed a sensitivity to it after using it the 1st time) I had a terrible itchy rash develop within hours with redness, swelling and extreme itching, requiring a trip to my nurse practitioner prescribing topical medication along with Benadryl for days. I woke up in the middle of the night with great discomfort and I had a miserable day at work the next day... all I wanted to do was scratch!! I googled &amp;#34;can you be allergic to Henna&amp;#34; and a myriad of sites came up. Henna King claimed I was the only one with an allergy. The smell from the product is really bad and I washed my hair 2 times a day for a week to get it out~~I could still smell it. Henna King refunded me for the unused products that I ended up returning at my own cost. They claimed I was the ONLY one out of several hundred thousand people who had used it that had a problem. Yes you can be allergic, despite it being &#x27;natural&#x27;. I do have a sensitivity to fabric softener so if you are the type of person who has &#x27;allergies&#x27; please beware. The color after 2 weeks turned brassy looking and I ended up going back to using Loreal Feria without a problem despite the warning from Henna King that I should never color my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate Henna King refunding me for the products I did NOT use, they did NOT refund me for the 2 packets that I did use and this is not an attack on their business just trying to be helpful in letting people know that you can have an allergy to it. I received a very unkind email from Henna King regarding this review.</li>
            <li> When i purchased this product it took a long time to get here not only did it take forever but it wasnt enough for my whole head like it explained there was in the details. The color did not turn brown it turned greenish. And i was not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> covered my grays fairly well. Will use again</li>
            <li> Am I the first person ever who used this product and got a severe reaction to it? It&#x27;s just very heard to believe... due to all the other positive reviews I wanted to give this Henna product a shot.&lt;br /&gt;First time using Henna. I followed the instructions very carefully. I used 200gms since I have long thick hair. I used black tea in my water mix instead of plain filtered water. Read this enhances the dark color. Used 2 TSP of lemon juice to hold the color. I used 1 TSP jojoba oil instead olive oil to help moisterize the hair and used 4 drops of lavender essential oil to help mask smell. Believe me when I say this was merely not enough.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is horrible once mixed with liquid. I mean very intense. The application wasn&#x27;t so bad since I used a hair coloring brush to apply the Henna which made it less messy. Once the hair was fully covered, I then wrapped it well w plastic serrane wrap. Then a plastic hair cover and 3rd a beannie hat to trap heat. Left it on for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Then washed hair off with just conditioner. Everything seemed fine. Hair was quite dark. Now keep in mind after the initially rinse it was advised to leave hair unwashed with shampoo for the first 48 hrs. I cannot emphasize the horrible smell it leaves on the hair. The next day I noticed a slight itch on my scalp and the horrilbe smell gave me a slight headache. 2nd day the itchiing increased and the smell is still there. By this point was dying to have my hair washed.  I almost literally tore at my scalp from itching it so hard while washing. After the wash, I basically had a scalp itch attack. This terrified me. I took Benadryl. It worked but it literally knocked me out. The itch finally stopped and I&#x27;m still recovering from the shock. I&#x27;ve emailed Henna King about my experience and awaiting to see what they have to say...&lt;br /&gt;4/23/13 Update on my Henna experience. Used this Henna for the 2nd time about 4 days later I got Red hives on both of my ears with severe itching and dryness. This has convinced me to STOP using this product.his has convinced me to STOP using this product.</li>
            <li> usually get Henna from local India grocery and worked great, but the grocery store closed out. So based on positive reviews here, we gave a try. what&#x27;s a mistake. followed directions closely and hope some white hairs will trun darker. To my surprise, the white are still white or maybe little grey, not brown, not darker. Never trust this product again</li>
            <li> I left in the product longer than the advised two hours and added additional vinegar as instructed to cover grays. The product did not work. I had performed a strand test to make sure I wasn&#x27;t allergic but it still made my head itch like crazy after using it. It&#x27;s been over a week and my head still itches. I did not like it at all. And for days after I smelled like a cross between dirt and green tea.</li>
