            <li>I enjoy them in all of my artwork.  </li>
            <li>The color changes upon adding top coat and makes your nails look like a hot</li>

            <li>Most of the flowers were either half-there or broken up completely.</li>
            <li>These flowers are cute but very hard to work with.</li>
            <li>I ordered these dried flowers and received a wheel full different color and shape rhinestones.</li>

            <li> Do not buy it...................................... flowers were everywhere and only received a few flowers that came out hole. The rest where all broken up. you can go to 101customnails channel to view a video I have posted to see how they came out. I open them and take them out on this video and if you watch you will see that this is not worth buying. Very disappointed. Will not buy from this buyer again......................................</li>

            <li> Very fragile. But they are beautiful and look great layered. And can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Their cute ive bought them before but Ebay &amp; these only come With w flowers each slot/: disappointed but cznt do nothing bout it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some wonderful dried flowers out there made for nail-art, and these are definitely NOT among them. Very cheap. Most of the flowers were either half-there or broken up completely. The color variety isn&#x27;t even remotely the same as pictured, nor are they as brightly colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied to the nail AS DIRECTED, they look awful. The color changes upon adding top coat and makes your nails look like a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend these at all.</li>
            <li> thanks again it work out really well thank again.</li>
            <li> Received them. Haven&#x27;t used them but love the way they look and feel.  So far very happy.</li>
            <li> Colors not as bright but they look very nice</li>
            <li> Have to apply multiple top coats to keep in place with a smooth  finish.</li>

            <li> Well :) they are very beautiful and cute :) 5 star here :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus : when you are taking them out of the box, be very careful they broken very easy :( and careful when moving the opening side of the box they get trapped in the middle of the compartments and get broken :(&lt;br /&gt;It was a pain trying to get the  flower sitting in the top of the nail, when applying the gel coat on them  :( placing the flower on the nail one side of the flower down and the other part of the flower went up :( results a lot of flowers bits in the nail to remove :(&lt;br /&gt;To much work :( but if you get the entire flower in the nail, they are very beautiful to see :) Good luck</li>
            <li> These flowers are cute but very hard to work with. They don&#x27;t sit on the nail right and break when you try to adjust them. I will not it these again nor will I recommend these. They&#x27;re cute but very frustrating to work with</li>
            <li> Very cheap product. Smears all over your nails and does not look good.</li>
            <li> I used these for my daughter who is a tween, in her manicure. They are a great accent. I also used these for my artwork and illustrations in adding the flowers to the hair of my illus. There are a lot of uses for these that go beyond just nail art. I enjoy them in all of my artwork.  I hope you found the review helpful.</li>
