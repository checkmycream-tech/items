    <ol>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>Best incense holder ever!!</li>
            <li>The best incense holder I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this incense burner.</li>
            <li>Great design!</li>
            <li>Fist of all these are the BEST burners.</li>
            <li>For sticks, try wedging the stick-end between two end rungs to angle it UP for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best ones have a metal lining in the bottom as well.</li>
            <li>The best ones have a metal lining in the bottom as well.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, the best burners.</li>
            <li>THE best!  ~JSV</li>
            <li>Works perfectly!  </li>
            <li>Perfect.  </li>
            <li>If I made this, it would be perfect in all respects</li>
            <li>Nice....one of the best</li>
            <li>You can tell it was made by hand, remarkable!</li>
            <li>Looks great.</li>
            <li>I was happy using the box that way.</li>
            <li>works great with Tibetan style incense.  </li>
            <li>I thought this box would be good at achieving that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to clean them.sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the best burners.</li>
            <li>i love this one, collects ashes and it&#x27;s a great design also.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing incense burner, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Nice design.</li>
            <li>But it is well made and captures the ashes nicely.</li>
            <li>I burn TONS of incense of every kind.</li>
            <li>this is the best type of incense holder you can really buy.</li>
            <li>It looks handmade, which is nice.</li>
            <li>What I got was astounding to me.</li>
            <li>But I do love the compact size, and incense ash falls nicely inside the box, the designs on the side are nice, and I would still probably buy it again since I was able to figure out how to keep the incense burning.  </li>
            <li>This is a good stick incense burner as the ashes fall inside the burner keeping the surrounding area clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about fitting it into a hole, it is very easy to place the incense stick in at a slant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this for many, many years.</li>
            <li>However, for Indian stick-style incense, which is my favorite, you can&#x27;t beat this burner for ease of use and cleanliness.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this incense burner.  </li>
            <li>This happens to be one of my favorite incense burner because it is unlike the others ones that you have to struggle to put the stick in the hole.  </li>
            <li>In the Boston/Cambridge area you can imagine Tibetan incense is also a lot easier to find in stores than most places.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure you get the MEASUREMENTS of the burner.</li>
            <li>If you have the space (and can find) the 14&amp;#34; burner you&#x27;ll find it the most versitile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m gonna buy one for my mom and girlfriend, they both love it too.</li>
            <li>Ok I got this burner for my Tibetan/Nepalese incense</li>
            <li>All the ash falls inside the box, I even burned a cone on it, I just set it on top of the 2 closest bars and it burned well</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t burn the wood as it fell on top of ash</li>
            <li>but it might not be safe to do</li>
            <li>but that is a lot better than getting ash all over the place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hands down, best burner I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Once they burn-out and get a bit scorched from use, they typically stop doing this, and work perfectly well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nepal &amp; Tibetan incense.</li>
            <li>And then having exceeded my original expectation</li>
            <li>to clean them.sometimes.</li>
            <li>super cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting such good construction for a burner under $10.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the tower style -- since the ashes collect at the bottom, it is inevitable that ashes will spill when the top is removed to add more incense.</li>
            <li>I use it with many different types of incense, i couldn&#x27;t have found a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really enjoying my new incense burner.</li>
            <li>Finally, I just ordered three more!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more natural smelling, and remind me of the woods and the outdoors.</li>
            <li>Nice and simple design.</li>
            <li>Whatever it is, it is slightly figured and quilted and is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Worth ten bucks, I suppose, but it looks more like a $3.99 product.</li>
            <li>Does not hold-up incense sticks very well at all &amp; is somewhat unstable, for its intended purpose!</li>
            <li>I just spent over $100 and 2 months trying to find an incense burner that I really liked for burning Indian-style sticks.</li>
            <li>To solve this, tuck the end of the stick under the first wire and burn the stick at an angle.</li>
            <li>First time using incense</li>
            <li>This is a pic of the one I use the most because it&#x27;s the larger (14 inch)</li>
            <li>This is a pic of the one I use the most because it&#x27;s the larger (14 inch)</li>
            <li>Japanese burned ok on it</li>
            <li>For those who think it will put off the incense stick - just see the product picture on how the stick is angled - and will ensure a full burn and no mess.</li>
            <li>I have tried the Japanese bowl -- it might be fine for shorter Japanese-style joss sticks, but the ash spill is unacceptable for Indian stick incense.</li>
            <li>thats all i really needed</li>
            <li>It also is made out of real wood, not that new-age material that everything is made out of now, I think its called plastic.</li>
            <li>and it works very well now</li>
            <li>As a professional exotic wood craftsman who does this as a living, I was simply amazed by this.    </li>
            <li>right from the start, i didn&#x27;t have any problems with sticks burning completely.</li>
            <li>There is no mess from the ash; it burns and falls right into the bottom of the burner.  </li>
            <li>Please appreciate it for what it is and forget for a moment that you live in the age of instant gratification and cheap prices.    </li>
            <li>main reason for choosing this design was that I did not want the ashes spilling all over.</li>
            <li>My stick doesn&#x27;t stand over it as high like in the pic.</li>
            <li>It works great, requires no sand, and leaves the area much less messy.  </li>
            <li>THIS HAPPENS WHEN THEY&#x27;RE NEW.</li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;rungs&amp;#34; collect ash when they&#x27;re new &amp; polished, so they tend to &amp;#34;wick&amp;#34; the heat away from the stick.</li>
            <li>The inlaid pattern is nice and subtle, and the burner is made from solid, real</li>
            <li>The 14&amp;#34; version is hard to find.it the most versitile.</li>
            <li>The main issue I have with this burner is that when the stick reaches one of the cross bars, it snuffs out; regardless of what incense I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The slightly crooked seams, the obvious file marks (rasp file of some sort), the slightly convex portions where knots are (and wood that is harder to sand) and many other things tell me that this was made by a man who had no access to band saws, belt sanders or surface planers.</li>
            <li>For newer burners, laying the stick at a slight angle helps a bit &amp; burns them in more evenly (instead of having just the center line burn-</li>
            <li>I have had no issues with it, the ashes fall right down into the box.</li>
            <li>I have tried the coffin style -- it is difficult sometimes to find the holes in dim light and the holes are either too big or too small to fit the sticks a large percentage of times.</li>
            <li>Ok so I know that this is not a good burner for Japanese or Tibetan incense.</li>
            <li>inlays are kind of cheesy.</li>
            <li>holds the incense sticks in place all the way through with no mess outside of the box.</li>
            <li>My fix is to insert the end of the stick UNDER the end cross bar so it rests across the TOP of the next one and this elevates the stick; then it burns fine, except that when the stick is done, the wood end falls inside the box and you can&#x27;t get it out merely with shaking it upside down.  </li>
            <li>The same holds true for the various 3 or 4\\&quot; dish-style burners -- such a mess!</li>

            <li> As you can see, the Tibetan style lays flat, as well as the larger &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; style sorig incense, and rope incense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Important for first-time users of these: You&#x27;ll notice reviewers metioning that laying Tibetan incense flat across the rungs results in the stick sometimes going out when it passes the metal.</li>
            <li> As long as the wood box doesn&#x27;t break, they last forever.</li>
            <li> In fact, the more uneven the rungs are, the quicker they seem to get broken</li>
            <li> , long stem BBQ lighter, etc.,</li>
            <li> For that reason I expected to limit myself to placing the sticks at an angle, reclined against the back of the box.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t empty it regularly it can hold quite a bit of ash.</li>
            <li> It was probably deeply scribed lines in the wood with hand made inlay strips that were tapped in with a hammer and later filed down flush.    </li>
            <li> I was looking for a burner that would also store the incense; however, based on the reviews of those types of holders, I was a little skeptical about spending more money for a product that I might not like.  </li>
            <li> I saw some other people&#x27;s reviews having problems with the incense going out when it hits the metal wire, but I had no such problems</li>
            <li> first try, it looks like this Tibetan burner is a big fail, but the reviewer who gave it a 4 rating had the solution.</li>
            <li> Will probably drill a little hole in the end to insert the tip of the wood which may resolve the issue of the wood end falling under the cross bars.</li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;You could even scuff the rungs and pre-scorch them (be careful) with a flame, hand torch</li>
            <li> I still love sick incense though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not positive, but the wood might be East indian rosewood.</li>
            <li> Yeah to echo other reviewers</li>
            <li> But perhaps my expectations had been adjusted downwards from other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why you would use any other holder other than for novelty or because you didn&#x27;t know this existed would be beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was looking for a burner that would also store the incense; however, based on the reviews of those types of holders, I was a little skeptical about spending more money for a product that I might not like.  This one serves me well.  I can store the incense somewhere else.  There is no mess from the ash; it burns and falls right into the bottom of the burner.  I would recommend this one if you&#x27;re not intent on having one in which you can store the incense.</li>
            <li> Does not hold-up incense sticks very well at all &amp; is somewhat unstable, for its intended purpose!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Well built. Nice design. Looks great. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this for many, many years.</li>
            <li> Best incense holder ever!! this is the only one I will ever use again.</li>
            <li> The main issue I have with this burner is that when the stick reaches one of the cross bars, it snuffs out; regardless of what incense I have tried.  My fix is to insert the end of the stick UNDER the end cross bar so it rests across the TOP of the next one and this elevates the stick; then it burns fine, except that when the stick is done, the wood end falls inside the box and you can&#x27;t get it out merely with shaking it upside down.  But I do love the compact size, and incense ash falls nicely inside the box, the designs on the side are nice, and I would still probably buy it again since I was able to figure out how to keep the incense burning.  Will probably drill a little hole in the end to insert the tip of the wood which may resolve the issue of the wood end falling under the cross bars.</li>
            <li> I just spent over $100 and 2 months trying to find an incense burner that I really liked for burning Indian-style sticks. I have tried the coffin style -- it is difficult sometimes to find the holes in dim light and the holes are either too big or too small to fit the sticks a large percentage of times. I have tried the tower style -- since the ashes collect at the bottom, it is inevitable that ashes will spill when the top is removed to add more incense. I have tried the Japanese bowl -- it might be fine for shorter Japanese-style joss sticks, but the ash spill is unacceptable for Indian stick incense. The same holds true for the various 3 or 4\\&quot; dish-style burners -- such a mess! I have tried the inverted burner -- these seem like the solution, because they catch all the ash, but the sticks burn too hard with excessive smoke when they are upside down, and the burner starts to stink in a short time. Finally, there is the boat burner, but this has the same problem as the coffin style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first try, it looks like this Tibetan burner is a big fail, but the reviewer who gave it a 4 rating had the solution. It is a fact -- if you lay the stick on the wires, the coal will go out. To solve this, tuck the end of the stick under the first wire and burn the stick at an angle. The reviewer found that the remaining stick fell inside the burner, but this has not been a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other solutions are needed for joss, cones, dhoop, spiral, etc. However, for Indian stick-style incense, which is my favorite, you can&#x27;t beat this burner for ease of use and cleanliness.</li>
            <li> The best incense holder I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> First time using incense and I&#x27;m really enjoying my new incense burner. My stick doesn&#x27;t stand over it as high like in the pic. But it is well made and captures the ashes nicely. I didn&#x27;t realize it has gold drawings of ying and yang  on the side.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this incense burner. I use it to burn the regular stick style incense and I like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about fitting it into a hole, it is very easy to place the incense stick in at a slant. I have had no issues with it, the ashes fall right down into the box. I highly recommend this one :)</li>
            <li> i love this one, collects ashes and it&#x27;s a great design also. right from the start, i didn&#x27;t have any problems with sticks burning completely. but i did what another reviewer suggested,  scuffing the rungs and pre-scorching them, i used my regular lighter for it, ran twice with a flame. Finally, I just ordered three more! one for my another room and two for presents )))</li>
            <li> 1. You don&#x27;t have to dump it every time.  Burn and burn and burn, and the ashes just collect in the box.  Cleanest burner I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Sturdy!  I was not expecting such good construction for a burner under $10.  The inlaid pattern is nice and subtle, and the burner is made from solid, real wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You can burn two incense at once!!  I did read the reviews, and I am using the &#x27;sick the stick through the bars to hold it up&#x27; method, instead of just laying it across the lattice.  Works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, best burner I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this incense burner.  I use several types of incense: stick, rope and powder.  I used to have a different burner for each type.  The common, flat stick-type burner was always very messy, and I needed sand for the rope type.  Now I have only two, one for powder, and this one.  It works great, requires no sand, and leaves the area much less messy.  Great design!</li>
            <li> This happens to be one of my favorite incense burner because it is unlike the others ones that you have to struggle to put the stick in the hole.  Simple and works for Tibetan incense too.</li>
            <li> Fist of all these are the BEST burners. I&#x27;ve used them for 20 years. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nepal &amp; Tibetan incense. They&#x27;re more natural smelling, and remind me of the woods and the outdoors. In the Boston/Cambridge area you can imagine Tibetan incense is also a lot easier to find in stores than most places.&lt;br /&gt;Tibetan incense doesn&#x27;t have the typical &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; so there&#x27;s less unnecessary wood burning. I still love sick incense though. If you burn (or want to try) rope incense, just lay &#x27;em down on the rungs of these burners as they also collect the ash. For sticks, try wedging the stick-end between two end rungs to angle it UP for the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Important for first-time users of these: You&#x27;ll notice reviewers metioning that laying Tibetan incense flat across the rungs results in the stick sometimes going out when it passes the metal. THIS HAPPENS WHEN THEY&#x27;RE NEW. These &amp;#34;rungs&amp;#34; collect ash when they&#x27;re new &amp; polished, so they tend to &amp;#34;wick&amp;#34; the heat away from the stick. Once they burn-out and get a bit scorched from use, they typically stop doing this, and work perfectly well. For newer burners, laying the stick at a slight angle helps a bit &amp; burns them in more evenly (instead of having just the center line burn-in.&lt;br /&gt;You could even scuff the rungs and pre-scorch them (be careful) with a flame, hand torch, long stem BBQ lighter, etc., but it&#x27;s not necessary if you&#x27;re patient about breaking them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ll last for years and years. As long as the wood box doesn&#x27;t break, they last forever. I burn TONS of incense of every kind. I usually have about 50 varieties at any time, and this burner works for virtually anything other than coals or cones. The rungs will typically seem all uneven. These are usually hand-made. In fact, the more uneven the rungs are, the quicker they seem to get broken-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get the MEASUREMENTS of the burner. They&#x27;re not all the same size/length. If you have the space (and can find) the 14&amp;#34; burner you&#x27;ll find it the most versitile. The best ones have a metal lining in the bottom as well. If any wood stick from stick incense fall through, you can always pull them through. The tiny wood stick will break before the metal rungs will EVER get damaged. Every so often I even rinse these in water after emptying. to clean them.sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the best burners. THE best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~JSV&lt;br /&gt;[Edited] I decided to add a photo. This is a pic of the one I use the most because it&#x27;s the larger (14 inch) and it holds anything. As you can see, the Tibetan style lays flat, as well as the larger &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; style sorig incense, and rope incense. The stick-style can just be wedged in the rungs. This one looks its age. It&#x27;s been used every day; for 20 years! It&#x27;s even been damaged and repaired. The 14&amp;#34; version is hard to find.it the most versitile.

            <li> Works as desired. For those who think it will put off the incense stick - just see the product picture on how the stick is angled - and will ensure a full burn and no mess.</li>
            <li> My friends from Kasmier(India) always used this for thir incense burner, along with a cup of Indian tea, or Kasmere tea.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing incense burner, I absolutely love it! You can tell it was made by hand, remarkable! I use it with many different types of incense, i couldn&#x27;t have found a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna buy one for my mom and girlfriend, they both love it too.</li>
            <li> Yeah to echo other reviewers this is the best type of incense holder you can really buy. When it burns through everything falls in the coffin and you only have to cleanup every like 30 burns.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!  holds the incense sticks in place all the way through with no mess outside of the box.</li>
            <li> super cheaply made. inlays are kind of cheesy. but it catches ash well. thats all i really needed</li>
            <li> It looks handmade, which is nice. It also is made out of real wood, not that new-age material that everything is made out of now, I think its called plastic.</li>
            <li> I give it 5* because it exceeded my expectations. But perhaps my expectations had been adjusted downwards from other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for choosing this design was that I did not want the ashes spilling all over. I thought this box would be good at achieving that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others complain that they could not put the sticks fully horizontal over the bars because sticks would not burn fully; thus have to be placed inclined. For that reason I expected to limit myself to placing the sticks at an angle, reclined against the back of the box. I was happy using the box that way. It did what it was supposed to do. But then I decided to give it a try at placing the sticks horizontally, and to my surprise they burned all the way to the end. And then having exceeded my original expectation, I give it 5*. Oh, and forgot to say, yes the ashes fall inside the box, just like I wanted.</li>
            <li> works great with Tibetan style incense.  I saw some other people&#x27;s reviews having problems with the incense going out when it hits the metal wire, but I had no such problems</li>
            <li> Works well, using with Tibetan and Bhutanese incense. Nice and simple design.</li>
            <li> Ok I got this burner for my Tibetan/Nepalese incense and I have tried different brands on it and the sticks turn off when the burning end hits one of the bars. Japanese burned ok on it some burned all the way some didn&#x27;t and turned off. Now the cross bars came slanted so the Japanese incense sometimes rolls to the side burning the wood on the wall of the burner. Ok so I know that this is not a good burner for Japanese or Tibetan incense. This is a good stick incense burner as the ashes fall inside the burner keeping the surrounding area clean. SO I was not going to return it as I only paid $4 for it, what I did was drill small holes at an angle on each side of the burner for my stick incense and it works very well now, the sticks are held in the hole and lay across the burner not touching the bars just a couple of mm elevated from the bars. All the ash falls inside the box, I even burned a cone on it, I just set it on top of the 2 closest bars and it burned well but at the end a small piece of burning cone fell inside the box it didn&#x27;t burn the wood as it fell on top of ash but it might not be safe to do so if left unattended. I hope my experience with this type of burner helps someone when purchasing this for a specific type of incense.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  No ashes outside the box</li>
            <li> Function &amp; price decided this purchase.    What I got was astounding to me. As a professional exotic wood craftsman who does this as a living, I was simply amazed by this.    The slightly crooked seams, the obvious file marks (rasp file of some sort), the slightly convex portions where knots are (and wood that is harder to sand) and many other things tell me that this was made by a man who had no access to band saws, belt sanders or surface planers. He also had no access to drum sanders, routers or drill presses. There is brass inlay that was completed without the use of a CNC machine. It was probably deeply scribed lines in the wood with hand made inlay strips that were tapped in with a hammer and later filed down flush.    I can see the little pencil marks made where the holes were drilled in the sides. I see they are not uniform and wonder if a hand crank drill was used.    I&#x27;m not positive, but the wood might be East indian rosewood. Whatever it is, it is slightly figured and quilted and is gorgeous. It&#x27;s very hard and probably damn hard to work. I have no idea what this craftsman was paid, but despite the price I paid I will treasure this piece of art.    If I made this, it would be perfect in all respects and I would also charge you $100 for it too. Please appreciate it for what it is and forget for a moment that you live in the age of instant gratification and cheap prices.    If the end falls off, please forgive him as the glue was probably home made too.</li>
            <li> Nice....one of the best</li>
            <li> If you burn any quantity of incense you want this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holders that suspend the incense midair on a pivot are retarded, the ash falls everywhere and you make unneeded mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this one the ash just falls into it and you dump it out. Why you would use any other holder other than for novelty or because you didn&#x27;t know this existed would be beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be handmade, some of the cross bars aren&#x27;t 100% even...but that is a lot better than getting ash all over the place. Even if you don&#x27;t empty it regularly it can hold quite a bit of ash.</li>
            <li> Poorly and hastily made. Wires are uneven. Worth ten bucks, I suppose, but it looks more like a $3.99 product.</li>
