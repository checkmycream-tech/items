            <li>Easy to charge up and use.</li>

            <li>I use this oral irrigator to clean between my lower permanent retainer and my teeth.</li>
            <li>The high-pressure is pretty good for the professional oral cleaning, the travel size, the  capacity of the water tank, the light weight and the help with sinus problems are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really good product, I especially like the nasal irrigator that replaces my netti pot.</li>
            <li>The flow rate is quite good and this is my only issue, there is no way to reduce the flow.</li>
            <li>The reservoir holds 300 ml; adequate for nasal irrigation.</li>

            <li>The orthodontic tip is much more comfortable for use on the back of my throat.</li>
            <li>There was no pressure worth talking about.  </li>
            <li>This product has no dial to get the right setting for pressure and EVERY piece of this thing falls off with the slightest touch/bump.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned waterpiks before that wouldn&#x27;t clean your teeth very well.  </li>
            <li>The description of this product - Professional Portable 2-in-1 Nasal Sinus &amp; Oral Irrigator Travel - is accurate up to a point.  </li>
            <li>The water pressure is impressive for such a small and portable irrigator.</li>
            <li>Seems counterintuitve at first, I know.</li>
            <li>My husband had a travel water pick and it stopped working, I took a chance on this one and it is exactly like the one he had.  </li>
            <li>great for traveling with because of the size, but not much good for anything else.  </li>
            <li>This product certainly did not do the job.  </li>
            <li>I returned it immediately with much sadness as I really liked my previous on.</li>
            <li>They were both pretty high pressure in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I like it so much that I use it all of the time, not just for travel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy New Year!</li>
            <li>This unit looks just and functions like an updated version of the one I owned for years, but it LEAKS, spewing water all over though the attachment aperture--the fit is too loose, although snapped in correctly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this waterpik.  </li>
            <li>me, I use the high pressure tip for cleaning between my retainer/teeth</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes to travel with a water pick</li>
            <li>A few weeks ago I decided to check Amazon once more</li>
            <li>This has a powerful pump, maybe a little too powerful.  </li>
            <li>If I am very congested I need a low flow or else too much pressure builds up.</li>
            <li>I could not tell much of a difference in pressure between the high and low pressure tips.</li>
            <li>this is a great product that i have been using in the past few weeks</li>
            <li>It comes with a tip for nasal use no less!  </li>
            <li>I found that the water pressure is too high for use on the back of my throat when using either the high pressure tip and the low pressure tip.</li>
            <li>The power of an electric water pic in a small package that is easy to assemble and comes apart to fit in a very small package.  </li>
            <li>I mean look at it, so compact in a nice little package perfect for small spaces or for traveling, bub, sadly</li>
            <li>It works very well and consolidates into a small travel bag which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Had one like this for a long time and bought this new one.</li>
            <li>No more powerful than swishing water in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>The oral irrigator is much easier to use than my neti pot, and without the mess.  </li>
            <li>It is small enough to travel with and powerful enough to do the job.  </li>

            <li> It exceeded our expectations by a long shot.  </li>

            <li> I fully charged it over night, it worked fine right after unplugged form the charger, but cranked terribly after 5, 6 hours.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s small enough that you can take it with you anywere.</li>

            <li> also damage the teeth very joteuna not switch on the handle a little uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s small compare to other products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use and just not very well made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am poor at using English as I am a Korean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After the third use as an oral irrigator this product is now broken.  </li>
            <li> Water container came off the base very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Battery won&#x27;t hold charge for very long.  </li>
            <li> I bought this irrigator for my duaghter.&lt;br /&gt;She needed a small irrigator as she stayed&lt;br /&gt;at</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is no power level setting on it.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say that there is a one year warranty on this product...too bad there was no warranty card included in the box which is required for returns.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Our battery operated travel water pic died and we needed to replace it.  This item looked like it would meet our needs so we ordered it.  It exceeded our expectations by a long shot.  The power of an electric water pic in a small package that is easy to assemble and comes apart to fit in a very small package.  Battery life is more than sufficient between charges.  If you want a portable power flosser, this cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> No more powerful than swishing water in your mouth.  I don&#x27;t think it could have removed a piece of parsley from my tooth</li>
            <li> great for the money works well,all good arrived on time,and in good shape,fast shipping,woeks as it should.</li>
            <li> this is a great product that i have been using in the past few weeks and i love it, I know  that flossing after every meal is a must and this makes it easy, it&#x27;s small compare to other products but this is what makes it great,  it&#x27;s small enough that you can take it with you anywere.</li>
            <li> Had one like this for a long time and bought this new one. Does what it suppose to do. Will be in our RV to&lt;br /&gt;keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> it does not work. I charged the battery as per the instructions and then took the battery and had it  checked. it was fully charged but the unit will not turn-on. it never has from day one.</li>
            <li> I had a Waterpik travel size and it got burned up when I plugged it in overseas.  This unit is compatible with 120v and 240v.  The price was also a bargain.</li>
            <li> This unit looks just and functions like an updated version of the one I owned for years, but it LEAKS, spewing water all over though the attachment aperture--the fit is too loose, although snapped in correctly. More dollars down the drain (literally) for MADE IN CHINA CRAP. By the time I get back to the states, it will be out of warranty and too costly to return from halfway around the globe. Bah.</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever bought, I highly recommend it. I use it for my sinus and it works wonderful. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product. It&#x27;s hard to use and just not very well made. I&#x27;ll still have to purchase water pick.</li>
            <li> used only as nasal irrigation, works nicely.</li>
            <li> Very helpful-super compact</li>
            <li> The high-pressure is pretty good for the professional oral cleaning, the travel size, the  capacity of the water tank, the light weight and the help with sinus problems are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Really good product, I especially like the nasal irrigator that replaces my netti pot. The compact size works well for me as I have limited counter space.</li>
            <li> Went through two of the newer type one piece waterpik after wearing out the original that was just like this one.    This new unit works great and uses a better battery than the nicd the old one had.  The new kind of waterpiks keep breaking.  This is a great upgrade from current waterpik units.</li>
            <li> Water container came off the base very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Battery won&#x27;t hold charge for very long.  I fully charged it over night, it worked fine right after unplugged form the charger, but cranked terribly after 5, 6 hours.</li>
            <li> This has a powerful pump, maybe a little too powerful.  Unfortunately there is no power level setting on it.  I tried another brand that didn&#x27;t have enough power so this is the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a waterpik for awhile.  This is compact, &amp; powerful!  It&#x27;s very portable for travel. It comes with a nice travel bag, it&#x27;s rechargeable, and awesome!  I&#x27;ve owned waterpiks before that wouldn&#x27;t clean your teeth very well.  This definitely does!  The oral irrigator is much easier to use than my neti pot, and without the mess.  I love the gum attachment, great for getting food out of pockets under the gums.  If you or your child has braces, the orthodontic attachment is very useful.  I highly recommend this waterpik.  It&#x27;s a great deal and high quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this irrigator for my duaghter.&lt;br /&gt;She needed a small irrigator as she stayed&lt;br /&gt;at her university dormitory. I am living in&lt;br /&gt;Korea so I wondered how it was for her.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has allery on her nose so she&lt;br /&gt;has been using it very usefully for her nose&lt;br /&gt;and her teeth.  Nowadays she is staying at home&lt;br /&gt;for her winter vacation.  Whenever I see the&lt;br /&gt;cute and useful irrigator at bathroom, I am&lt;br /&gt;so happy with my good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am poor at using English as I am a Korean.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to post the review but I hope&lt;br /&gt;my review is helpful to somebody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year!</li>
            <li> I use this oral irrigator to clean between my lower permanent retainer and my teeth. I also use it to rinse out my tonsil crypts periodically. It works very well and consolidates into a small travel bag which is very convenient. The water pressure is impressive for such a small and portable irrigator. I like how it already comes with a rechargeable battery and charger, so no need to purchase anything else for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also very well engineered. The &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button will engage with slight pressure and disengage when released. If you push with more pressure, the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button will click into place and remain on until you push it again. I found this convenient because you are not left struggling to turn the thing off (while water is spraying everywhere) when doing short bursts. You also have the option to leave it on (hands free) if needed. It comes with great directions on how to assemble the thing, but I am sort of a mechanically minded person and had no problem assembling the parts without reading the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I use the high pressure tip for cleaning between my retainer/teeth and I use the orthodontic tip for rinsing out my tonsils. Seems counterintuitve at first, I know. I found that the water pressure is too high for use on the back of my throat when using either the high pressure tip and the low pressure tip. Both seemed to be too strong for rinsing out my tonsils. The orthodontic tip is much more comfortable for use on the back of my throat. The high pressure tip works great for cleaning between the teeth as sort of a flosser as well. I think all the tips are designed well for their use, except for the low pressure tip in my personal case. I could not tell much of a difference in pressure between the high and low pressure tips. They were both pretty high pressure in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great product and I would recommend it to you.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small zipped bag, perfect for traveling. Easy to charge up and use. I tried all the dental attachments and they worked great. The nasal irrigator works as described. I did try it but I &#x27;ve always gotten a burning sensation from Neti pots and such so for me the dental uses are paramount. I really liked this product because I travel a lot and when at home it&#x27;s small size doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li> The description of this product - Professional Portable 2-in-1 Nasal Sinus &amp; Oral Irrigator Travel - is accurate up to a point.  It is portable and comes with a travel case and is an oral irrigator.  The directions that came with this product specifically say - not for use in the ears, eyes, nose or other sensitive areas...ummmmmm...I bought this to use for my sinuses.  It comes with a tip for nasal use no less!  The directions also say that you cannot use anything but water in the system...no oils, salt or mouthwash, again, ummmmmmmmmmm.  Amazon presents this item with an add-on for a nasal rinse additive.  DO NOT buy this if you are used to a quality product like a Water Pik brand flosser/irrigator.  This product has no dial to get the right setting for pressure and EVERY piece of this thing falls off with the slightest touch/bump.  The tank is tiny and does not lock into place...great for traveling with because of the size, but not much good for anything else.  I&#x27;ve used it, so I have to keep it, but I&#x27;ll be ordering a product from a reputable company to replace it.  ONLY buy this if you are going to travel with it and expect to treat it like a house of cards once you set it up...everything falls off of it when it is touched.  Oh and it also requires a 12 hour charging time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After the third use as an oral irrigator this product is now broken.  The water tank leaks all over the pumping unit and I have to hold the irrigator tip on with my thumb or it shoots out of the hose bib and sprays water everywhere.  The instructions say that there is a one year warranty on this product...too bad there was no warranty card included in the box which is required for returns.  This item is a P.O.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Returned product to Amazon for refund 04/09/13.</li>
            <li> These days I go to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Because you were using a toothbrush to go to the dentist before undergoing treatment itneude every week to an implant is used after it came out well not have food stuck between gums.&lt;br /&gt;I also damage the teeth very joteuna not switch on the handle a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as stated.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, I recommend it for daily hygiene of teeth. The best thing is that it is easy to carry and is ideal for taking on trips.</li>
            <li> I have had the identical product however the name on it has changed.  I can only assume that this line was sold to another company.  This product certainly did not do the job.  I was planning on traveling with it.  There was no pressure worth talking about.  I returned it immediately with much sadness as I really liked my previous on.</li>
            <li> You will like this. It is very powerful. My only dislike is that if you do not stretch out the cord, it will topple over.</li>
            <li> This unit is very compact and sleek looking; quite portable. The reservoir holds 300 ml; adequate for nasal irrigation. It runs off  a&lt;br /&gt;rechargeable internal battery. It comes with a rubber nasal tip  as well as some dental tips which I don&#x27;t use. The flow rate is quite good and this is my only issue, there is no way to reduce the flow. If I am very congested I need a low flow or else too much pressure builds up. I have communicated with the vendor and they are looking for possible mods to allow flow adjustment. Otherwise would give five stars.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the ease of use and superior design.  I have used it for travel because it is small enough to pack in bags.  I like the design feature that permits it to be navigated around the gums.  Strongly suggest this product.</li>
            <li> My husband had a travel water pick and it stopped working, I took a chance on this one and it is exactly like the one he had.  It is small enough to travel with and powerful enough to do the job.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes to travel with a water pick</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, I really wanted to like it.  I mean look at it, so compact in a nice little package perfect for small spaces or for traveling, bub, sadly I just couldn&#x27;t.  It leaked, water shot out everywhere and after about fifteen seconds and a good soaking it stopped working.  I dried myself of and tried again, carefully following the directions.  Same thing, I could have skipped my shower!  Love the concept but it needs some tweaking.        ***edited*** after receiving a replacement unit I had no problems with water leakage or power supply.  This item will be great for travel, compact and easy to store and put together.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using it on my next trip.</li>
            <li> About fourteen years ago I purchased a Waterpik travel system and used it well until about five years ago when I could no longer buy replacement parts for it because the company discontinued making it. I have searched and also asked my dentist to search his resources for another unit. Neither of us were successful. A few weeks ago I decided to check Amazon once more and there was the unit I have been looking for now being manufactured by US Advamced Healthcare.  This is one of the most useful systems I have ever used and I have tried many.  I like it so much that I use it all of the time, not just for travel.  Thank you. thank you.</li>
