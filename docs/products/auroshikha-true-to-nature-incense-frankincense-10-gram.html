            <li> I Don t6 Know Why I Thought this Scent Would Smeel Good. It Don t !! Light It Up in Some ones Elses Place &amp; Run Away !!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brand! They use real essential oils to make it, not fake &amp;#34;just smells like&amp;#34; stuff. Frankincense is great for keeping the ghostlies and negs away. I light it when sudden anger (or arguments) erupts in those around me and you&#x27;d be surprised how quickly the whole mood changes, it&#x27;s almost instantaneous! That&#x27;s one way you can tell if negs are around.</li>
            <li> Very old school traditional product in a totally good way.</li>
            <li> smells very strong. not as pleasant as i thought it was</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!! Leaves me no sinus problems, and smell lingers and is absolutely delicious! Makes my mouth water. Very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this incence at all. It smells nothing like frankincense. My wife made me put it out after only a few minutes. It smells like cheap convenience store bargain bin stuff used to cover up Pakistani armpit smell. The only reason I gave this a chance was because of the price. I had to throw the remainder in the garbage as my wife won&#x27;t let me burn any more in the house. If you like frankincense try Shoyiedo&#x27;s Incense Road which is the best frankincense i have ever smelled, but pricey.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent of this product.  I burn it along with Myhrr to cleanse my apartment about once a week.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance and this incense burn the average amount tie that I would expect.  Holds up good to time.</li>
            <li> Strange that I found this popular scent to be strong and smokey.  Do not prefer obvious incense smell that is too overwhelming to be relaxing.  Not the worst, but certainly not best for me.</li>
            <li> A little less smoke and a little more scent would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This incense is great. The sticks burn longer than any I have used in the past. It is not overpoweringly strong but has the frankincense aroma. I will order it again when I have used all that I received in this order. The price was also great.</li>
            <li> Apparently Frankincense is one of the hardest fragrance to reproduce.  That one IS frankincense!  I wish it lingered longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay. Next time I stick with my incense store so I can ask questions and smell the different types of incense and candles.</li>
            <li> I have previously bought this brand and liked the quality of the product.  This last order looked like cheap dime store incense. They was hardly any resin on the stick! Will not be buying Auroshikha brand incense again!</li>
            <li> Not a good quality insense.</li>
