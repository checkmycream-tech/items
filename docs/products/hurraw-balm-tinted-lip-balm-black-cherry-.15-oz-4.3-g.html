    <ol>
            <li>This product tastes so delicious.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and if you do lick your lips you wont mind</li>
            <li>ended up being a great buy.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>It smells good, looks good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my lip balm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering 3 more of these and giving it 5 stars instead of 4!  </li>
            <li>The light tint is build-able and looks great on any skin tone.</li>
            <li>I tried this in an organic store in Denmark and really liked it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture, a perfect rosy tint, and it&#x27;s all natural and vegan.  </li>
            <li>A very smooth &amp; nourishing lip balm.</li>
            <li>Its just okay.</li>
            <li>The texture was okay</li>
            <li>Over all, its not a horrible product, but I won&#x27;t be buying any again.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love this lip blam</li>
            <li>the tint is perfect for no or low makeup days and keeps my lips from drying out</li>
            <li>just the most fabulous lip treat!</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to see it on Amazon for Add-On with Prime.</li>
            <li>I could not recommend this product more, it&#x27;s the one I&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
            <li>those already with some tone to their lips may like this as a balm or easy out-the-door-to-the-grocery-store type of lip.</li>
            <li>Thanks and more power!</li>
            <li>Ok I end up having to put it on several times per day but it smells great and super smooth.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this to make my Free Shipping on another item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth without giving you sticky lips.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have super high hopes for this but had heard a lot of good things, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>it is one of the most moisturizing, tinted lip balms I have ever tried...and I have tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to do a little sugar/olive oil rub (just a tbsp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got an excellent safety rating on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep from it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Tastes good and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I really like the slim shape of the tube; it fits easily into my pocket.</li>
            <li>the shape, and most of all, the splendidly natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>And the tint is just right.</li>
            <li>she liked the moisturizing, light feel and slight hint of color.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a little pricey, it&#x27;s worth it to find a good vegan lip balm, especially one that has a nice subtle red tint to it-- not too bright or garish, but just enough color to make it look like you&#x27;re wearing a nice bit of lipstick!  </li>
            <li>Had higher hopes, gave away</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll always have one ready!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a total lip balm junkie and the fact that it&#x27;s natural and organic is so much better!</li>
            <li>This is truly a smooth hint of reddish over your lips, it looks very natural (only better than natural).  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes my lips which get really dry in the winter time. :)</li>
            <li>I wanted a tinted lip balm however this isn&#x27;t really tinted at all.</li>
            <li>my SIL really has no clue about makeup, what to buy or how to apply.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>and this is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Like when you get a soda from a fast food place &amp; you drink all the soda &amp; leave the ice to melt in the car all day &amp; take a sip of that, all you can taste is the plastic cup or straw.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>but they go on thick and bright as lip stick.  </li>
            <li>but what balm really does?</li>
            <li>They have a lot of other flavors there too :)</li>
            <li>One star off for the high price, one star off for not being very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I do like the way it feels just need to find the right flavor, so maybe I&#x27;ll try the coconut or vanilla next.</li>
            <li>And the price is right if you buy it from their website - they are $3.79 - $4.29 with a minimum order of 3 balms and shipping is only $2.95 at www.hurrawbalm.com.  </li>
            <li>of sugar, a drop of olive oil &amp; a little tiny dab of water, mix together) on your lips (to get rid of any dry skin) then use this product, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve got new soft and supple lips with a beautiful cherry</li>
            <li>The color is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>highly recommended for the sensitive skin&#x27;ed</li>
            <li>tint.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase the Black Cherry again and would love to try the plethora of flavors this brand offers.&lt;br /&gt;Samantha</li>
            <li>It also makes your lips so soft.</li>
            <li>It looks like natural beauty.</li>
            <li>Truthfully I don&#x27;t care about it being purely organic, but I suppose that&#x27;s a plus for our environment :)  Just one star off for how expensive it is for how small it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Due to the slim shape, this, a credit card, ID and some cash can fit into a tiny, slim clip wallet when I don&#x27;t want to carry a bag and don&#x27;t have pockets, so that and the color are the only reasons why I continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li>Keeps lips soft and never dry.</li>
            <li>This is all natural, plant-based and totally not harming ref blooded creatures including humans.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to really sink into the skin, so it&#x27;s not very moisturizing but it will do.</li>
            <li>found exact product at mall for $4.50.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s just an average tinted balm.</li>
            <li>Sorry, just my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>what I love even more is the organic, natural qualities of this lip balm and the moisturizing effects.&lt;br /&gt;Although, it is a little expensive for such a small lip balm (hence my 4/5 star rating)</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the black cherry &amp; was amazed at how much it did not smell or taste anything like cherries.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last extraordinarily long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it has lasted a really long time.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if the other &#x27;flavors&#x27; are the same.</li>
            <li> and  I&#x27;m definitely checking out other make-up and bath-and-body products.  </li>
            <li> This is really getting frustrating!</li>
            <li> I bought thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be a waste of $ based on all the positive reviews, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The tint is subtle, but on the red side.</li>
            <li> there was a little shine</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a little pricey, but it qualified for shipping</li>
            <li> The tinting part isn&#x27;t very dark at all and on darker lips you can&#x27;t tell you put anything on but a little gloss look.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or heavy.</li>
            <li> if you have pale lips</li>
            <li> I hate lipstick, but enjoy a little color on my lips!  </li>
            <li> I first tried the lime which didn&#x27;t taste as bad as the cherry, but it still didn&#x27;t agree with me</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure guys looking for a hint of color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually hard to find, a lot of them advertise that they have lip tint</li>
            <li> and I was tired of searching.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but 20x worse!</li>
            <li> The package is just awkward.</li>
            <li> The scent wasn&#x27;t too bad but it was artificial smelling.</li>
            <li> you may be disappointed in the color payoff and may need to try something heavier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wanted a tinted lip balm however this isn&#x27;t really tinted at all. I still recommend for lips as it is not drying at all. Will not order again.</li>
            <li> my SIL really has no clue about makeup, what to buy or how to apply.  I had this in my makeup hoard and needed to have a purge so I gave it to her.  she liked the moisturizing, light feel and slight hint of color.  if you have pale lips you may be disappointed in the color payoff and may need to try something heavier.  those already with some tone to their lips may like this as a balm or easy out-the-door-to-the-grocery-store type of lip. there was a little shine so I&#x27;m not sure guys looking for a hint of color would like this, unless going for that slightly-moist look. the balm also had a &#x27;yummy&#x27; scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm. I&#x27;m a total lip balm junkie and the fact that it&#x27;s natural and organic is so much better! I just recently stopped using things with toxins in it and this is very moisturizing. It smells good, looks good. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Ok I end up having to put it on several times per day but it smells great and super smooth. Doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or heavy. It&#x27;s like your lips just soak it up. I wonder if the other &#x27;flavors&#x27; are the same. The tinting part isn&#x27;t very dark at all and on darker lips you can&#x27;t tell you put anything on but a little gloss look.</li>
            <li> Tastes good and lasts a long time.  The hint of red is just enough to get some color without having that lipstick feeling.</li>
            <li> This is all natural, plant-based and totally not harming ref blooded creatures including humans.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with my lip balm and  I&#x27;m definitely checking out other make-up and bath-and-body products.  As a plus, even though they&#x27;re a third-party provider, they delivered promptly and everything was properly packed.  Thanks and more power!</li>
            <li> Its just okay. Would not recommend, not what I thought it was going to be. Very disappointed. Had higher hopes, gave away</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a little pricey, it&#x27;s worth it to find a good vegan lip balm, especially one that has a nice subtle red tint to it-- not too bright or garish, but just enough color to make it look like you&#x27;re wearing a nice bit of lipstick!  I ordered several of them so I can have one to spread out amongst my various purses and evening handbags so I&#x27;ll always have one ready!  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like the slim shape of the tube; it fits easily into my pocket. The color is nice and subtle. The balm itself is so-so; it&#x27;s one of those balms you will need to reapply often. It doesn&#x27;t seem to really sink into the skin, so it&#x27;s not very moisturizing but it will do. Due to the slim shape, this, a credit card, ID and some cash can fit into a tiny, slim clip wallet when I don&#x27;t want to carry a bag and don&#x27;t have pockets, so that and the color are the only reasons why I continue to buy this product. One star off for the high price, one star off for not being very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have super high hopes for this but had heard a lot of good things, so I decided to try it. The scent wasn&#x27;t too bad but it was artificial smelling. The texture was okay but I prefer Carmex or EOS. I like thicker type balms so that I can tell if my lips absorb it or not. The package is just awkward. Over all, its not a horrible product, but I won&#x27;t be buying any again.</li>
            <li> found exact product at mall for $4.50.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s just an average tinted balm. way over priced</li>
            <li> I had purchased this to make my Free Shipping on another item.&lt;br /&gt;It was a little pricey, but it qualified for shipping and I was tired of searching.&lt;br /&gt;This ended up being a great buy. Made in America, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;But what I love even more is the organic, natural qualities of this lip balm and the moisturizing effects.&lt;br /&gt;Although, it is a little expensive for such a small lip balm (hence my 4/5 star rating) it is one of the most moisturizing, tinted lip balms I have ever tried...and I have tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to do a little sugar/olive oil rub (just a tbsp. of sugar, a drop of olive oil &amp; a little tiny dab of water, mix together) on your lips (to get rid of any dry skin) then use this product, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve got new soft and supple lips with a beautiful cherry tint.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase the Black Cherry again and would love to try the plethora of flavors this brand offers.&lt;br /&gt;Samantha</li>
            <li> Taste yummy according to my son who&#x27;s 3. Moisturizes my lips which get really dry in the winter time. :)</li>
            <li> This product tastes so delicious. It is vegan and yummy. It also makes your lips so soft. And the tint is just right. It looks like natural beauty. I love it.</li>
            <li> love this lip blam the tint is perfect for no or low makeup days and keeps my lips from drying out</li>
            <li> just the most fabulous lip treat! the scent...the shape, and most of all, the splendidly natural ingredients! highly recommended for the sensitive skin&#x27;ed*****</li>
            <li> Smooth without giving you sticky lips. The light tint is build-able and looks great on any skin tone. Keeps lips soft and never dry.</li>
            <li> A very smooth &amp; nourishing lip balm. The tint is subtle, but on the red side. Smells awesome and if you do lick your lips you wont mind lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in this product! I bought thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be a waste of $ based on all the positive reviews, but I was wrong. Maybe there&#x27;s just something wrong with me, but I am having the hardest time finding a cruelty free product with a smell &amp; taste that I can tolerate! This is really getting frustrating! I first tried the lime which didn&#x27;t taste as bad as the cherry, but it still didn&#x27;t agree with me so I decided to try the black cherry &amp; was amazed at how much it did not smell or taste anything like cherries. All I can smell/taste is plastic. Like when you get a soda from a fast food place &amp; you drink all the soda &amp; leave the ice to melt in the car all day &amp; take a sip of that, all you can taste is the plastic cup or straw. It&#x27;s just like that but 20x worse! Sorry, just my honest opinion. I do like the way it feels just need to find the right flavor, so maybe I&#x27;ll try the coconut or vanilla next. Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> I really like this lip balm.  I was looking for something that would give me a hint of color.  It&#x27;s actually hard to find, a lot of them advertise that they have lip tint but they go on thick and bright as lip stick.  This is truly a smooth hint of reddish over your lips, it looks very natural (only better than natural).  Truthfully I don&#x27;t care about it being purely organic, but I suppose that&#x27;s a plus for our environment :)  Just one star off for how expensive it is for how small it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It&#x27;s May of 2015.  I&#x27;m ordering 3 more of these and giving it 5 stars instead of 4!  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it has lasted a really long time.  And the price is right if you buy it from their website - they are $3.79 - $4.29 with a minimum order of 3 balms and shipping is only $2.95 at www.hurrawbalm.com.  They have a lot of other flavors there too :)</li>
            <li> I tried this in an organic store in Denmark and really liked it. I was kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t buy it so I was pleased to see it on Amazon for Add-On with Prime. It&#x27;s tasty but not cloying flavor, with a sheer red tint. It doesn&#x27;t last extraordinarily long but what balm really does? It&#x27;s got an excellent safety rating on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep from it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is yummy! Just like cherries.</li>
            <li> This product has everything I want out of a lip balm.  It has a nice texture, a perfect rosy tint, and it&#x27;s all natural and vegan.  I hate lipstick, but enjoy a little color on my lips!  I could not recommend this product more, it&#x27;s the one I&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
