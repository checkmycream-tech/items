            <li>GOOD.</li>
            <li>kinda is like dirt to be honest it was good though absorbs into my skin without making me break out.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping which was great!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation, and I&#x27;m devastated that they are no longer making it!</li>
            <li>I have now bought this product more than once!</li>
            <li>It blends nicely and doesnt cake on.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I usually love Maybelline products</li>
            <li>Love the product, I like how the mineral foundation it blends With my skin.</li>
            <li>shipped really fast and the product is great though my face does look a bit ashy when i apply so</li>
            <li>Well, it was more than a year over the expiration date but as returning would cost more than the item, I then opened the package and checked out the powder makeup.  </li>
            <li>I love maybelline</li>
            <li>You can be that girl on the go now :) Deff recommend.</li>
            <li>It makes skin look healthy.</li>
            <li>The quality is very good for the price, and I love that it has the SPF just like Bare Minerals does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This give a nice matte finish with medium to full blendable coverage.</li>
            <li>but i liked the product overall great price and shipping</li>
            <li>I want more natural one but the quality is good.</li>
            <li>It looks nice at first, but doesn&#x27;t stay well and ends up just making me look shiny by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>IT KEEPS THE  SKIN OIL FREE ALLL DAY.  </li>
            <li>Applied to clean skin, I was indeed darker than indicated and instead of going on smoothly and evenly ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to put on, also.</li>
            <li>I personally love this line, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, my skin can breathe, and i love waking up and simply dusting my face instead of matting liquid foundation on my face.</li>
            <li>Really surprised since I typically love Maybelline products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like... tanning booth or fresh off the beach tan.</li>
            <li>However, if I were doing something special like going out or taking photos, I would use a higher quality brand like Bare Minerals because the color and covergae is better.</li>
            <li>Would be too dark if you are fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I took that out, but other wise the make up provides great light weight and long lasting cover (if used with a primer, which I highly suggest when using a powder foundation).</li>
            <li>This is my first trying this powder foundation</li>
            <li>The texture and coverage are not as nice as other mineral powder foundations I have used.  </li>
            <li>I received the product fast and the color looked pretty much just like the color in the photo.</li>
            <li>looks super natural and gives me an even tan tone.</li>
            <li>research your seller and never throw away packaging until you are certain you will keep it</li>
            <li>I mix mineral makeup with loose powder to save money and get better coverage.</li>
            <li>Goes on fresh with a moisturizer put before hand, i was surprised at how much coverage it gave me.</li>
            <li>(It also pairs really well with L&#x27;Oreal TrueMatch Concealer for tougher</li>
            <li>This makes getting ready a breeze.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I love this makeup, It will be all i use from here on out, I have dry skin, normally powder kinda of just cakes to my face</li>
            <li>Cover Girl works almost as good as the more expensive mineral makeups and lasts just as long</li>
            <li>Product was just as described, brand new in box just like was stated.</li>
            <li>However, this product I recieved was used and claimed to be new.</li>
            <li>the first day - my skin is already clearing back up.</li>
            <li>Looks like you had a slight tanning in the sun actually :)</li>
            <li>It Makes skin look clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried TONS of foundations, some costing me upwards of 50-60 bucks and nothing beats this stuff for acne-prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It adds a natural tan to skin</li>
            <li>I switched to this after I found \\&quot;Bare Minerals,\\&quot; because it works just as well for 1/3 the price!</li>
            <li>The problem with Bare Minerals is that it comes in this tiny jar that wouldn&#x27;t last you a week with normal use.</li>
            <li>Before I even opened this item, the packaging was so old, discolored and mutilated that I checked the expiration date to see when it had last been retrieved by the seller from some pharmacies trash.  </li>
            <li>it went on streaky and blotchy (caking thickly on certain areas and not adhering or covering at all in other places).  </li>
            <li>The seller went as far as gluing the packaging back down to make it look new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if It was actually filled with some other makeup or if having another persons oils mixed in did that.</li>

            <li> This makeup is what I switched to after I was having trouble shelling out the $25 for the Bare Minerals makeup.  </li>
            <li> Visually, the sand color looked very dark and orangey ...</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and had minimal issues.</li>
            <li> You could replace the brush for something softer since it is alittle rough but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the small brush that came with it, and the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the plastic filter apparatus that came inside.</li>
            <li> Expected it to be a little lighter in color(sandy beige)</li>
            <li> When I saw the package I thought it was going to be way too dark for my skin</li>
            <li> Not too dark for medium tan skin - to lighter tan faces.</li>
            <li> Literally the only complaint I could think of is that the powder can be messy while applying.</li>
            <li> This makeup also had an odd texture on my skin.</li>
            <li> this is very dark color</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m confused whether the age and obvious poor storage of this makeup compromised</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly disappointed because I did have to go to the store and buy another seeing as I dumped the packaging, trusting it completely because it is a product and color</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to be applying it ridiculously for it to every look cakey or orange-y.</li>
            <li> but it seriously reminded me of dirt.</li>
            <li> Wrong color.</li>
            <li> but I am not impressed with their Mineral Powder.  </li>
            <li> nothing wrong with that.</li>
            <li> OR it just genuinely stinks!</li>
            <li> After I realized it was discontinued, I ended up trying a Clinique liquid foundation and it broke me out TERRIBLY.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product was just as described, brand new in box just like was stated. Very fast shipping which was great! I was in need of the product.</li>
            <li> This is my first trying this powder foundation and I love it. It gives me the matte finish. Very happy. :)</li>
            <li> Wrong color. Oh well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation, and I&#x27;m devastated that they are no longer making it! I switched to this after I found \\&quot;Bare Minerals,\\&quot; because it works just as well for 1/3 the price! Hopefully they will revive the product at some point.</li>
            <li> Expected it to be a little lighter in color(sandy beige) but i liked the product overall great price and shipping</li>
            <li> When I saw the package I thought it was going to be way too dark for my skin but it was actually perfect. It blends nicely and doesnt cake on. I have now bought this product more than once!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years and it&#x27;s the only thing that works for me. After I realized it was discontinued, I ended up trying a Clinique liquid foundation and it broke me out TERRIBLY. I, once again, slapped myself for straying away from this stuff. I bought some online and -after the first day - my skin is already clearing back up. This covers up my breakout and post-breakout marks well. (It also pairs really well with L&#x27;Oreal TrueMatch Concealer for tougher breakouts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral powder foundation is the only way I can go, but I find that others have a glittery, pearly look. It looks nice at first, but doesn&#x27;t stay well and ends up just making me look shiny by the end of the day. This give a nice matte finish with medium to full blendable coverage. You&#x27;d have to be applying it ridiculously for it to every look cakey or orange-y. It&#x27;s quick and easy to put on, also. Literally the only complaint I could think of is that the powder can be messy while applying. So sometimes it gets on my jeans. I think I can deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried TONS of foundations, some costing me upwards of 50-60 bucks and nothing beats this stuff for acne-prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I usually love Maybelline products but I am not impressed with their Mineral Powder.  The texture and coverage are not as nice as other mineral powder foundations I have used.  Really surprised since I typically love Maybelline products.</li>
            <li> I think it;s the best skin flavor for me and thank you for continually to have it in stock!!! Blessings!</li>
            <li> Love the product, I like how the mineral foundation it blends With my skin. It ashamed That no store carried this color or product anymore.</li>
            <li> this face powder is long lasting and covers well.</li>
            <li> This is a great every day make-up, I have been using it for years and would never buy another bottle of make-up in my life. However, if I were doing something special like going out or taking photos, I would use a higher quality brand like Bare Minerals because the color and covergae is better. The problem with Bare Minerals is that it comes in this tiny jar that wouldn&#x27;t last you a week with normal use.</li>
            <li> PERFECT SHADE FOR MY FRIEND, GAVE IT TO HER FOR A GIFT.&lt;br /&gt;PURCHASED AS AN ADD ON ITEM, TO QUALIFY FOR NEXT DAY SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I received the product fast and the color looked pretty much just like the color in the photo. I mix mineral makeup with loose powder to save money and get better coverage. Cover Girl works almost as good as the more expensive mineral makeups and lasts just as long so why spend the extra money for a name?</li>
            <li> i cannot find this product in stores anymore. ive used it on my face for years now. cant beat the price. never looks like i have a ton of caked on makeup on. looks super natural and gives me an even tan tone. i have an olive skin color and this provides excellent coverage on my face!</li>
            <li> shipped really fast and the product is great though my face does look a bit ashy when i apply so i suggest putting a bottom moisturize on the face before use.</li>
            <li> Before I even opened this item, the packaging was so old, discolored and mutilated that I checked the expiration date to see when it had last been retrieved by the seller from some pharmacies trash.  Well, it was more than a year over the expiration date but as returning would cost more than the item, I then opened the package and checked out the powder makeup.  Visually, the sand color looked very dark and orangey ... but you never know.  Applied to clean skin, I was indeed darker than indicated and instead of going on smoothly and evenly ... it went on streaky and blotchy (caking thickly on certain areas and not adhering or covering at all in other places).  Now I&#x27;m confused whether the age and obvious poor storage of this makeup compromised it&#x27;s quality OR it just genuinely stinks!</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of this product and have ordered multiple sets of this from sellers on Amazon. However, this product I recieved was used and claimed to be new. The seller went as far as gluing the packaging back down to make it look new. This was also a color I used regularly and it was not even close to the same. The safety seal inside the jar was removed and the makeup was everywhere. This color was orange. Like a rust orange, and last time I checked, sandy beige is not rust orange. This makeup also had an odd texture on my skin. I&#x27;m not sure if It was actually filled with some other makeup or if having another persons oils mixed in did that. I am thoroughly disappointed because I did have to go to the store and buy another seeing as I dumped the packaging, trusting it completely because it is a product and color I use daily. I have ordered this before and had minimal issues. Advice: research your seller and never throw away packaging until you are certain you will keep it</li>
            <li> this is very dark color I couldn&#x27;t use this. I want more natural one but the quality is good. I love maybelline</li>
            <li> This makeup is what I switched to after I was having trouble shelling out the $25 for the Bare Minerals makeup.  The quality is very good for the price, and I love that it has the SPF just like Bare Minerals does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect color for someone with medium/tan skin.  Would be too dark if you are fair skinned.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this product and its also awesome that it doesn&#x27;t turn my face orange making me look like an oompa loompa :) I don&#x27;t use the small brush that came with it, and the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the plastic filter apparatus that came inside. I took that out, but other wise the make up provides great light weight and long lasting cover (if used with a primer, which I highly suggest when using a powder foundation).</li>
            <li> WOKS  GOOD. I  ALSO ADD  BAKING SODA TO THE  MIX. IT KEEPS THE  SKIN OIL FREE ALLL DAY.  GREAT  PRODUCT</li>
            <li> kinda is like dirt to be honest it was good though absorbs into my skin without making me break out. It workd for what i got it for but it seriously reminded me of dirt.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Goes on fresh with a moisturizer put before hand, i was surprised at how much coverage it gave me. Not too dark for medium tan skin - to lighter tan faces. Looks like you had a slight tanning in the sun actually :) nothing wrong with that. You could replace the brush for something softer since it is alittle rough but gets the job done. I personally love this line, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, my skin can breathe, and i love waking up and simply dusting my face instead of matting liquid foundation on my face. This makes getting ready a breeze. You can be that girl on the go now :) Deff recommend.</li>
            <li> I like Maybelline ..it&#x27;s for the budget shoppers who still want quality.</li>
            <li> Applies well, blends well, and doesn&#x27;t cause acne, but holy hell is this stuff dark!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Korean with a medium tan, and this is still several shades darker than I am. It&#x27;s like... tanning booth or fresh off the beach tan. &gt;&lt;</li>
            <li> could not find the proper color on the local shelves anymore. picked up enough here to last a WHILE. thanks</li>
            <li> I love this makeup, It will be all i use from here on out, I have dry skin, normally powder kinda of just cakes to my face but this didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Use it to cover up blemishes and birthmarks.  It Makes skin look clear. It makes skin look healthy. It adds a natural tan to skin</li>
