            <li>Great price with fast shipping</li>
            <li>this iron is perfect for the shortest hair along the back of my head.it is easy to handle the hair either to curl it or straighten.  </li>
            <li>Very useful and perfect for very short hair.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is great, exactly what I wanted and works great</li>
            <li>Easily can take this in your purse.</li>
            <li>I could use it just for travel, but it&#x27;s so easy and light that I use it every day.  </li>
            <li>this straightner is great for bangs and short hair.</li>
            <li>have short hair, so it works great for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap...</li>
            <li>So if its plugged up its on whether the switch is on or off and the light does not come on at all to signify that it is on or off.</li>
            <li>But it was cheap and it serves its function.</li>
            <li>There were a little chip on the top of one of the plates which I wasn&#x27;t happy about.</li>
            <li>I love this little mini iron, the shipping was on time as promised packageing was great</li>
            <li>I got it quickly, but when I turned it on , it didn&#x27;t even straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up well and would be nice for bangs or really short hair.</li>
            <li>The first heated up nicely but this new one not so much.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked it more if both plates touched when you close them together, only the top part of the irons com in contact with each other.</li>
            <li>I love this tiny Detailler, and it cools quickly for quick packing.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty irritated that it fried so quickly.</li>
            <li>It is about the size of one my small/skinny hairbrushes, which is the right size I wanted.</li>
            <li>This thing has two settings, HOT and SUPER HOT.</li>
            <li>Later it was still very soft temperature wise.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to manipulate than the full size Chi and works just as well.</li>
            <li>My hair was unruly and now I&#x27;m trying to grow it back out, and the middle length is what this mini styling iron is great for.</li>
            <li>It got super hot, and really did what I needed it to do-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously HOT.</li>
            <li>They do get really hot though.  </li>
            <li>It was great while it lasted, but it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as it should have.  </li>
            <li>Cant use it, because the outer part gets hot.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as described.</li>
            <li>It does work and it gets hot and straightens my hair but</li>
            <li>This might be good if you were just taking it with you for touch ups or have really short short hair.</li>
            <li>just wear the mitt they provide because the whole thing gets really hot</li>
            <li>its work good but too small than what I see in the picture</li>
            <li>Works fine, just a whole lot smaller than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fairly fast and very convenient.</li>
            <li>Perfect, small, definitely gets hot enough for women of color hair.</li>
            <li>They stay straight from morning til bedtime, which amazes me.</li>
            <li>I received the item fast.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing, and even though I won&#x27;t need it for long, I am extremely glad I invested in it for my grow-out period.</li>
            <li>I now use the mini iron almost exclusively and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, I guess works ok, it just takes a little longer in the bathroom then the reg. size straighteners.</li>
            <li>Should have send it back, but wasn&#x27;t worth, the return postage.</li>
            <li>I bought a new one because it worked so flippin</li>
            <li>It becomes extremely hot and there are not enough room to hold it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and one time I actually singed some of my hair, so don&#x27;t linger for too long with the iron in any one section.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you have a big wad of hair to do at a time, but it was not good for my bangs.</li>
            <li>This product works really well on short hair styles.</li>
            <li>I used to have medium length hair and only really used it to get the hair around my ears and my temples.</li>
            <li>Be warned it gets VERY hot, so be careful!</li>
            <li>If you have short to medium hair this is really all you need for styling.</li>
            <li>However, 3 months later, it does not get nearly as hot, no matter how long I let it heat up.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous little flat iron.  </li>
            <li>it can burn both your hand and your hair if you are not very careful.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t open it for several months but since I have opened, the new one only closes at the tip.  </li>
            <li>It gets close for long bangs or stray hairs near the scalp.</li>
            <li>My other flat iron gets as hot as 450, this one only 250.</li>
            <li>It got extremely hot but then died after a few uses.</li>
            <li>It gets just as hot as my full-sized flat iron, but it&#x27;s small enough to actually straighten the hair that is between 1 and 4 inches long without completely frying it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Otherwise I would just buy a regular one inch flat iron</li>
            <li> the only complaint i have is that it gets so hot</li>
            <li> Cord seems long for a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; iron, but I still would take this on a daily basis, not just when I travel.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any of the issues with burning my hand like others have, but I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron for years, so</li>
            <li> I have thin, gray, wavy hair, and just one pass across leaves my bangs soft and totally straight.</li>
            <li> The  plates don&#x27;t get close enough to each other without me having to squeeze the heck out of it which, then pulls my hair.</li>
            <li> I got to to have a work (I walk or bike mostly) and have only used it once or twice because it burned my hair. :(</li>
            <li> It broke after a few uses and only one side was working.</li>
            <li> However I was disappointed by the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really get hot and when straightening my hair get kinda stuck</li>
            <li> The plates don&#x27;t get close enough for small amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> and I find it hard to believe that they are the same.  </li>
            <li> They are very small which I like, they are no bigger then my hand.</li>
            <li> This thing died in less than a month.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s just sitting in a mess of cord in my desk drawer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this little iron to straighten my bangs.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, textured/curly hair, and recently got an ill-advised pixie cut.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have had one of these for years, I purchased another so if the first one went bad I would have a replacement at the moment.  </li>
            <li> And just too small.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item for my son to use and didn&#x27;t realize how small it was going to be, I know it says mini</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but almost too small.</li>
            <li> Too hard to use it with all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Want to have one that works but afraid to order again for fear of it being the same and having to return.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very small</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m annoyed with how curly it gets sometimes</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that this flatiron is quite inefficient.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the replacement.  </li>

            <li> This is the best for short hair!</li>
            <li> Im a guy and I&#x27;ve been experimenting, I have reasonably short hair but I&#x27;m annoyed with how curly it gets sometimes so i resolved to straightening it. When I received this straightener it was a lot smaller than I excepted, which I thought was perfect considering my hair length. However I was disappointed by the fact that it doesn&#x27;t really get hot and when straightening my hair get kinda stuck and it hurt because its pulling some hairs out. Convenience factor is great, heat not so much.</li>
            <li> This thing has two settings, HOT and SUPER HOT. I got to to have a work (I walk or bike mostly) and have only used it once or twice because it burned my hair. :( Now it&#x27;s just sitting in a mess of cord in my desk drawer. I&#x27;m scared of it. It&#x27;s seriously HOT.</li>
            <li> I am an african american and i have a short haircut. this iron is perfect for the shortest hair along the back of my head.it is easy to handle the hair either to curl it or straighten.  the only complaint i have is that it gets so hot it can burn both your hand and your hair if you are not very careful.</li>
            <li> I tried this mini iron at my hairdresser&#x27;s and fell in love with it. It is much easier to manipulate than the full size Chi and works just as well. I checked my local beauty supply place and similar irons were over $50. I now use the mini iron almost exclusively and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it more if both plates touched when you close them together, only the top part of the irons com in contact with each other. They are very small which I like, they are no bigger then my hand. They do get really hot though.  There were a little chip on the top of one of the plates which I wasn&#x27;t happy about. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  I had this for 2 months when it totally burned out.  DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> When I first received this straightener, I loved it!  It got super hot, and really did what I needed it to do- make my bangs look good.  However, 3 months later, it does not get nearly as hot, no matter how long I let it heat up.  It was great while it lasted, but it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as it should have.  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This product works really well on short hair styles. The only thing that I had to adjust to was the fact that I can only touch the handle of the device while styling  my hair which was a change from my 1 inch Chi.</li>
            <li> This iron was a great purchase! It gets close for long bangs or stray hairs near the scalp. Easily can take this in your purse. Cord seems long for a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; iron, but I still would take this on a daily basis, not just when I travel.</li>
            <li> Cant use it, because the outer part gets hot.  And just too small.  Should have send it back, but wasn&#x27;t worth, the return postage.</li>
            <li> this straightner is great for bangs and short hair. you can get close to your scalp without burning yourself. just wear the mitt they provide because the whole thing gets really hot and it&#x27;s so tiny that there isn&#x27;t any spot left to touch.</li>
            <li> It is about the size of one my small/skinny hairbrushes, which is the right size I wanted. It heats up fairly fast and very convenient. I would purchase it again for the value.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this iron, perfect for traveling and bangs!!! My roommate uses one and also loves it! Thanks Amazon for carrying!</li>
            <li> Perfect, small, definitely gets hot enough for women of color hair.</li>
            <li> It broke after a few uses and only one side was working. It got extremely hot but then died after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that this flatiron is quite inefficient.  This is the second one I have owned and I find it hard to believe that they are the same.  The first heated up nicely but this new one not so much.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is tiny as described- but it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as described. My other flat iron gets as hot as 450, this one only 250.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my son to use and didn&#x27;t realize how small it was going to be, I know it says mini but it&#x27;s very small, I guess works ok, it just takes a little longer in the bathroom then the reg. size straighteners.</li>
            <li> Works fine, just a whole lot smaller than I thought it would be.  Thought I would get it for travel.  Really only works on the bangs and hair around my face.  Too hard to use it with all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my results from this straightener. I used to have medium length hair and only really used it to get the hair around my ears and my temples. Now I have a shorter cut and it&#x27;s great for everything. Be warned it gets VERY hot, so be careful! I have fine hair, and one time I actually singed some of my hair, so don&#x27;t linger for too long with the iron in any one section. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy to own one of these babies!</li>
            <li> good price and quick shipment</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t not work!  I emailed asking for a replacement, and no one responded. I would definitely NOT buy this!</li>
            <li> MAYBE I MIS READ THE SIZE BUT THIS MINI IRON DOES NOT WORK FOR ME IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A TOY TO BE PLAYED WITH</li>
            <li> I purchased this little iron to straighten my bangs. It does a subperb job and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I have thin, gray, wavy hair, and just one pass across leaves my bangs soft and totally straight. They stay straight from morning til bedtime, which amazes me. The price can&#x27;t be beat and the size is perfect for styling my bangs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but almost too small. It heats up well and would be nice for bangs or really short hair. Otherwise I would just buy a regular one inch flat iron</li>
            <li> If you have short to medium hair this is really all you need for styling. Compact and great for travel. My second one and they have added an on-off switch.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my roots when my hair straightening is growing out, just like I needed. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 or 4 years.</li>
            <li> I didnt like it at all. I turned it on and like 5 mins. Later it was still very soft temperature wise. It says it heats up over 400 but I didnt feel it that way. It didnt straigten my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron!! Had one b4 but it stopped working (had it for alomst 8 yrs).&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair, so it works great for me. Im able to curl my hair in anyway</li>
            <li> Very useful and perfect for very short hair.</li>
            <li> its work good but too small than what I see in the picture</li>
            <li> Fabulous little flat iron.  I could use it just for travel, but it&#x27;s so easy and light that I use it every day.  It heats instantly and is especially versatile used in either hand.  I love this tiny Detailler, and it cools quickly for quick packing.  It&#x27;s Perfect!</li>
            <li> The  plates don&#x27;t get close enough to each other without me having to squeeze the heck out of it which, then pulls my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this little mini iron, the shipping was on time as promised packageing was great</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for years, I purchased another so if the first one went bad I would have a replacement at the moment.  I didn&#x27;t open it for several months but since I have opened, the new one only closes at the tip.  So honestly it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair.  The red area only touches on the tip.  If I would have known when I purchased the second one I would have returned it immediately.  Very disappointed in the replacement.  Want to have one that works but afraid to order again for fear of it being the same and having to return.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, textured/curly hair, and recently got an ill-advised pixie cut. My hair was unruly and now I&#x27;m trying to grow it back out, and the middle length is what this mini styling iron is great for. It gets just as hot as my full-sized flat iron, but it&#x27;s small enough to actually straighten the hair that is between 1 and 4 inches long without completely frying it. I haven&#x27;t had any of the issues with burning my hand like others have, but I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron for years, so maybe my hand is just used to the heat by now. I love this little thing, and even though I won&#x27;t need it for long, I am extremely glad I invested in it for my grow-out period. It makes me feel like I can still make myself look feminine even with the mop of hair I am currently dealing with.    *UPDATE* This thing died in less than a month. I bought a new one because it worked so flippin well and it&#x27;s cheap... but I&#x27;m pretty irritated that it fried so quickly.</li>
            <li> The plates don&#x27;t get close enough for small amounts of hair. It&#x27;s good if you have a big wad of hair to do at a time, but it was not good for my bangs.</li>
            <li> Great price with fast shipping</li>
            <li> I got it quickly, but when I turned it on , it didn&#x27;t even straighten my hair. It becomes extremely hot and there are not enough room to hold it.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great, exactly what I wanted and works great</li>
            <li> Excellent! Great travel iron!!!!</li>
            <li> With multiple speeds, CAN BE ADJUSTED TO SUIT &amp;#34;YOUR HAIR TYPE. LIKE IT FOR NOT BURNING UP MY HAIR THE WAY THE &amp;#34;CHI&amp;#34; IRON DID.</li>
            <li> I received the item fast. It does work and it gets hot and straightens my hair but the on/off switch does not work. So if its plugged up its on whether the switch is on or off and the light does not come on at all to signify that it is on or off. But it was cheap and it serves its function.</li>
            <li> This might be good if you were just taking it with you for touch ups or have really short short hair. Would take hours to do shoulder length hair.</li>
