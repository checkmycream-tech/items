            <li>This is a great razor!</li>
            <li>This is the best razor i have ever used</li>
            <li>The shaving cream it comes with is also perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent protection, excellent seller</li>
            <li>Excellent Razor!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the best razor ever!!!!</li>
            <li>For the record, the shaving gel was excellent; I could not distinguish the gel from their &#x27;regular\\&quot; Gillette Series Shave gel, which I have also found to be excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It appears to operate flawlessly.</li>
            <li>for best price</li>
            <li>Awesome razor.  </li>
            <li>Awesome shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional Gillete Fusion Proglide Razor and was incredible impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received it as a promotion from the company and it was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift.</li>
            <li>But as i said its already a great deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely glad I made the change!!</li>
            <li>▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used.</li>
            <li>Perfect, so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I really liked the way it felt against my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice concept, Gilette, but this product still needs some work.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all thosedivots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.)  </li>
            <li>Excellent Razor...Glides smoothly for a super clean great shave....</li>
            <li>This new razor is surprisingly awesome.  </li>
            <li>Best razor ive purchased, only thing i would knock is the price of the replacement razors, but thats something everyone doesnt like</li>
            <li>i even love the box it came in</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noticeably better, a faster shave</li>
            <li>Outstanding shave and correct in the claim the razor stays on your face.  </li>
            <li>From the hype I was expecting a much better experience than I got.  </li>
            <li>I got a better shave (I shave my head)</li>
            <li>▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a great new product out on the market, it&#x27;s worth checking out!</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t slip even with soap on your hands.</li>
            <li>I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>But, you won&#x27;t have to worry about anything, except maybe looking too good with this new razor from Gillette.</li>
            <li>I must say, I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, it makes shaving so much less of a hassle.</li>
            <li>&gt;▲ The famous \\&quot;Flexball\\&quot; is obvious because of its bright orange color.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free trial from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how great this Flexball technology is -- especially if you are going without the vibrating one with batter.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory.</li>
            <li>this is a smooth well designed razor wish it stayed sharp longer before having to replace blades but its a very good razor over all i do enjoy using it,</li>
            <li>You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving around ears and jaws super quick and easy.</li>
            <li>As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li>My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags.</li>
            <li>The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I see/feel no improvement over the 3-blade Gillette I&#x27;ve been using for years before (on my &#x27;normal&#x27; to &#x27;light&#x27; growth of beard).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few razors and this one seems to be the best so far, I will gladly use it again and again.</li>
            <li>Would have saved many cuts and using inferior razors including 190+ straight days during a deployment.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced.</li>
            <li>Decided to try the &amp;#34;latest and greatest&amp;#34; because the price was right for the experiment.</li>
            <li>(For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new Proglide cartridges will easily fit on your existing Gillette Fusion shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it to shave my face, I used it to shave my chest, a little manscaping is good for you and your spouse, if they like that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>is the first manual razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging.</li>
            <li>I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften.</li>
            <li>low price , looks cool , easily shaves low , sharp , first razor i had that does not get hair stuck in it , feels solid in the hand ,  it also feels and is super easy/safe to use allowing me to shave as fast as i want in any angle almost while making sure i get a perfect low shave.</li>
            <li>You really get best results if you replace the blade every couple uses, but that gets expensive.</li>
            <li>I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor.  </li>
            <li>This product well engineered, and I strongly recommend you go to your local department store and pick one up!.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do much, it seems like a gimmick which worked on me because I bought it.</li>
            <li>Much smoother shave</li>
            <li>I tried the pro version at Art Of Shaving but couldn&#x27;t see paying that much for it and heard that there was a store version coming.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Since the razor/cartridge is obviously the important feature, this review focuses on the razor product.</li>
            <li>The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale.</li>
            <li>&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it.</li>
            <li>This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Well, my skin appreciated those \\&quot;polymers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY:</li>
            <li>Well, my skin appreciated those \\&quot;polymers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY:</li>
            <li>What happen to the good old days when a simply razor would last a week</li>
            <li>Very useful for daily use, works as advertised, no complaints.</li>
            <li>The new Flexball™ effortlessly follows the contours of your face, providing a much closer, and smoother shave.</li>
            <li>but this razor is so much better than all the rest, that I mind shaving less</li>
            <li>I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and it will become your razor of choice for life.</li>
            <li>Proglide does come with an improved handle compared to the old Fusion, but the real difference between the two version is to be found in the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt;▲ For \\&quot;Field Test #2,\\&quot; I had just the normal 1-day beard.</li>
            <li>As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction.</li>
            <li>The sad part is it cannot be returned because it contains razor blades which evidently makes it hazardous.</li>
            <li>The packaging clearly states the contents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flexball is a bit gimmicky, but it is definitely a smooth cut.  </li>
            <li>I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel.  </li>
            <li>But one star off because the replacement blades cost twice as much as the actual razor.</li>
            <li>To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Personally, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It really targets the hard to get corners such as the bottom of your chin and crook of your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Work just like the old razor,but with a little twist.</li>
            <li> There are little \\&quot;stops\\&quot; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far.</li>
            <li> When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> This razor has a strange ball located in the center.</li>
            <li> much less time time shave with the Proglide then with my current razor.</li>
            <li> am a big proglide fan it cuts coeasn with vey few  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s nothing worse than getting ready for a date, and showing up as if you&#x27;ve slaughtered your neck with a butcher knife.</li>
            <li> One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li> One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products.</li>
            <li> but i cant think of one ( especially at this price ) , despite being a sorta negative person lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck.  </li>
            <li> By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz.</li>
            <li> The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The five blades are extremely sharp, with virtually no tugging, even after missing shave day for the past week.</li>
            <li> The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting.  </li>
            <li> After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin \\&quot;bar\\&quot; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Best razor ive purchased, only thing i would knock is the price of the replacement razors, but thats something everyone doesnt like</li>
            <li> The flexball is a bit gimmicky, but it is definitely a smooth cut.  You really get best results if you replace the blade every couple uses, but that gets expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor! I really liked the way it felt against my skin. I didn&#x27;t use it to shave my face, I used it to shave my chest, a little manscaping is good for you and your spouse, if they like that sort of thing. The flexball technology helps to glide this razor across your skin with no irritation and it gets all of the hairs that you don&#x27;t notice until you check. The handle is easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t slip even with soap on your hands. I&#x27;ve owned a few razors and this one seems to be the best so far, I will gladly use it again and again. It comes with a blade already in the razor and an extra one. I received it as a promotion from the company and it was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor i have ever used and i have used quiet a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s : low price , looks cool , easily shaves low , sharp , first razor i had that does not get hair stuck in it , feels solid in the hand ,  it also feels and is super easy/safe to use allowing me to shave as fast as i want in any angle almost while making sure i get a perfect low shave. The shaving cream it comes with is also perfect. i even love the box it came in lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S : I feel bad about this but i cant think of one ( especially at this price ) , despite being a sorta negative person lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other thoughts : Maybe it was just me but i thought it might come with a replacement blade but it does NOT. it comes with one blade on the razor its self and no more than that. But as i said its already a great deal.</li>
            <li> What happen to the good old days when a simply razor would last a week and you then threw it away ? This razor is worthless. Usually I use an electric razor, but I needed something that would cut the hair on my neck. This razor has a strange ball located in the center. Why? I have no idea, because it came with no instructions, neither inside nor on the outside the box.! I tried using it on my neck and on the back of my head, around the hairline. . .no good. It came with an aerosol can of foam which helped a little, but it also failed. I spent over $40 for this sorry razor, a can of foam and 8 refill that have not arrived. You would think the order would both come from the same company  I should throw !?!.  Another complaint, the refills have not arrived. Why did the razor come from one company and the refills from another ? Do not buy this item.</li>
            <li> Excellent Razor...Glides smoothly for a super clean great shave....Makes the shave last longer. Makes shaving around ears and jaws super quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Work just like the old razor,but with a little twist.</li>
            <li> Not better than the electric one</li>
            <li> Very useful for daily use, works as advertised, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free trial from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I shave about once a week so I reply ask a lot from my razor. This razor handles it and then some. It toll much less time time shave with the Proglide then with my current razor. 5 stars. Big recommendation.</li>
            <li> Excellent protection, excellent seller</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Another &amp;#34;I-can&#x27;t-believe-I-need-it-gadget.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m amazed at how great this Flexball technology is -- especially if you are going without the vibrating one with batter.  I take the manual in my travel kit and can&#x27;t believe what an improvement the flexball is.</li>
            <li> am a big proglide fan it cuts coeasn with vey few  nicks yhr rollerball feature elimines ven those</li>
            <li> This new razor is surprisingly awesome.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much of a difference from my power Fushion that I&#x27;ve been using for a few years.  It&#x27;s noticeably better, a faster shave (I guess it just takes fewer strokes, which I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to be possible) and it&#x27;s a manual model (no batteries required!).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a great new product out on the market, it&#x27;s worth checking out! I just received the Gillette® Fusion® ProGlide® manual razor with Flexball™ technology. I must say, I&#x27;m very impressed with this product, it makes shaving so much less of a hassle. Personally, I have sensitive skin and there&#x27;s nothing worse than getting ready for a date, and showing up as if you&#x27;ve slaughtered your neck with a butcher knife. But, you won&#x27;t have to worry about anything, except maybe looking too good with this new razor from Gillette. The new Flexball™ effortlessly follows the contours of your face, providing a much closer, and smoother shave. The five blades are extremely sharp, with virtually no tugging, even after missing shave day for the past week. This product well engineered, and I strongly recommend you go to your local department store and pick one up!.</li>
            <li> Outstanding shave and correct in the claim the razor stays on your face.  After 22 years of shaving in the USAF I wish I had this razor before I retired.  Would have saved many cuts and using inferior razors including 190+ straight days during a deployment. I highly recommend this and it will become your razor of choice for life.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t do much, it seems like a gimmick which worked on me because I bought it. I prefer the regular version because it doesn&#x27;t just turn on contact.</li>
            <li> Decided to try the &amp;#34;latest and greatest&amp;#34; because the price was right for the experiment. It&#x27;s OK, but I see/feel no improvement over the 3-blade Gillette I&#x27;ve been using for years before (on my &#x27;normal&#x27; to &#x27;light&#x27; growth of beard).</li>
            <li> Wish the blades were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Excellent Razor!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first manual razor I have ever used. I always used electric ones prior to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely glad I made the change!! Much smoother shave even though it takes a bit longer.</li>
            <li> this is a smooth well designed razor wish it stayed sharp longer before having to replace blades but its a very good razor over all i do enjoy using it,</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a promotional Gillete Fusion Proglide Razor and was incredible impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Proglide is a five blade shaver with an additional blade on the back for trimming. The new Proglide cartridges will easily fit on your existing Gillette Fusion shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexball technology allows the shaver to stay in close contact to your skin. It really targets the hard to get corners such as the bottom of your chin and crook of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proglide does come with an improved handle compared to the old Fusion, but the real difference between the two version is to be found in the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leading blades have been made thinner, and the lubricating strip above the blades is significantly larger to improve the glide across your face.</li>
            <li> Perfect, so glad I bought this. I tried the pro version at Art Of Shaving but couldn&#x27;t see paying that much for it and heard that there was a store version coming. Love it! Thanks.</li>
            <li> this is the best razor ever!!!! I do not like to shave but this razor is so much better than all the rest, that I mind shaving less</li>
            <li> From the hype I was expecting a much better experience than I got.  After two shaves I went back to the vibrating Gilette product.  I got a better shave (I shave my head) and I got a closer shave.  Nice concept, Gilette, but this product still needs some work.</li>
            <li> This product comes neatly packaged with 1 razor, 1 cartridge, and 1 full-size, 7 oz can of Gillette \\&quot;Fusion Proglide Sensitive\\&quot; shaving gel. Package was simple to open (i.e., no \\&quot;clam-shell packaging.) Since the razor/cartridge is obviously the important feature, this review focuses on the razor product. For the record, the shaving gel was excellent; I could not distinguish the gel from their &#x27;regular\\&quot; Gillette Series Shave gel, which I have also found to be excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ One might mistakenly think this set comes with an ADDITIONAL cartridge, but it&#x27;s just 1 razor with 1 cartridge installed, plus the 7 oz can of gel.  The packaging clearly states the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor comes with a very handy stand to hold while not being used. Fits well, stays put. The razor is very hefty--about 1.8 oz measured on my scale. By contrast, a disposable typically weighs-in less than 1 oz. I measured a Gillette disposable at 1/2 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The razor body is very solid, and has a comfortable feel to it. I liked the feel of the razor body--it felt solidly constructed, and is also well-balanced. I also liked the black raised ergonomic contours on the body of the razor.  Again--felt very solid and well constructed. The color of the body is black with silver trim, plus the orange Flexball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For \\&quot;Field Test #1,\\&quot; I did not shave for several days, so that I had a 3-day beard. I washed my face with cool water, left my face wet, then applied a smooth layer of the Proglide gel. I then waited several minutes for my beard to soften. I began shaving in the easier portions of my face, where the whiskers are lighter, then proceeded to the heavier sections around my chin. The razor nicely navigated all the crags and contours without the slightest drag or snagging. The blades cut very close without the hint of scraping or cutting.  I examined my face very closely after shaving, and I was very pleased with the result. The razor did an outstanding job, providing a very close, clean shave. (For the records, I do NOT have a really smooth face--it&#x27;s about normal roughness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ For \\&quot;Field Test #2,\\&quot; I had just the normal 1-day beard. I washed my face with warm water, left my face wet, then similarly applied a layer of the same gel.  I waited exactly 3 1/2 minutes for the bristles to soften. This time, I paid attention to how well the razor traversed over the chin and down to the neck.  I wanted to see if the rotating head of the razor could smoothly navigate this hilly territory. As before the razor did a similarly outstanding job, providing a very close and smooth shave.  Thus, both the Field Tests confirm the capability of this product.  It works as advertised. When I completed my shaving, I rinsed the razor, and noticed that it is somewhat difficult to get the blades entirely clean of shaving gel.  With 5 blades closely spaced together, this is not a trivial feat.  After cleaning, I thoroughly dried the cartridge, as I hope to extend the life of the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The famous \\&quot;Flexball\\&quot; is obvious because of its bright orange color. The Flexball pivots in 2 different ways. As you hold the razor in front of you, it pivots left to right, in an angular fashion--perhaps up to 15 degrees in each direction. There are little \\&quot;stops\\&quot; on the Flexball that prevent it from rotating too far. You can see a very fine band (at first I thought it was a wire) that allows the angular pivoting. This movement is very smooth--no hitches whatsoever. There is a small screw-like pivot-point, around which the movement takes place. This fastener appears to be very solid; I doubt anything will come lose.  The head of the razor also pivots forward and back, using a thin \\&quot;bar\\&quot; going into the head of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ The above Flexball is very impressive engineering. It appears to operate flawlessly. All of this is to allow the razor to match the contours of your face.  That&#x27;s a nice way of saying, shave around all thosedivots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.)  To further get around those slight detours, this product uses extremely thin, five blades that are designed to glide more smoothly; thus, there is no tugging on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▲ Gillette also claims to incorporate a proprietary strip called the \\&quot;Enhanced Lubrastrip.\\&quot; It&#x27;s the part of the cartridge that is pale green. This strip contains mineral oil and \\&quot;lubricating polymers.\\&quot;  Well, my skin appreciated those \\&quot;polymers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ SUMMARY: My shaving \\&quot;test\\&quot; passed with flying colors. My shave was very smooth, very close, no tugs, no snags. The razor feels very solid. One possible caveat--the razor itself, and the replacement blades are not cheap compared to other products. However, it seems unfair to lower the rating because of the cost; the shopper can make their own decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♫ A Review by Chris Lawsondivots and dents in your face (not that YOU have any, of course, but someone else might.)

            <li> 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;original for best price</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product but I wanted an electric version and did not realize until I received it that it was manual. The sad part is it cannot be returned because it contains razor blades which evidently makes it hazardous.</li>
            <li> Replacement cartridges are way expensive</li>
            <li> Awesome razor.  But one star off because the replacement blades cost twice as much as the actual razor.</li>
