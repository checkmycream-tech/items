            <li>I absolutely love these bath bombs!</li>
            <li>I first found this type of thing at Disney World when I was a kid, and they were the perfect thing for helping me relax.</li>
            <li>I love these bath bombs!</li>
            <li>Smell amazing and work well.</li>
            <li>These smell amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I was not overly thrilled with these.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for men that don&#x27;t want a whole lot of scent.</li>
            <li>Nice to know that Amazon sells these so that I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as fragrant, but still smell nice.</li>
            <li>They are nice scents.  </li>
            <li>Bath Bombs, they fizz and make your shower smell nice.  </li>
            <li>Fragrant and nice bubbles.</li>
            <li>I used one and did have a nice bath.</li>
            <li>Honestly i cant choose between the two yet.</li>
            <li>Never heard if she liked them.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>These might be perfect for a normal bathtub though.</li>
            <li>The ones above smell great, great fizz, good moisture, etc.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>They smell amazing and for the price I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>I love watching them fizz away and the smell from these bombs are just amazing.</li>
            <li>The packaging looked nice and clean!</li>
            <li>Will buy more to keep on hand for looks, scent and to use.</li>
            <li>They are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love a relaxing bath in the evening and often add product to make it even better.  </li>
            <li>I mostly bought them because of the price.</li>
            <li>The bath bombs have an appealing scent, but the brown one (I guess the vanilla one?) turns the bath water a murky brown color.</li>
            <li>I am a bath bomb snob and prefer better quality.</li>
            <li>The bath salts are much much better.</li>
            <li>Bought for a trip to vegas and had several wonderful soaks on my trip.  </li>
            <li>I love these bath bombs.  </li>
            <li>glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>i fell in love with this product as i mentioned to Amazon y or it might have been you.</li>
            <li>So do I:)</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>love the fragrant scents and are so soothing</li>
            <li>They worked perfectly either way and left my skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Better than described.</li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the lavender one</li>
            <li>The bath bombs have an appealing scent, but the brown one (I guess the vanilla one?) turns the bath water a murky brown color.  </li>
            <li>I make these and love them in my bath.</li>
            <li>These fizzers are okay.</li>
            <li>These smell sooooo good and are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t smell really nice, not bad at all, but</li>
            <li>They smell pretty good too, the purple one made all the water purple as well,</li>
            <li>These have a strong, almost overwhelming smell to them.  </li>
            <li>The Lavender and Vanilla smells good but the White tea has a really strong smell and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>While my wife does enjoy the sents we thought these would be more like a bath salt and also make the water fizzy...</li>
            <li>I relax the most in the shower/bath, so I enjoy pampering myself.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy these as a gift because they&#x27;re nothing impressive, but they&#x27;re okay as an inexpensive little treat for yourself.</li>
            <li>I have loved each of the scents and it is nice to have the smaller size</li>
            <li>is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;d be fine but ...</li>
            <li>For the price this is fantastic, it came VERY quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>They have a wonderful scent, and left the bath water a pretty color</li>
            <li>Instead of smelling like a moth ball, the person will smell really pleasant and soft.</li>
            <li>The price is good but the scents are too light to really notice and fade quickly.  </li>
            <li>I cut them in 1/2 as they were huge (in my opinion).</li>
            <li>I enjoy fragrance, but you end up smelling like grandma&#x27;s perfume for hours.  </li>
            <li>These are mostly for fun and for looks.</li>
            <li>They were cheap</li>
            <li>I will enjoy all of them.</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin so soft and smelling good..</li>
            <li>These were a gift item and the recipient was pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t feel clean when you use them&lt;br /&gt;-smaller</li>
            <li>These are perfect, not too expensive, and create a nice relaxing atmosphere whenever I take a bath.</li>
            <li>I think if she liked it, it smelled good, and she wants more, then it was a good buy, especially since I&#x27;ve never seen the village naturals products move up or down in price.</li>
            <li>They hardly fizz, the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li>good extra</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I had just ordered from LUSH or another company though.  </li>
            <li>They might be good for a foot bath, but for a regular bath, maybe use two of them or in conjunction with another bath product.</li>
            <li>The Bath Bombs are so cool.</li>
            <li>From best to least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe even a solid 4 because the quality js good.</li>
            <li>and quickly turn them into hanging Ornaments with the Elf stamp I had created from the north pole at santa;s work shop on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for a higher quality product coming from this fabulous brand.</li>
            <li>After a long day of work, a bubble bath sounds soooo good.</li>
            <li>I have no issues with product itself, they do as expected, fizz in the water and smell pleasant.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty nice and cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to put the bomb into&lt;br /&gt;the water and watch it fizz.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay, they don&#x27;t really smell like much after about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I would have liked them to be a bit stronger but that&#x27;s my only issue</li>
            <li>I love the bath bombs from lush, and these were not even close.</li>
            <li>These bath bombs are fun-</li>
            <li>So far everyone I&#x27;ve given one to has enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>So fun to put in the bath and relax.</li>
            <li>and my skin felt insanely soft. :)</li>
            <li>:) They don&#x27;t really fizz too much and they don&#x27;t turn your bath water&#x27;s colour or anything.</li>
            <li>The other two are still nice, but I don&#x27;t love then quite as much as the lavender.</li>
            <li>these were fun and fairly inexpensive compared to other bath bombs.</li>
            <li>If you like a lot of scent these are the right bath bombs for you.</li>
            <li>This product was just all right.  </li>
            <li>They dissolve completely in a fairly short amount of time and made my skin feel pretty nice.</li>
            <li>They dont fizz that much, however it made my skin feel sooo smooth, and I felt very relaxed afterwards.</li>
            <li>These bath bombs smell nice but they don&#x27;t really make the water feel any different.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how easily they disperse.</li>
            <li>A good scent and left me feeling soft when I got out of they tub.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for however, and they don&#x27;t dissolve very well or quickly.</li>
            <li>I still love Village Naturals and will continue to purchase their other fine products.</li>
            <li>These fizz out quickly and are rather small, but for the price it&#x27;s fair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get into the tub and try out my new bath bomb.....</li>
            <li>They do not bubble up much, I would like bubbles!</li>
            <li>So glad I could get it as a regular item and not an add on.</li>
            <li>I was initially using them to lure my 4yo into the bathtub, as she was bath averse, but then also bought more for my mom.</li>
            <li>I love everything bath related.</li>
            <li>If a scented bath is what you are after, you&#x27;re better off buying a large bag of bath salts for the same price and having enough for WAY more than 3 baths.</li>
            <li>She wants more next Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Really good product except alittle small</li>
            <li>The smell so good and the smell last a long time on your skin after bathing with it.  </li>
            <li>The event isn&#x27;t strong enough for me</li>
            <li>The green tea bomb is my favorite!</li>
            <li>2 fizzed fast and one was a dud and just sat in the tub like mush ,  they all smell</li>
            <li>They do not have that much of a scent</li>
            <li>The scents really are nothing to rave about and once dissolved you have no scent.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than boutiques-</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t very relaxing at all, just very perfumey and gave me sort of a headache before it wore</li>
            <li>they spin and sputter and fizz, releasing scent the whole time.</li>
            <li>very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>Very overpriced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*raises hand &amp; promises not to try to eat them whole again*</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t very fizzy or fragrant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to really describe that.</li>
            <li>Really help my wife soothe her stress.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a whole lot cheaper to make them than it cost here to buy them..............</li>
            <li>I feel very relaxed after soaking in the bath.</li>
            <li>it was very relaxing.i loved all the smells and how it slowly melted away.</li>
            <li>They all basically smell the same, like really strong perfume that old ladies use</li>
            <li>They are kind of small.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be nice change from her usual routine.  </li>
            <li>While the bath bombs are fun, the fun is very short-lived and not worth the price.</li>
            <li>These run smaller than traditional bath bombs (such a Lush bombs) but are of good quality.</li>
            <li>Great for kids who only care about the fizz who could use a little extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Normally I could handle it</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected, but works ok.</li>
            <li>Nice subtle scents-</li>
            <li>I only gave them 3 stars: you only get 3 bombs, and they aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>Vanilla and white tea especially smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Not very scented either, more  of just a generic scent.</li>
            <li>.. hurts if it comes near your skin in the bath.</li>
            <li>Wait until it is completely devolved before entering the bath, and stir.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you had an old style</li>
            <li>at lush they are</li>
            <li>If you can splurge, I&#x27;d opt for a Lush bath bomb instead.</li>
            <li>Bought these for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>She kept stealing my $6 Lush bath bombs</li>
            <li>Clear up to y 18 year old.</li>
            <li>But both are a complete 5 stars plus some for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the ones i don&#x27;t recommend because they are like seriously cheap and a waste of a bath bomb experience.</li>
            <li>so until I&#x27;m not so busy, I&#x27;ll be buying these.</li>
            <li>They do not last more than a few minutes...</li>
            <li>The bath bombs did not make my skin feel any different, and the fizzing action resulted in rapid dissolving with no noticeable change in the water other than a light tint from the lavender one.</li>
            <li>It softened the water a bit and smelled nice, but very subtle.  </li>
            <li>I thought standered shipping would still be fine from where you are located when other orders further with the same shipping plan came way befor yours, 23, 24, 26,</li>
            <li>Honestly, they are a lot smaller than other ones I&#x27;ve purchased, so you feel a little robbed when opening the package.</li>
            <li>The scent was too light and did not last beyond a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Left skin very soft and silky</li>
            <li>27th was the 2nd to last main gift.</li>
            <li>I only rated this as a 3 star simply because I really don&#x27;t feel they are big enough for an oversized jaccuzi tub.  </li>
            <li>Overall OK, but not great.</li>
            <li>The difference between this and other bath salts and products is that this gives a more subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Both are cheap with weak ingredients or something.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These are perfect for men that don&#x27;t want a whole lot of scent.</li>
            <li> Nice to know that Amazon sells these so that I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as fragrant, but still smell nice.</li>
            <li> They are nice scents.  </li>
            <li> Bath Bombs, they fizz and make your shower smell nice.  </li>
            <li> Fragrant and nice bubbles.</li>
            <li> I used one and did have a nice bath.</li>
            <li> Honestly i cant choose between the two yet.</li>
            <li> Never heard if she liked them.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> These might be perfect for a normal bathtub though.</li>
            <li> The ones above smell great, great fizz, good moisture, etc.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> They smell amazing and for the price I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> I love watching them fizz away and the smell from these bombs are just amazing.</li>
            <li> The packaging looked nice and clean!</li>
            <li> Will buy more to keep on hand for looks, scent and to use.</li>
            <li> They are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love a relaxing bath in the evening and often add product to make it even better.  </li>
            <li> I mostly bought them because of the price.</li>
            <li> The bath bombs have an appealing scent, but the brown one (I guess the vanilla one?) turns the bath water a murky brown color.</li>
            <li> I am a bath bomb snob and prefer better quality.</li>
            <li> The bath salts are much much better.</li>
            <li> Bought for a trip to vegas and had several wonderful soaks on my trip.  </li>
            <li> I love these bath bombs.  </li>
            <li> glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> i fell in love with this product as i mentioned to Amazon y or it might have been you.</li>
            <li> So do I:)</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> love the fragrant scents and are so soothing</li>
            <li> They worked perfectly either way and left my skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Better than described.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the lavender one</li>
            <li> The bath bombs have an appealing scent, but the brown one (I guess the vanilla one?) turns the bath water a murky brown color.  </li>
            <li> I make these and love them in my bath.</li>
            <li> These fizzers are okay.</li>
            <li> These smell sooooo good and are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t smell really nice, not bad at all, but</li>
            <li> They smell pretty good too, the purple one made all the water purple as well,</li>
            <li> These have a strong, almost overwhelming smell to them.  </li>
            <li> The Lavender and Vanilla smells good but the White tea has a really strong smell and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> While my wife does enjoy the sents we thought these would be more like a bath salt and also make the water fizzy...</li>
            <li> I relax the most in the shower/bath, so I enjoy pampering myself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these as a gift because they&#x27;re nothing impressive, but they&#x27;re okay as an inexpensive little treat for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have loved each of the scents and it is nice to have the smaller size</li>
            <li> is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;d be fine but ...</li>
            <li> For the price this is fantastic, it came VERY quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> They have a wonderful scent, and left the bath water a pretty color</li>
            <li> Instead of smelling like a moth ball, the person will smell really pleasant and soft.</li>
            <li> The price is good but the scents are too light to really notice and fade quickly.  </li>
            <li> I cut them in 1/2 as they were huge (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> I enjoy fragrance, but you end up smelling like grandma&#x27;s perfume for hours.  </li>
            <li> These are mostly for fun and for looks.</li>
            <li> They were cheap</li>
            <li> I will enjoy all of them.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin so soft and smelling good..</li>
            <li> These were a gift item and the recipient was pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel clean when you use them&lt;br /&gt;-smaller</li>
            <li> These are perfect, not too expensive, and create a nice relaxing atmosphere whenever I take a bath.</li>
            <li> I think if she liked it, it smelled good, and she wants more, then it was a good buy, especially since I&#x27;ve never seen the village naturals products move up or down in price.</li>
            <li> They hardly fizz, the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li> good extra</li>
            <li> I kind of wish I had just ordered from LUSH or another company though.  </li>
            <li> They might be good for a foot bath, but for a regular bath, maybe use two of them or in conjunction with another bath product.</li>
            <li> The Bath Bombs are so cool.</li>
            <li> From best to least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe even a solid 4 because the quality js good.</li>
            <li> and quickly turn them into hanging Ornaments with the Elf stamp I had created from the north pole at santa;s work shop on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a higher quality product coming from this fabulous brand.</li>
            <li> After a long day of work, a bubble bath sounds soooo good.</li>
            <li> I have no issues with product itself, they do as expected, fizz in the water and smell pleasant.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty nice and cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to put the bomb into&lt;br /&gt;the water and watch it fizz.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, they don&#x27;t really smell like much after about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I would have liked them to be a bit stronger but that&#x27;s my only issue</li>
            <li> I love the bath bombs from lush, and these were not even close.</li>
            <li> These bath bombs are fun-</li>
            <li> So far everyone I&#x27;ve given one to has enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> So fun to put in the bath and relax.</li>
            <li> and my skin felt insanely soft. :)</li>
            <li> :) They don&#x27;t really fizz too much and they don&#x27;t turn your bath water&#x27;s colour or anything.</li>
            <li> The other two are still nice, but I don&#x27;t love then quite as much as the lavender.</li>
            <li> these were fun and fairly inexpensive compared to other bath bombs.</li>
            <li> If you like a lot of scent these are the right bath bombs for you.</li>
            <li> This product was just all right.  </li>
            <li> They dissolve completely in a fairly short amount of time and made my skin feel pretty nice.</li>
            <li> They dont fizz that much, however it made my skin feel sooo smooth, and I felt very relaxed afterwards.</li>
            <li> These bath bombs smell nice but they don&#x27;t really make the water feel any different.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how easily they disperse.</li>
            <li> A good scent and left me feeling soft when I got out of they tub.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for however, and they don&#x27;t dissolve very well or quickly.</li>
            <li> I still love Village Naturals and will continue to purchase their other fine products.</li>
            <li> These fizz out quickly and are rather small, but for the price it&#x27;s fair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get into the tub and try out my new bath bomb.....</li>
            <li> They do not bubble up much, I would like bubbles!</li>
            <li> So glad I could get it as a regular item and not an add on.</li>
            <li> I was initially using them to lure my 4yo into the bathtub, as she was bath averse, but then also bought more for my mom.</li>
            <li> I love everything bath related.</li>
            <li> If a scented bath is what you are after, you&#x27;re better off buying a large bag of bath salts for the same price and having enough for WAY more than 3 baths.</li>
            <li> She wants more next Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Really good product except alittle small</li>
            <li> The smell so good and the smell last a long time on your skin after bathing with it.  </li>
            <li> The event isn&#x27;t strong enough for me</li>
            <li> The green tea bomb is my favorite!</li>
            <li> 2 fizzed fast and one was a dud and just sat in the tub like mush ,  they all smell</li>
            <li> They do not have that much of a scent</li>
            <li> The scents really are nothing to rave about and once dissolved you have no scent.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than boutiques-</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t very relaxing at all, just very perfumey and gave me sort of a headache before it wore</li>
            <li> they spin and sputter and fizz, releasing scent the whole time.</li>
            <li> very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> Very overpriced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*raises hand &amp; promises not to try to eat them whole again*</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very fizzy or fragrant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to really describe that.</li>
            <li> Really help my wife soothe her stress.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a whole lot cheaper to make them than it cost here to buy them..............</li>
            <li> I feel very relaxed after soaking in the bath.</li>
            <li> it was very relaxing.i loved all the smells and how it slowly melted away.</li>
            <li> They all basically smell the same, like really strong perfume that old ladies use</li>
            <li> They are kind of small.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be nice change from her usual routine.  </li>
            <li> While the bath bombs are fun, the fun is very short-lived and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> These run smaller than traditional bath bombs (such a Lush bombs) but are of good quality.</li>
            <li> Great for kids who only care about the fizz who could use a little extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Normally I could handle it</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, but works ok.</li>
            <li> Nice subtle scents-</li>
            <li> I only gave them 3 stars: you only get 3 bombs, and they aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> Vanilla and white tea especially smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Not very scented either, more  of just a generic scent.</li>
            <li> .. hurts if it comes near your skin in the bath.</li>
            <li> Wait until it is completely devolved before entering the bath, and stir.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you had an old style</li>
            <li> at lush they are</li>
            <li> If you can splurge, I&#x27;d opt for a Lush bath bomb instead.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> She kept stealing my $6 Lush bath bombs</li>
            <li> Clear up to y 18 year old.</li>
            <li> But both are a complete 5 stars plus some for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the ones i don&#x27;t recommend because they are like seriously cheap and a waste of a bath bomb experience.</li>
            <li> so until I&#x27;m not so busy, I&#x27;ll be buying these.</li>
            <li> They do not last more than a few minutes...</li>
            <li> The bath bombs did not make my skin feel any different, and the fizzing action resulted in rapid dissolving with no noticeable change in the water other than a light tint from the lavender one.</li>
            <li> It softened the water a bit and smelled nice, but very subtle.  </li>
            <li> I thought standered shipping would still be fine from where you are located when other orders further with the same shipping plan came way befor yours, 23, 24, 26,</li>
            <li> Honestly, they are a lot smaller than other ones I&#x27;ve purchased, so you feel a little robbed when opening the package.</li>
            <li> The scent was too light and did not last beyond a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Left skin very soft and silky</li>
            <li> 27th was the 2nd to last main gift.</li>
            <li> I only rated this as a 3 star simply because I really don&#x27;t feel they are big enough for an oversized jaccuzi tub.  </li>
            <li> Overall OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> The difference between this and other bath salts and products is that this gives a more subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Both are cheap with weak ingredients or something.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money just buy lush products</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long though.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I expected them to last a lot longer than they did.</li>
            <li> Not huge like those from Lush.</li>
            <li> I was new to Bath Bombs just late last year</li>
            <li> She seems to like them a lot, although they are more expensive than bubble bathe, and have a lot less uses.</li>
            <li> However, most of them were really expensive ($20 on shipping alone!).</li>
            <li> you dont get that full effect of smells and colours in the tub like other bath bombs sadly</li>
            <li> They are not harsh on her delicate skin.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not very fizzy, but they do fizzle for a bit.</li>
            <li> then i expected.</li>
            <li> And I was a little afraid to stay in the tub too long for fear of staining it light purple.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, these are not very fizzy.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do nearly as much as other bath bombs I&#x27;ve used i.e. not much scent, color, or skin moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very small, practically scentless and old.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely small too, a lot smaller than other brands.</li>
            <li> There was a bit of fizz when it was dropped in the tub but not as much as a typical bath bomb.  </li>
            <li> small and minimal scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s like a little time at the spa.</li>
            <li> not happy, id rather buy from a different company.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t smell much but do not smell bad either.  </li>
            <li> not sure what this was supposed to do......</li>
            <li> These seem a bit on the expensive side since they are about as big as a golf ball.....and didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a small one.</li>
            <li> They are alright- definitely too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting with this product, but this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> My problem is they are small as idk</li>
            <li> For some reason they are hard to come by</li>
            <li> She said she did at least.  </li>
            <li> At least when they&#x27;re done, the smell</li>
            <li> but the size is a negative.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very difficult to unwrap from their individual celophane wrappings.</li>
            <li> No fizzle, no scent, no moisturizers, no bubbles,  I was so looking forward to using, but disappointed when I saw no action, but too late to add another product to the tub.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> They we all broken and in pieces at the bottom of the shipping box.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the bath balls was broken inside.</li>
            <li> Naturals and Village Naturals are the worse.</li>
            <li> They are not in the game anymore.</li>
            <li> but since Ive been sick and down and in hospitals, Mayo clincs in Florida, fighting with blood deciese, heart issues, srokes and in september i find out my kidneys are now infected.</li>
            <li> I think women would be a little disappointed though</li>
            <li> I am sorry I gave them as gifts at Christmas too.</li>
            <li> the 1st meds failed in Novemeber, I told my Husband about it ad folks just thisJanuary.</li>
            <li> what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> In fact, it looks a lot like dirty bath water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product, I just didn&#x27;t expect this.</li>
            <li> We were really disappointed in these based on their size.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> But not the worst.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> not sure what this was supposed to do......it didn&#x27;t bubble ...just sunk to bottom of tub and dissolved. I could not tell if it did anything to the water or not but the scent disappeared when it sunk. I would not buy again and prefer bath salts in scents that stick around while I soak. These seem a bit on the expensive side since they are about as big as a golf ball.....and didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> Great scents, but made my skin itchy.</li>
            <li> Smell amazing and work well. Wonderfully relaxing. Will buy more to keep on hand for looks, scent and to use.</li>
            <li> Chose this as a bday gift for my mom. She loves these things. The packaging looked nice and clean! Overall pretty nice and cheap</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected, but works ok.</li>
            <li> They do not bubble up much, I would like bubbles!</li>
            <li> I love these!  They are my favorite.  The smell so good and the smell last a long time on your skin after bathing with it.  So glad I could get it as a regular item and not an add on.</li>
            <li> The Lavender and Vanilla smells good but the White tea has a really strong smell and not in a good way. I didn&#x27;t tried it yet in the bathtub though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great.. hurts if it comes near your skin in the bath. Wait until it is completely devolved before entering the bath, and stir. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again..</li>
            <li> 2 fizzed fast and one was a dud and just sat in the tub like mush ,  they all smell the same so when they say 3 diffdrent scents they lied.  not happy, id rather buy from a different company.</li>
            <li> Smells great, good deal!</li>
            <li> She said she did at least.  She wants more next Christmas.  Made the bathroom smell great.  I think if she liked it, it smelled good, and she wants more, then it was a good buy, especially since I&#x27;ve never seen the village naturals products move up or down in price.</li>
            <li> I loved my baths before . .  but now I REALLY love my baths!  It&#x27;s fun to put the bomb into&lt;br /&gt;the water and watch it fizz.  The fragrance is wonderful, and it makes your skin feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a little time at the spa.</li>
            <li> These were a gift item and the recipient was pretty pleased. No problems here. I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> I love a relaxing bath in the evening and often add product to make it even better.  I tossed one of these balls into the water and it fizzed like the submarine toy my son used to have.  After it finished fizzing there was nothing.  No bubbles, no oil, no scent, just colored water for the lavender one, not even that for the others.  It was a complete waste of money.  I am sorry I gave them as gifts at Christmas too.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin so soft and smelling good..good extra sent just drop it in with matching bubble bath and feel it relax you</li>
            <li> We were really disappointed in these based on their size.  They are not much bigger than a golf ball and in our whirlpool tub they just disappeared.  Maybe if you had an old style 50 inch tub they&#x27;d be fine but ... smallest bath bomb we&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too big of a fan of these bath bombs. I mostly bought them because of the price. They all basically smell the same, like really strong perfume that old ladies use and I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin after using.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-they come with three different scents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t fizz&lt;br /&gt;-Overwhelming scent&lt;br /&gt;-Water doesn&#x27;t feel clean when you use them&lt;br /&gt;-smaller than I imagined&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I was not overly thrilled with these.  At the time, I was living in a fairly rural area, and did not want to drive over an hour to find a place with bath bombs.  I kind of wish I had just ordered from LUSH or another company though.  These have a strong, almost overwhelming smell to them.  I enjoy fragrance, but you end up smelling like grandma&#x27;s perfume for hours.  As other reviewers have stated, these are not very fizzy.  One of mine actually ended up floating in chunks in the bath water.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> They dissolve completely in a fairly short amount of time and made my skin feel pretty nice. They do not have that much of a scent and they don&#x27;t smell really nice, not bad at all, but nothing really great.  These are perfect for men that don&#x27;t want a whole lot of scent. I think women would be a little disappointed though</li>
            <li> The bath bombs have an appealing scent, but the brown one (I guess the vanilla one?) turns the bath water a murky brown color.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get into the tub and try out my new bath bomb.....what a disappointment. The scents really are nothing to rave about and once dissolved you have no scent. I didn&#x27;t feel any softness in my skin after using this brand and I do not plan on purchasing any bath bombs from this company again. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Nice subtle scents- I let my daughter use these as prizes for when she is very good.  Good size, a golf ball? Not huge like those from Lush. Much cheaper than boutiques- at lush they are what,  6$ and up?</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> These are mostly for fun and for looks. They fizz in the water but do not moisturize at all. And for $2 each/per bomb I would like some moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very difficult to unwrap from their individual celophane wrappings. They are kind of small. They don&#x27;t do nearly as much as other bath bombs I&#x27;ve used i.e. not much scent, color, or skin moisturizing. Not very impressed. They were cheap I guess.</li>
            <li> The price is good but the scents are too light to really notice and fade quickly.  Great for kids who only care about the fizz who could use a little extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Nice to know that Amazon sells these so that I don&#x27;t run out.  The local stores only have them around holidays.  The green tea bomb is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Yummy ..very fragrant. . A bit pricey</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, they don&#x27;t really smell like much after about 2 minutes. They&#x27;re extremely small too, a lot smaller than other brands. They might be good for a foot bath, but for a regular bath, maybe use two of them or in conjunction with another bath product. The smell isn&#x27;t very relaxing at all, just very perfumey and gave me sort of a headache before it wore off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for, I guess! If you can splurge, I&#x27;d opt for a Lush bath bomb instead.</li>
            <li> Bath bombs are so relaxing, I love these things! All three of these scents are calming and sweet-smelling, definitely use these in every bath you take.</li>
            <li> These smell sooooo good and are very reasonably priced. I was initially using them to lure my 4yo into the bathtub, as she was bath averse, but then also bought more for my mom.</li>
            <li> Very small, practically scentless and old. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you like a lot of scent these are the right bath bombs for you.</li>
            <li> Really good product except alittle small</li>
            <li> Each one smells amaazing! The bath bombs were a lot bigger than I imagined also. They dont fizz that much, however it made my skin feel sooo smooth, and I felt very relaxed afterwards. Really good for the price!</li>
            <li> These bath bombs smell nice but they don&#x27;t really make the water feel any different. I am a bath bomb snob and prefer better quality.</li>
            <li> Makes a great bath. My wife loves them. I was surprised how easily they disperse. I would have liked them to be a bit stronger but that&#x27;s my only issue and it&#x27;s a small one.</li>
            <li> These fizz out quickly and are rather small, but for the price it&#x27;s fair. Don&#x27;t buy these as a gift because they&#x27;re nothing impressive, but they&#x27;re okay as an inexpensive little treat for yourself.</li>
            <li> I only rated this as a 3 star simply because I really don&#x27;t feel they are big enough for an oversized jaccuzi tub.  These might be perfect for a normal bathtub though. I have no issues with product itself, they do as expected, fizz in the water and smell pleasant.</li>
            <li> This product was just all right.  There was a bit of fizz when it was dropped in the tub but not as much as a typical bath bomb.  It softened the water a bit and smelled nice, but very subtle.  Overall OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money just buy lush products</li>
            <li> They are alright- definitely too expensive. The bath salts are much much better. They didn&#x27;t have a very strong smell. I love the bath bombs from lush, and these were not even close.</li>
            <li> Bought for a trip to vegas and had several wonderful soaks on my trip.  Left skin very soft and silky</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 6 year old. She kept stealing my $6 Lush bath bombs so I bought her these cheaper alternatives. They aren&#x27;t as fragrant, but still smell nice. They are not harsh on her delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I love these bath bombs.  For some reason they are hard to come by sometime so when I do find them online I buy as many as the store has in stock!  They smell awesome and don&#x27;t leave a nasty ring around the tub.</li>
            <li> These bath bombs are fun- they spin and sputter and fizz, releasing scent the whole time. However, you only get three and their lifespan is very short. They do not last more than a few minutes...I expected them to last a lot longer than they did. At least when they&#x27;re done, the smell stays- so in that sense, it&#x27;s the equivalent of putting scented bath salts in your water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I only gave them 3 stars: you only get 3 bombs, and they aren&#x27;t cheap. If a scented bath is what you are after, you&#x27;re better off buying a large bag of bath salts for the same price and having enough for WAY more than 3 baths. While the bath bombs are fun, the fun is very short-lived and not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I Like how they dissolve well.  They are nice scents.  I like the price of the soaps. glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> For the price this is fantastic, it came VERY quickly and packaged well. Came in perfect condition. They&#x27;re not very fizzy, but they do fizzle for a bit. The scents are strong and very pleasant. Vanilla and white tea especially smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I actually used  two in the bathtub and still no bubbles !  waste of money</li>
            <li> small and minimal scent</li>
            <li> Awesome and cheap. I have loved each of the scents and it is nice to have the smaller size so I don&#x27;t waste any. I will be buying these again</li>
            <li> No fizzle, no scent, no moisturizers, no bubbles,  I was so looking forward to using, but disappointed when I saw no action, but too late to add another product to the tub.</li>
            <li> i fell in love with this product as i mentioned to Amazon y or it might have been you. My daughter loves to soak and mentioned these big bath balls. Since living in SC, from AZ. where this product is in a store there and I had every color of balls,salt and bubble bath to end or start the day. it was on her Christmas List. I found you finally on the net. ordered. Stocking stuffers were the plan. We even had Christmas later. Dec 27th and no bath balls. Since I ordered it on the 18th I thought standered shipping would still be fine from where you are located when other orders further with the same shipping plan came way befor yours, 23, 24, 26, 27th was the 2nd to last main gift. But the #1 on my Daughter&#x27;s nope. Well we went along as planned and Christmas took it&#x27;s Traditional 4am course. We put bath salt from B&amp;BWS in her stocking in stead of wraping it. She slumped. MY daughter that asked out of 3 is 11. Ive used your brand for 14 years and wish they had a store here in SC. Later in the day I heard the truck. I met him out side. Ran to my room&lt;br /&gt;with my plan B (redCelifane Wrapping) and quickly turn them into hanging Ornaments with the Elf stamp I had created from the north pole at santa;s work shop on the bottom. Gold string and Stamp cuts from santa that looked like a sleigh. and in the same wrighting for 18 years wrote HOHO you thought Forgot You. HOHO. You could not smell me, Im so glad you found me Miss Emmie, HOHO! Merry Christmas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, That was so anoying this year. Normally I could handle it but since Ive been sick and down and in hospitals, Mayo clincs in Florida, fighting with blood deciese, heart issues, srokes and in september i find out my kidneys are now infected. the 1st meds failed in Novemeber, I told my Husband about it ad folks just thisJanuary. So yes I was drained after playing Santa save the day plan B again. I always have a santa B. I am Santa. WE Believe at our house. Clear up to y 18 year old. It&#x27;s my Favorit Holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess now I need a soak from all the stress. But She was laughing and loved how he hung them.. She still Believes.  So do I:)&gt;So I guess now I need a soak from all the stress. But She was laughing and loved how he hung them.. She still Believes.  So do I:)</li>
            <li> I bought several of these for Christmas presents.  So far everyone I&#x27;ve given one to has enjoyed it.  I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> Bath Bombs, they fizz and make your shower smell nice.  very relaxing.  they make for a great gift.  I recommend</li>
            <li> love the fragrant scents and are so soothing</li>
            <li> Excellent smelling bath bombs. I cut them in 1/2 as they were huge (in my opinion). They worked perfectly either way and left my skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> They hardly fizz, the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest. The a bit smaller then i expected. You probably would want two or three for a bath but the smell of these would clash if you put them all in the bath.</li>
            <li> So fun to put in the bath and relax. Fragrant and nice bubbles. Better than described. I will enjoy all of them.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a higher quality product coming from this fabulous brand. The scent was too light and did not last beyond a few minutes. The bath bombs did not make my skin feel any different, and the fizzing action resulted in rapid dissolving with no noticeable change in the water other than a light tint from the lavender one. I still love Village Naturals and will continue to purchase their other fine products.</li>
            <li> Honestly, they are a lot smaller than other ones I&#x27;ve purchased, so you feel a little robbed when opening the package. Also kinda fall apart when opened.</li>
            <li> Gift for my niece who loves it</li>
            <li> these were fun and fairly inexpensive compared to other bath bombs. They smell pretty good too, the purple one made all the water purple as well,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting with this product, but this wasn&#x27;t it. I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad product, I just didn&#x27;t expect this. When you drop in the &amp;#34;bath bomb&amp;#34; they start to fizz. It colors the water and the scent is pretty nice. They don&#x27;t last very long though. And I was a little afraid to stay in the tub too long for fear of staining it light purple.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t smell much but do not smell bad either.  Very overpriced.  Consider ordering from www.nourishsavannah.com -- better priced and they smell absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> The Bath Bombs are so cool. I wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li> They we all broken and in pieces at the bottom of the shipping box.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these bath bombs! My favorite is the lavender one and I wish they sold a three pack of just that one. The other two are still nice, but I don&#x27;t love then quite as much as the lavender.</li>
            <li> Made a great gift for my mother.</li>
            <li> These smell amazing and they&#x27;re at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have only used one of these at this time. When I opened the package the bath balls was broken inside.</li>
            <li> Can anyone admit these balls permanently gave you the \\&quot;O\\&quot; face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*raises hand &amp; promises not to try to eat them whole again*</li>
            <li> Disappointing. No fizz.No bubbles.No aroma to speak of.</li>
            <li> I got these bombs because my girlfriend loves to take bubble bathes.  I thought it would be nice change from her usual routine.  She seems to like them a lot, although they are more expensive than bubble bathe, and have a lot less uses.</li>
            <li> I got this for a birthday present for my friend so I don&#x27;t know about the fizz or how it actually is. It smelled good but I couldn&#x27;t wrap the plastic it came in (which I was planning to do) but the package was damaged and the end wouldn&#x27;t close. I wouldn&#x27;t by this again.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very fizzy or fragrant.</li>
            <li> I first found this type of thing at Disney World when I was a kid, and they were the perfect thing for helping me relax. However, I could not every find them anywhere else, so I had to stock up whenever I went. We stopped going after a while, so I had to find replacements. However, most of them were really expensive ($20 on shipping alone!). These are perfect, not too expensive, and create a nice relaxing atmosphere whenever I take a bath.</li>
            <li> While my wife does enjoy the sents we thought these would be more like a bath salt and also make the water fizzy... yeah I don&#x27;t know how to really describe that. But for a good smelling bath these are great!</li>
            <li> I love everything bath related. I can admit, I spoil myself often with different scrubs, bath bombs, body washes.. I relax the most in the shower/bath, so I enjoy pampering myself. I love these bath bombs! They have a wonderful scent, and left the bath water a pretty color and my skin felt insanely soft. :)</li>
            <li> it was very relaxing.i loved all the smells and how it slowly melted away. I loved every thing about it</li>
            <li> Over all good products. Really help my wife soothe her stress. Having a relax feeling at home.</li>
            <li> mini bath bomb! wish they were bigger. you dont get that full effect of smells and colours in the tub like other bath bombs sadly</li>
            <li> They smell amazing and for the price I absolutely love them. :) They don&#x27;t really fizz too much and they don&#x27;t turn your bath water&#x27;s colour or anything. Generally happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The wife loves these and they are the best price I&#x27;ve found that are worth it.</li>
            <li> very good bath balls.</li>
            <li> These run smaller than traditional bath bombs (such a Lush bombs) but are of good quality. I used one and did have a nice bath. A good scent and left me feeling soft when I got out of they tub. Good price but the size is a negative.</li>
            <li> Ok. I was new to Bath Bombs just late last year so i went on a testing spree. This review will be the same for each one except the stars will be different.&lt;br /&gt;Ok. From best to least favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two best choices are Lush(only one I&#x27;m reviewing not sold on amazon) and Moon&#x27;s Harvest Bath &amp; Body Shop. Honestly i cant choose between the two yet. But both are a complete 5 stars plus some for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next. This one. Blissful Bath and Lather and Fizz Bath Boutique. These i think are the same company. Both are a 3 1/2 to 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last on my recommended list of good reviews is Level Naturals. They are great quality. My problem is they are small as idk what. Like golf ball or smaller. I had to use 2 at a time which is why im giving them a 3. Scents are Earthy which i like. If they increase the size and keep the same quality, id have them at a 4 with the 2 above. Maybe even a solid 4 because the quality js good. Which would bring these to a second place(not a tie with the ones above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the ones i don&#x27;t recommend because they are like seriously cheap and a waste of a bath bomb experience. Ps. The ones above smell great, great fizz, good moisture, etc. what you expect from a bath bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugo Naturals and Village Naturals are the worse. I give them 1 star. Enough said. They are not in the game anymore. I used all 3 village ones that come in that pack at the same time and it still didnt come to a 2 star level. Both are cheap with weak ingredients or something. Ok. Thats all. Time to copy and paste this to all the others. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> The bath bombs have an appealing scent, but the brown one (I guess the vanilla one?) turns the bath water a murky brown color.  In fact, it looks a lot like dirty bath water.  Hmmm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bombs are initially fizzy, but don&#x27;t generate bubbles.</li>
            <li> Not the best. But not the worst. The event isn&#x27;t strong enough for me</li>
            <li> I make these and love them in my bath. It isn&#x27;t a whole lot cheaper to make them than it cost here to buy them..............so until I&#x27;m not so busy, I&#x27;ll be buying these. If you are going to buy bath bombs, this is the best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> These fizzers are okay. You get what you pay for however, and they don&#x27;t dissolve very well or quickly. Not very scented either, more  of just a generic scent. I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> Sent these to my (now) ex-girlfiriend in a care package, but a dear john letter was coming in the mail to me from her at the same time.  Never heard if she liked them.</li>
            <li> After a long day of work, a bubble bath sounds soooo good. I drop two of these each time I take a bubble bath. I love watching them fizz away and the smell from these bombs are just amazing. I feel very relaxed after soaking in the bath. These are also great for party gifts. A friend of mine wrapped each one in plastic wrapping paper sac and tied a bow to it. Everyone at the party loved these gifts!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these. They perform. After a bath, the person who took one smells like the scent you chose. The difference between this and other bath salts and products is that this gives a more subtle scent. Instead of smelling like a moth ball, the person will smell really pleasant and soft.</li>
