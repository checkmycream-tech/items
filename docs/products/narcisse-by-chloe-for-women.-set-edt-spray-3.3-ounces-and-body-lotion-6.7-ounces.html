            <li>I&#x27;m having fun wearing it again.</li>

            <li>As always with Amazon, you just have to wait for the right price, this perfume we have been trying to get it for my mom for some time</li>
            <li>I quickly ordered and received the 6.7oz body lotion (which can be worn by itself and very moisturizing) and a 3.4 oz of eau de toilette for $36.00 plus s/h ($5.99).</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was the first perfume my mom ever bought me.</li>
            <li>I really like the lotion, too!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted at the price I wanted to pay</li>
            <li>I used to be able to get it in several places but not anymore.</li>

            <li>Shipping was so fast and the product is exactly how it looks in the photo.</li>
            <li>The shippment came fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Handling and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Too much is very overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find any kind of gift set in this perfume, Thanks!</li>
            <li>it was time for her to get more because she kept the old one for over two years when she only had a little in it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve remember her wearing this when I was young.</li>
            <li>she cant get out like she use to she&#x27;s 83yrs old and cant drive</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, now she wants to open it in on her birthday in February (was a Christmas gift).</li>
            <li>Would probably have given it a 5 because it arrived early and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>my mom was begging me as a gift from long ago, She does really like this perfume.</li>
            <li>too expensive after I found a better bargain in new york city in Broadway.</li>

            <li> This fragrance is my absolute favorite...I received my first bottle (very small bottle) of this fragrance in 1994 to wear during my Junior Prom. Almost 20 years later, and I still love it! When I went to college I could no longer find Narcisse, I was crushed but I still remembered the rich, sweet honey-floral scent. Recently, I googled for the newest Chloe scent that I received a sample of from a department store to my surprise what pops up is an Amazon link for Narcisse. I quickly ordered and received the 6.7oz body lotion (which can be worn by itself and very moisturizing) and a 3.4 oz of eau de toilette for $36.00 plus s/h ($5.99). Great price for 2 large bottles and fast shipping (3 days to get my order)! Now, I am ordering it 2 at a time because I don&#x27;t want to ever run out!</li>
            <li> excellent product good for me</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I buy. I have worn this brand since I was a 19 and I&#x27;m 31 now. I love this scent on my skin. Here in Oki - they did not have my brand in the stores, so I had to go online to order it. I had to have it shipped to my mom in the States and she mailed it to me overseas. The shippment came fast.</li>
            <li> As always with Amazon, you just have to wait for the right price, this perfume we have been trying to get it for my mom for some time and we could not beleive the price nor the fact that it is original.  Very pleased, it takes longer than what they say but it is worth waiting.</li>
            <li> I give it a 5 because I got it for my grandmother she loves it, I use it sometimes when I can get my hands on it but she keep it with her at all times, this her 4th time having it I&#x27;ve remember her wearing this when I was young. it was time for her to get more because she kept the old one for over two years when she only had a little in it...lol she didn&#x27;t want to use it she cant get out like she use to she&#x27;s 83yrs old and cant drive, so I got it for her she was very happy.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally found this perfume great price fast shipping especially since its my best friends favorite got some for to for birthday present thx amazon</li>
            <li> This product is certainly worth the money.  I love this perfume by Chloe and this set is excellent.  I have not found this product at this low price anywhere.  Amazon did a good thing by selling this perfume set at this price.  I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying this perfume set and I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this perfume. glad to find this combo pack. my girlfriend likes it too. it was a hit for a gift.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I placed this order on December 9th. Got Free Super Saving Shipping (which ships between 5-8 days), and it came on December 12th! Excellent service. I bought this perfume for my mom for Christmas because she&#x27;s always raving about \\&quot;back in the day\\&quot; there used to be a perfume called Narcisse by Chloe and she loves the smell etc. Thought I&#x27;d surprise her with this one. I couldn&#x27;t resist spraying just a tiny bit on my hand to see how it smells. All these years of hearing my mom talk about it I have to say it smells wonderful. Not too heavy (which is  a good thing). It has a floral, powdery scent. Thank you so much for the excellent service. I know my mom is going to love it.</li>
            <li> perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was adjusted to my expectations in price and quality. Perfume and body lotion for a great price. Its exceptional content.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume last Sunday and I got it just today. Shipping was so fast and the product is exactly how it looks in the photo. I highly recommend this product and I&#x27;ll be buying it whenever I run out of it for sure!</li>
            <li> This company was great to get me my product in time for a special event.  This is my favorite perfume and I could not find it any where.  The Customer Service was awesome.  Can not say enough good things and they made me very happy and even received the product early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I send her two bottles every six months. And if you are wandering, yes, this *is* the original product (had the same concern...), and it is offered at a fair price. Handling and shipping was fast. Will keep buying this as long as it remains the same...</li>
            <li> Searched long and spent a lot of money trying to find the scent both my partner and i loved....this is it!&lt;br /&gt;Light, floral and not too overpowering. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have wore this scent for at least 15 years.  It is the only thing I wear.  I get soooo many compliment on the way I smell!!</li>
            <li> This was the first perfume my mom ever bought me. It was my signature scent back in high school, so I was delighted to find here on Amazon for such a great price. It brings back tons of memories. I&#x27;m having fun wearing it again.</li>
            <li> My mom has this perfume She used it carefully because in my country is imposible can found it..But We found it in Amazon..Its smell is sweet like the candy LOL...my mom love it.. it&#x27;s delicious</li>

            <li> I love it!!!! It is a wonderful fragrance. I get compliments every time I wear it. I really like the lotion, too!</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. It is difficult to find any kind of gift set in this perfume, Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good service/ excellent condition/ satisfied.  THANKS</li>
            <li> my mom was begging me as a gift from long ago, She does really like this perfume. is not expensive, but it&#x27;s a stylish fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mi mamá lo estaba pidiendo como regalo desde hace ya mucho tiempo, le gusta mucho este perfume. no es caro, pero no es un perfume de mal gusto.</li>
            <li> This is my sisters favorite perfume so I bought it for her birthday and one for myself.  A little goes a long way.  Too much is very overpowering.</li>
            <li> too expensive after I found a better bargain in new york city in Broadway. not too attractive package. need to be colorful</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted at the price I wanted to pay and it arrived in perfect shape in plenty of time.</li>
            <li> My wife was pleased with this fragrance because she could not find it in the stores locally.&lt;br /&gt;However, now she wants to open it in on her birthday in February (was a Christmas gift). So I am intrigued to see what it&lt;br /&gt;will be like.  Would probably have given it a 5 because it arrived early and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Narcisse is difficult to find now. I used to be able to get it in several places but not anymore.I cannot find a perfume I like as well as this one.  I hope they continue to make it.</li>
