            <li>This is an amazing product..</li>

            <li>All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!!</li>
            <li>so its too soon to tell how effective it will be for me</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants great skin!  </li>
            <li>I just started taking these, so it&#x27;s too soon to say how effective they are--but the company service was excellent,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>Well this is kind of what happened to me here.</li>
            <li>I received this as part of a promotion in order to facilitate an unbiased and honest review</li>
            <li>This was a wonderful unexpected surprise!  </li>
            <li>What I like about this product is that it uses ceramide made from rice, and studies have indicated they are more effective than phytoceramides made from wheat.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my results so far I wish I taken pics</li>
            <li>Then I should be able to give an honest rating of the product.  </li>
            <li>This product has been a wonderful help in restoring natural collagen in hair and skin.</li>
            <li>are more potent than wheat or sweet potato based Phytoceramides and give faster and superior results.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in decades.  </li>
            <li>I am however very optimistic about it since reading all the great reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>but a friend has been using this for a while and has been really pleased with the improvements in her skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>and I want to try another bottle to see better results.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It has helped my skin better absorb the serums, creams and lotions that I use.</li>
            <li>and I feel that most products are not going to work for me..  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>and my results have been fabulous!</li>
            <li>My skin is way better</li>
            <li>and I hope to improve even more.</li>
            <li>Smoother lines and better color to skin is what I receive from this.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work</li>
            <li>And the visible improvement is more noticeable with this brand.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that this product seems to really be working.</li>
            <li>My husband thought I was wasting money by purchasing this, but now even he sees that it’s working and keeps asking me if I need to order some more.</li>
            <li>i go to the gym and take better care of myself these days.</li>
            <li>If you were undecided about this, I was too, but I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s why I did it, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>My skin became more pristine and I had a &amp;#34;warmer glow&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still waiting to see more results as I just started the product.  </li>
            <li>there appears to be a good deal of compelling evidence that phytoceramides can help increase hydration and stimulate collagen production, thereby plumping the skin from the inside out</li>
            <li>as I said I love this product..</li>
            <li>I will just continue and see what happens :)</li>
            <li>I love what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li>I’m really glad I found this product</li>
            <li>After reading more about it, however, I decided to use the rice based product.</li>
            <li>E which help us rebuild healthy tissues faster.</li>
            <li>so hope after taking this one I will get better results.  </li>
            <li>After almost giving up hope I found something that solved all my problems and more.</li>
            <li>I love all the vitamins that are in these capsules.</li>
            <li>I’m really enjoying the changes I have been seeing</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t Wait!!  :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered two bottles initially to try the product, very happy with the results</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve ordered two more.  </li>
            <li>My skin appears healther, more toned after just two months</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more results as I take the product for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this product for what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the supplememnt but just received it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product and will continue taking phytoceramides to maintain the improvement in my wrinkles and dryness.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I&#x27;m petrified to STOP taking them at this point because I like how i&#x27;m looking these days. :)</li>
            <li>I do feel like my skin looks more youthful and</li>
            <li>I feel better about myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li>When we use fillers, they fill the wrinkles in on the top layer but these mask wrinkles rather than treat them at the source.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many products, however, I have not had any adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels softer, looks smoother, and seems to retain moisture better.</li>
            <li>The acne is 75% better.</li>
            <li>I really love the teraputics phytoceramides, I am in my 50s ,I have used them before so</li>
            <li>This is impressive to me because it means that they believe in their product, back it up, and stay in contact with the client.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very excited about this product.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good though!  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>top of being more effective than wheat or sweet potato derived Phytoceramides, these are gluten free as well</li>
            <li>I am so excited to receive my bottle of Phytoceramides!</li>
            <li>Wow an incredible product my face feels tighter smooth</li>
            <li>I have noticed that when i started using the product my fine lines began to diminish and i feel so much better about myself.</li>
            <li>so am pleased that this product is gluten free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the phytoceramides so far.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I experienced an unexpected benefit from using this product.</li>
            <li>but i am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>and I love the free gift I received.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t experienced a real noticeable improvement yet, but I will continue taking it for 2 months to see if its full effect will be perceptible.</li>
            <li>I picked this brand because the bottle really stood out to me and they had a good price.</li>
            <li>But, overall, this product has been really good for my skin!</li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>I received the package very quickly and on time.</li>
            <li>my skin is easily reactive and immediately shows signs of dehydration.  </li>
            <li>great quick shipping, &amp; decent price point.</li>
            <li>There are easy to take, easy to swallow capsules that keep my skin</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I am also encouraged to drink more water now, to get the full effect of the phytoceramides.  </li>
            <li>I finished a bottle and noticed reduced lines and a softer texture, but I think I need to give it more than a month to see full results, so I&#x27;m going to order another bottle.  </li>
            <li>It takes skin a full month or more to &amp;#34;turn over&amp;#34; so I know I have to be patient.</li>
            <li>Studies have proven that Phytoceramides can increase moisture retention in your skin, which drastically affects the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fine lines and wrinkles I had are gone or fading away.</li>
            <li>Without a question, fine lines around my eyes seemed to disappear and the creases in my forehead softened.  </li>
            <li>I use them in conjunction with Vitamin C serum and an excellent moisturizer, and the bags under my eyes have become less puffy and pronounced and are continuing to smooth out.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays in place, my nails are less brittle, my wrinkles are greatly reduced, and since I look better I feel much better as well.</li>
            <li>Huge difference in my skin texture and tone.</li>
            <li>I noticed huge improvement with her skin after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>By May 1 my colleagues at the school where I teach began to tell me how great I was looking, and visiting, long-graduated students home for the summer from college commented on how I looked &amp;quot;younger&amp;quot; than they remembered, and that whatever it was that I was doing differently, to keep doing it!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Also this product is produced in an FDA-registered lab, which is important.</li>
            <li>I really honestly did not expect much from taking this supplement but have noticed a gradual improvement with my skin ever since I started taking it.</li>
            <li>I plan to take this for a few months so that I can get absolutely perfect skin.</li>
            <li>Today makes my third day on it ,  and I am looking forward to great results.  </li>
            <li>So thankful for a free bottle.  </li>
            <li>After reading such great reviews, my wife and I wanted to try this product.  </li>
            <li>I took these capsules for 60 days (I took advantage of the free bottle offer that came with my order).  </li>
            <li>I chose this product because I am gluten intolerant, and needed a gluten free phytoceramide.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free by the way.</li>
            <li>- 100% Gluten Free</li>
            <li>That was my primary concern when I bought them.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with my skin and use them in conjunction with topical Vitamin</li>
            <li>Liked e mail notifications,  fast delivery and  an information pamphlet about this</li>
            <li>so when I saw this was gluten free, I had to try it.</li>
            <li>but I wanted the free bottle which required I write the review before I saw the results.</li>
            <li>which is important to the growing percent of the population who suffer from wheat allergies.</li>
            <li>My own daughter asked yesterday what I was doing to make my skin glow so much.  </li>
            <li>This is one product that definitely gives great results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing I have tried has helped to get rid of my acne that effectively or that fast.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free so that I can try it out.</li>
            <li>I did research before ordering, and this product contained all of the essentials that were stated in articles as important to have in phytoceramide supplements.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I decided to go ahead and choose this particular brand because of the amazing price and that they seem legit.</li>
            <li>in mind that healthy, beautiful, natural-looking skin should look plump and firm ...</li>
            <li>I am excited to see the result sinceI still use it</li>
            <li>So excited use this.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li>so excited what whould be d result.</li>
            <li>This is is not an original product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to see what will happen in another 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited to see what will happen in another 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how this progresses.</li>

            <li>If you have dry skin or you&#x27;re concerned about signs of aging - this supplement might be of great help to you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;rice-based phytoceramides - such as teraputics - are demonstrated to be more effective than their wheat-based counterparts&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since then, my skin is much more radiant, clear, and has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>capsules are easy to swallow, and they are certainly gluten-free (or I would know about it!).  </li>
            <li>Overall my skin looks good.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I am doing good for my body, and my future appearance/</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t upset stomach and actually makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>I have gotten such compliments on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>The capsules are easy to take and my skin is soft and I do not have many wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Even people at my work for no apparent reason would tell me that I look really good for some reason and they can&#x27;t quite put their finger on it.</li>
            <li>In effect, I have healthier skin and fine lines don&#x27;t concern me as much!</li>
            <li>but I am one of the lucky ones.  </li>
            <li>However, don’t let me and that yellow dog influence your own determination as to precisely in which of the two photo</li>
            <li>As we still have two more bottles to use from our initial order, we are anticipating seeing even better things happen.  </li>
            <li>I also received this bottle for free so that was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>skin is severely damaged as a result of using oral minoxidil (not the commonly-used topical form, but the considerably more potent pill form), which has the undocumented side-effect of suppressing the body&#x27;s ability to produce collagen&lt;</li>
            <li>Now a month later, my face is getting more and more blemish free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just received this product and so far so good as Teraputics responded to my order very efficiently.  </li>
            <li>I got it quick and the company has quick follow up.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and I also got a coupon for another bottle free.  </li>
            <li>To add another note, we did research and review other wheat based phytoceramides prior to purchasing this one and decided this product is the best we found among them, as well as being gluten free.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more soft and looks more vibrant.</li>
            <li>The labeling is very professional and it comes in a very beautiful little box.</li>
            <li>was excited to receive my first bottle of Teraputics Phytoceramides and began using faithfully on March 1.  </li>
            <li>This appears to be the best of the three, yet as the formula for all of the gluten-free ceramides appears to be exactly the same and the manufacturing process appears to be the same, I  wonder if I am kidding myself.  </li>
            <li>After years of eating whatever, tanning, etc; I&#x27;m now committed to living a more healthy lifestyle; exercising, eating natural foods, and this supplement will be a continued part of my new routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big believer in most supplements, but I&#x27;m a huge believer in the results I&#x27;m seeing from taking Phytoceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It took 60 years to get my skin at this point and in this condition, and if I saw improvements in even six months, then that would truly be miraculous and worth the money and effort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly worth</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product is that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>The catalyst for this was finding out about phytoceramides and how they can help keep your skin moist and fresh.</li>
            <li>my skin is fresh and...</li>
            <li>Of course youthful unblemished skin will make you look better.</li>
            <li>After 1 month, my skin appears far more well hydrated throughout the day...</li>
            <li>well worth the try.</li>
            <li>Do not look as tired and my coloring is great!!!!!!!!!!!.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don’t think I’d have ever believed that these phytoceramides actually work if I hadn’t seen it for myself.</li>
            <li>I just started using it, so we will see in a couple weeks what the results will be, but their customer service thus far has made me feel confident I bought the right brand.</li>
            <li>If you want to look younger and more vibrant and better looking.....</li>
            <li>I not only see positive changes, but looking better again has helped me feel more confident enough to get out and socialize more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am so excited to finish the whole bottle and purchase it again!!!Q!Q</li>
            <li>One a day is good since I take other supplements</li>
            <li>’s right, put your glasses on, and then go get somebody else to come over here and decide with you, so as to do this judging thing democratically right.</li>
            <li>Love it - skin is smooth, soft, clear!</li>
            <li>most appropriate old axiom to the present occasion at hand as follows:</li>
            <li>It make my skin fresh and my skin crisp.</li>
            <li>Anxious to use and see great results.</li>
            <li>I’ve been trying to stick to gluten free products and foods for a while now in an attempt to live a healthier lifestyle</li>
            <li>I dont experience rashes or allergy its natural and easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>but I definitely wil continue to keep ordering great results and the price is ridiculously low.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My skin has always been so dry that it just won’t hold any kind of moisture at all</li>
            <li>so anything that makes my day easier and gives me the same or better results is definitely worth</li>
            <li>You will see the new you with a baby face!!!</li>
            <li>Though, what actually sold me was when my research kept indicating that phytoceremide, derived from rice, was more easily absorbed into the body’s cell structure than phytoceremide derived from only wheat.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, after ordering and using just one bottle (a one month’s supply) of your rice-derived phytoceremide capsules, the tighter, plumper, fuller, rosier, and much more youthful looking skin emerging on my face and neck was all the damn research I needed.</li>
            <li>So I reviewed many companies and products, and settled on Teraputics due to the extremely high number of satisfied customers who saw results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All Natural Plant Derived Vitamin Extract, Skin Restoring Skincare Oral Supplement, Eliminates Wrinkles, Reduces Fine Lines, Strengthens Hair Skin Nails, 30 Veggie Caps,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably too early to see a change in fine wrinkles, but I&#x27;ll continue to take the product to allow enough time to reap its many benefits.</li>
            <li>My skin really not too amazing</li>
            <li>Fast service!</li>
            <li>Thank you Thank you, Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>ok so I have only been using this product for 1/2 month</li>
            <li>The product was delivered as promised, fast and efficient!</li>
            <li>Thanks Teraputics!</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I am starting to see a more even skin tone</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have to say that they work almost exactly as they claim they will...</li>
            <li>so I knew this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>it seems to be a better quality than similar products.  </li>
            <li>All of the formulations leave the skin feeling softer and more hydrated, especially the legs.  </li>
            <li>It definitely does not irritate my system like many vitamins do.</li>
            <li>I first heard about ceramides on the Dr. Oz show and decided to go ahead and try it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase and intend to continue using these as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>It worked exactly as I was told it would.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in the first week.</li>
            <li>Phytoceramides are 100% all natural, made in the USA , and are gluten free since they&#x27;re rice derived.</li>
            <li>The product is okay after one bottle so let&#x27;s see what happens next.</li>
            <li>Will continue taking and update this with more information later</li>
            <li>You will see a difference within the first week of using this product.</li>
            <li>Just took my first one.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see wat the future holds, but for now I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can finally get them affordably instead of buying overpriced ones from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I will post again after the next couple of months looking for more results on my hands and face.</li>
            <li>The specific reason that I wanted to try your brand was the fact that I discovered that, unlike the other brands which were made from wheat, the phytoceremide in your capsules was derived from rice which my exhaustive Internet research (you can be exhaustive when your retired and there’s nothing better to do) indicated that phytoceremide, derived from rice, was superior to that produced from wheat in several important respects.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of positive reviews about it.</li>
            <li>These Ceramides seem to be working though there is no dramatic change.  </li>
            <li>Take your time Don’t make your final determination and selection simply as the naturally biased manufacturers of the wonderfully effective phytoceremide product that produced this remarkably handsome, garrulously talkative, sexy, and youthful looking face, which is wrapped around a rather big, horsey-looking smile and plastered onto and covering what is, in all truth and fact, a nearly 70 year old visage --- but rather make and pick your choice as the honest, objective, unbiased (well, I guess you can strike that last word, anyway)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half way but so far so good.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, has more moisture, less lines around my eyes, lip, laugh and forehead lines.  </li>
            <li>I’ve been taking this for a month but the lines on my face have softened a little and my skin is kind of lighter and smoother</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and I am aware that it may not work for everyone</li>
            <li>, I ask you, to consider for just a moment the better of the two photos enclosed, which even a yellow dog could tell would clearly be the “after” photo, which was taken a month ago after using your fine , rice-based product for only three months.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>I have always had very oily skin and over the years I have been seeing an increase of sun and age spots.  </li>
            <li>So I had no expectations for miracles straight out of the gate, or box, if you will.  </li>
            <li>I never really had that many wrinkles</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Well after only a week of taking these capsules I saw my skin tighten up, my wrinkles smooth out, and my skin became almost brighter.</li>
            <li>Ready to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This phytocermide was high recommended!</li>
            <li>I do also use topical hyaluronic acid and light therapy on my face, so I can&#x27;t say which of these treatments is making the difference.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important to know because there have been numerous studies that show 40mg of rice derived Phytoceramides</li>
            <li>I am very encouraged and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I noticed it’s not shedding that much in the shower anymore</li>
            <li>My skin has tightened up, especially along my jawline, on my cheeks, and my neck and my skin is so smooth to touch.</li>
            <li>She transformed in front of my very eyes.</li>
            <li>and I am curious to see how much more it could do.</li>
            <li>Delivered very timely and product is as stated.  </li>
            <li>Skin is much softer and moisturized.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>or since it is added it would be better to use a natural source rather than the synthetic form that is currently used.</li>
            <li>It seems like my skin has actually become softer and more clear.</li>
            <li>Absolutely noticed a significant difference in my skin after finishing the bottle--the improvements were obvious.  </li>
            <li>So what more can I say other than why don&#x27;t you just try these phytoceramides if you really want something that works.</li>
            <li>After two weeks let me just say that my skin has cleared up completely, my hair stopped falling out as much, my hair feels stronger, the dark circles under my eyes are almost gone, and I feel amazing about all of this.</li>
            <li>I truly have not taken it long enough to give an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>The wheat-based phytoceramides actually made the deep wrinkles on my face more pronounced and made me look older, so perhaps I have a gluten sensitivity I wasn&#x27;t previously aware of.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines associated with dry skin started freaking me out about a year ago.</li>
            <li>We are only in the initial phase, but still, we give this product a top rating because we are excited about the future results!  </li>
            <li>First I want to say however that there weren&#x27;t any side effects at all, the pill would just completely pass through my body.</li>
            <li>I am new to phytoceramides!  </li>
            <li>This is first time I used this product, it&#x27;s been only five days, but I can clearly that see my skin is more even and brighter, it definitely works!</li>
            <li>Even the creases on my forehead are now less prominent.</li>
            <li>and my complexion is more even and less sallow, and I have not has any acne to speak of.</li>
            <li>Please remember to have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li>Please remember to have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li>Now, if it is a women in your office who is reading this letter, then please, don‘t be like my older sister</li>
            <li>(she’s 76, going on 212, so she knows everything) and try and tell me that men my age don’t care about their looks as they get older.</li>
            <li>I also started giving one a day to my husband who is 5 years older than me and who had some pronounced creasing in his forehead as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing that just a simple little pill can mask the symptoms of aging so well.</li>
            <li>as an important part of a broad, systemic approach in an attempt to increase my body&#x27;s collagen production and repair as much of the oral minoxidil-induced damage as possible</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I feel they are a high quality brand.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>One other problem is that my friend tried these phytoceramides too and they didn&#x27;t have such an amazing effect on her.</li>
            <li>I just have to give it a little more time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it a little more to give it some more time to have some effect, but after a few weeks of using it and nothing, I&#x27;m losing my faith.    </li>
            <li>I am very conscientious about my skin and natural anti aging</li>
            <li>and I am pleasantly surprised about the whole thing.</li>
            <li>Within a few days, my skin appeared healthier, more even toned.  </li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t drink any alcohol for a few days it gets even better.</li>
            <li>I can deinitely give this product a confident 5 stars and have already recommended it to my sister and a few friends.</li>
            <li>For the first week I barely felt any difference</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks after I began taking Phytoceramides I noticed more fullness to my cheeks, and a visible reduction in the sagging at the jowls.</li>
            <li>No side effects, arrived quickly and since they aren&#x27;t huge pills like some supplements, they aren&#x27;t so hard to swallow.</li>
            <li>It seems as if my skin repairs itself more rapidly and with less to zero scarring!</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have done nothing extraordinary, beyond soap and water and a basic moisturizing body lotion to care for my face.  </li>
            <li>i recently became single again and was looking for ways to look better so i can attract some women.</li>
            <li>“One can only rightly conclude, based strictly on the evidence before us, that the proof of the phytoceremide, unlike the proverbial pudding, is not in the ‘ tasting’ but in the ‘looking’,…n’est pas?”ent occasion at hand as follows:</li>
            <li>“One can only rightly conclude, based strictly on the evidence before us, that the proof of the phytoceremide, unlike the proverbial pudding, is not in the ‘ tasting’ but in the ‘looking’,…n’est pas?”</li>
            <li>after one month using  Phytoceramides , I notice my nails become hard and my skin looks fresh and fine lines diminished.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that people interested in adding a bit of youth back into their skin give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that people interested in adding a bit of youth back into their skin give it a try.  </li>
            <li>this is a new one for me</li>
            <li>When you apply a cream, it sinks in to the top layer of skin and perhaps the second layer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different creams, serums, dermarolling, and facial-flex with minimal results.</li>
            <li>I am 73 years and have always had dryer skin, especially on my legs,  I have been taking this  product  for 30 days and am amazed at how smooth  my entire body feels, I also notice a difference on my face, I  look forward to seeing additional benefits from this product</li>
            <li>and I am very surprised with my results.</li>
            <li>Am using it in conjunction with Mad Hippy skin care products which also work great, and the combination seems to be really working.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that 40mg is equal to the 350mg in the wheat product</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what other changes are going to take place as I continue using this product.</li>
            <li>A rice based skin supplement is hard to find as many of them are made with wheat so that was one of the reasons I chose this particular brand.</li>
            <li>I have&#x27;t been using it one 1 day, but after reading other reviews I am excited to begin and cannot wait to see result.</li>
            <li>and I’m anxious to see even more as time goes on.</li>
            <li>#34;You look younger than you do when I first met you!&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>There are other factors that have most likely contributed, but this stuff has been part of the equation.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend, especially to women struggling with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Now, so as not to drag this testimony from New York to South Georgia, just let me say that I think the two un-retouched photos ( one before and one after) that I’ve included as an attachment to this email pretty much says it all.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Every single summer my skin dries out very quickly and wrinkles form on my face that were simply not there before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 64 years old and live in the desert</li>
            <li>I am 45 years old and had recently started contemplating my getting Botox for the first time.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a short period of time, maybe it&#x27;s all in my head, but I swear I am seeing positive results.</li>
            <li>trying several different brands of phytoceremide and all with fair to moderate success as far as results go, I finally got around to ordering your product to try just a few months ago.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything more than a minor visual improvement with any of the brands, but I have not been regular about taking the supplements either.  </li>
            <li>I find myself touching my face throughout the day because it feels so different than it did previously.</li>
            <li>The instructions were plain and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>After taking them for a little over two months I continued to see those positive changes getting more pronounced, and my face was definitely still filling back out.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt whatsoever that I am now seeing some pretty dramatic results for my own personal skin type and condition.  </li>
            <li>There is no doubt whatsoever that I am now seeing some pretty dramatic results for my own personal skin type and condition.  </li>
            <li>had a little bit of acne when I first started taking this and within the first week, it had started to clear up.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive results: smoother skin and more importantly, no more dry skin.</li>
            <li>so, in your final, closing statement, concerning this whole matter, I think you would probably agree to state out loud and say along with me ----</li>
            <li>(and they clear up after I take a Zantac for allergies).</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this product a try as I will be turning 50 years young this year.  </li>
            <li>Within 24 hours, I was pleasantly surprised to find my skin and hair were not oily.  </li>
            <li>My wrinkles have reduced and the lines on my face have almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe something that is all natural could work so well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue taking this product for at least 6 more months</li>
            <li>I am a 52 year old man with all sorts of splotches and blotches.</li>
            <li>So I am ready to buy another bottle to see how much younger could I look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old woman in her 50&#x27;s and my skin is just falling apart.</li>
            <li>, it feels really soft and I have fewer lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>My co-workers keep telling me that I look much younger than my real age.  </li>
            <li>I specifically purchased from this company because the product is all natural and made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>I am currently on some medication that really dries out my hair and skin, and this product is helping me manage those side effects.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, I&#x27;ve only used once.</li>
            <li>Early days yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking Phytoceramides for nearly six months now, so I can share a bit about how well these have worked for me so far.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give a complete review based on the length of time I have been using the Phytoceramides.  </li>
            <li>I finished the product which took one month and didn&#x27;t notice anything different about my skin... Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>so I will respond after the 30 days are complete</li>
            <li>Really noticed a difference in overall skin quality.  </li>
            <li>and it was a small easy to swallow pill</li>
            <li>It took about a week before I noticed that my skin wasn’t as dry anymore, and now almost 1 month in, my skin is soft and smooth and there aren’t any dry patches anywhere anymore.</li>
            <li>I feel like a whole new person because my skin is moist and has a softness it hasn’t had in a very long time.</li>
            <li>Seeing small but beneficial improvement to the fine lines...</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin isn’t nearly as dry as it was, my crow’s feet have faded a little bit, and my complexion is more even than it was.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be reordering this product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All the little, fine lines above my lips are gone!</li>
            <li>Some of my fine lines seem to be fading a little, especially the &amp;#34;eleven&amp;#34; wrinkles between my eyebrows, and the wrinkles across my forehead.</li>
            <li>Re ordering more today as I only have a few pills left</li>
            <li>After a little more than a month the bagginess under my eyes was cleared up, and the toothpick lines at the bridge of my nose were harder to see.</li>
            <li>Everybody is different but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try something new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even noticed that my heels which get quite dry are much improved.  </li>
            <li>Both our skin is feeling much smoother and not as dry or itchy that it was.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of topical treatments, which have only helped so far.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t wait to order them again, my skin looks and feels very soft and creamy especially on my legs.</li>
            <li>I mean…after all…mine is the face of responsibility: I’ve got several women depending on this face and that smile to bring a little extra-curricular joy into their lives --- not all at the same time, mind you, but rather each on a different day of the week --- that is, if I’m not too awfully tired from my services to the others earlier in the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I believe my fine lines are less visible, after only a short time using this product.  </li>
            <li>, I find it usually takes a minimum of 30 days to see definitive results with any supplement--but I definitely noticed softer skin, improved glow and better overall skin clarity.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that there were no digestive issues with Teraputic&#x27;s Phytoceramides nor any other type of negative reaction whatsoever, I find wheat based harsher on the digestion.  </li>
            <li>Within two weeks, his age lines also softened significantly and he looks quite a few years younger!  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a supplement that would restore the moisture in my skin that was left pretty dry after the laser peel and photofacial, and this is the answer!</li>
            <li>The results are positive and I agree with the other reviews that say give it time.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the results and will continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li>The difference is quite apparent.</li>
            <li>so I have no plans to discontinue using this product in the near future.</li>
            <li>They would always be so brittle but lo and behold they barely ever chip now.</li>
            <li>I think it is too early to see results, I am trusting they will come with the second bottle.  </li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t have any comments, positive or negative, to offer.</li>
            <li>I really saw a difference on the back of my hands--they tend to get very dry, they became glowier and smoother also.  </li>
            <li>My skin has been transformed from dry, scaly, dull skin to amazingly soft, smooth, youthful skin.  </li>
            <li>I give this one the highest rating thus far as they provide a pamphlet that gives you information that others don&#x27;t; such as.... take at the same time every day, give it 6-8 weeks, drink water.  </li>
            <li>I have been using phytoceramides for a while now and my skin is not dry anymore</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any major results, that is why I&#x27;ve only giving it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>I just received my order today, and am very hopeful that I will experience the same results that other reviewers have had.  </li>
            <li>specific situation is somewhat unusual and extreme, and i intend to continue using teraputics phytoceramides because i believe it&#x27;s a quality product and a valuable component in my efforts</li>
            <li>At 57 never expected to see such improvement!</li>
            <li>I am still anxious to see if this will reduce the deeper smile lines after taking them longer.</li>
            <li>approaching June 1, I continue to receive comments from folks young and old that I &amp;quot;sure am wearing my age well,&amp;quot; and that I look nothing like other women they know in their 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>Since I started taking these, my skin all over is nowhere near as dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore, taking a tablet is far less hassle than a daily half-hour routine of expensive skin creams, scrubs, rubs, massages and more!</li>
            <li>I have no new breakouts and my old scars are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>i was very surprise that in a little time my face looks younger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a long three weeks for me as I try to make myself look a little better than usual.</li>
            <li>I was just told the other day that I was a very young  looking 65.</li>
            <li>so I have nothing good or bad to say.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am particularly happy about this being gluten/wheat free.</li>
            <li> My skin has had amazing results since I have been taking it.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product..</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product.</li>
            <li> All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!!</li>
            <li> so its too soon to tell how effective it will be for me</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants great skin!  </li>
            <li> I just started taking these, so it&#x27;s too soon to say how effective they are--but the company service was excellent,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> Well this is kind of what happened to me here.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a promotion in order to facilitate an unbiased and honest review</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful unexpected surprise!  </li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that it uses ceramide made from rice, and studies have indicated they are more effective than phytoceramides made from wheat.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my results so far I wish I taken pics</li>
            <li> Then I should be able to give an honest rating of the product.  </li>
            <li> This product has been a wonderful help in restoring natural collagen in hair and skin.</li>
            <li> are more potent than wheat or sweet potato based Phytoceramides and give faster and superior results.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in decades.  </li>
            <li> I am however very optimistic about it since reading all the great reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> but a friend has been using this for a while and has been really pleased with the improvements in her skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> and I want to try another bottle to see better results.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It has helped my skin better absorb the serums, creams and lotions that I use.</li>
            <li> and I feel that most products are not going to work for me..  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> and my results have been fabulous!</li>
            <li> My skin is way better</li>
            <li> and I hope to improve even more.</li>
            <li> Smoother lines and better color to skin is what I receive from this.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work</li>
            <li> And the visible improvement is more noticeable with this brand.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that this product seems to really be working.</li>
            <li> My husband thought I was wasting money by purchasing this, but now even he sees that it’s working and keeps asking me if I need to order some more.</li>
            <li> i go to the gym and take better care of myself these days.</li>
            <li> If you were undecided about this, I was too, but I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s why I did it, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> My skin became more pristine and I had a &amp;#34;warmer glow&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to see more results as I just started the product.  </li>
            <li> there appears to be a good deal of compelling evidence that phytoceramides can help increase hydration and stimulate collagen production, thereby plumping the skin from the inside out</li>
            <li> as I said I love this product..</li>
            <li> I will just continue and see what happens :)</li>
            <li> I love what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li> I’m really glad I found this product</li>
            <li> After reading more about it, however, I decided to use the rice based product.</li>
            <li> E which help us rebuild healthy tissues faster.</li>
            <li> so hope after taking this one I will get better results.  </li>
            <li> After almost giving up hope I found something that solved all my problems and more.</li>
            <li> I love all the vitamins that are in these capsules.</li>
            <li> I’m really enjoying the changes I have been seeing</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t Wait!!  :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles initially to try the product, very happy with the results</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve ordered two more.  </li>
            <li> My skin appears healther, more toned after just two months</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more results as I take the product for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this product for what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the supplememnt but just received it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product and will continue taking phytoceramides to maintain the improvement in my wrinkles and dryness.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I&#x27;m petrified to STOP taking them at this point because I like how i&#x27;m looking these days. :)</li>
            <li> I do feel like my skin looks more youthful and</li>
            <li> I feel better about myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li> When we use fillers, they fill the wrinkles in on the top layer but these mask wrinkles rather than treat them at the source.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many products, however, I have not had any adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels softer, looks smoother, and seems to retain moisture better.</li>
            <li> The acne is 75% better.</li>
            <li> I really love the teraputics phytoceramides, I am in my 50s ,I have used them before so</li>
            <li> This is impressive to me because it means that they believe in their product, back it up, and stay in contact with the client.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very excited about this product.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good though!  </li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> top of being more effective than wheat or sweet potato derived Phytoceramides, these are gluten free as well</li>
            <li> I am so excited to receive my bottle of Phytoceramides!</li>
            <li> Wow an incredible product my face feels tighter smooth</li>
            <li> I have noticed that when i started using the product my fine lines began to diminish and i feel so much better about myself.</li>
            <li> so am pleased that this product is gluten free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the phytoceramides so far.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I experienced an unexpected benefit from using this product.</li>
            <li> but i am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> and I love the free gift I received.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t experienced a real noticeable improvement yet, but I will continue taking it for 2 months to see if its full effect will be perceptible.</li>
            <li> I picked this brand because the bottle really stood out to me and they had a good price.</li>
            <li> But, overall, this product has been really good for my skin!</li>
            <li> Not bad!</li>
            <li> I received the package very quickly and on time.</li>
            <li> my skin is easily reactive and immediately shows signs of dehydration.  </li>
            <li> great quick shipping, &amp; decent price point.</li>
            <li> There are easy to take, easy to swallow capsules that keep my skin</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I am also encouraged to drink more water now, to get the full effect of the phytoceramides.  </li>
            <li> I finished a bottle and noticed reduced lines and a softer texture, but I think I need to give it more than a month to see full results, so I&#x27;m going to order another bottle.  </li>
            <li> It takes skin a full month or more to &amp;#34;turn over&amp;#34; so I know I have to be patient.</li>
            <li> Studies have proven that Phytoceramides can increase moisture retention in your skin, which drastically affects the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fine lines and wrinkles I had are gone or fading away.</li>
            <li> Without a question, fine lines around my eyes seemed to disappear and the creases in my forehead softened.  </li>
            <li> I use them in conjunction with Vitamin C serum and an excellent moisturizer, and the bags under my eyes have become less puffy and pronounced and are continuing to smooth out.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays in place, my nails are less brittle, my wrinkles are greatly reduced, and since I look better I feel much better as well.</li>
            <li> Huge difference in my skin texture and tone.</li>
            <li> I noticed huge improvement with her skin after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> By May 1 my colleagues at the school where I teach began to tell me how great I was looking, and visiting, long-graduated students home for the summer from college commented on how I looked &amp;quot;younger&amp;quot; than they remembered, and that whatever it was that I was doing differently, to keep doing it!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Also this product is produced in an FDA-registered lab, which is important.</li>
            <li> I really honestly did not expect much from taking this supplement but have noticed a gradual improvement with my skin ever since I started taking it.</li>
            <li> I plan to take this for a few months so that I can get absolutely perfect skin.</li>
            <li> Today makes my third day on it ,  and I am looking forward to great results.  </li>
            <li> So thankful for a free bottle.  </li>
            <li> After reading such great reviews, my wife and I wanted to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I took these capsules for 60 days (I took advantage of the free bottle offer that came with my order).  </li>
            <li> I chose this product because I am gluten intolerant, and needed a gluten free phytoceramide.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free by the way.</li>
            <li> - 100% Gluten Free</li>
            <li> That was my primary concern when I bought them.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with my skin and use them in conjunction with topical Vitamin</li>
            <li> Liked e mail notifications,  fast delivery and  an information pamphlet about this</li>
            <li> so when I saw this was gluten free, I had to try it.</li>
            <li> but I wanted the free bottle which required I write the review before I saw the results.</li>
            <li> which is important to the growing percent of the population who suffer from wheat allergies.</li>
            <li> My own daughter asked yesterday what I was doing to make my skin glow so much.  </li>
            <li> This is one product that definitely gives great results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing I have tried has helped to get rid of my acne that effectively or that fast.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free so that I can try it out.</li>
            <li> I did research before ordering, and this product contained all of the essentials that were stated in articles as important to have in phytoceramide supplements.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I decided to go ahead and choose this particular brand because of the amazing price and that they seem legit.</li>
            <li> in mind that healthy, beautiful, natural-looking skin should look plump and firm ...</li>
            <li> I am excited to see the result sinceI still use it</li>
            <li> So excited use this.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> so excited what whould be d result.</li>
            <li> This is is not an original product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to see what will happen in another 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited to see what will happen in another 3-6 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how this progresses.</li>
            <li> I have been using Phytoceramides for almost 2 years now and it has made a significant change in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks already and my skin really change more bright and soft.</li>
            <li> Am just getting started and I am so excited.</li>
            <li> Be sure your consistent when taking theses pills.</li>
            <li> My husband and i have been using this product for about a month now and both of us have been seeing a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased so far with this product.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin or you&#x27;re concerned about signs of aging - this supplement might be of great help to you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;rice-based phytoceramides - such as teraputics - are demonstrated to be more effective than their wheat-based counterparts&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since then, my skin is much more radiant, clear, and has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> capsules are easy to swallow, and they are certainly gluten-free (or I would know about it!).  </li>
            <li> Overall my skin looks good.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I am doing good for my body, and my future appearance/</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it worked honestly.</li>
            <li> I’m glad I chose to give this product a chance because my skin is so much healthier looking now</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t upset stomach and actually makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> I have gotten such compliments on how good my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> The capsules are easy to take and my skin is soft and I do not have many wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Even people at my work for no apparent reason would tell me that I look really good for some reason and they can&#x27;t quite put their finger on it.</li>
            <li> In effect, I have healthier skin and fine lines don&#x27;t concern me as much!</li>
            <li> but I am one of the lucky ones.  </li>
            <li> However, don’t let me and that yellow dog influence your own determination as to precisely in which of the two photo</li>
            <li> As we still have two more bottles to use from our initial order, we are anticipating seeing even better things happen.  </li>
            <li> I also received this bottle for free so that was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> skin is severely damaged as a result of using oral minoxidil (not the commonly-used topical form, but the considerably more potent pill form), which has the undocumented side-effect of suppressing the body&#x27;s ability to produce collagen&lt;</li>
            <li> Now a month later, my face is getting more and more blemish free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just received this product and so far so good as Teraputics responded to my order very efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I got it quick and the company has quick follow up.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and I also got a coupon for another bottle free.  </li>
            <li> To add another note, we did research and review other wheat based phytoceramides prior to purchasing this one and decided this product is the best we found among them, as well as being gluten free.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more soft and looks more vibrant.</li>
            <li> The labeling is very professional and it comes in a very beautiful little box.</li>
            <li> was excited to receive my first bottle of Teraputics Phytoceramides and began using faithfully on March 1.  </li>
            <li> This appears to be the best of the three, yet as the formula for all of the gluten-free ceramides appears to be exactly the same and the manufacturing process appears to be the same, I  wonder if I am kidding myself.  </li>
            <li> After years of eating whatever, tanning, etc; I&#x27;m now committed to living a more healthy lifestyle; exercising, eating natural foods, and this supplement will be a continued part of my new routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big believer in most supplements, but I&#x27;m a huge believer in the results I&#x27;m seeing from taking Phytoceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It took 60 years to get my skin at this point and in this condition, and if I saw improvements in even six months, then that would truly be miraculous and worth the money and effort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly worth</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> The catalyst for this was finding out about phytoceramides and how they can help keep your skin moist and fresh.</li>
            <li> my skin is fresh and...</li>
            <li> Of course youthful unblemished skin will make you look better.</li>
            <li> After 1 month, my skin appears far more well hydrated throughout the day...</li>
            <li> well worth the try.</li>
            <li> Do not look as tired and my coloring is great!!!!!!!!!!!.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don’t think I’d have ever believed that these phytoceramides actually work if I hadn’t seen it for myself.</li>
            <li> I just started using it, so we will see in a couple weeks what the results will be, but their customer service thus far has made me feel confident I bought the right brand.</li>
            <li> If you want to look younger and more vibrant and better looking.....</li>
            <li> I not only see positive changes, but looking better again has helped me feel more confident enough to get out and socialize more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am so excited to finish the whole bottle and purchase it again!!!Q!Q</li>
            <li> One a day is good since I take other supplements</li>
            <li> ’s right, put your glasses on, and then go get somebody else to come over here and decide with you, so as to do this judging thing democratically right.</li>
            <li> Love it - skin is smooth, soft, clear!</li>
            <li> most appropriate old axiom to the present occasion at hand as follows:</li>
            <li> It make my skin fresh and my skin crisp.</li>
            <li> Anxious to use and see great results.</li>
            <li> I’ve been trying to stick to gluten free products and foods for a while now in an attempt to live a healthier lifestyle</li>
            <li> I dont experience rashes or allergy its natural and easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> but I definitely wil continue to keep ordering great results and the price is ridiculously low.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been so dry that it just won’t hold any kind of moisture at all</li>
            <li> so anything that makes my day easier and gives me the same or better results is definitely worth</li>
            <li> You will see the new you with a baby face!!!</li>
            <li> Though, what actually sold me was when my research kept indicating that phytoceremide, derived from rice, was more easily absorbed into the body’s cell structure than phytoceremide derived from only wheat.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, after ordering and using just one bottle (a one month’s supply) of your rice-derived phytoceremide capsules, the tighter, plumper, fuller, rosier, and much more youthful looking skin emerging on my face and neck was all the damn research I needed.</li>
            <li> So I reviewed many companies and products, and settled on Teraputics due to the extremely high number of satisfied customers who saw results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All Natural Plant Derived Vitamin Extract, Skin Restoring Skincare Oral Supplement, Eliminates Wrinkles, Reduces Fine Lines, Strengthens Hair Skin Nails, 30 Veggie Caps,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably too early to see a change in fine wrinkles, but I&#x27;ll continue to take the product to allow enough time to reap its many benefits.</li>
            <li> My skin really not too amazing</li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> Thank you Thank you, Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> ok so I have only been using this product for 1/2 month</li>
            <li> The product was delivered as promised, fast and efficient!</li>
            <li> Thanks Teraputics!</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I am starting to see a more even skin tone</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have to say that they work almost exactly as they claim they will...</li>
            <li> so I knew this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> it seems to be a better quality than similar products.  </li>
            <li> All of the formulations leave the skin feeling softer and more hydrated, especially the legs.  </li>
            <li> It definitely does not irritate my system like many vitamins do.</li>
            <li> I first heard about ceramides on the Dr. Oz show and decided to go ahead and try it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase and intend to continue using these as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> It worked exactly as I was told it would.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in the first week.</li>
            <li> Phytoceramides are 100% all natural, made in the USA , and are gluten free since they&#x27;re rice derived.</li>
            <li> The product is okay after one bottle so let&#x27;s see what happens next.</li>
            <li> Will continue taking and update this with more information later</li>
            <li> You will see a difference within the first week of using this product.</li>
            <li> Just took my first one.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see wat the future holds, but for now I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> and I love that I can finally get them affordably instead of buying overpriced ones from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I will post again after the next couple of months looking for more results on my hands and face.</li>
            <li> The specific reason that I wanted to try your brand was the fact that I discovered that, unlike the other brands which were made from wheat, the phytoceremide in your capsules was derived from rice which my exhaustive Internet research (you can be exhaustive when your retired and there’s nothing better to do) indicated that phytoceremide, derived from rice, was superior to that produced from wheat in several important respects.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of positive reviews about it.</li>
            <li> These Ceramides seem to be working though there is no dramatic change.  </li>
            <li> Take your time Don’t make your final determination and selection simply as the naturally biased manufacturers of the wonderfully effective phytoceremide product that produced this remarkably handsome, garrulously talkative, sexy, and youthful looking face, which is wrapped around a rather big, horsey-looking smile and plastered onto and covering what is, in all truth and fact, a nearly 70 year old visage --- but rather make and pick your choice as the honest, objective, unbiased (well, I guess you can strike that last word, anyway)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way but so far so good.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, has more moisture, less lines around my eyes, lip, laugh and forehead lines.  </li>
            <li> I’ve been taking this for a month but the lines on my face have softened a little and my skin is kind of lighter and smoother</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and I am aware that it may not work for everyone</li>
            <li> , I ask you, to consider for just a moment the better of the two photos enclosed, which even a yellow dog could tell would clearly be the “after” photo, which was taken a month ago after using your fine , rice-based product for only three months.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> I have always had very oily skin and over the years I have been seeing an increase of sun and age spots.  </li>
            <li> So I had no expectations for miracles straight out of the gate, or box, if you will.  </li>
            <li> I never really had that many wrinkles</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Well after only a week of taking these capsules I saw my skin tighten up, my wrinkles smooth out, and my skin became almost brighter.</li>
            <li> Ready to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This phytocermide was high recommended!</li>
            <li> I do also use topical hyaluronic acid and light therapy on my face, so I can&#x27;t say which of these treatments is making the difference.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important to know because there have been numerous studies that show 40mg of rice derived Phytoceramides</li>
            <li> I am very encouraged and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and I noticed it’s not shedding that much in the shower anymore</li>
            <li> My skin has tightened up, especially along my jawline, on my cheeks, and my neck and my skin is so smooth to touch.</li>
            <li> She transformed in front of my very eyes.</li>
            <li> and I am curious to see how much more it could do.</li>
            <li> Delivered very timely and product is as stated.  </li>
            <li> Skin is much softer and moisturized.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> or since it is added it would be better to use a natural source rather than the synthetic form that is currently used.</li>
            <li> It seems like my skin has actually become softer and more clear.</li>
            <li> Absolutely noticed a significant difference in my skin after finishing the bottle--the improvements were obvious.  </li>
            <li> So what more can I say other than why don&#x27;t you just try these phytoceramides if you really want something that works.</li>
            <li> After two weeks let me just say that my skin has cleared up completely, my hair stopped falling out as much, my hair feels stronger, the dark circles under my eyes are almost gone, and I feel amazing about all of this.</li>
            <li> I truly have not taken it long enough to give an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> The wheat-based phytoceramides actually made the deep wrinkles on my face more pronounced and made me look older, so perhaps I have a gluten sensitivity I wasn&#x27;t previously aware of.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines associated with dry skin started freaking me out about a year ago.</li>
            <li> We are only in the initial phase, but still, we give this product a top rating because we are excited about the future results!  </li>
            <li> First I want to say however that there weren&#x27;t any side effects at all, the pill would just completely pass through my body.</li>
            <li> I am new to phytoceramides!  </li>
            <li> This is first time I used this product, it&#x27;s been only five days, but I can clearly that see my skin is more even and brighter, it definitely works!</li>
            <li> Even the creases on my forehead are now less prominent.</li>
            <li> and my complexion is more even and less sallow, and I have not has any acne to speak of.</li>
            <li> Please remember to have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> Please remember to have realistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> Now, if it is a women in your office who is reading this letter, then please, don‘t be like my older sister</li>
            <li> (she’s 76, going on 212, so she knows everything) and try and tell me that men my age don’t care about their looks as they get older.</li>
            <li> I also started giving one a day to my husband who is 5 years older than me and who had some pronounced creasing in his forehead as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing that just a simple little pill can mask the symptoms of aging so well.</li>
            <li> as an important part of a broad, systemic approach in an attempt to increase my body&#x27;s collagen production and repair as much of the oral minoxidil-induced damage as possible</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I feel they are a high quality brand.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One other problem is that my friend tried these phytoceramides too and they didn&#x27;t have such an amazing effect on her.</li>
            <li> I just have to give it a little more time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it a little more to give it some more time to have some effect, but after a few weeks of using it and nothing, I&#x27;m losing my faith.    </li>
            <li> I am very conscientious about my skin and natural anti aging</li>
            <li> and I am pleasantly surprised about the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, my skin appeared healthier, more even toned.  </li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t drink any alcohol for a few days it gets even better.</li>
            <li> I can deinitely give this product a confident 5 stars and have already recommended it to my sister and a few friends.</li>
            <li> For the first week I barely felt any difference</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks after I began taking Phytoceramides I noticed more fullness to my cheeks, and a visible reduction in the sagging at the jowls.</li>
            <li> No side effects, arrived quickly and since they aren&#x27;t huge pills like some supplements, they aren&#x27;t so hard to swallow.</li>
            <li> It seems as if my skin repairs itself more rapidly and with less to zero scarring!</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have done nothing extraordinary, beyond soap and water and a basic moisturizing body lotion to care for my face.  </li>
            <li> i recently became single again and was looking for ways to look better so i can attract some women.</li>
            <li> “One can only rightly conclude, based strictly on the evidence before us, that the proof of the phytoceremide, unlike the proverbial pudding, is not in the ‘ tasting’ but in the ‘looking’,…n’est pas?”ent occasion at hand as follows:</li>

            <li> after one month using  Phytoceramides , I notice my nails become hard and my skin looks fresh and fine lines diminished.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that people interested in adding a bit of youth back into their skin give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that people interested in adding a bit of youth back into their skin give it a try.  </li>
            <li> this is a new one for me</li>
            <li> When you apply a cream, it sinks in to the top layer of skin and perhaps the second layer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different creams, serums, dermarolling, and facial-flex with minimal results.</li>
            <li> I am 73 years and have always had dryer skin, especially on my legs,  I have been taking this  product  for 30 days and am amazed at how smooth  my entire body feels, I also notice a difference on my face, I  look forward to seeing additional benefits from this product</li>
            <li> and I am very surprised with my results.</li>
            <li> Am using it in conjunction with Mad Hippy skin care products which also work great, and the combination seems to be really working.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that 40mg is equal to the 350mg in the wheat product</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what other changes are going to take place as I continue using this product.</li>
            <li> A rice based skin supplement is hard to find as many of them are made with wheat so that was one of the reasons I chose this particular brand.</li>
            <li> I have&#x27;t been using it one 1 day, but after reading other reviews I am excited to begin and cannot wait to see result.</li>
            <li> and I’m anxious to see even more as time goes on.</li>
            <li> #34;You look younger than you do when I first met you!&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> There are other factors that have most likely contributed, but this stuff has been part of the equation.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend, especially to women struggling with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Now, so as not to drag this testimony from New York to South Georgia, just let me say that I think the two un-retouched photos ( one before and one after) that I’ve included as an attachment to this email pretty much says it all.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Every single summer my skin dries out very quickly and wrinkles form on my face that were simply not there before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old and live in the desert</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and had recently started contemplating my getting Botox for the first time.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a short period of time, maybe it&#x27;s all in my head, but I swear I am seeing positive results.</li>
            <li> trying several different brands of phytoceremide and all with fair to moderate success as far as results go, I finally got around to ordering your product to try just a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything more than a minor visual improvement with any of the brands, but I have not been regular about taking the supplements either.  </li>
            <li> I find myself touching my face throughout the day because it feels so different than it did previously.</li>
            <li> The instructions were plain and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> After taking them for a little over two months I continued to see those positive changes getting more pronounced, and my face was definitely still filling back out.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt whatsoever that I am now seeing some pretty dramatic results for my own personal skin type and condition.  </li>
            <li> There is no doubt whatsoever that I am now seeing some pretty dramatic results for my own personal skin type and condition.  </li>
            <li> had a little bit of acne when I first started taking this and within the first week, it had started to clear up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive results: smoother skin and more importantly, no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> so, in your final, closing statement, concerning this whole matter, I think you would probably agree to state out loud and say along with me ----</li>
            <li> (and they clear up after I take a Zantac for allergies).</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this product a try as I will be turning 50 years young this year.  </li>
            <li> Within 24 hours, I was pleasantly surprised to find my skin and hair were not oily.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles have reduced and the lines on my face have almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe something that is all natural could work so well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue taking this product for at least 6 more months</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old man with all sorts of splotches and blotches.</li>
            <li> So I am ready to buy another bottle to see how much younger could I look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old woman in her 50&#x27;s and my skin is just falling apart.</li>
            <li> , it feels really soft and I have fewer lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> My co-workers keep telling me that I look much younger than my real age.  </li>
            <li> I specifically purchased from this company because the product is all natural and made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> I am currently on some medication that really dries out my hair and skin, and this product is helping me manage those side effects.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, I&#x27;ve only used once.</li>
            <li> Early days yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking Phytoceramides for nearly six months now, so I can share a bit about how well these have worked for me so far.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a complete review based on the length of time I have been using the Phytoceramides.  </li>
            <li> I finished the product which took one month and didn&#x27;t notice anything different about my skin... Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> so I will respond after the 30 days are complete</li>
            <li> Really noticed a difference in overall skin quality.  </li>
            <li> and it was a small easy to swallow pill</li>
            <li> It took about a week before I noticed that my skin wasn’t as dry anymore, and now almost 1 month in, my skin is soft and smooth and there aren’t any dry patches anywhere anymore.</li>
            <li> I feel like a whole new person because my skin is moist and has a softness it hasn’t had in a very long time.</li>
            <li> Seeing small but beneficial improvement to the fine lines...</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin isn’t nearly as dry as it was, my crow’s feet have faded a little bit, and my complexion is more even than it was.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be reordering this product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> All the little, fine lines above my lips are gone!</li>
            <li> Some of my fine lines seem to be fading a little, especially the &amp;#34;eleven&amp;#34; wrinkles between my eyebrows, and the wrinkles across my forehead.</li>
            <li> Re ordering more today as I only have a few pills left</li>
            <li> After a little more than a month the bagginess under my eyes was cleared up, and the toothpick lines at the bridge of my nose were harder to see.</li>
            <li> Everybody is different but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try something new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even noticed that my heels which get quite dry are much improved.  </li>
            <li> Both our skin is feeling much smoother and not as dry or itchy that it was.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of topical treatments, which have only helped so far.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t wait to order them again, my skin looks and feels very soft and creamy especially on my legs.</li>
            <li> I mean…after all…mine is the face of responsibility: I’ve got several women depending on this face and that smile to bring a little extra-curricular joy into their lives --- not all at the same time, mind you, but rather each on a different day of the week --- that is, if I’m not too awfully tired from my services to the others earlier in the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I believe my fine lines are less visible, after only a short time using this product.  </li>
            <li> , I find it usually takes a minimum of 30 days to see definitive results with any supplement--but I definitely noticed softer skin, improved glow and better overall skin clarity.  </li>
            <li> I also liked that there were no digestive issues with Teraputic&#x27;s Phytoceramides nor any other type of negative reaction whatsoever, I find wheat based harsher on the digestion.  </li>
            <li> Within two weeks, his age lines also softened significantly and he looks quite a few years younger!  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a supplement that would restore the moisture in my skin that was left pretty dry after the laser peel and photofacial, and this is the answer!</li>
            <li> The results are positive and I agree with the other reviews that say give it time.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the results and will continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> The difference is quite apparent.</li>
            <li> so I have no plans to discontinue using this product in the near future.</li>
            <li> They would always be so brittle but lo and behold they barely ever chip now.</li>
            <li> I think it is too early to see results, I am trusting they will come with the second bottle.  </li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t have any comments, positive or negative, to offer.</li>
            <li> I really saw a difference on the back of my hands--they tend to get very dry, they became glowier and smoother also.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been transformed from dry, scaly, dull skin to amazingly soft, smooth, youthful skin.  </li>
            <li> I give this one the highest rating thus far as they provide a pamphlet that gives you information that others don&#x27;t; such as.... take at the same time every day, give it 6-8 weeks, drink water.  </li>
            <li> I have been using phytoceramides for a while now and my skin is not dry anymore</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any major results, that is why I&#x27;ve only giving it 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I just received my order today, and am very hopeful that I will experience the same results that other reviewers have had.  </li>
            <li> specific situation is somewhat unusual and extreme, and i intend to continue using teraputics phytoceramides because i believe it&#x27;s a quality product and a valuable component in my efforts</li>
            <li> At 57 never expected to see such improvement!</li>
            <li> I am still anxious to see if this will reduce the deeper smile lines after taking them longer.</li>
            <li> approaching June 1, I continue to receive comments from folks young and old that I &amp;quot;sure am wearing my age well,&amp;quot; and that I look nothing like other women they know in their 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> Since I started taking these, my skin all over is nowhere near as dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, taking a tablet is far less hassle than a daily half-hour routine of expensive skin creams, scrubs, rubs, massages and more!</li>
            <li> I have no new breakouts and my old scars are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> i was very surprise that in a little time my face looks younger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long three weeks for me as I try to make myself look a little better than usual.</li>
            <li> I was just told the other day that I was a very young  looking 65.</li>
            <li> so I have nothing good or bad to say.</li>
            <li> After three weeks my skin barely feels dry.</li>
            <li> You WILL see results!d old that I &amp;quot;sure am wearing my age well,&amp;quot; and that I look nothing like other women they know in their 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> Additionally, I had always looked young for my age but had lost that due to an illness.  </li>
            <li> I  have been using for approximately three weeks - I have gotten such compliments on how good my skn looks and EVEN I - (as we all are our worst critic) see an astounding difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Since I have not changed my skincare products for awhile (nothing new) in quite a few months I must say this definitely adds something.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I spent an entire year trying all sorts of hocus pocus skincare treatments and wasted so much time.</li>
            <li> so I have only have been using this product for three weeks but have noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t seem as dry as has been and the crinkles around my eyes are not as noticeable as they were as well as the pillow lines across my cheek bones.</li>
            <li> My name is Doc Edwards, and I’ve been a convert to your phytoceremide product’ for nearly four and a half months now.</li>
            <li> I generally take one capsule each morning with a full glass of water about 20 - 30 minutes before mealtime, and I haven&#x27;t had any ill effects</li>
            <li> Additionally, historically, in the winter, my skin gets exceedingly dry, all over my body...beyond alligator.  </li>
            <li> The process for me was very simple, I just took 1 capsule every single morning with</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my legs and elbows, as well as stretch marks from my second pregnancy, and I&#x27;m hoping that this product will do something to re-hydrate my skin!  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is a lot less dry</li>
            <li> But did it clear up a few wrinkles, bumps, and abrasions?</li>
            <li> update you about tge long time effects!&lt;br /&gt;Judith</li>
            <li> Since I have been taking the phytoceramids, I have  noticed that overall my body skin is softer and  requires less topical moisturizing.</li>
            <li> After only about 20 days of use the results that I can see are pretty dramatic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I will see the same results mentioned by other customers.  </li>
            <li> People are again taking me for younger, which could well be due to the phytoceramides.  </li>
            <li> Of course it does not hurt to follow the other recommendations, to drink plenty of water, to eat properly, sleep, and exercise.  </li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles, crow&#x27;s feet, dry skin etc.</li>
            <li> It took about a month to see the effects and, when I stopped taking it, I found my dry skin returned within 2 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> but I can tell my skin is not as dry.</li>
            <li> I have heard from TV personalities over the years that Phytoceramides are to be a &amp;#34;Facelift in a Bottle.&amp;#34; The main ingredient in Plant-Derived Ceramides replenishes the ceramides that your skin loses over time.</li>
            <li> food.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that definitely speed things along and lock in my progress is washing my face a few times a day especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> While my skin did look as though it had improved, it&#x27;s hard to judge how much of that improvement was due to this product versus an improved skin-care regimen that included Vitamins A, E and hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s just say that now, when I look at myself critically in the mirror, I am without question beginning to notice, especially around the eyes and mouth, a dramatic softening of lines, and my skin feels as soft as a newborn&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s just say that now, when I look at myself critically in the mirror, I am without question beginning to notice, especially around the eyes and mouth, a dramatic softening of lines, and my skin feels as soft as a newborn&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> so I bought this brand for no particular reason.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it had less or &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; added vitamins ...</li>
            <li> I would especially appreciate less vitamin A....</li>
            <li> are less deep, skin are defiantly fresher, tighter!</li>
            <li> but my skin is always so very dry.</li>
            <li> I even tried a few other brands of phytoceramides and had barely any results.</li>
            <li> it has been a little over a month since i began taking this product and my complexion has definitely cleared up.</li>
            <li> So far, we have been using it less than one month, so we cannot claim any future benefits, but my wife says she sees some subtle improvement of her skin, (smoothing) and</li>
            <li> He truly believes he is seeing them fade from using the product for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but it delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> I thought about buying this for a few months and decided to finally do it.</li>
            <li> When you start taking these capsules you will feel the effects after only a few days.</li>
            <li> I will update my review in a few weeks after I try a second bottle.</li>
            <li> The product arrived when I expected it.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 30 days before I expected to see a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using them for a few days</li>
            <li> No adverse Side effects except rings are harder to take off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to say there might be Subtle changes if anything, so I&#x27;m not sure it works -</li>
            <li> My skin is less dry, less red, and less itchy.</li>
            <li> My skin already seems less dry after just a week.</li>
            <li> My skin has become lighter and softer and less dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is less dry and it plumps up my face.</li>
            <li> What can i say other than the mirror speaks for itself</li>
            <li> I have extreme gluten sensitivity</li>
            <li> If you are a middle-aged woman (or man) with wrinkles forming on your face due to weather or to age, I suggest you try phytoceramides.</li>
            <li> Have tried this and 2 other brands.  </li>
            <li> To me, there is no question that taking Phytoceramides helps to improve and even reverse the root causes of wrinkles and other signs of aging, so I intend to continue taking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me, there is no question that taking Phytoceramides helps to improve and even reverse the root causes of wrinkles and other signs of aging, so I intend to continue taking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I ran out so after researching other brands</li>
            <li> I have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin after using the other brand</li>
            <li> Hoping to see some skin tightening ...will check back in  a few months to report in!</li>
            <li> Like that it has the other vitamins and they give you a getting started guide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking Phytoceramides for 2 weeks and already notice the small bumps on my arms have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I developed the most horrible rash on my face and neck while taking this product.</li>
            <li> so I started taking this to see if it would help with my dry skin and also reduce the few wrinkles I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had a sallow, uneven complexion with dark under-eye circles for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I previously had tried other products but nothing has compared to Teraputics Phytocermides.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews unless a product is stellar or horrific.  </li>
            <li> at least 10 yrs younger</li>
            <li> I am trying  a second bottle and then stopping because that is usually when I notice something is missing.</li>
            <li> but then I noticed my hands were not as dry as they would usually be.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s less efffective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking them for about a month and have noticed a slight change in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it less than a month</li>
            <li> but they’re less noticeable than they were before.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my nails are stronger and less prone to cracking.</li>
            <li> Because of sun my wrinkles form much harder than it usually be.</li>
            <li> My complexion was a bit sallow, yet after just a few weeks of taking Teraputics Phytoceramides, my skin is both softer and pinker, plus the two dark spots on my face are noticeably fading.</li>
            <li> are taking a little longer because they were deeper lines</li>
            <li> My skin improved a little</li>
            <li> Maybe a little in the skin too.</li>
            <li> Now, after having done nothing special to my skin for all these years,  I knew that I wasn&#x27;t going to see any dramatic (read: unrealistic) results in 2,</li>
            <li> In a few days I noticed my skin had cleared up just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I take one everyday and drink lots of water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been just a few weeks since I began taking these pills</li>
            <li> in a few weeks time--and will report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I started taking two capsules everyday.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I&#x27;ll do an update on how it&#x27;s going</li>
            <li> My wife took these pills for a few weeks and wanted me to write this review.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within a few weeks of using Phytoceramides.  </li>
            <li> The small lines on my face have decreased so I look so much younger.  </li>
            <li> If it works, don&#x27;t mess with it!</li>
            <li> I was beginning to get a few comments from folks when I was out with my three small grandchildren who were mistakenly thought to be my CHILDREN.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works yet.  </li>
            <li> For those who are skeptical, my husband has the same oily skin as I do</li>
            <li> Of course I was skeptical but it actually did have an effect on me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> He suffers from skin marks generally called liver spots.  </li>
            <li> I suffered ( past tense now) from hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> Hard to say.</li>
            <li> The manual suggests to wait at least 8-12 weeks to observe results.  </li>
            <li> I committed to at least six months.  </li>
            <li> These phytoceramides have allowed me to put off that track, at least for a while.  </li>
            <li> I will give it at least a month to determine if it has an impact on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> my splotchy spots, weird bumps are being reduced everyday.</li>
            <li> and my face does not look tired and feels tighter.</li>
            <li> But... I am confused.  </li>
            <li> My allergist informed me that I am deficient or lacking of a filagrin gene.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the research and science behind LE articles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for approximately 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pills are odorless and do not upset my stomach (and I have a very weak stomach).</li>
            <li> I will say I was somewhat skeptical and already spend quite a bit of money on vitamins and skin care but wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I am sorry</li>
            <li> Before I started taking them, I was suffering from a bad case of contact dermatitis/eczema.  </li>
            <li> My bad mistake...</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> From the reviews that I have read it sounds like I wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> They have helped--I can now wash my hands with soap and water without disastrous consequences!  </li>
            <li> I have gluten sensitivities, none of the nasty gluten side effects I always experience.  </li>

            <li> This product is something that I never thought of coming across! All the little, fine lines above my lips are gone! The ones I had from smoking (I quit for two years now) are taking a little longer because they were deeper lines but they&#x27;re almost gone too. I&#x27;ve been taking this supplement for one month now and I can&#x27;t believe the results!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I was surprised by the results and will continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> What can i say other than the mirror speaks for itself</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  My skin has been transformed from dry, scaly, dull skin to amazingly soft, smooth, youthful skin.  My skin looks better than it has in decades.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I trust this product. I recommend it to my friends. I am excited to see the result sinceI still use it</li>
            <li> I think rice is a good substitute for wheat phytoceraimides.  Just be aware that 40mg is equal to the 350mg in the wheat product so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s less efffective.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I saw an improvement and softness to my face and hands within 2 weeks.  I am getting alot of compliments from people that haven&#x27;t seen me in awhile.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Heard good things about this product from a friend. My friend has a acne prone skin and her acne seemed disappearing. So excited use this.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the product so far. I  was out of  town  for awhile so I have only have been using this product for three weeks but have noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t seem as dry as has been and the crinkles around my eyes are not as noticeable as they were as well as the pillow lines across my cheek bones. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results from three months of continuous use.</li>
            <li> Fast service! I just received the product and I&#x27;m looking forward to good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using your product for about 2 months now.  I am very conscientious about my skin and natural anti aging options.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I head about Phytoceramides and wanted to give it a try.  I will say I was somewhat skeptical and already spend quite a bit of money on vitamins and skin care but wanted to give it a try. The next step was  which brand should I use?  After doing my research I decided on Teraputics.  I feel they are a high quality brand. I will say that I have been very happy.  Overall my skin looks good.  I&#x27;ve even noticed that my heels which get quite dry are much improved.  This was a wonderful unexpected surprise!  I will continue to purchase this product as I am a believer and a bit vain when it comes to my looks!</li>
            <li> I have heard from TV personalities over the years that Phytoceramides are to be a &amp;#34;Facelift in a Bottle.&amp;#34; The main ingredient in Plant-Derived Ceramides replenishes the ceramides that your skin loses over time. Studies have proven that Phytoceramides can increase moisture retention in your skin, which drastically affects the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started taking Phytoceramides, and am eager to see what benefits I gain from them. I feel like I am doing good for my body, and my future appearance/health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a savings price, or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. Yours may differ from mine.</li>
            <li> This is first time I used this product, it&#x27;s been only five days, but I can clearly that see my skin is more even and brighter, it definitely works!</li>
            <li> My husband is actually the person taking the product.  He suffers from skin marks generally called liver spots.  He truly believes he is seeing them fade from using the product for only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Just started using it but it delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> this is a new one for me so it is working I just have to give it a little more time</li>
            <li> So excited to find this awesome great product! It&#x27;s 21 days today and following the instructions and can&#x27;t wait ! Thank you Thank you, Thank you so much! A.T.</li>
            <li> Great product that lives up to its promise of softer improved skin.</li>
            <li> ok so I have only been using this product for 1/2 month but I do notice a difference in my skin. Since I have not changed my skincare products for awhile (nothing new) in quite a few months I must say this definitely adds something. I notice my skin is smoother-almost has a glow to it and my face does not look tired and feels tighter. I will be 57 but I have to say-don&#x27;t look it (even though I feel it-lol).&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing again before I run out.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works yet.  I&#x27;ve only been using it about two weeks.  The manual suggests to wait at least 8-12 weeks to observe results.  I have very dry skin on my legs and elbows, as well as stretch marks from my second pregnancy, and I&#x27;m hoping that this product will do something to re-hydrate my skin!  I am hopeful!</li>
            <li> I just received the product on time. And im using d product 1 week now and im so excited what whould be d result. I dont experience rashes or allergy its natural and easy to swallow. Thank u for this product looking forward.....</li>
            <li> I just received the product so I have nothing good or bad to say. I am however very optimistic about it since reading all the great reviews on this product. I will come back and give an update on my results with this product!</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this product a try as I will be turning 50 years young this year.  I have always had very oily skin and over the years I have been seeing an increase of sun and age spots.  When I received my order in the mail, I didn&#x27;t hesitate but took the dosage required.  Within 24 hours, I was pleasantly surprised to find my skin and hair were not oily.  Within a few days, my skin appeared healthier, more even toned.  I highly recommend this product and I am aware that it may not work for everyone but I am one of the lucky ones.  For those who are skeptical, my husband has the same oily skin as I do and so I told him about the product.  He thought he would give it a try and to his surprise it worked.  We both are sold on phytoceramides.  Thanks for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Just received the pills.  The box was damaged and pills were not sealed.  This is is not an original product.  See the pictures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;m getting with Teraputics Phytoceramides.  I use them in conjunction with Vitamin C serum and an excellent moisturizer, and the bags under my eyes have become less puffy and pronounced and are continuing to smooth out.  I&#x27;m 67, so these are pretty&lt;br /&gt;phenomenal results.  When I don&#x27;t drink any alcohol for a few days it gets even better.</li>
            <li> Wow an incredible product my face feels tighter smooth i was very surprise that in a little time my face looks younger. Thank you for this miracle pills.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Takes about 4 weeks to start noticing the difference. Use this in conjunction with hyaluronic acid and you will have great looking skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to say there might be Subtle changes if anything, so I&#x27;m not sure it works - I&#x27;ll try it a little more to give it some more time to have some effect, but after a few weeks of using it and nothing, I&#x27;m losing my faith.    Update:  Still no changes</li>
            <li> The product was delivered as promised, fast and efficient! I am looking forward to the benefits of using this product. TY</li>
            <li> I just started taking this so its too soon to tell how effective it will be for me but a friend has been using this for a while and has been really pleased with the improvements in her skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews unless a product is stellar or horrific.  In this case, I&#x27;d like to write a wonderful review for Teraputics Phytoceramides.  I have used the product for three months and just ordered my fourth bottle.  I am 60 years old and have done nothing extraordinary, beyond soap and water and a basic moisturizing body lotion to care for my face.  I now try to prevent sun damage, but will admit to tans and burns in my younger days.  Last winter I happened upon an article on skin care in one&#x27;s 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.  Phytoceramides were promoted as a way to improve the overall health and appearance of aging skin without resorting to a face lift. I did my research, read reviews, and decided to give it a go.  Now, after having done nothing special to my skin for all these years,  I knew that I wasn&#x27;t going to see any dramatic (read: unrealistic) results in 2, 3 or even 4 weeks time.  So I had no expectations for miracles straight out of the gate, or box, if you will.  I committed to at least six months.  It took 60 years to get my skin at this point and in this condition, and if I saw improvements in even six months, then that would truly be miraculous and worth the money and effort. So I reviewed many companies and products, and settled on Teraputics due to the extremely high number of satisfied customers who saw results.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to receive my first bottle of Teraputics Phytoceramides and began using faithfully on March 1.  By April 1 I was beginning to get a few comments from folks when I was out with my three small grandchildren who were mistakenly thought to be my CHILDREN. By May 1 my colleagues at the school where I teach began to tell me how great I was looking, and visiting, long-graduated students home for the summer from college commented on how I looked &amp;quot;younger&amp;quot; than they remembered, and that whatever it was that I was doing differently, to keep doing it!&lt;br /&gt;Now approaching June 1, I continue to receive comments from folks young and old that I &amp;quot;sure am wearing my age well,&amp;quot; and that I look nothing like other women they know in their 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say that now, when I look at myself critically in the mirror, I am without question beginning to notice, especially around the eyes and mouth, a dramatic softening of lines, and my skin feels as soft as a newborn&#x27;s skin. There is no doubt whatsoever that I am now seeing some pretty dramatic results for my own personal skin type and condition.  I am extremely pleased with this product and will continue to use it.  I&#x27;m really excited to see what will happen in another 3-6 months.  I would highly recommend that people interested in adding a bit of youth back into their skin give it a try.  Please remember to have realistic expectations.  I liken this process to an obese person on a life-changing diet and exercise program.  The body didn&#x27;t gain weight and get out of shape overnight, so it will take time and effort to improve appearance and health.  The same applies to using this product.  Begin a good skin care regimen (I have now), protect skin from the sun, follow the directions on how to take &amp;quot;for best results,&amp;quot; and be patient. You WILL see results!d old that I &amp;quot;sure am wearing my age well,&amp;quot; and that I look nothing like other women they know in their 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say that now, when I look at myself critically in the mirror, I am without question beginning to notice, especially around the eyes and mouth, a dramatic softening of lines, and my skin feels as soft as a newborn&#x27;s skin.

            <li> I have always had dry skin. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of topical treatments, which have only helped so far. I decided to look for a supplement that could help me with this problem. I have been reading about phytoceramides for some time. What I like about this product is that it uses ceramide made from rice, and studies have indicated they are more effective than phytoceramides made from wheat. Also this product is produced in an FDA-registered lab, which is important. I&#x27;ve been taking this product for about a week and I am starting to see a change in the texture of my skin. I&#x27;m excited to see how this progresses. Thanks Teraputics!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way but so far so good. My skin improved a little and I want to try another bottle to see better results. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product so I really don&#x27;t have any comments, positive or negative, to offer.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my results so far I wish I taken pics I have used one bottle and starting my second but I definitely wil continue to keep ordering great results and the price is ridiculously low. Thank you teraputics</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin or you&#x27;re concerned about signs of aging - this supplement might be of great help to you. I have been using Phytoceramides for almost 2 years now and it has made a significant change in the appearance of my skin. It has helped my skin better absorb the serums, creams and lotions that I use. In effect, I have healthier skin and fine lines don&#x27;t concern me as much! If you were like me and just kept wondering why your skin products don&#x27;t work - read up on Phytoceramides. Read up on it, buy it and try it. It&#x27;s truly worth all the hype it&#x27;s been getting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> When I read about your product, I had to try this miracle pill.  I am 65 and I feel that most products are not going to work for me..  The capsules are easy to take and my skin is soft and I do not have many wrinkles around my eyes. I want to keep taking it to just see if my  skin does continue&lt;br /&gt; to improve. I was just told the other day that I was a very young  looking 65.</li>
            <li> Just started taking product, we&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> No opinion, as I have just started taking the pills.  But... I am confused.  The box instructions you to TAKE WITH FOOD.  The printout says to TAKE WITH A GLASS OF WATER.  So, which is it!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a short period of time, maybe it&#x27;s all in my head, but I swear I am seeing positive results. I am particularly happy about this being gluten/wheat free. I have gluten sensitivities, none of the nasty gluten side effects I always experience.  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Product works great. My wrinkles have reduced and the lines on my face have almost completely disappeared. I can&#x27;t believe it! Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  ACTUALLY KNOW THIS IS WORKING.</li>
            <li> It has been a month since I started using this product and I feel my skin is tightening a bit and there is a bit of a glow. I will be ordering another bottle and am hoping it will progress. I will write a follow up review after the second bottle.</li>
            <li> Message: My name is Doc Edwards, and I’ve been a convert to your phytoceremide product’ for nearly four and a half months now. I’ m just about to turn the chronological big 70 next year. Now, if it is a women in your office who is reading this letter, then please, don‘t be like my older sister (she’s 76, going on 212, so she knows everything) and try and tell me that men my age don’t care about their looks as they get older. Horse hockey! I mean…after all…mine is the face of responsibility: I’ve got several women depending on this face and that smile to bring a little extra-curricular joy into their lives --- not all at the same time, mind you, but rather each on a different day of the week --- that is, if I’m not too awfully tired from my services to the others earlier in the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here’s “An Unsolicited Testimonial,” as they say:&lt;br /&gt;“After trying several different brands of phytoceremide and all with fair to moderate success as far as results go, I finally got around to ordering your product to try just a few months ago. The specific reason that I wanted to try your brand was the fact that I discovered that, unlike the other brands which were made from wheat, the phytoceremide in your capsules was derived from rice which my exhaustive Internet research (you can be exhaustive when your retired and there’s nothing better to do) indicated that phytoceremide, derived from rice, was superior to that produced from wheat in several important respects. Though, what actually sold me was when my research kept indicating that phytoceremide, derived from rice, was more easily absorbed into the body’s cell structure than phytoceremide derived from only wheat.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, after ordering and using just one bottle (a one month’s supply) of your rice-derived phytoceremide capsules, the tighter, plumper, fuller, rosier, and much more youthful looking skin emerging on my face and neck was all the damn research I needed. And the bottom-line is I’ve used it for the last four months like it was a prayer book. Now, so as not to drag this testimony from New York to South Georgia, just let me say that I think the two un-retouched photos ( one before and one after) that I’ve included as an attachment to this email pretty much says it all.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I ask you, to consider for just a moment the better of the two photos enclosed, which even a yellow dog could tell would clearly be the “after” photo, which was taken a month ago after using your fine , rice-based product for only three months. However, don’t let me and that yellow dog influence your own determination as to precisely in which of the two photo’s you yourself think that I look the youngest in?&lt;br /&gt;That’s right, put your glasses on, and then go get somebody else to come over here and decide with you, so as to do this judging thing democratically right. Now, mind you, both of you need to try and stay completely objective as you make your final selection. Take your time Don’t make your final determination and selection simply as the naturally biased manufacturers of the wonderfully effective phytoceremide product that produced this remarkably handsome, garrulously talkative, sexy, and youthful looking face, which is wrapped around a rather big, horsey-looking smile and plastered onto and covering what is, in all truth and fact, a nearly 70 year old visage --- but rather make and pick your choice as the honest, objective, unbiased (well, I guess you can strike that last word, anyway) just and fair judges of the unvarnished, undeniable evidence and proof , based in and upon the uncompromising, unforgivable, unaltered photographic images of me that are now before you, tagged “Before” and “After.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, in your final, closing statement, concerning this whole matter, I think you would probably agree to state out loud and say along with me ---- in the words of that great philosopher, whose name I have alreadyforgotten -----that most appropriate old axiom to the present occasion at hand as follows: “One can only rightly conclude, based strictly on the evidence before us, that the proof of the phytoceremide, unlike the proverbial pudding, is not in the ‘ tasting’ but in the ‘looking’,…n’est pas?”ent occasion at hand as follows: “One can only rightly conclude, based strictly on the evidence before us, that the proof of the phytoceremide, unlike the proverbial pudding, is not in the ‘ tasting’ but in the ‘looking’,…n’est pas?”</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile. The results are positive and I agree with the other reviews that say give it time. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a difference! Great product!  Delivered in a timely fashion as well.</li>
            <li> I just received the product and i&#x27;ve been using it for a week now. I have noticed that when i started using the product my fine lines began to diminish and i feel so much better about myself. i am so excited to finish the whole bottle and purchase it again!!!Q!Q</li>
            <li> I developed the most horrible rash on my face and neck while taking this product.</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks already and my skin really change more bright and soft.This is the best supplements.very pleased and plan on continue using this product. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product fast ship ,great service will buy again</li>
            <li> I am so excited to receive my bottle of Phytoceramides! I&#x27;ve tried two others and they did NOT have the ratings that Teraputics does....I like the professionalism with the helpful booklet that accompanies the product....and if you email the company with any questions or concerns they will get back to you!!! So, I can honestly say I am looking forward to the beautiful results......thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been taking this product for 16 days.  Haven&#x27;t seen any major results, that is why I&#x27;ve only giving it 4 stars.  I&#x27;m hoping I will see the same results mentioned by other customers.  I have extreme gluten sensitivity so am pleased that this product is gluten free.  Will continue taking and watching for results.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see any changes</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results! I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. It has helped keep my acne at bay. I have no new breakouts and my old scars are starting to fade. I&#x27;m using this along with a Vitamin C lotion and plan to keep purchasing both! I take this after a meal in case of getting an upset stomach.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I see the difference in my skin and my hair.  Will continue buying this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using Phytoceramides going on two years now.  My skin has had amazing results since I have been taking it.  My skin is softer, has more moisture, less lines around my eyes, lip, laugh and forehead lines.  I previously had tried other products but nothing has compared to Teraputics Phytocermides.  There is definitely a visible difference.</li>
            <li> I started taking this about two weeks ago and I am very surprised with my results. I really honestly did not expect much from taking this supplement but have noticed a gradual improvement with my skin ever since I started taking it. My deep wrinkles have disappeared about 25% and I think they will improve even further. I plan to take this for a few months so that I can get absolutely perfect skin.</li>
            <li> My allergist informed me that I am deficient or lacking of a filagrin gene. This has caused me to have moderate to severe execema. He told me to use moisturizers with ceramides in them. I stumbled upon your product,phytoceramides and decided to give it a try. I have been taking it for just over a week and have noticed some improvements. My skin is less dry, less red, and less itchy. I am cautiously optimistic on this product helping my excema!</li>
            <li> Every single summer my skin dries out very quickly and wrinkles form on my face that were simply not there before. I get lines under my eyes that make me look just unattractive. I heard about this product through a friend of mine and decided to go ahead and try it. My favorite thing about this product is that it is all natural. So I have been using it for just under a month now and my results have been fabulous! I decided to go ahead and choose this particular brand because of the amazing price and that they seem legit. The lines and wrinkles around my face and under my eyes have begun to fade and I look much younger. My skin feels more soft and looks more vibrant. I can&#x27;t believe something that is all natural could work so well. I can deinitely give this product a confident 5 stars and have already recommended it to my sister and a few friends. If you are a middle-aged woman (or man) with wrinkles forming on your face due to weather or to age, I suggest you try phytoceramides. You never know what they can do for you. I will be taking this for a few more months at least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the phytoceramides so far. My skin already seems less dry after just a week. I was recommended the product by a friend whose had really good results with them after just one month of use so I&#x27;m very excited about this product.</li>
            <li> I understand the product is good.  I truly have not taken it long enough to give an honest opinion.  Today makes my third day on it ,  and I am looking forward to great results.  Will be quite happy to do this again after taking for two months.  Then I should be able to give an honest rating of the product.  So thankful for a free bottle.  Will look forward to making this a part of my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Judith</li>
            <li> I am starting to see a more even skin tone and I believe my fine lines are less visible, after only a short time using this product.  I am also encouraged to drink more water now, to get the full effect of the phytoceramides.  Looking forward to seeing the results I&#x27;ll get after a longer period of time.  But will definitely keep using, based on the results I&#x27;ve seen already.</li>
            <li> Just started taking Teraputics Phytoceramindes Cermide-PCD and I see results.  My skin is way better and I am very happy with this product.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants great skin!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long three weeks for me as I try to make myself look a little better than usual. The catalyst for this was finding out about phytoceramides and how they can help keep your skin moist and fresh. I decided to try it so I bought this brand for no particular reason. I have to say that they work almost exactly as they claim they will... my skin is fresh and... my skin is moist. The dryness is gone. Does it regenerate my skin cells? Hard to say. But did it clear up a few wrinkles, bumps, and abrasions? Yes it did. A+ stuff. I will be buying again fo sho.</li>
            <li> I received the package very quickly and on time. The labeling is very professional and it comes in a very beautiful little box. The pills have Vitamins A,C,D,E in them as well as rice phytoceramides. My doctor told me that Vitamin E is good for repairing damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills are odorless and do not upset my stomach (and I have a very weak stomach). I started taking just 1 pill every afternoon with my lunch. While there is no miracle anti-aging supplement out there I believe that these phytoceramides have definitely cleared up my skin, and strengthened my hair and nails. My nails have been growing faster and stronger than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to continue taking this product for at least 6 more months and I hope to improve even more. It&#x27;s pretty amazing that just a simple little pill can mask the symptoms of aging so well. I have already told my sister about this and she&#x27;s going to get started on it as well.</li>
            <li> Only used for a couple of weeks.  Am anticipating good results.</li>
            <li> It make my skin fresh and my skin crisp. Because of sun my wrinkles form much harder than it usually be. I take one everyday and drink lots of water. The curing for my skin is here in this bottle. Smoother lines and better color to skin is what I receive from this. Go get it!</li>
            <li> After reading such great reviews, my wife and I wanted to try this product.  So far, we have been using it less than one month, so we cannot claim any future benefits, but my wife says she sees some subtle improvement of her skin, (smoothing) and I am hoping for a lessening of spots on my hands.  We are only in the initial phase, but still, we give this product a top rating because we are excited about the future results!  As we still have two more bottles to use from our initial order, we are anticipating seeing even better things happen.  To add another note, we did research and review other wheat based phytoceramides prior to purchasing this one and decided this product is the best we found among them, as well as being gluten free.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have ordered four times and will continue to use. Huge difference in my skin texture and tone. Furthermore, I experienced an unexpected benefit from using this product. It seems as if my skin repairs itself more rapidly and with less to zero scarring! You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Have been taking this product for several months now, people guess my age at least 10 yrs younger then I am!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks better then before this product, so am sticking with it!  If it works, don&#x27;t mess with it!</li>
            <li> I thought about buying this for a few months and decided to finally do it. I picked this brand because the bottle really stood out to me and they had a good price. I never really had that many wrinkles but my skin is always so very dry. This product claims that it helps to retain moisture in your skin so I knew this is exactly what I needed. Of course I was skeptical but it actually did have an effect on me. For the first week I barely felt any difference but then I noticed my hands were not as dry as they would usually be. After three weeks my skin barely feels dry. I used to slather on lotion 10 times a day but now I just do it once or twice. Not bad! I&#x27;m surprised it worked honestly.</li>
            <li> I just received my order today, and am very hopeful that I will experience the same results that other reviewers have had.  I chose this product because it&#x27;s made in the USA, had great reviews, and had no fillers - it seems to be a better quality than similar products.  I will update this review after I have been taking the supplement for 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update November 2015: I took these capsules for 60 days (I took advantage of the free bottle offer that came with my order).  While my skin did look as though it had improved, it&#x27;s hard to judge how much of that improvement was due to this product versus an improved skin-care regimen that included Vitamins A, E and hyaluronic acid.  Will continue to take them, along with continuing my updated regimen - no adverse effects, and while I haven&#x27;t experienced changes in my skin that make me appear as though I&#x27;ve lost decades off my age, I have noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> Very interesting stuff. I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work but I gradually noticed improvement in my skin. I am a 52 year old man with all sorts of splotches and blotches. Wrinkles, crow&#x27;s feet, dry skin etc. You name it and I have to deal with it. I have finished an entire bottle of these pills and at the end of it I saw a picture of myself from before I started taking them. The difference is quite apparent. So I am ready to buy another bottle to see how much younger could I look. I suggest taking a picture of yourself before starting to take these pills so you can compare. Anyways, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Have tried this and 2 other brands.  This appears to be the best of the three, yet as the formula for all of the gluten-free ceramides appears to be exactly the same and the manufacturing process appears to be the same, I  wonder if I am kidding myself.  All of the formulations leave the skin feeling softer and more hydrated, especially the legs.  I don&#x27;t see anything more than a minor visual improvement with any of the brands, but I have not been regular about taking the supplements either.  I give this one the highest rating thus far as they provide a pamphlet that gives you information that others don&#x27;t; such as.... take at the same time every day, give it 6-8 weeks, drink water.  They seem to be dedicated to making this work for the consumer, and helping the consumer understand the process.  And the visible improvement is more noticeable with this brand.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I am gluten intolerant, and needed a gluten free phytoceramide. I have been using this for a month, and it seems to be helping. I do see some improvement in my skin and hair, and will continue using to see if longer usage increases the improvement. It definitely does not irritate my system like many vitamins do. Am using it in conjunction with Mad Hippy skin care products which also work great, and the combination seems to be really working.</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am very happy I bought this product. I plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> After only about 20 days of use the results that I can see are pretty dramatic. The bags and lines under my eyes have disappeared. My skin has become lighter and softer and less dry. I no longer have to apply pounds of lotion just to get through the day. The process for me was very simple, I just took 1 capsule every single morning with food.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that definitely speed things along and lock in my progress is washing my face a few times a day especially in the morning. My skin gets so oily in the summertime so this is the perfect supplement that I have been looking. I can honestly say that I look better than before!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I just felt like I had to say something about this. I first heard about ceramides on the Dr. Oz show and decided to go ahead and try it. I&#x27;m an old woman in her 50&#x27;s and my skin is just falling apart. Well after only a week of taking these capsules I saw my skin tighten up, my wrinkles smooth out, and my skin became almost brighter. It has been a month now taking these pills and I am just glowing. My hair stays in place, my nails are less brittle, my wrinkles are greatly reduced, and since I look better I feel much better as well. I will definitely be reordering this product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Ready to give it a try. Day 1</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that this product seems to really be working. I have noticed that my skin isn’t nearly as dry as it was, my crow’s feet have faded a little bit, and my complexion is more even than it was. I am excited to see what other changes are going to take place as I continue using this product. My friends have already said they notice that my skin looks healthier than it did before I started using this. My husband thought I was wasting money by purchasing this, but now even he sees that it’s working and keeps asking me if I need to order some more. Really happy with the results I’ve seen and will be placing another order soon!</li>
            <li> i recently became single again and was looking for ways to look better so i can attract some women. i go to the gym and take better care of myself these days. my skin has always been an issue for me, there are wrinkles forming everywhere. i heard about ceramides on the dr oz show and decided to try it. it has been a little over a month since i began taking this product and my complexion has definitely cleared up. there is still some room left for improvement but i am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> When you start taking these capsules you will feel the effects after only a few days. My appearance was noticeably improved and my skin seemed firmer, smoother, and softer. Even people at my work for no apparent reason would tell me that I look really good for some reason and they can&#x27;t quite put their finger on it. Well that&#x27;s because my skin quality had improved! Of course youthful unblemished skin will make you look better. My only concern with these capsules is that what will happen to me after I stop taking them? I assume my complexion will just fall apart again so I have no plans to discontinue using this product in the near future. If you were undecided about this, I was too, but I am glad I tried it. One other problem is that my friend tried these phytoceramides too and they didn&#x27;t have such an amazing effect on her. Everybody is different but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try something new, that&#x27;s why I did it, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been just a few weeks since I began taking these pills and I have actually noticed some results. First I want to say however that there weren&#x27;t any side effects at all, the pill would just completely pass through my body. My skin became more pristine and I had a &amp;#34;warmer glow&amp;#34; (this is what my boyfriend said to me). The lines on my face smoothed out and the greatest thing was how my nails became stronger. They would always be so brittle but lo and behold they barely ever chip now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to see more results as I just started the product.  So far so good though!  My only wish is that it had less or &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; added vitamins ...I would especially appreciate less vitamin A....or since it is added it would be better to use a natural source rather than the synthetic form that is currently used.</li>
            <li> Very happy with how well this product works. I’ve noticed that my skin is firmer, smoother, and my complexion has evened out so I no longer have blotchy areas on my cheeks and hands. Even the creases on my forehead are now less prominent. I’ve tried a lot of products, but Teraputics beats them all ten to one. I got this product for free by the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a difference in the texture and tone of my skin, as well as the elasticity.  I&#x27;ll keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using phytoceramides for a while now and my skin is not dry anymore, it feels really soft and I have fewer lines on my face.  My co-workers keep telling me that I look much younger than my real age.  This product does what it says it does.  You will start to see the difference in your skin at around 30 days, it takes around that time for your body to process the ingredients and start making collagen.  I specifically purchased from this company because the product is all natural and made in the USA.  Buy it!!! you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This product has been a wonderful help in restoring natural collagen in hair and skin. I am currently on some medication that really dries out my hair and skin, and this product is helping me manage those side effects. A+</li>
            <li> Absolutely noticed a significant difference in my skin after finishing the bottle--the improvements were obvious.  It took about two weeks to fully see some changes for me--which was quite immediate, I find it usually takes a minimum of 30 days to see definitive results with any supplement--but I definitely noticed softer skin, improved glow and better overall skin clarity.  After 1 month, my skin appears far more well hydrated throughout the day...my skin is easily reactive and immediately shows signs of dehydration.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t attest to that part but my skin is nonetheless plumped up.  I really saw a difference on the back of my hands--they tend to get very dry, they became glowier and smoother also.  I also liked that there were no digestive issues with Teraputic&#x27;s Phytoceramides nor any other type of negative reaction whatsoever, I find wheat based harsher on the digestion.  I am pleased with my purchase and intend to continue using these as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> My skin cleared up. I also received this bottle for free so that was pretty cool. It worked exactly as I was told it would. If you want to look younger and more vibrant and better looking..... then check this one out, don&#x27;t sleep on it!</li>
            <li> I do see and feel a difference on my face and body skin when I use this product regularly.  It took about a month to see the effects and, when I stopped taking it, I found my dry skin returned within 2 weeks or so.  The wheat-based phytoceramides actually made the deep wrinkles on my face more pronounced and made me look older, so perhaps I have a gluten sensitivity I wasn&#x27;t previously aware of.  Then I read about the rice-based phytoceramides and I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive results: smoother skin and more importantly, no more dry skin.I will keep taking these for the rest of my days!</li>
            <li> This phytocermide was high recommended! Taking this along with a good skin care regiment is just what the doctor ordered! I&#x27;m 64 years old and live in the desert so taking these phytocermides are a must!</li>
            <li> there appears to be a good deal of compelling evidence that phytoceramides can help increase hydration and stimulate collagen production, thereby plumping the skin from the inside out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keep in mind that healthy, beautiful, natural-looking skin should look plump and firm ... not tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rice-based phytoceramides - such as teraputics - are demonstrated to be more effective than their wheat-based counterparts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my skin is severely damaged as a result of using oral minoxidil (not the commonly-used topical form, but the considerably more potent pill form), which has the undocumented side-effect of suppressing the body&#x27;s ability to produce collagen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m using [[ASIN:B00J44UVZW Teraputics Phytoceramides Ceramide-PCD ® Made From Rice - 100% Gluten Free All Natural Plant Derived Vitamin Extract, Skin Restoring Skincare Oral Supplement, Eliminates Wrinkles, Reduces Fine Lines, Strengthens Hair Skin Nails, 30 Veggie Caps, 40mg + G...]] as an important part of a broad, systemic approach in an attempt to increase my body&#x27;s collagen production and repair as much of the oral minoxidil-induced damage as possible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my specific situation is somewhat unusual and extreme, and i intend to continue using teraputics phytoceramides because i believe it&#x27;s a quality product and a valuable component in my efforts</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I have naso-labial fold lines. They seem to have lessened since starting to use this product. I do also use topical hyaluronic acid and light therapy on my face, so I can&#x27;t say which of these treatments is making the difference.</li>
            <li> I just started taking these, so it&#x27;s too soon to say how effective they are--but the company service was excellent,&lt;br /&gt;the capsules are easy to swallow, and they are certainly gluten-free (or I would know about it!).  I look forward to seeing&lt;br /&gt;improvements in a few weeks time--and will report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reporting back: I&#x27;ve been taking these for 3 months and plan to go on taking them.  Before I started taking them, I was suffering from a bad case of contact dermatitis/eczema.  I had read that phytoceramides could help with this condition.  That was my primary concern when I bought them.  They have helped--I can now wash my hands with soap and water without disastrous consequences!  Additionally, I had always looked young for my age but had lost that due to an illness.  People are again taking me for younger, which could well be due to the phytoceramides.  Of course it does not hurt to follow the other recommendations, to drink plenty of water, to eat properly, sleep, and exercise.  However, none of those behaviors did anything to help cure my eczema.  The phytoceramides get all the credit for that.</li>
            <li> These Ceramides seem to be working though there is no dramatic change.  I am happy with my skin and use them in conjunction with topical Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Knowing I&#x27;m allergic to wheat, a friend gave me the rice (gluten-free) phytoceramides. I&#x27;ve been taking them for about a month and have noticed a slight change in the texture of my skin. This may increase as the days progress.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, I&#x27;ve only used once. I will come back and update!</li>
            <li> I have heard really good things about this product and I have decided to try it.  The shipping was very fast and I also got a coupon for another bottle free.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> as I said I love this product..</li>
            <li> One the best product!!!</li>
            <li> Will definitely order from Teraputics again. Liked e mail notifications,  fast delivery and  an information pamphlet about this product.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say anything about the product yet because I just started to use it.</li>
            <li> My complexion was a bit sallow, yet after just a few weeks of taking Teraputics Phytoceramides, my skin is both softer and pinker, plus the two dark spots on my face are noticeably fading. It&#x27;s probably too early to see a change in fine wrinkles, but I&#x27;ll continue to take the product to allow enough time to reap its many benefits.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I could tell a difference in the first week. I even had a coworker comment on how my skin looked like it was glowing and my discoloration ( years in a tanning bed) was not noticeable. Re ordering more today as I only have a few pills left</li>
            <li> I’ve been trying to stick to gluten free products and foods for a while now in an attempt to live a healthier lifestyle so when I saw this was gluten free, I had to try it. I’m glad I chose to give this product a chance because my skin is so much healthier looking now and it’s even helped to make my hair healthier, stronger, and it now has a shine to it that wasn’t there before. I recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item based upon the reviews on Amazon.  It seems to be the preferred brand, so I have great hopes it will be my fountain of youth!  I give this 3 stars because I just started using it but I wanted the free bottle which required I write the review before I saw the results.</li>
            <li> The instructions were plain and easy to follow.  It takes discipline, but well worth the try.</li>
            <li> I  have been using for approximately three weeks - I have gotten such compliments on how good my skn looks and EVEN I - (as we all are our worst critic) see an astounding difference in my skin.  Do not look as tired and my coloring is great!!!!!!!!!!!.  Thank you for this  product and I thanked my girlfirend for introducing me to it!  This is my second reorder will not be without them...part of my daily routine! Love this product!</li>
            <li> Well,  I am faithfully taking the phytoceramides daily and drinking lots of water.  I think it is too early to see results, I am trusting they will come with the second bottle.  Improvements take time I will just continue and see what happens :)</li>
            <li> great quick shipping, &amp; decent price point.</li>
            <li> I finished a bottle and noticed reduced lines and a softer texture, but I think I need to give it more than a month to see full results, so I&#x27;m going to order another bottle.  No side effects, arrived quickly and since they aren&#x27;t huge pills like some supplements, they aren&#x27;t so hard to swallow.</li>
            <li> Am just getting started and I am so excited. Delivery was prompt and I&#x27;m on my second day.Will confirm after a week or so.</li>
            <li> Hélio, i head my friends taking about and they told me the product are so good and they loved .</li>
            <li> A rice based skin supplement is hard to find as many of them are made with wheat so that was one of the reasons I chose this particular brand. I love what it has done for my skin. I feel like a whole new person because my skin is moist and has a softness it hasn’t had in a very long time. The small lines on my face have decreased so I look so much younger.  I’m really glad I found this product and I love the free gift I received. That was a great bonus!</li>
            <li> I have just started using this.  At this point, I do not know any results.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my third bottle this week. After reading about phytoceramides in Life Extension I decided to try it. I appreciate the research and science behind LE articles. After reading more about it, however, I decided to use the rice based product. Early days yet but I can tell my skin is not as dry. I&#x27;ve also had a couple of people comment that I look younger than I actually am. That hasn&#x27;t happened recently! Needless to say, I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> The description says that these are non-gmo BUT the bottle says NOTHING pertaining to that. I can&#x27;t tae these in good conscience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big believer in most supplements, but I&#x27;m a huge believer in the results I&#x27;m seeing from taking Phytoceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking Phytoceramides for nearly six months now, so I can share a bit about how well these have worked for me so far. Within a few weeks after I began taking Phytoceramides I noticed more fullness to my cheeks, and a visible reduction in the sagging at the jowls. After a little more than a month the bagginess under my eyes was cleared up, and the toothpick lines at the bridge of my nose were harder to see. After taking them for a little over two months I continued to see those positive changes getting more pronounced, and my face was definitely still filling back out. I&#x27;m a week short of 6 months since I started taking them now and I no longer have any saggy jowls, and only have baggy eyes if allergies are bothering me (and they clear up after I take a Zantac for allergies). I not only see positive changes, but looking better again has helped me feel more confident enough to get out and socialize more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Phytoceramides are 100% all natural, made in the USA , and are gluten free since they&#x27;re rice derived. That&#x27;s important to know because there have been numerous studies that show 40mg of rice derived Phytoceramides are more potent than wheat or sweet potato based Phytoceramides and give faster and superior results. The bottle contains 30 medium sized capsules, and the recommended dose is one capsule a day. I generally take one capsule each morning with a full glass of water about 20 - 30 minutes before mealtime, and I haven&#x27;t had any ill effects whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of being more effective than wheat or sweet potato derived Phytoceramides, these are gluten free as well which is important to the growing percent of the population who suffer from wheat allergies. This brand also includes the recommended daily does of vitamins A, C, D, and E which help us rebuild healthy tissues faster. I have seen a definite improvement in my appearance, skin tone, and feelings about my appearance since starting to take Phytoceramides. To me, there is no question that taking Phytoceramides helps to improve and even reverse the root causes of wrinkles and other signs of aging, so I intend to continue taking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional discount received for evaluation, testing, and review purposes.ite improvement in my appearance, skin tone, and feelings about my appearance since starting to take Phytoceramides.

            <li> I have only been taking this for 10 days ....I have noticed my skin is tone is even and face appears firmer!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been taking this product for one month, but it does seem to be working. I have repurchased the product and will continue to take it. I can&#x27;t give a complete review based on the length of time I have been using the Phytoceramides.  However, I can say that the customer service at Teraputics is excellent.</li>
            <li> after one month using  Phytoceramides , I notice my nails become hard and my skin looks fresh and fine lines diminished.</li>
            <li> Love it - skin is smooth, soft, clear! At 57 never expected to see such improvement!</li>
            <li> I have been taking Teraputics Phytoceramides for a week and have seen a difference in my skin already. This is an amazing product.. I think I may not have to go to my Dermatologist anymore.</li>
            <li> I began using the phytoceramides 3 months ago.  Since then, my skin is much more radiant, clear, and has a healthy glow.  My fine lines and wrinkles are greatly reduced!  I will continue to purchase this product, as it works!</li>
            <li> I did not expect that this product would work in such a short time. I’ve been taking this for a month but the lines on my face have softened a little and my skin is kind of lighter and smoother so I can only imagine what the changes will be like in the coming months. I am impressed and happy with the results. I will update my review in a few weeks after I try a second bottle. The product is okay after one bottle so let&#x27;s see what happens next. Then it could deserve a 5+ rating.</li>
            <li> I have seen an improvement in the texture of my skin. I will continue to order this product to see even more improvement!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product believing in all the hype. I finished the product which took one month and didn&#x27;t notice anything different about my skin... Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is making my skin feel moist and look good after just 2 weeks.  My own daughter asked yesterday what I was doing to make my skin glow so much.  I told her about this phytoceramides pill. I am very encouraged and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was using another brand which worked great but I ran out so after researching other brands I found this one which  had really good reviews. I&#x27;m just giving it 4 stars for now because I just received this.  I have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin after using the other brand so hope after taking this one I will get better results.  I am 65 and people think I&#x27;m a lot younger but I do have a genetic disease called Neurofibromatosis and just recently had surgery on my face to remove tumors so hoping this will help in restoring my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin on my face seems to be smoother and toned.</li>
            <li> My bad mistake...I did not see my skin get any better at all!!!  I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I felt safer to buy this brand Phytoceramides, because it has GMP (Good Manufacture Practices) seal, and it is manufactured by a FDA-registered drug establishment. I have used it less than a month, It does keep my face lifted some - wrinkles are less deep, skin are defiantly fresher, tighter! I am very happy with it. Please keep the good quality forever, I&#x27;ll keep buying it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Read great things about this product. So far so good. Will post another review after ive taken them longer.</li>
            <li> The product arrived when I expected it.  I have&#x27;t been using it one 1 day, but after reading other reviews I am excited to begin and cannot wait to see result.</li>
            <li> This is just a gem. I can&#x27;t believe that I spent an entire year trying all sorts of hocus pocus skincare treatments and wasted so much time. I even tried a few other brands of phytoceramides and had barely any results. I started taking these as sort of a last chance before I just give up on my skin forever. You know the phrase &amp;#34;it&#x27;s always darkest before dawn&amp;#34;? Well this is kind of what happened to me here. After almost giving up hope I found something that solved all my problems and more. I started taking just one capsule every morning. In a few days I noticed my skin had cleared up just a little bit. So I started taking two capsules everyday. One in the morning and one at night. After two weeks let me just say that my skin has cleared up completely, my hair stopped falling out as much, my hair feels stronger, the dark circles under my eyes are almost gone, and I feel amazing about all of this. So what more can I say other than why don&#x27;t you just try these phytoceramides if you really want something that works. This brand is legit.</li>
            <li> My skin really not too amazing and I look back at my younger self pictures in astonishment sometimes. I decide that i do something about it now finally. Thank my sister for the tip but she said i need to try ceramides and that it may help me. I only take this pills for just one week and my splotchy spots, weird bumps are being reduced everyday. how is it possible? I am including this supplement as a big part of my vitamins daily. Will continue taking and update this with more information later but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I am sorry but I can&#x27;t tell a difference. I am trying  a second bottle and then stopping because that is usually when I notice something is missing. Also I am 77 so may not get results.</li>
            <li> I am new to phytoceramides!  Hoping to see some skin tightening ...will check back in  a few months to report in!</li>
            <li> Great for my hair, nails, and skin. I&#x27;ve ordered from this seller twice and haven&#x27;t regretted yet. You will see a difference within the first week of using this product. Be sure your consistent when taking theses pills.</li>
            <li> I love all the vitamins that are in these capsules. They have helped rejuvenate my skin and my hair is shinier and I noticed it’s not shedding that much in the shower anymore and my nails are stronger and growing faster too. The vitamins are also great for keeping my body healthy too because I know that I don’t eat like I should, so these help kind of make up for that. I’m really enjoying the changes I have been seeing and I’m anxious to see even more as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Just took my first one. Can&#x27;t wait till I go through the bottle and see results. Shipping was point.  One a day is good since I take other supplements and it was a small easy to swallow pill</li>
            <li> I just received them and I&#x27;m so excited to see the amazing results I keep hearing about!! After a few weeks I&#x27;ll do an update on how it&#x27;s going I can&#x27;t Wait!!  :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t upset stomach and actually makes me feel good. Well packaged.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles initially to try the product, very happy with the results so I&#x27;ve ordered two more.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s made from rice.  My skin appears healther, more toned after just two months so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more results as I take the product for a longer period of time.  I&#x27;m not an advocate of Botox or surgery so this is the perfect product for me.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and still in the workforce so it helps to look my best!  After years of eating whatever, tanning, etc; I&#x27;m now committed to living a more healthy lifestyle; exercising, eating natural foods, and this supplement will be a continued part of my new routine.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Teraputics phytoeramides for just under 1 month now and there is definite improvement in the look and feel of my skin. My skin has always been so dry that it just won’t hold any kind of moisture at all so I started taking this to see if it would help with my dry skin and also reduce the few wrinkles I have. It took about a week before I noticed that my skin wasn’t as dry anymore, and now almost 1 month in, my skin is soft and smooth and there aren’t any dry patches anywhere anymore. My wrinkles are still there but they’re less noticeable than they were before. I give Teraputics 5 stars for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this one. This is one product that definitely gives great results. It has improved the look and feel of my skin, especially on my face, and it has also made my hair healthier and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;I had a little bit of acne when I first started taking this and within the first week, it had started to clear up. Now a month later, my face is getting more and more blemish free.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing I have tried has helped to get rid of my acne that effectively or that fast. We&#x27;ll see wat the future holds, but for now I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I honestly don’t think I’d have ever believed that these phytoceramides actually work if I hadn’t seen it for myself. I took a risk by trying them. I figured I was just throwing money in the trash, but to my surprise, they do actually work. My skin has tightened up, especially along my jawline, on my cheeks, and my neck and my skin is so smooth to touch. I find myself touching my face throughout the day because it feels so different than it did previously. The fine lines and wrinkles I had are gone or fading away. I am in love with this product for what it has done for my skin. The results are amazing!</li>
            <li> My wife took these pills for a few weeks and wanted me to write this review. She transformed in front of my very eyes. Younger looking and all that. Smoother, softer, lighter. Try it out...</li>
            <li> I love the supplememnt but just received it so I will respond after the 30 days are complete</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within a few weeks of using Phytoceramides.  Without a question, fine lines around my eyes seemed to disappear and the creases in my forehead softened.  I am 45 years old and had recently started contemplating my getting Botox for the first time. These phytoceramides have allowed me to put off that track, at least for a while.  I also started giving one a day to my husband who is 5 years older than me and who had some pronounced creasing in his forehead as well.  Within two weeks, his age lines also softened significantly and he looks quite a few years younger!  Additionally, historically, in the winter, my skin gets exceedingly dry, all over my body...beyond alligator.  Since I started taking these, my skin all over is nowhere near as dry.  I&#x27;m pleased with this product and will continue taking phytoceramides to maintain the improvement in my wrinkles and dryness.  Frankly, I&#x27;m petrified to STOP taking them at this point because I like how i&#x27;m looking these days. :)</li>
            <li> The scientific explanation makes a lot of sense and I wish I had came across this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;Will update you about tge long time effects!&lt;br /&gt;Judith</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for approximately 4-5 months. I do feel like my skin looks more youthful and just yesterday my friend said, &amp;#34;You look younger than you do when I first met you!&amp;#34;... which was 3.5 years ago! My partner also sees a difference. I don&#x27;t feel as compelled to seek cosmetic surgery as I did before using this product. I feel better about myself in the mirror. There are other factors that have most likely contributed, but this stuff has been part of the equation. Stick with it.</li>
            <li> When you apply a cream, it sinks in to the top layer of skin and perhaps the second layer. When we use fillers, they fill the wrinkles in on the top layer but these mask wrinkles rather than treat them at the source. When you take a tablet, they work in the body and cause internal improvements that penetrate outward, so that the root cause of wrinkles and signs of aging are reversed and improved inside-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, taking a tablet is far less hassle than a daily half-hour routine of expensive skin creams, scrubs, rubs, massages and more! I don’t know about you but my day is already short enough for all the things I have to do, so anything that makes my day easier and gives me the same or better results is definitely worth considering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking phytoceramides for years and I love that I can finally get them affordably instead of buying overpriced ones from the dermatologist. There are easy to take, easy to swallow capsules that keep my skin glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this as part of a promotion in order to facilitate an unbiased and honest review</li>
            <li> Just received product. Very quick shipping. Anxious to use and see great results. SS</li>
            <li> The purchase of this product has been exceptional.  I am allergic to many products, however, I have not had any adverse reactions.  It is too soon to determine the outcome, but I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived promptly&amp;#62; I like that the dose is just one pill per day. I have only taken the product for two weeks, so I don&#x27;t expect a miracle. I have noticed that my nails are stronger and less prone to cracking. I will give it at least a month to determine if it has an impact on my wrinkles. I am hopeful!</li>
            <li> Just great in a nutshell.</li>
            <li> Been using for almost 3 weeks. Skin feels softer, looks smoother, and seems to retain moisture better. Excellent customer service</li>
            <li> I just turned 30 and have started noticing forehead wrinkles as well as nasolabial folds that are starting to appear. I&#x27;ve also had a sallow, uneven complexion with dark under-eye circles for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve tried many different creams, serums, dermarolling, and facial-flex with minimal results. I heard about phytoceramides while researching online. I have been taking Terapeutics phytoceramides 1 cap every morning for about two weeks now. So far, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is a lot less dry and my complexion is more even and less sallow, and I have not has any acne to speak of. Some of my fine lines seem to be fading a little, especially the &amp;#34;eleven&amp;#34; wrinkles between my eyebrows, and the wrinkles across my forehead. I am still anxious to see if this will reduce the deeper smile lines after taking them longer. I will probably start taking 1 cap in the morning and one at night to see if that boosts the results. It takes skin a full month or more to &amp;#34;turn over&amp;#34; so I know I have to be patient. But, overall, this product has been really good for my skin!</li>
            <li> I am 73 years and have always had dryer skin, especially on my legs,  I have been taking this  product  for 30 days and am amazed at how smooth  my entire body feels, I also notice a difference on my face, I  look forward to seeing additional benefits from this product</li>
            <li> Just received this product and so far so good as Teraputics responded to my order very efficiently.  My review&lt;br /&gt;is on their follow-up at this time.  Will get back to  you on results in 30 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 45 days. Its an amazing product. I gave it 30 days before I expected to see a change in my skin. The changes began around day 18. My skin is brighter and hydrated from within. I suffered ( past tense now) from hormonal acne. The acne is 75% better. The fine lines associated with dry skin started freaking me out about a year ago. I&#x27;m 41 and began to think it was just aging. To my HUGE surprise it turns out to be just a hydration issue!!!! PRAISE GO!</li>
            <li> I have tried one bottle and received on time.Like that it has the other vitamins and they give you a getting started guide. I am reordering.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free so that I can try it out. It&#x27;s been about two weeks now and I am pleasantly surprised about the whole thing. It seems like my skin has actually become softer and more clear. I could say it worked and I am curious to see how much more it could do.</li>
            <li> I have seen some difference in my hair and nails.  Maybe a little in the skin too.</li>
            <li> My husband and i have been using this product for about a month now and both of us have been seeing a significant difference. We have ordered it again and will continue to use this product. Both our skin is feeling much smoother and not as dry or itchy that it was. love the product!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom to try. I noticed huge improvement with her skin after 2 weeks of use. It made her skin luminous and her wrinkles on her cheeks almost disappeared. She is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The best !!!! You will see the new you with a baby face!!!😀😀😀😀😀</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a supplement that would restore the moisture in my skin that was left pretty dry after the laser peel and photofacial, and this is the answer! Since I have been taking the phytoceramids, I have  noticed that overall my body skin is softer and  requires less topical moisturizing. Strongly recommend, especially to women struggling with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a month now.  Haven&#x27;t experienced a real noticeable improvement yet, but I will continue taking it for 2 months to see if its full effect will be perceptible.</li>
            <li> I really love the teraputics phytoceramides, I am in my 50s ,I have used them before so couldn&#x27;t wait to order them again, my skin looks and feels very soft and creamy especially on my legs. This is were I noticed the big difference Ive only taken them for one month so cant wait to see the results with using the product again. I will post again after the next couple of months looking for more results on my hands and face.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I read a lot of positive reviews about it. I got it quick and the company has quick follow up.  This is impressive to me because it means that they believe in their product, back it up, and stay in contact with the client.  I just started using it, so we will see in a couple weeks what the results will be, but their customer service thus far has made me feel confident I bought the right brand.</li>
            <li> Really noticed a difference in overall skin quality.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Phytoceramides for about two months now and my skin complexion getting a lot smoother.  I have gotten such compliments on how good my skin looks.  I will continue to use it and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have only been using them for a few days so I haven&#x27;t seen results yet. From the reviews that I have read it sounds like I wont be disappointed. I will post again with my results.</li>
            <li> Delivered very timely and product is as stated.  I did research before ordering, and this product contained all of the essentials that were stated in articles as important to have in phytoceramide supplements.  I will order these again!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve been using this only a month. No adverse Side effects except rings are harder to take off. My skin is less dry and it plumps up my face. Seeing small but beneficial improvement to the fine lines...</li>
            <li> I am very pleased so far with this product.  I&#x27;ve only been taking Phytoceramides for 2 weeks and already notice the small bumps on my arms have disappeared.  Looking forward to more results!</li>
            <li> Great product. Skin is much softer and moisturized.</li>
