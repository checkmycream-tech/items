    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>After reading the ingredients in this thing I was really impressed and had to try it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>I have never been so impressed with a beauty product, and I use a lot of them.</li>
            <li>Great way to shop!</li>
            <li>I was impressed with both</li>
            <li>Sigh...the search continues for the perfect non-toxic serum.</li>
            <li>Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>Great price at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is good, loved the way it made my face feel...but do NOT buy this for $59.95!  </li>
            <li>liked it, but WILL NOT pay almost $60 for it!</li>
            <li>I always get comments on how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Makeup goes on nicely over the face serum.  </li>
            <li>thing--in my case (and perhaps in the case of the person who gave it the one star review?) it has to be applied ALONG WITH (or AFTER) applying some kind of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I honestly did not expect it to work as well as it did</li>
            <li>I bought this, and I give it 3 stars because I do love the consistency, and the fact that it does feel very refreshing when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth serum that smells good, but no results</li>
            <li>This makes for a very smooth texture to the skin and allows the Eclos moisturizer to go in better.  </li>
            <li>I Love Eclos products.  </li>
            <li>Like others here I bought this on a whim--it was on sale at Walgreens--and because it is vegan-friendly, unlike so many \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite in the Eclos line.</li>
            <li>Sure, I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li>and I continue to buy more.</li>
            <li>It should be noted that I also have been getting Botox, juvaderm, chemical peels for many years.</li>
            <li>I used it up, liked the way my skin felt more comfortable, but forgot about it.</li>
            <li>I do love this product, however it is pricey</li>
            <li>It has produced better results than my Retin A does.</li>
            <li>I love that it is also a nice, light moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>sure I see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles to combat, so that might be it, but I do like this serum in conjunction with the face cream and the eye cream.</li>
            <li>I love the eclos line of products.  </li>
            <li>I am relatively happy with the new product I tried.  </li>
            <li>The product feels refreshing and light going on, but I&#x27;m not 100%</li>
            <li>This serum is easy to use,</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t like this particular product, this is a good company and they care about their customers and their experience.</li>
            <li>I used this product twice a day for six months and did not notice any reduced fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This product  makes your skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I heard such great reviews on this.</li>
            <li>They also sent me a coupon for a free item from their company, so I could try something else and made recommendations.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and works well under cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s freaking amazing, really.</li>
            <li>Use this after every shower and provides a silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m oily, but I do like to put something light on my face before I apply makeup, and this fits the bill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, it spreads easily.</li>
            <li>I had received a sample of this serum, which I loved...smelled clean and my skin felt really smooth.  </li>
            <li>It reduces (without eliminating) fine lines, but also seems to make my skin as a whole more radiant and smooth-looking.</li>
            <li>texture is light and is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product, but I did not notice any difference in my skin after 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Received quickly, too.</li>
            <li>have tried many products and found this line to be more effective than some of the more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li>I also have the facial cleanser, which is mild and effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely gotten more compliments on how good my skin looks since starting to use it.</li>
            <li>It come from a good skin care line with other products to choose from also.</li>
            <li>They are not harsh on my skin, has given me a really smooth complexion and for 31 I still get told I look like im 25, so I must be doing something right?!</li>
            <li>Right now, this is my go-to line of face care products.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a little over a week now and it appears to be having good results.</li>
            <li>I have to be consistent with the use of both - 3 -5 times per week, if not nightly.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for about a month and will most definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>have pretty irritable acne and have not had a problem with it clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe I see a change for the better regarding the deep wrinkles around my mouth.</li>
            <li>The crows feet are all but gone, unless I laugh too much.</li>
            <li>Used it twice a day with Eclos moisture therapy cream for 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Could not see effect on wrinkle yet but skin appeared to have more glow.&lt;br /&gt;Bought both after read reviews saying Eclos did not cause break out which has been a life long problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;Exam</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be checking out the Eclos moisturizer next because this entire line of skin care products actually works and is an incredible value for the money.</li>
            <li>It all started with a large sample of this serum.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this - very high quality!</li>
            <li>This is the only face product that I have ever used that reduces pores and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>There was a noticeable difference almost immediately (to others and myself), a reduction in the appearance of red marks from acne scarring, and a reduction in fine lines and pore size.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference except for that.</li>
            <li>I really like the eclos cellular activator face serum.  </li>
            <li>Really like the Eclos products!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Using the 2 together has really helped my dry, aging skin removing fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30, and starting to develop fine lines all over my face, and after using this product for three weeks I can see a clear difference.</li>
            <li>You can get it elsewhere for the right price, this is over double what it should be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using prescription Retin-A at a medical concentration for over a decade, first for acne and then for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I try to stick with natural products as most other moisturizers contain parabens, proven to dry skin and cause wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and need to get into some anti-aging skin care.  </li>
            <li>I would say my not deep but totally obvious without makeup forehead and smile lines are NOTICEABLY diminished.</li>
            <li>And so far, no break outs (my skin is sensitive to most products which results in small, red pimply areas -- but that hasn&#x27;t happened with Eclos).</li>
            <li>This product made me have a lot more acne than usual, and it was the only thing I changed in that time frame.</li>
            <li>I have several products in this line, and it is my first time regularly using a face serum.</li>
            <li>How old is the serum and is it working to its potential or expired too???</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, I do prefer to use only products with natural, non-toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>faint smell and results are seen pretty quick.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, I do prefer to use only products with natural, non-toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> faint smell and results are seen pretty quick.</li>
            <li> the price of my other product -- while results are nearly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At home I typically moisturize, wait a few minutes, and then put the serum on; when I travel, I have a little bottle with mixed moisturizer and serum and that works fine too.</li>
            <li> Even after all this time, Retin-A STILL leaves my skin flaky, dry and red.</li>
            <li> Using the Eclos system has made my 47 year old skin look years younger after just 3 or so weeks of use: my skin is hydrated, little lines less noticeable, ruddiness calmed, and generally brightened.</li>
            <li> I have used other more expensive products and have not gotten the results this face serum gives me.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> I purchased two other Eclos products (facial scrub and mask) prior to purchasing this serum.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s a coincidence, but my skin is unusually smooth and zit-free lately.</li>
            <li> I am currently researching the ingredients in this product and have found some information that may lead me to purchase a different, less toxic product line.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive products in the past and this works better.</li>
            <li> In less than a week my pores were noticeably smaller -</li>
            <li> , I have only been using it for a little over a month now-</li>
            <li> Although rather expensive, it is well worth money spent.</li>
            <li> Then a couple of weeks later, noticed my skin was dry and dull.</li>
            <li> that the second time I just removed it to a small jar and use it anyway..</li>
            <li> I did a little research on this product and was sorely disappointed to find out that phenoxyethanol (which is near the very top of the ingredients list) is considered to be some pretty nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it and use it along with another product I use everyday.</li>
            <li> That includes La Mer, which dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like not putting harsh chemicals on my face all the time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the whole line and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The lines on my face appeared worse after using this product.</li>
            <li> had a problem that it was so expensive and had a rebate in the box that expired 8/31/2013</li>
            <li> you apply the serum alone, it is slightly uncomfortable, and moreover doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> I have another very expensive plant stem cell product -- Eclos may not be inexpensive, but it is one-fifth</li>

            <li> I bought this product on a whim, having gone to the drug store to pick up something else. After reading the ingredients in this thing I was really impressed and had to try it. I&#x27;m 30, and starting to develop fine lines all over my face, and after using this product for three weeks I can see a clear difference. Also, it seems to have reduced my acne as well.

            <li> Bottle dispenser was defective</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product, but I did not notice any difference in my skin after 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product. I will continue to buy it and use it along with another product I use everyday.</li>
            <li> Great I d savor help reduce wrinkles, and essay to use. A must for all.</li>
            <li> I Love Eclos products.  They are not harsh on my skin, has given me a really smooth complexion and for 31 I still get told I look like im 25, so I must be doing something right?!</li>
            <li> had a problem that it was so expensive and had a rebate in the box that expired 8/31/2013 How old is the serum and is it working to its potential or expired too???</li>
            <li> I am skin care product junkie and have paid hundreds.  Recently ran out of my ususal cleanser. Ran to the drug store and grabbed this brand. I really liked it. So, decided to try the entire line.  This serum...texture is light and is easily absorbed into the skin. Will continue to use. Great price at Amazon.  Received quickly, too.</li>
            <li> This product  makes your skin feel smooth.  It has a nice fragrance.  It come from a good skin care line with other products to choose from also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every day as directed and I do not see any difference at all. The smell is not bad and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, it spreads easily. But it did not make a difference for me at all.</li>
            <li> This is the only face product that I have ever used that reduces pores and fine lines.  That includes La Mer, which dried out my skin.  I try to stick with natural products as most other moisturizers contain parabens, proven to dry skin and cause wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My skin shows me it loves this product.  It has a matted, smoothing, refining result and leaves no residue on skin surface.  I have another very expensive plant stem cell product -- Eclos may not be inexpensive, but it is one-fifth the price of my other product -- while results are nearly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup goes on nicely over the face serum.  And so far, no break outs (my skin is sensitive to most products which results in small, red pimply areas -- but that hasn&#x27;t happened with Eclos).</li>
            <li> I used this product twice a day for six months and did not notice any reduced fine lines or wrinkles. Nice smooth serum that smells good, but no results</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me. The lines on my face appeared worse after using this product. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I heard such great reviews on this. So I bought it , I have only been using it for a little over a month now- no results yet.</li>
            <li> This product made me have a lot more acne than usual, and it was the only thing I changed in that time frame. I used it for 2 weeks and I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference except for that. I called the company and they apologized, and said I should send it back to Amazon for a refund, which I did. They also sent me a coupon for a free item from their company, so I could try something else and made recommendations. I am relatively happy with the new product I tried.  Although I didn&#x27;t like this particular product, this is a good company and they care about their customers and their experience.</li>
            <li> I really like the eclos cellular activator face serum.  It goes on light and works well under cream.</li>
            <li> Like others here I bought this on a whim--it was on sale at Walgreens--and because it is vegan-friendly, unlike so many \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products. It&#x27;s actually the only \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; product I&#x27;ve ever gotten results from. I&#x27;ve definitely gotten more compliments on how good my skin looks since starting to use it. It reduces (without eliminating) fine lines, but also seems to make my skin as a whole more radiant and smooth-looking. (I have not tried it for pores.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing--in my case (and perhaps in the case of the person who gave it the one star review?) it has to be applied ALONG WITH (or AFTER) applying some kind of moisturizer. (I use the Solar Sense skin restoration (or whatever it&#x27;s called) moisturizer, but I assume you could use any moisturizer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you apply the serum alone, it is slightly uncomfortable, and moreover doesn&#x27;t seem to work. At home I typically moisturize, wait a few minutes, and then put the serum on; when I travel, I have a little bottle with mixed moisturizer and serum and that works fine too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Leaves your face feeling refreshed and invigorated. This is my favorite in the Eclos line.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I grew up in the Arizona sun.  Sure, I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;m 35, but I was getting a lot of wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.  My co-worker thought I was in my forties, so I determined to find something to make me look my age and found this.  I&#x27;ve been using this now for 10 months and my wrinkles are almost gone.  I had a conversation with a cashier who carded me and I said, &amp;#34;really, carded?  I&#x27;m 35&amp;#34; and they thought I looked 25.  This serum is easy to use, faint smell and results are seen pretty quick.</li>
            <li> This works wonders.  I have used other more expensive products and have not gotten the results this face serum gives me.&lt;br /&gt;Get the whole line and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My face feels softer, looks clearer. I have used this product for a little over a week now and it appears to be having good results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year and I continue to buy more. I always get comments on how good my skin looks. It should be noted that I also have been getting Botox, juvaderm, chemical peels for many years. So, it is not ALL the ECLOS serum.</li>
            <li> It all started with a large sample of this serum. I used it up, liked the way my skin felt more comfortable, but forgot about it. Then a couple of weeks later, noticed my skin was dry and dull. This made me remember this serum which I found here and ordered (at 24% off, too!) My skin perked back up and I haven&#x27;t looked back since. Using the Eclos system has made my 47 year old skin look years younger after just 3 or so weeks of use: my skin is hydrated, little lines less noticeable, ruddiness calmed, and generally brightened. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This makes for a very smooth texture to the skin and allows the Eclos moisturizer to go in better.  Using the 2 together has really helped my dry, aging skin removing fine wrinkles. I have to be consistent with the use of both - 3 -5 times per week, if not nightly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good, loved the way it made my face feel...but do NOT buy this for $59.95!  I bought it on Amazon a couple of months ago for $22! You can get it elsewhere for the right price, this is over double what it should be.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it, but WILL NOT pay almost $60 for it!</li>
            <li> I do love this product, however it is pricey and I find it now and then at Ross Stores for a fraction of the cost here.</li>
            <li> Since I purchased this product along with the cream, I&#x27;ve noticed a visible improvement in skin tone and a reduction in wrinkle lines-one was fairly deep.  I put the serum on and then apply the cream over it.  Have been using it for about a month and will most definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using prescription Retin-A at a medical concentration for over a decade, first for acne and then for wrinkles. Even after all this time, Retin-A STILL leaves my skin flaky, dry and red. It works, but with essentially the outcome of &#x27;face dandruff&#x27; which is ultra gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product on a total whim because it was on clearance at Rite Aid. Wow. I have never been so impressed with a beauty product, and I use a lot of them. I would say my not deep but totally obvious without makeup forehead and smile lines are NOTICEABLY diminished. It&#x27;s freaking amazing, really. It has produced better results than my Retin A does. And I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week. I wish I&#x27;d done a before picture for you. And it&#x27;s cheaper. I like not putting harsh chemicals on my face all the time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am a total fan and will probably stay on this and layoff the retin-A. I love that it is also a nice, light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty irritable acne and have not had a problem with it clogging my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Eclos!</li>
            <li> Really like the Eclos products!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products and found this line to be more effective than some of the more expensive department store brands. Everyone is going to wrinkle at some point but these products seem to relax my \\&quot;time lines\\&quot;. I noticed a difference within a week of use (I use the serum and regenerative cream twice daily w/sunscreen in AM).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package arrived within a week and intact. Great way to shop!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and need to get into some anti-aging skin care.  I had received a sample of this serum, which I loved...smelled clean and my skin felt really smooth.  I will also buy the cream and eye cream.  I use day and night.  I am acne prone and this has not caused any breakouts.  I highly recommend this - very high quality!</li>
            <li> I like the measured pump and the silky feel of it on my skin. I believe I see a change for the better regarding the deep wrinkles around my mouth. The crows feet are all but gone, unless I laugh too much.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic! Use this after every shower and provides a silky smooth skin. Although rather expensive, it is well worth money spent.</li>
            <li> I purchased two other Eclos products (facial scrub and mask) prior to purchasing this serum. I was impressed with both so I decided to give this a go too. Wow! I am so glad I did. There was a noticeable difference almost immediately (to others and myself), a reduction in the appearance of red marks from acne scarring, and a reduction in fine lines and pore size. I honestly did not expect it to work as well as it did and I intend to continue using this product until I can&#x27;t find it anymore. I&#x27;ll be checking out the Eclos moisturizer next because this entire line of skin care products actually works and is an incredible value for the money. I have tried expensive products in the past and this works better. I am an Eclos believer!</li>
            <li> I have several products in this line, and it is my first time regularly using a face serum. The product feels refreshing and light going on, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure I see a difference in my skin. I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles to combat, so that might be it, but I do like this serum in conjunction with the face cream and the eye cream. I also have the facial cleanser, which is mild and effective. Right now, this is my go-to line of face care products.</li>
            <li> Like others, I bought this product set on a whim. I bought the traveler&#x27;s pack at RiteAid (on sale) and thought I&#x27;d use it as a sample. In less than a week my pores were noticeably smaller - I&#x27;ve never had this happen before. (I&#x27;m in my 6th decade and have tried a lot of products!) I&#x27;ve been using a much more expensive serum, wash and eye cream (Borghese). I&#x27;m now buying these products from Amazon (for ease and price).</li>
            <li> I am currently researching the ingredients in this product and have found some information that may lead me to purchase a different, less toxic product line.</li>
            <li> I bought this, and I give it 3 stars because I do love the consistency, and the fact that it does feel very refreshing when you put it on. I&#x27;m oily, but I do like to put something light on my face before I apply makeup, and this fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, I do prefer to use only products with natural, non-toxic ingredients. I did a little research on this product and was sorely disappointed to find out that phenoxyethanol (which is near the very top of the ingredients list) is considered to be some pretty nasty stuff. Sigh...the search continues for the perfect non-toxic serum.</li>
            <li> I love the eclos line of products.  The smell is slighty medicinal but reminds me of spa treatment.  My skin glows after using these products.</li>
            <li> I have become a total fan of the Eclos products but have received two of the Serum packages and the pump doesnt work!  I like it enough that the second time I just removed it to a small jar and use it anyway..</li>
