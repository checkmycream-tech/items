            <li>This is my favorite fragrance of all time--classy and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Ladies love this cologne...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite and she didn&#x27;t expect me to get it before Christmas, if at all.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments from men when I wear it.  </li>

            <li>Glad to see they&#x27;ve made the correction</li>
            <li>Been using this brand/fragrance for many years.  </li>
            <li>my mom love this perfum, evry year I gift for chrismas</li>
            <li>Most perfumes give me a headache but never nina ricci.</li>
            <li>There are no words to describe how I love the scent from this perfume&#x27; I have used it for years.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>She has an arsenal of scents but this is her all time favorite.</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mine for years.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love colognes and perfumes, these are some of my favorite ones.</li>
            <li>Am pleased with the seller, well wrapped and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>A Very clean, feminine smell</li>
            <li>I would have liked a larger one, but I&#x27;m happy I found this one anyway.</li>
            <li>She wanted the real perfume as opposed to the Eau d&#x27;toliet spray, so even tho this was more spendy, she liked it much better.</li>
            <li>However, the smell of this perfume is so strong for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for well over 40 years &amp; was thrilled to find it on Amazon at such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li>still love this very feminine fragrance!</li>
            <li>I love this parfum by Nina Ricci, it always brings me positive attention when I wear it</li>
            <li>This bottle which I paid a good amount does not even last 1 hour.  </li>
            <li>I have worn L&#x27;air Du Temps for 40 years and am always complemented on how it smells so clean and fresh, not over powering</li>
            <li>Always have loved this - however it took so long to get it........</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is still nice but the long term scent seems to be missing a deeper note I loved.</li>
            <li>My thanks!</li>
            <li>The thing people have to remember,is you should not be able to smell it on yourself only others should smell your scent.</li>
            <li>Those positive reviews are not from those of us who have used the product for three decades or longer.  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Really???</li>
            <li>I as a man do not know much beyond that</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, despite warning it might take  3-5 days for Prime.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Air Du Temps is a classic feminine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>A classic.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a classic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;ve had and have so many of the dove-topped bottles, that I was excited to order it in a sleek, modern spray container (there were only a few left</li>
            <li>so I believed it to be the NEW packaging).  </li>
            <li>It is a soft floral that never overwhelms.</li>
            <li>rarely use any other fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old enough to know</li>
            <li>When I ordered this product recently I expected to get exactly what was pictured above - that container and all.  </li>
            <li>It is the only scent I can use since I am very allergic to other scents.  </li>

            <li> It is the only scent I can use since I am very allergic to other scents.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this classic scent, among a few others, all my life.  </li>
            <li> Has darker color than normal but absolutely NO scent!!!</li>
            <li> The Eau De Parfum Spray is becoming difficult to find.</li>
            <li> However, this time (I read other reviews where people got a different bottle than what was ordered)</li>
            <li> I had heard they have changed the scent a bit and unfortunately, this is true.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Disappointingly it was the same old, same old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have tried others in years past but always came back to this.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts all day, and I don&#x27;t need to use a heavy spray.  </li>
            <li> I had not bought any of this perfume in years and had been missing it.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews were rather negative, but I decided to try it anyway, mainly due to the price.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this perfume in the past and it smelled all day.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, I was anxious to receive my L&#x27;air Du Temps.  </li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed because this product has been literally &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; so much so that you don&#x27;t even get the scent while spraying it on.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was the bottle with the doves inside and not the other style pictured.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years - and subtle whiffs of the scent are enticing.</li>
            <li> But I was not happy!</li>
            <li> Terrible rip-off!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Both have changed for the worst.  </li>

            <li> Gift for my mother who loves the fragrance</li>
            <li> Never had the authentic perfume of L&#x27;Air DuTemps before but the price of this bottle was extrordinary, so I ordered it.  Love the cologne, but the aura of the perfume stays with me and even I can smell it.  Everyone remarks about the aroma and many people have commented on the delightful odor.  I am very pleased with this product.  It arrived in a timely fashion and the bottle is beautiful---authentic Nina Ricci!</li>
            <li> I have used this scent since 1980.  It is the only scent I can use since I am very allergic to other scents.  It is a nice light scent that no one minds.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance of all time--classy and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Ladies love this cologne...I have been buying it for the women in my life for years. It makes a hit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite and she didn&#x27;t expect me to get it before Christmas, if at all. I&#x27;ll do it again later.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Air Du Temps is a classic feminine fragrance.  I get so many compliments from men when I wear it.  It is a soft floral that never overwhelms.</li>
            <li> One of the cleaner scents on the market. Very light flora. Definitely worth the price. My wife will wear nothing else and it&#x27;s been that way for 35 years.</li>
            <li> Terrible rip-off!  Has darker color than normal but absolutely NO scent!!!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s mom loves this perfume and has worn it for many years.  She wanted the real perfume as opposed to the Eau d&#x27;toliet spray, so even tho this was more spendy, she liked it much better.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent! Timeless</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the shipping. However, the smell of this perfume is so strong for me. It is just not my perfume.</li>
            <li> I have worn L&#x27;air Du Temps for 40 years and am always complemented on how it smells so clean and fresh, not over powering</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this I have purchased this perfume in the past and it smelled all day.  This bottle which I paid a good amount does not even last 1 hour.  Will never purchase perfume on line again.</li>
            <li> I have always found L&#x27;Air du Temps to be an enchanting fragrance...men are especially complimentary about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ve had and have so many of the dove-topped bottles, that I was excited to order it in a sleek, modern spray container (there were only a few left so I believed it to be the NEW packaging).  Disappointingly it was the same old, same old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love this very feminine fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is the perfume that I remember, however, it came in a squat bottle with wings. Would have liked the the container shown as it is this one is too cumbersome to carry. Perfume is great and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I have worn L&#x27;Air Du Temps for 50 years. I love it!!!  Whenever I make a purchase I expect it to be the item shown on the website.  However, this time (I read other reviews where people got a different bottle than what was ordered) I thought I would get what I ordered.  Not so.  I got the glass bottle with the doves.  Really?  I wanted this container for travel-not a glass bottle.  Email us or contact us to see if we want the exchange product.  I decided not to return it as I needed the fragrance now for home as well so kept it.  But I was not happy!</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance ever and at a better price that department stores.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because my mother didn&#x27;t want the bottle with the doves on it.  When it arrived, as scheduled, wrapped it and put it under the tree.  Unfortunately it was the bottle with the doves inside and not the other style pictured.</li>
            <li> MY GIRLFRIEND JUST LOVE L&#x27;AIR DU TEMPS ,I TRY TO BUY THIS TWICE A YEAR FOR HER.</li>
            <li> Item was not same as one pictured.  Glad to see they&#x27;ve made the correction</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this product for years and always get compliments.  People want to know what I&#x27;m wearing.  When I ordered this product recently I expected to get exactly what was pictured above - that container and all.  I got a glass container with a big plastic dove on it.  The believe the product is the same but showing this picture is deceptive in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Greatest parfum ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this over 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;I rarely use any other fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Ilia</li>

            <li> Great scent! A little goes a long way, and lasts all day. I&#x27;ve used this for years - and subtle whiffs of the scent are enticing.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE HAS BEEN USEING THIS FOR YEARS and SHE LOVES IT  so I TRY TO KEEP HER WELL SUPPLYED</li>
            <li> A classic.  When you wear it you know why.  A lady has just entered the room. Even the botte is a winner!</li>
            <li> I think it is deceptive to show a picture of the metal container when what you&#x27;re going to ship is in a glass bottle. I know it says that the packaging may be different, but the difference between perfume in a metal container and perfume in a glass bottle is almost a different product. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister who was thrilled. She has an arsenal of scents but this is her all time favorite. I&#x27;m old enough to know it&#x27;s a classic. I as a man do not know much beyond that but as an Amazon customer I was particularly impressed with the always reliable service in terms of ordering and delivery which was very prompt.</li>
            <li> Purchased this version of L&#x27;Air Du Temps rather than the toilette water to discover they both have changed.  No longer does the fragrance lingers and stays on clothing.  Both have changed for the worst.  I am totally disappointed because this product has been literally &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34; so much so that you don&#x27;t even get the scent while spraying it on.  I have used both the toilette &amp; par fum for over 30 years and know the difference in the quality of the product then and now.  Those positive reviews are not from those of us who have used the product for three decades or longer.  Time to revisit Tresor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this parfum for years and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite of mine for years.  The fragrance lasts all day, and I don&#x27;t need to use a heavy spray.  After reading some of the reviews, I was anxious to receive my L&#x27;air Du Temps.  Some of the reviews were rather negative, but I decided to try it anyway, mainly due to the price.  The fragrance is great and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this classic scent, among a few others, all my life.  I wish they made a rollerball version to tuck in my purse for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> Mother was very excited to get this for mothers day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this fragrance for well over 40 years &amp; was thrilled to find it on Amazon at such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> I love colognes and perfumes, these are some of my favorite ones. The delivery with Amazon has always been a great experience, that is why I keep using Amazon for everything I like or need. Keep up the great work. you are the best!!!</li>
            <li> Great price on my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
            <li> I had not bought any of this perfume in years and had been missing it. I had heard they have changed the scent a bit and unfortunately, this is true. It is still nice but the long term scent seems to be missing a deeper note I loved. Am pleased with the seller, well wrapped and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL fragrance. Long-lasting, but not at all over-powering. Fast shipping, despite warning it might take  3-5 days for Prime.  I&#x27;m totally delighted (and I smell so good)! &amp;#60;smile&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Always have loved this - however it took so long to get it........</li>
