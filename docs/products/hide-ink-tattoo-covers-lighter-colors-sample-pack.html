    <ol>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t place it on and expect perfection since it does look best 24 hours AFTER you place it on.</li>
            <li>AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li>-There is no way that something is going to match perfectly on your skin</li>
            <li>It looks perfect &amp; even I can&#x27;t tell I have a ankle tattoo when I use this.</li>
            <li>If it matched it would have been perfect.  </li>
            <li>so I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to look perfect.</li>
            <li>so I could see which color best matched my skin.</li>
            <li>The color when I was finished was very good</li>
            <li>Hope this helps others because it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I have a tattoo on my wrist that cannot be covered by anything but these, which happen to work great.</li>
            <li>If I need to have my tattoo covered when in bright sunlight</li>
            <li>I had applied ivory  and another layer of fair.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and there was no combination of any of the colors I got to match my skin.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve done better with putting tape over it instead!</li>
            <li>You are better off with makeup!</li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING product.  </li>
            <li>Here is how I&#x27;ve used it with incredible success.  </li>
            <li>and it was kind of glossy which didn&#x27;t blend well with my skin</li>
            <li>To be honest if they have all the colors maybe I would have a chance at matching my skin.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The more it cracked, the more the tattoo showed through.</li>
            <li>it stood out more than the tattoo did</li>
            <li>I lightly tap any edges that look lifted, rinse with warm water and let it air</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sooooooo glad I have found this product</li>
            <li>but I need to blend better to match rest of my skin.</li>
            <li>Having a WAY better result now that I use makeup to cover them.</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>It does crack and i tried makeup over it and it took the makeup pretty good.</li>
            <li>which wasn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li>The next day before I head off to work the shine is gone and it blends great with my skin.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I might add light concealer around the edges.  </li>
            <li>You can tell there is something covering it and looks cheap.</li>
            <li>The first layer a shade darker than the top</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product, hoping it would cover up the tattoo on my arm for wedding/formal events.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>When it was freshly applied, I was happy with how it covered the black ink.</li>
            <li>This brought MORE attention to my tattoos, which completely defeated the purpose.</li>
            <li>Product was ok but not easy to apply to foot and needed 3 layers to be effective.</li>
            <li>The seller did ship them right away though.</li>
            <li>Covers very well, but because my skin is so oily it rubs off/gets flakey quickly.</li>
            <li>I knew to expect cracking and, sure enough, there was a lot of cracking.</li>
            <li>It lost some of its shine by the end of the first 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Firstly, two layers do not cover the tattoo fully at all.</li>
            <li>The next time I tried it, I followed the instructions to a T, making sure I did everything it said to do.</li>
            <li>It also said that it would look better the next day.</li>
            <li>Upon reading the reviews, I&#x27;d heard a few good things about it and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>So if you need two sheets or more to cover your tattoo and want to use the same tone, you&#x27;re out of lucky if you only bought one pack.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and waited 24-48 hours before really casting judgement.</li>
            <li>My skin is white with a light tan</li>
            <li>The whole process takes about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable even when I put make up over the tattoo cover.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these.  </li>
            <li>Covers really well</li>
            <li>it looks very cracked.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really bother reading the instructions.</li>
            <li>didnt work at all, honestly the biggest waste of money out there.</li>
            <li>Nothing ever matched (I&#x27;m very light skinned w a large black tattoo on my wrist).  </li>
            <li>like I wasted my money not even being able to make my tone.  </li>
            <li>It does say that dark colored tattoos will not be as easily covered, but after three coats I could still clearly define my tattoo.</li>
            <li>so I put a little foundation with a sponge over this to blend and if it&#x27;s too light</li>
            <li>If you really want to cover it over so that no one knows what your hiding, I think a sleeve is the only way to achieve it.</li>
            <li>it looks incredibly natural.  </li>
            <li>my old method was costing me a fortune and over 30 minutes for application.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>NONE of the skin tones came remotely close to matching and you can see my tattoo right through them.</li>
            <li>First, this pack only comes with ONE of each of the skin tones and they are not very big sheets.</li>
            <li>I wash my wrist, dry it, place product on, cover it with wet damp sponge and press lightly for over 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>This product will definitely work if you have distance between you and the public, but anyone up close would certainly know what it is</li>
            <li>However, the covers themselves are apparently not enough to look natural because it looked like I was wearing a tattoo-shaped bandaid, it seems SOME blending with makeup is required.</li>

            <li> The first 6-12 hours it looks like an ultra shiny crackly yucky mess with my tattoo still slightly visible.</li>
            <li> Next, I experienced enormous amounts of cracking, it looks disgusting.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too</li>
            <li> Second, yes cracks and wrinkles showed up like other reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, with so much cracking a lot of the black and blue ink showed through and on the 2nd day, the entire outline of the tattoo was visible as a blurred tattoo.</li>
            <li> just dried up and flaked off even when I tried to do multiple layers</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> not really what I was hoping for....very wrinkly....</li>
            <li> This product did not do what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> It is not worth even a single penny -.-</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviews say..</li>
            <li> Not worth the time unless your tattoo is very small and has no black in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having trouble blending it in with other makeup, has a shiny glare.</li>
            <li> I work for a company that requires all tattoos to be hidden.</li>
            <li> That caused the hide ink tattoo to start to dissolve into a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> waste.</li>
            <li> Makeup would rub off on my uniform and by the end of the day I could boldly see my tattoo :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t cost hardly anything.</li>
            <li> How hard could it be?</li>
            <li> I tried all of the different colors, none of them matched my skin color, and the cover up looks very fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very hard to apply to tattoos that are in hard to reach places like your ankle.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; the tattoo, it merely &amp;#34;camouflaged&amp;#34; it with it&#x27;s shiney, cracked, blotchy mess.</li>
            <li> It looked worse, if you could imagine that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried ALL the expensive tattoo makeup along with all tips and tricks.</li>
            <li> Creepy feel</li>
            <li> Total CRAP!</li>
            <li> Very fake looking.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it looked awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> By day 2 the Hide Ink tattoo still looked terrible</li>
            <li> It looked AWFUL.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When it was freshly applied, I was happy with how it covered the black ink. I knew to expect cracking and, sure enough, there was a lot of cracking. The more it cracked, the more the tattoo showed through. It lost some of its shine by the end of the first 24 hours. I had applied ivory  and another layer of fair. The color when I was finished was very good and I was hopeful that this was a solution. Unfortunately, with so much cracking a lot of the black and blue ink showed through and on the 2nd day, the entire outline of the tattoo was visible as a blurred tattoo. If you really want to cover it over so that no one knows what your hiding, I think a sleeve is the only way to achieve it. This product will definitely work if you have distance between you and the public, but anyone up close would certainly know what it is you are trying to hide.</li>
            <li> Horrible. doesn&#x27;t HIDE anything. it stood out more than the tattoo did</li>
            <li> I work for a company that requires all tattoos to be hidden. I&#x27;ve tried ALL the expensive tattoo makeup along with all tips and tricks. Nothing ever matched (I&#x27;m very light skinned w a large black tattoo on my wrist).  Makeup would rub off on my uniform and by the end of the day I could boldly see my tattoo :(&lt;br /&gt;  This is an AMAZING product.  Here is how I&#x27;ve used it with incredible success.  24 hours before work I apply this to my wrist. I wash my wrist, dry it, place product on, cover it with wet damp sponge and press lightly for over 30 seconds. The paper then glides off.  I lightly tap any edges that look lifted, rinse with warm water and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;  The first 6-12 hours it looks like an ultra shiny crackly yucky mess with my tattoo still slightly visible. The next day before I head off to work the shine is gone and it blends great with my skin.  The second and third day it&#x27;s on my skin it looks incredibly natural.  Sometimes I might add light concealer around the edges.  If I need to have my tattoo covered when in bright sunlight I put two layers on 24hrs in advance. The first layer a shade darker than the top layer.&lt;br /&gt;  This product has saved me! Just don&#x27;t place it on and expect perfection since it does look best 24 hours AFTER you place it on. I&#x27;m sooooooo glad I have found this product and so is my pocket book bc my old method was costing me a fortune and over 30 minutes for application. AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I would give this product 0 stars if that was possible... I was really excited to try this product, hoping it would cover up the tattoo on my arm for wedding/formal events. Firstly, two layers do not cover the tattoo fully at all. Next, I experienced enormous amounts of cracking, it looks disgusting. I would&#x27;ve done better with putting tape over it instead! This product is nothing like how it was described on the website. I will never be purchasing this again! And I suggest those of you who are considering it to please reconsider!! It is not worth even a single penny -.-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having trouble blending it in with other makeup, has a shiny glare. Covers actual tattoo but I need to blend better to match rest of my skin.</li>
            <li> I would not get this product again it looked like I put shiny duct tape on my back and it didn&#x27;t even cover my tattoo even with two layers on.</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions then tried some of the alternate methods suggested it did not work at all just dried up and flaked off even when I tried to do multiple layers and it was kind of glossy which didn&#x27;t blend well with my skin</li>
            <li> Covers very well, but because my skin is so oily it rubs off/gets flakey quickly.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and waited 24-48 hours before really casting judgement. Does this cover tattoos? Yes. Does it look like my skin? Not really. First, this pack only comes with ONE of each of the skin tones and they are not very big sheets. So if you need two sheets or more to cover your tattoo and want to use the same tone, you&#x27;re out of lucky if you only bought one pack. Second, yes cracks and wrinkles showed up like other reviews mentioned. Eventually they did *sort of* look like my skin in that aspect. However, the covers themselves are apparently not enough to look natural because it looked like I was wearing a tattoo-shaped bandaid, it seems SOME blending with makeup is required.</li>
            <li> Product was ok but not easy to apply to foot and needed 3 layers to be effective. Delivery was quick. Efficient service but disapointing product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money. I have tattoos on my inner ankles that I nee to cover in the spring and summer when I wear dresses to work. NONE of the skin tones came remotely close to matching and you can see my tattoo right through them. Having a WAY better result now that I use makeup to cover them.</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviews say.. If these didn&#x27;t work - you are not using them correctly. My skin is white with a light tan so I get Olive -There is no way that something is going to match perfectly on your skin so I put a little foundation with a sponge over this to blend and if it&#x27;s too light then I add a tiny bit of bronzer with a brush. It looks perfect &amp; even I can&#x27;t tell I have a ankle tattoo when I use this. The whole process takes about 5 minutes. Hope this helps others because it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Does not blend well with skin. Might as well use a band aid instead. Very noticeable even when I put make up over the tattoo cover.</li>
            <li> To be honest if they have all the colors maybe I would have a chance at matching my skin.  If it matched it would have been perfect.  I wanted to hide a scar not a tattoo.  I did not want to keep buying packages until I found my matching color.  They should sell smaller squares cheaper to try out to match your skin tone and then you could buy a pack of your tone only.  I felt like I wasted my money not even being able to make my tone.  They do stay on quite well and feels like skin.. Creepy feel but it moves with you.  It does crack and i tried makeup over it and it took the makeup pretty good.</li>
            <li> I ran out so this is my third order. I have a tattoo on my wrist that cannot be covered by anything but these, which happen to work great. If these do not work for you, then you are not using them correctly. Take your time and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these.  I bought them for a photos hoot and they didn&#x27;t work as described.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I have used these on surgery scars and tattoos. If applied correctly and moisturizer they do work.  And they don&#x27;t cost hardly anything.</li>
            <li> didnt work at all, honestly the biggest waste of money out there. i tried every shade and none of them even close to worked, wish i would have tried make up or something</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Made my skin look wrinkly and itched after I took it off</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and there was no combination of any of the colors I got to match my skin. It does say that dark colored tattoos will not be as easily covered, but after three coats I could still clearly define my tattoo. It left me dry and was SUPER hard to get off later. Not worth the time unless your tattoo is very small and has no black in it.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews prior to purchasing so I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to look perfect. By day 2 the Hide Ink tattoo still looked terrible so I tried to put makeup over it. That caused the hide ink tattoo to start to dissolve into a sticky mess. I had to scrub it off which wasn&#x27;t easy. Waste of money and time.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product and will not use it again.</li>
            <li> okay...not really what I was hoping for....very wrinkly....</li>
            <li> Covers really well but close up it looks very cracked. Lasts a long time too</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t look natural. It looks like you have plastic on you. It&#x27;s also very hard to apply to tattoos that are in hard to reach places like your ankle. Stick to cover up make-up. The skin tones are way off as well. Very fake looking. The seller did ship them right away though.</li>
            <li> I tried all of the different colors, none of them matched my skin color, and the cover up looks very fake. You can tell there is something covering it and looks cheap.</li>
            <li> This product did not do what I expected it to do. Yes, it&#x27;s very easy to apply. It&#x27;s essentially one of those tattoos that you&#x27;d get from the 50 cent machines that you apply with water. Unfortunately, it looked awful. Upon reading the reviews, I&#x27;d heard a few good things about it and decided to try it. I ordered the sample pack so I could see which color best matched my skin. When I applied it, I thought I could wing it so I didn&#x27;t really bother reading the instructions. How hard could it be? Upon applying it, it had INSTANTLY cracked. It looked AWFUL. It was like having wall texture covering my tattoo. So then I figured it was just my application method.The next time I tried it, I followed the instructions to a T, making sure I did everything it said to do. It also said that it would look better the next day. It didn&#x27;t. It looked worse, if you could imagine that. It didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; the tattoo, it merely &amp;#34;camouflaged&amp;#34; it with it&#x27;s shiney, cracked, blotchy mess. This brought MORE attention to my tattoos, which completely defeated the purpose. Will never order these again, not even if they paid me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like if you got a temporary tattoo, it occasionally peels and is very obvious</li>
            <li> Total CRAP! Doesn&#x27;t cover up tattoos at all. Trust me, don&#x27;t. waste. your. money!!!! You are better off with makeup!</li>
