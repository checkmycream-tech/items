            <li>Much shorter than expected.</li>
            <li>A little on the brown side of black when sun shines on it, I was hoping for a more unnatural blue-black  </li>
            <li>Would like to have had it be less black and more on the dark brown side.  </li>

            <li> Would like to have had it be less black and more on the dark brown side.  </li>
            <li> Still a great, delicate piece that doesn&#x27;t look as bushy and wirey and fake as other clips I&#x27;ve had like this.</li>
            <li> I ordered black which was an off black and matched very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not deep brown, it&#x27;s coal black.</li>
            <li> It is a little short</li>
            <li> Only downside is im not sure how durable the clip will be after continuous use.</li>
            <li> Its not too long or too heavy and looks</li>
            <li> And way too dark.</li>
            <li> A little shorter than I thought</li>
            <li> The clip was broken and the hair wasn&#x27;t even attached properly to the clip to began with.  </li>
            <li> It is very obvious that this is fake.</li>
            <li> I specifically purchased a BLACK one for someone with BLACK hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I would order this again as its preety and DOES look like my hair which is this color and thick!</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> if you gave fewer stars because the color is wrong....</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t because I HAVE BLACK HAIR!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worst purchase ever and will &amp;#34;NEVER&amp;#34; purchase from this seller ever, ever again</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair clip I bought! Only downside is im not sure how durable the clip will be after continuous use. I wear it everywhere I go! Looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I loved mine. Did my hair in no time and clipped it right in. Every one thought it was my real hair. Lots of compliments. If you&#x27;re wondering ny nationality is Colombian (hispanic).</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim without knowing what to expect. I get compliments on mine ALL the time and it really blends in with your natural hair. I never would have thought that for this cheap of a price I&#x27;d get so much out of it.</li>
            <li> I wish the curls were looser but I love this piece anyways! This thing will hold on for all day wear the hair is quality! matched my hair perfect ! Came super fast about 7 days after I purchased it Just great quality looks natural too moves nicely! I wore this for about 5 hours and the curls stayed full no matting or tangling that I saw but I did see some flyaways. I will be ordering this product again and I will be purchasing from this buyer again!</li>
            <li> It is a little short but I like it.</li>
            <li> Very heavy but full and nice quality.</li>
            <li> Clip is strong enough so that when I shake my head hair piece stays firmly on and it looks good</li>
            <li> Looks like a rat&#x27;s nest.  Never wore it. Color off as well.</li>
            <li> Great quality hair, easily tangled.</li>
            <li> Worst purchase ever and will &amp;#34;NEVER&amp;#34; purchase from this seller ever, ever again</li>
            <li> A little shorter than I thought but it feels and looks like my hair! I WISH I COULD TONE the shine though as this is shinier than my hair but I love that its the same color and blends well. I would order this again as the claw clip is sturdy and easy to clip in. This has body in it and some wavey curls just like the picture shows but I wore it and am veryactive and the curls loosened up a bit. I would order this again as its preety and DOES look like my hair which is this color and thick! You have to match the color to yours to make it look real!</li>
            <li> Too curly. And way too dark. It&#x27;s not deep brown, it&#x27;s coal black. Disappointed. Wish the colors were more clear online</li>
            <li> Much shorter than expected. Would like to have had it be less black and more on the dark brown side.  And there are strings in the back. Don&#x27;t know what those are for.</li>
            <li> Love it....if you gave fewer stars because the color is wrong....that&#x27;s your error.  Its not too long or too heavy and looks very very naural...I&#x27;m gonna order another for a spare to keep in my desk.</li>
            <li> Shorter and not curled as nicely as it looks in the picture</li>
            <li> The clip was broken and the hair wasn&#x27;t even attached properly to the clip to began with.  Once again you get what you pay for!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27; looks real and feels real.  It clips on to your own hair easily and quickly.  It is a very good price too.</li>
            <li> Simply addorable to wear!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about the ponytail clips at first after looking at the other reviews, but I&#x27;m very happy with this product! I needed them to match a wig I already had, and they matched perfectly. They also arrived two weeks early from the expected arrival day, which is a great bonus!</li>
            <li> Received this today and it is RED - for a RED HEAD!!! I specifically purchased a BLACK one for someone with BLACK hair!!!! Looks like it will be a great way to wear a ponytail but I can&#x27;t because I HAVE BLACK HAIR!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is very obvious that this is fake.</li>
            <li> It feels real and looks too..</li>
            <li> I really love think this  hair piece.  I was really surprised how soft  and silky the hair felt.  It is so easy to take  care of.  I just need to finger comb it,  and it looks nice.  The curls stay bouncy.  I would recommend this hair piece.</li>
            <li> Super quick ship. Stayed in my hair very well. I ordered black which was an off black and matched very well</li>
            <li> Cute and looks very much as shown, but it tangles a little.  For the money it&#x27;s a bargain as it does look nice.</li>
            <li> Poorly made. And the length they advertised was not the length that came.</li>
            <li> A little on the brown side of black when sun shines on it, I was hoping for a more unnatural blue-black  but thats my fault for not asking! Still a great, delicate piece that doesn&#x27;t look as bushy and wirey and fake as other clips I&#x27;ve had like this.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the hair. I use it every day for work. Make getting ready for work quick and easy</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t create a natural or bouncy look at all. I ended up selling at a garage sale.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hairpiece. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful ponytail, look exactly in the pic. The shipping isn&#x27;t fast, but I like it.</li>
