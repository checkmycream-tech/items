            <li>Great, Wonderful, Excellent product.</li>
            <li>happy with the results</li>
            <li>This is a great product, just can&#x27;t always afford to buy it.</li>
            <li>Nioxin products are great.</li>
            <li>I already use the product and I was looking for a multipack and, of course, good pricing.</li>
            <li>Love Nioxin brand item.</li>
            <li>best prices we found were only on amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to be thicker and fuller and much more managable.</li>
            <li>glad I discovered Nioxin</li>
            <li>But it arrived quickly and pacakged nicely</li>
            <li>Again there was the issue with postage, thinking I was getting free postage for my order</li>
            <li>H&amp;H filled the bill.</li>
            <li>, now im able to take care of my sculpt and on top of that hair loss is very less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m thinking it works good</li>
            <li>I really ordered more than I wanted.</li>
            <li>This product has helped my fine thin hair look thicker and fuller with much more body, I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li>It was reasonable priced and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who wants full looking hair with body.</li>
            <li>I enjoy massaging this into just the hairline only.</li>
            <li>I really saw no difference while using this</li>
            <li>and I expected better from the nioxin line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product 3 weeks from now; and really I have noticed that hair is not falling the way it used to do before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While my hair is not thick, it has stopped falling out as much and is growing much faster than it ever has.</li>
            <li>Live and learn to pay attention.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li>I like this better then the Rogaine mousse because it is easier to apply directly to my scalp and not as messy as the mousse.  </li>
            <li>It did not work for me at all ,make my scalp mor sensitive ...</li>
            <li>but I sense there is slight growth using the full array of products</li>
            <li>I am on my third week of using this daily and I am seeing new hair growth where my hairline is receding.  </li>

            <li> This little bottle will last me a long time and will purchase again for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> SO really do not have a story of how it works.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of little short hairs coming out, and I see that there is a lot less falling out than before.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, but after about a month, I can definitely see that there is new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> and I use it every other washing.  </li>
            <li> I resently started loosing hair due to medications, and my hair designer told me about Nioxin...</li>
            <li> It would be easier to apply and not drip down my forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 45 days and my hair has stopped falling out.  </li>
            <li> will update again in a few months --</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few years now, won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Not sure this did anything.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy it at the salon I go to, but lately they haven&#x27;t been stocking it, so I turned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought myhair seemed worse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a bad thing to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> This is too expensive too.</li>
            <li> This crap made in Mexico</li>

            <li> Great product!  Wish Nioxin made these in larger bottles.</li>
            <li> Love Nioxin brand item. best prices we found were only on amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be thicker and fuller and much more managable. I would buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I am on my third week of using this daily and I am seeing new hair growth where my hairline is receding.  I like this better then the Rogaine mousse because it is easier to apply directly to my scalp and not as messy as the mousse.  I enjoy massaging this into just the hairline only. This little bottle will last me a long time and will purchase again for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I will update again in a few months -- should do before and after pics</li>
            <li> This product has helped my fine thin hair look thicker and fuller with much more body, I am very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, but after about a month, I can definitely see that there is new hair growth.  There is a lot of little short hairs coming out, and I see that there is a lot less falling out than before.</li>
            <li> Just never kept up with it. SO really do not have a story of how it works. But it arrived quickly and pacakged nicely</li>
            <li> I really saw no difference while using this and I expected better from the nioxin line. This is too expensive too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin 3 for about 4 months now. While my hair is not thick, it has stopped falling out as much and is growing much faster than it ever has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a bad thing to say about this product.  It does everything it&#x27;s advertised to do.</li>
            <li> glad I discovered Nioxin, now im able to take care of my sculpt and on top of that hair loss is very less.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product 3 weeks from now; and really I have noticed that hair is not falling the way it used to do before.&lt;br /&gt;im happy with the results</li>
            <li> Not sure this did anything.  I thought myhair seemed worse but I had an underlying condition that was causing all my problems</li>
            <li> I finally found a hair product that works and I use it every other washing.  It was reasonable priced and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a foam&lt;br /&gt; It would be easier to apply and not drip down my forehead. Too soon to know if my hair will grow back.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it makes my hair look fuller. Been using it for a few years now, won&#x27;t use anything else. I used to buy it at the salon I go to, but lately they haven&#x27;t been stocking it, so I turned to Amazon. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants full looking hair with body.</li>
            <li> I resently started loosing hair due to medications, and my hair designer told me about Nioxin...I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 45 days and my hair has stopped falling out.  It has shine and life to it.  Great, Wonderful, Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Product just as describes! Fast shipping! I will order again!</li>
            <li> It did not work for me at all ,make my scalp mor sensitive ...so don&#x27;t buy it . This crap made in Mexico</li>
            <li> I do not know if it&#x27;s wishful thinking but I sense there is slight growth using the full array of products</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m thinking it works good and it does NOT leave a film on your hair.....which is nice!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, just can&#x27;t always afford to buy it. Again there was the issue with postage, thinking I was getting free postage for my order I really ordered more than I wanted. Live and learn to pay attention.&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks&lt;br /&gt;Louise</li>
            <li> Nioxin products are great.</li>
            <li> I already use the product and I was looking for a multipack and, of course, good pricing. H&amp;H filled the bill.</li>
