            <li>This is by far the best after sun/sunburn product</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>The sun can be intense in San Diego, Maui Island is soothing, cooling and rehydrates the skin...and it smells good too!</li>
            <li>I burn easily and this works better than any aloe I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and burn easily regardless of how much sunscreen</li>
            <li>We continued using it throughout the vacation as his moisturizer just to make sure.</li>
            <li>Magically stuff, it helps my sunburn immediately.</li>
            <li>better than aloe vera</li>
            <li>It works much better than Aloe Vera on</li>
            <li>I have had it stop my skin from peeling after a medium sunburn, which turns into a better tan.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I tell everyone about it :)</li>
            <li>This product is an amazing product that helped cool, sooth and heal</li>
            <li>This is a must for anyone that gets too much sun or a burn of any kind!</li>
            <li>Amazing product - never fails!</li>
            <li>I wish they had these more easily available here in California --</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, which I find to be much too drying.</li>
            <li>This is \\&quot;really good stuff\\&quot; and works way better than just regular aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I have to say maybe it&#x27;s good after immediate sunburns, but for old burns, no..</li>
            <li>It really does cool the skin really nicely</li>
            <li>I first used it in Hawaii and am so glad that I can now get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin all cool and stops it from itching.</li>
            <li>The best stuff money can buy, you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li>I also like this gel better than coconut oil, which I had been using prior to it&#x27;s arrival, because it provides some cooling relief to burns.</li>
            <li>It does seem to work for the first night.</li>
            <li>Purchased tis for my daughter in law who is a red head and burns really easy</li>
            <li>We applied this to his back and arms a few times before bed and it truly did work great.</li>
            <li>The label does not lie, you really go from burn to brown.  </li>
            <li>these products are the real deal, won&#x27;t use anything else moving forward</li>
            <li>It really seems to increase healing time.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>but while at the beach my son got burned and this worked very well</li>
            <li>It works a lot better then other &amp;quot;aloe only&amp;quot; products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and not only does it smell great and dry fast, it actually works to both lessen the pain and redness.  </li>
            <li>when I became super burned while vacationing in Hawaii -- it really DOES turn your skin from red to brown.</li>
            <li>I loved that it smells good, doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste (on hands after applying) and how well it worked!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it necessarily turned it into a golden tan, but he didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; the next day and never peeled or was in pain.</li>
            <li>This is second only to fresh medicinal aloe vera.</li>
            <li>She felt less itchy and cool.</li>
            <li>It felt cool and soothing just like aloe but without the sticky, tight feeling when it dries.  </li>
            <li>No peeling, and by the end of the week it was like I was barely burned.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this!! I burn easily and this works better than any aloe I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It really does cool the skin really nicely</li>
            <li> The best stuff money can buy, you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love every product from this company!</li>
            <li> I went off of reviews for this and gave it a shot for our recent vacation. My husband tends to burn like a lobster and then requires aloe for the rest of the trip. Instead of the usual variety I buy at the store, I ordered this after reviewers claimed it &amp;#34;worked overnight&amp;#34; and would &amp;#34;turn burn into tan.&amp;#34; As predicted, my husband burned the first day. We applied this to his back and arms a few times before bed and it truly did work great. It was great relief for him and he never did end up peeling (he ALWAYS peels). I wouldn&#x27;t say it necessarily turned it into a golden tan, but he didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; the next day and never peeled or was in pain. We continued using it throughout the vacation as his moisturizer just to make sure. And it didn&#x27;t seem as sticky as other aloes can. I wish the prices was a little lower for the size of the bottle, but some things are worth spending a little extra on I think. I definitely recommend this and will be stocking up for summer for our family!</li>
            <li> This is the best after sun lotion.  Used it Maui and Kauai and had to order some when I got home to Encinitas.  The sun can be intense in San Diego, Maui Island is soothing, cooling and rehydrates the skin...and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> Best on the market today - Great tan - actually goes on brown</li>
            <li> I bought this on vacation in Maui after I got a wicked burn.  IT&#x27;S A MIRACLE WORKER!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and not only does it smell great and dry fast, it actually works to both lessen the pain and redness.  Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Discovered this product on vacation in Hawaii.  Got a little burned on the beach and stopped in a store to get some aloe.  The clerk recommended this and said it was \\&quot;really good stuff\\&quot;.  Got back to the hotel and applied it.  It felt cool and soothing just like aloe but without the sticky, tight feeling when it dries.  Later that night, my skin noticeably went from red to tan.  It was like magic!  The label does not lie, you really go from burn to brown.  No pain, great smell, and it even delayed peeling.  The label says you can use it to treat burns, jellyfish stings, or just as a skin moisturizer.  This is \\&quot;really good stuff\\&quot; and works way better than just regular aloe vera.</li>
            <li> these products are the real deal, won&#x27;t use anything else moving forward</li>
            <li> Saved a family member from blisters after being burned on a cruise! This is a must for anyone that gets too much sun or a burn of any kind!</li>
            <li> Maui wowee. I was recommended this when I became &amp;#34;Crab Man&amp;#34; on a trip to Maui. No peeling, and by the end of the week it was like I was barely burned. Smells good, works good.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best stuff I have ever used for sun burns! I bought a bottle a number of years ago, when I became super burned while vacationing in Hawaii -- it really DOES turn your skin from red to brown. It&#x27;s like magic! Years later, i still had some, and went on a business trip to Vegas. My co-worker went to the pool, fell asleep and woke up LOBSTER RED! Thankfully, I had a bit more in the bottle and it worked WONDERS for her overnight! I wish they had these more easily available here in California -- I hate paying the pricey shipping fees and/or upcharges on the product :(</li>
            <li> Magically stuff, it helps my sunburn immediately.</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully</li>
            <li> better than aloe vera, but the shipping price is ridiculous.Have someone who is vacationing in Hawaii go to the ABC store and buy it for you. It&#x27;s only 9.00 there. Great stuff though!!!</li>
            <li> This product is an amazing product that helped cool, sooth and heal my sun burn - I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> very happy with the product and fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;have been using this product for sunburns for almost 10 years now since my wife and I found t while vacationing in Hawaii</li>
            <li> Amazing product - never fails!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a browning oil and came across this gel during my research. I love it! It works much better than Aloe Vera on it&#x27;s own, which I find to be much too drying. I also like this gel better than coconut oil, which I had been using prior to it&#x27;s arrival, because it provides some cooling relief to burns. I noticed my burn healed much faster than usual and there was no peeling.</li>
            <li> Trusted by this Maui regular.  This is second only to fresh medicinal aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product for several years and have it shipped to me in California. As a lifeguard there is no better product for the skin after a day too long out in the sun. Smells awesome too</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I first used it in Hawaii and am so glad that I can now get it through Amazon. It makes your skin all cool and stops it from itching. It works a lot better then other &amp;quot;aloe only&amp;quot; products. I have had it stop my skin from peeling after a medium sunburn, which turns into a better tan. I also use it successfully on itchy bug bites. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Works great to heal a burn quickly!!!</li>
            <li> this was great! I loved that it smells good, doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste (on hands after applying) and how well it worked! My husband and I just returned from a vacation in Jamaica and we both got a lot of sun exposure even with using sunscreen we still had some red shoulder etc. this was so helpful in relieving pain associated as well as reducing the red and turning it to brown. We actually ordered another bottle our last day their knowing we&#x27;d need it for further applications this week. The only thing I would change is a bigger bottle for the same price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It really seems to increase healing time. Idk how but it does but it&#x27;s AMAZING. I have purchased this several times.</li>
            <li> Found this gem in Maui! It really works. You&#x27;re burn, you apply, then you&#x27;re brown. They nailed the naming of this product!</li>
            <li> We are sold on this aloe as it works 5 times faster then regular aloe.  And it smells sooo good.  We take it everywhere and I tell everyone about it :)</li>
            <li> Beyond Amazing! this stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best after sun/sunburn product I have ever used. I am very fair skinned and burn easily regardless of how much sunscreen I use.&lt;br /&gt;This prevents blisters and peeling. I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Purchased tis for my daughter in law who is a red head and burns really easy but while at the beach my son got burned and this worked very well</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom. She&#x27;s been suffering from sunburns for two years but refuses any medicine with chemicals unwanted. I read the good reviews of this product hoping it might work. It does seem to work for the first night. She felt less itchy and cool. But after two time of use, the skin became even dryer than before. I have to say maybe it&#x27;s good after immediate sunburns, but for old burns, no..</li>
            <li> The bestaloe product i have everused.  Great for sunburn and bug bites</li>
            <li> I found this product in Maui and continued to use it for 10 years.  Helps with minor sunburns and I feel that it helps with peeling.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, the only drawback is that shipping was a bit expensive when you compare it to the price of the product.</li>
