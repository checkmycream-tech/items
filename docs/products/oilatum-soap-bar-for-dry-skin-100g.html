    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>However, I still find this soap to be excellent for my skin</li>
            <li>For my eczema prone son, this is the best soap I have found.  </li>
            <li>For a non-drying skin soap it is still the best I have found</li>
            <li>This one, not even good for that!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Could  do not  have been a better experience, perfect.</li>
            <li>It has always had a pleasant smell but now is medicinal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the Oilatum we knew and loved.  </li>
            <li>Good soap for eczema.</li>
            <li>and it also is a good deodorant soap...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy to still be able to buy it.</li>
            <li>Delightful, exciting and familiar in a very lovely way!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing soap.  </li>
            <li>Just follow with a nice moisturizing creme afterwards.</li>
            <li>The old Oilatum was the best thing I ever found, just coincidentally, for removing lipstick stains from anything.  </li>
            <li>if you need safe soap for your feminine parts this is it.</li>
            <li>This is the favorite soap of my Mum.  </li>
            <li>This brand of soap works so well for me, I have used it for years and plan to use it for many more years.</li>
            <li>I have been using Oilatum soap for years and love it.</li>
            <li>This soap is perfect for not only my skin, but also my husband&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It does what was intended, I&#x27;ll order more when I run out</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an option any more.  </li>
            <li>I have try many products for eczema</li>
            <li>Way overpriced but it is the best soap for my extremely dry skin I have found.  </li>
            <li>Love the light scent of the soap, also.  </li>
            <li>Then one day it was no longer available in the stores - - or anywhere on line.</li>
            <li>It was available temporarily for awhile--even from Amazon, but at exorbitant prices.</li>
            <li>My face looks more moisturizer, and my smile lines are not as pronounced</li>
            <li>Stank of cheap scent.  </li>
            <li>I used the original Oilatum for 20+ years and was devastated when they discontinued it.</li>
            <li>the original had no fragrance.</li>
            <li>Thus far, I know that contains perfum suitable for a cheap whore.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this very effective great product for treating dry skin since 2012 in lieu of other soap bar products.  </li>
            <li>began using it about twenty years ago and found that unlike more commercial soaps it was better for my skin which was suffering from skin ulcers.</li>
            <li>I wish there was someone with more reliable knowledge of the history of the product who could tell us about the new product and how it stacks up against what is on the market today.</li>
            <li>I wonder if Stiefel Labs is aware this HK retailer is selling a version of their soap that is not the original Oilatum.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth having to pay to ship the Oilatum products from overseas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to buy it as I used to SWEAR BY IT...but can&#x27;t go that far any more.  </li>
            <li>Sometime later, I don&#x27;t recall when, it was available from Amazon at a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but I guess its because this is just the first bar.</li>
            <li>Both of us have sensitive skin and Oilatum soap leaves our skin smooth, soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that so many people have found Oilatum helpful for dry skin especially for this suffering from psoriasis and  </li>
            <li>now in 2014, with all the positive reviews, perhaps I should try it again.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not so positive.</li>
            <li>What I noticed was that the new bar had a distinct order...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s formulated so it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin as do most soaps.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, does not sting the eyes, non-drying.</li>
            <li>And it really helped my rosacea.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from the seller.</li>
            <li>What I found is NOTHING like the real product.</li>
            <li>This soap is very moisturizing without being oily.  </li>
            <li>It is as good as when it was made by the actual Stiefel pharma, no, I don&#x27;t understand why they had to change it...and at the same time DOUBLE the price, but I suppose it is whatever the market will bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because my parents can no longer purchase this at their local drugstore being able to order it on-line makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li>Alas, some things are gone for good.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t say that it was any less affective on my skin because I didn&#x27;t use it that long.</li>
            <li>My first clue should have been the packaging, which is not the same.</li>
            <li>This soap works well for him and his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>fast international shipping.  </li>
            <li>I will just have to find another soap that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wondered if some manufacturer had bought the name and was taking advantage of the fine name that would attract a rather small market of users that regretted the loss of a product that they relied upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way too pricey and not the same as the old non-scented Oilatum cleansing bar.  </li>
            <li>Especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I consider over $100 a bar excessive, but it was being shipped from England which I assumed was the last source of the original supply.</li>
            <li>but since I ordered it in a foreign country it is too much headache and expense.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Because my parents can no longer purchase this at their local drugstore being able to order it on-line makes a big difference.  This soap works well for him and his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This soap has been around since I was a kid with alligator skin.  It seems to help and lasts a long time because it is so solid.</li>
            <li> if you need safe soap for your feminine parts this is it.</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed in this product. It is NOT  the same as the oilatum that Steiffel has sold in the USA over the last 20+ years. The companies in the UK and elsewhere misrepresent when they claim it is the same product with the same ingredients. I compared labels and it is not the same. It does not smell or feel the same. i would like to return it but since I ordered it in a foreign country it is too much headache and expense. I just chalk it up to a loss of the $45. ( I mistakenly ordered 6 bars based on the belief it was the same soap)</li>
            <li> Several years ago this soap was recommended to me to help with rosacea. It is gentle, does not sting the eyes, non-drying. And it really helped my rosacea. You would never know I ever had a problem. Then one day it was no longer available in the stores - - or anywhere on line. I&#x27;m so thankful it is back! I get compliments on my complexion all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00JPWWCZ0 Dead Girls Don&#x27;t Blog (Murder Blog Mysteries Book 1)]]</li>
            <li> Just received the soap from the UK.  It&#x27;s not the Oilatum we knew and loved.  Thus far, I know that contains perfum suitable for a cheap whore.  It wreaks.  The new manufacturers are too stupid to realize that people with particular needs and possibly problems bought the old Oilatum.  It was never inexpensive.  Do they not wonder why someone would pay such money for a bar of soap?  The last thing Oilatum fans probably wanted was a change in the formula and a perfume added.  I can&#x27;t bear the scent of it, so I may never use it.</li>
            <li> This is the favorite soap of my Mum.  She has used it for years and won&#x27;t try another brand. She swears by it to keep her skin from drying out in winter and being oily in summer.</li>
            <li> Soap is soothing to my rough hands, roughness and discomfort due to cold, dry weather.  Have problems with it every winter, it&#x27;s worse every winter.  Love the light scent of the soap, also.  It&#x27;s like Grandma used to smell!  Delightful, exciting and familiar in a very lovely way!</li>
            <li> This brand of soap works so well for me, I have used it for years and plan to use it for many more years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t for a minute think this is the same Oilatum that you used to buy in drugstores years ago.  It is now made in Brazil, not the US and only sold overseas or online.  It smells wretched!  I used the original Oilatum for 20+ years and was devastated when they discontinued it. I stocked up when I saw it online, but was so disappointed in the look, feel, smell and overall inferior quality.  Alas, some things are gone for good.  P.S.  The old Oilatum was the best thing I ever found, just coincidentally, for removing lipstick stains from anything.  This one, not even good for that!</li>
            <li> Could  do not  have been a better experience, perfect.</li>
            <li> Good soap for eczema. Bought for my kid who has very dry skin. It has started to improve after using. Fast shipping from the seller. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> my brother has some type of minor psoriasis and this is doing wondering for the drying out of his skin. Just follow with a nice moisturizing creme afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oilatum soap for years and love it. I have eczema, and it is the only soap I have found that does not make me break out in a rash. When my pharmacy said they could no longer get it, I decided to look online. What I found is NOTHING like the real product. My first clue should have been the packaging, which is not the same. This stuff smells TERRIBLE! It smells like a machine shop--really, no kidding! Gross.</li>
            <li> Way too pricey and not the same as the old non-scented Oilatum cleansing bar.  I was very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had ordered Oilatum soaps for my son who has excema. There is no marked improvement but I guess its because this is just the first bar.</li>
            <li> This soap is perfect for not only my skin, but also my husband&#x27;s. Both of us have sensitive skin and Oilatum soap leaves our skin smooth, soft, and clean. My dermatologist recommended it years ago and I have been using it ever since. I wish it were easier to get here in stores, but at least the delivery was right on time so no complaints there. I would use this provider again.&lt;br /&gt;Several months later: One reviewer wrote that this soap is different from the Oilatum we bought 20 or 30 years ago. That reviewer may be right or wrong. I don&#x27;t know. However, I still find this soap to be excellent for my skin and I&#x27;m so happy to still be able to buy it.</li>
            <li> what can I say?  It does what was intended, I&#x27;ll order more when I run out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that so many people have found Oilatum helpful for dry skin especially for this suffering from psoriasis and  eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using it about twenty years ago and found that unlike more commercial soaps it was better for my skin which was suffering from skin ulcers. Several years ago, however, the company ran into financial difficulties and closed. It was available temporarily for awhile--even from Amazon, but at exorbitant prices. I consider over $100 a bar excessive, but it was being shipped from England which I assumed was the last source of the original supply. Sometime later, I don&#x27;t recall when, it was available from Amazon at a more reasonable price. I ordered a couple of bars. What I noticed was that the new bar had a distinct order...the original had no fragrance. Honestly, I can&#x27;t say that it was any less affective on my skin because I didn&#x27;t use it that long. Changes in skin improvement in my experience with a chronic condition are very slow. The fragrance, however, told me that it wasn&#x27;t the same. I wondered if some manufacturer had bought the name and was taking advantage of the fine name that would attract a rather small market of users that regretted the loss of a product that they relied upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now in 2014, with all the positive reviews, perhaps I should try it again. The only thing that holds me back is to read the reviews of those who used Oilatum years ago. They&#x27;re not so positive. I wish there was someone with more reliable knowledge of the history of the product who could tell us about the new product and how it stacks up against what is on the market today.</li>
            <li> For my eczema prone son, this is the best soap I have found.  It&#x27;s worth having to pay to ship the Oilatum products from overseas.</li>
            <li> My Dad loves this stuff so I got some for him.  It is a little pricey but I guess that is because of the laws of supply and demand as they do not make it anymore.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing soap.  I have bought lots of homemade soaps and commercial soaps looking for one that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or filmy. This soap is very moisturizing without being oily.  Beats L&#x27;Occitane.  fast international shipping.  I will definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Have been using this very effective great product for treating dry skin since 2012 in lieu of other soap bar products.  Try it and you&#x27;ll see the difference between other soap bars.</li>
            <li> My face looks more moisturizer, and my smile lines are not as pronounced</li>
            <li> The bar stinks like a nursing home. Do not purchase this item. Especially if you have sensitive skin. I could smell the soap through the package.</li>
            <li> Did not like the way it smelled.</li>
            <li> For a non-drying skin soap it is still the best I have found and it also is a good deodorant soap...if you can handle the smell of the soap. I used to buy the non-scented...it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an option any more.  It is as good as when it was made by the actual Stiefel pharma, no, I don&#x27;t understand why they had to change it...and at the same time DOUBLE the price, but I suppose it is whatever the market will bear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy it as I used to SWEAR BY IT...but can&#x27;t go that far any more.  What a SHAME that GSK couldn&#x27;t just leave well enough alone.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced but it is the best soap for my extremely dry skin I have found.  When I couldn&#x27;t get it I switched to Basis because of my dermatologists recommendation and as the weather got cold I began to break out with winter eczema.  Started using Oilatum again and the problem along with the itching is gone</li>
            <li> They have changed the formula since Stiefel was bought by another company.  It has always had a pleasant smell but now is medicinal.  Nothing wrong with the order service.  I will just have to find another soap that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have try many products for eczema and I find this product works. It puts moisture back in your body.</li>
            <li> This soap is the same one I have bought for years whenever I was visiting the UK.  It&#x27;s formulated so it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin as do most soaps.  Nor does it irritate skin with stinky perfumes.  Recently I tried Oilatum under the same name and brand but from a Hong Kong retailer.  It was absolutely a different disgusting soap.  Stank of cheap scent.  The ingredients were totally different.  I threw all the bars in the bin.  Only buy it from the UK.  I wonder if Stiefel Labs is aware this HK retailer is selling a version of their soap that is not the original Oilatum.  Buyer beware!</li>
