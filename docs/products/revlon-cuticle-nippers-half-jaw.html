            <li>When I ordered these nippers for the 1st time, they were so good I even ordered ones for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Good clipper and this price was lower than purchasing it in the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>The size is good too for cuticles around the nails.</li>
            <li>These are way better, and cheaper, than the Tweezerman brand nippers I bought for $26!  </li>
            <li>What kind of product lasts just three weeks?</li>
            <li>product that I&#x27;d replace that quickly has to be good.</li>
            <li>I love this nippers.  </li>
            <li>they are used for cuticle trimming but for me they work awesome for my tiny toenails.</li>
            <li>This product is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this item.</li>

            <li>These are good, sturdy nippers and just the right size for small/medium hands.</li>
            <li>Good product at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I have owned other cuticle nippers and this one has been the best from all!</li>
            <li>They Are sharp and cut perfectly I have four of them.</li>
            <li>I finally tried Amazon and was so happy to find them here.</li>
            <li>Comfortable in hand and does the trick.</li>
            <li>The Revlon nips do the job clean and neatly without tearing.</li>
            <li>These cuticle nippers do the job and remove any cuticles in a clean and painless way.</li>
            <li>I decided that cuticle health was a great enough incentive to invest in a higher quality nipping instrument.  </li>
            <li>The design allows user to quickly move tension spring into use or not.</li>
            <li>They work well, but if you are making hand and nail health investment, perhaps there is a higher quality product available.</li>
            <li>Good quality snippers for a pretty low price.</li>
            <li>I get them pretty often too!</li>
            <li>These work great and are pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>The only way that I can take care of my nails is clipping and maintaining them looking nice.</li>
            <li>These things are sharp (so no tugging at half-cut cuticles), the spring is a good distance, and really I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re still reading this instead of buying them.</li>
            <li>I threw out a new pair of Trim brand nips as they tore my cuticles did not cut cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know where I came up with my first pair</li>
            <li>Excellent product quality for such a small price.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as sharp or effective as it could be.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I caused more damage by using these nippers...should have listened to the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, small and good for the fine work.</li>
            <li>They are super sharp and the spring mechanism is much better than the one on the Tweezermans, which constantly comes apart and pinches my hand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the retailers can mark these up so high?</li>
            <li>This is perfect to smooth out the little irregularities that otherwise would make me crazy.</li>
            <li>but I have been looking for a new pair for months.  </li>
            <li>They also smell better than bear scat left in the woods on a dark moonless night in October.</li>
            <li>They do cut a little better than using the back of a saw.  </li>
            <li>I accidentally broke my last pair (after 10+ years of use) and replaced them as fast as possible.</li>
            <li>Tried several other brands looking for sharp but safe cuticle nippers and this Revlon product is just what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>it that it gets dull and not sharp enough to cut clean after continued use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen much more expensive ones that didnt work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>On the third, the middle spring completely snapped.</li>
            <li>The Revlon blades tear the cuticle less than the store brand, and have a tighter blade alignment, but they are not the magic clean line I was hoping to achieve through nail grooming with a high quality instrument :(  </li>

            <li> The package itself was a little beat up, but the nippers were brand new.</li>
            <li> the quality has gone down - revlan jaws used to be super sharp, these were thick.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these over other brands.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these cuticle clippers because they&#x27;re sharp and dependable!</li>
            <li> I have had a nipper from Revlon for at least 10 years, it is as sharp as new.  </li>
            <li> These bad boys work a lot better than the pair I purchased at the drugstore as part of a &amp;#34;nail care&amp;#34; package.  </li>
            <li> I did not really want to spend the $12 retail for the Revlon nippers, but there is def a difference between these and the store brand.  </li>
            <li> The metal is not as thick as the old revlon nippers that is why I am not sure how long this will last.</li>
            <li> I read other online reviews that said the Revlon nippers close tight the entire length of the blades, and that they do not tear the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> I needed one for travel, this one is certainly not the one going with me.</li>
            <li> Ordered them again for the third time hoping that I would be lucky this time, but nippers were so bad they could not even cut cuticle, they were just ripping it off.</li>
            <li> Sharp and well made also they can be spring-loaded or not.  </li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> They are as sharp as could be!</li>
            <li> Half of what you would pay at a drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to find this in any local shops despite repeated efforts.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to add to title.</li>
            <li> This one is so dull it does not cut cuticles.  </li>
            <li> When I say &amp;#34;immediate&amp;#34;, I mean within 5 minutes I had already ordered my replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very dull, they pull instead of cut.</li>
            <li> I stupidly broke my last pair (no fault of the nippers; the spring bar got caught, I pulled, it broke), and immediately bought them again.</li>
            <li> I even tried the very expensive units made in Solingen, Germany, but prefer the Revlon unit.</li>
            <li> I have tried to buy cheaper nippers and have always been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate these nippers.</li>
            <li> Worthless purchase.</li>
            <li> I am So disappointed!!!</li>

            <li> The only way that I can take care of my nails is clipping and maintaining them looking nice. That&#x27;s the only way that i can prevent bitting my nails.</li>
            <li> I decided that cuticle health was a great enough incentive to invest in a higher quality nipping instrument.  These bad boys work a lot better than the pair I purchased at the drugstore as part of a &amp;#34;nail care&amp;#34; package.  I did not really want to spend the $12 retail for the Revlon nippers, but there is def a difference between these and the store brand.

            <li> When I ordered these nippers for the 1st time, they were so good I even ordered ones for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;But when I ordered them again, they turned out to be completely different and not so convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;Upd. Ordered them again for the third time hoping that I would be lucky this time, but nippers were so bad they could not even cut cuticle, they were just ripping it off. I am So disappointed!!! Hate these nippers.</li>
            <li> Good product at a very reasonable price.  I threw out a new pair of Trim brand nips as they tore my cuticles did not cut cleanly.  The Revlon nips do the job clean and neatly without tearing.</li>
            <li> Good quality snippers for a pretty low price.</li>
            <li> This product is just okay.  It isn&#x27;t as sharp or effective as it could be.  Coming from Revlon I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Good clipper and this price was lower than purchasing it in the pharmacy. Nice job!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I have been looking for. Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;SB</li>
            <li> They do cut a little better than using the back of a saw.  They also smell better than bear scat left in the woods on a dark moonless night in October.</li>
            <li> Great Seller. Product as described.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and this is my  4th or 5th one.The only problem Iw&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&lt;br /&gt;th it that it gets dull and not sharp enough to cut clean after continued use.</li>
            <li> I have had a nipper from Revlon for at least 10 years, it is as sharp as new.  This one is so dull it does not cut cuticles.  I use it as a toe nail clipper.  I needed one for travel, this one is certainly not the one going with me.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Works Well, Will do the job. Glad I purchased this item. Can&#x27;t say any more with out distorting the facts.</li>
            <li> They are as sharp as could be! They haven&#x27;t dulled one bit and I use them all the time for hangnails. I get them pretty often too! I would definitely recommend these cuticle clippers because they&#x27;re sharp and dependable!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.  The metal is not as thick as the old revlon nippers that is why I am not sure how long this will last.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product is Revlon</li>
            <li> I stupidly broke my last pair (no fault of the nippers; the spring bar got caught, I pulled, it broke), and immediately bought them again. When I say &amp;#34;immediate&amp;#34;, I mean within 5 minutes I had already ordered my replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any product that I&#x27;d replace that quickly has to be good. These things are sharp (so no tugging at half-cut cuticles), the spring is a good distance, and really I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re still reading this instead of buying them.</li>
            <li> Half of what you would pay at a drugstore.  I don&#x27;t know how the retailers can mark these up so high?</li>
            <li> the quality has gone down - revlan jaws used to be super sharp, these were thick. also the packaging in the pic is NOT what i received</li>
            <li> Es un producto de muy buena calidad y la entrega fue oportuna y en muy buenas condiciones. Recomiendo este vendedor.</li>
            <li> As a former nail biter, I still constantly fidget with my nails and cuticles. This is perfect to smooth out the little irregularities that otherwise would make me crazy.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised. Sharp and well made also they can be spring-loaded or not.  The design allows user to quickly move tension spring into use or not.</li>
            <li> Sharp, small and good for the fine work. I also like using this to trim the tops of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> These are way better, and cheaper, than the Tweezerman brand nippers I bought for $26!  I would definitely recommend these over other brands.  They are super sharp and the spring mechanism is much better than the one on the Tweezermans, which constantly comes apart and pinches my hand.</li>
            <li> Worthless purchase. This costs upwards of $20 in stores! Why? It started rusting within two weeks. On the third, the middle spring completely snapped. I don&#x27;t understand how this happens when it was only used moderately. What kind of product lasts just three weeks? Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this in any local shops despite repeated efforts.  I love having one and now I do!  Comfortable in hand and does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have used Revlon nippers for years.  They are great and they have a lifetime warranty.  Way to go Revlon.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I have tried to buy cheaper nippers and have always been disappointed. Revlon always make the best products. They Are sharp and cut perfectly I have four of them. I only buy Revlon brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cuticle clippers for years and needed a replacement pair. These work great and are pretty sharp. The size is good too for cuticles around the nails. I don&#x27;t think I would want anything bigger.</li>
            <li> Not much more to add to title. These cuticle nippers do the job and remove any cuticles in a clean and painless way.</li>
