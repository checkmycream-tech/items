            <li>Great great buy.</li>
            <li>It also worked great on my chin area, and underarms.</li>
            <li>(Didn&#x27;t do the bikini area as I am no longer bikini material, LOL).</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price.</li>
            <li>It is very nice for the legs and underarms, but not for the bikini.</li>
            <li>, THIS IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I used it 4 times with good results</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for for the legs, but it&#x27;s good for the bikini and armpits.</li>
            <li>i bought this because of the good reviews it has.</li>
            <li>I bought to my sister and she loved.</li>
            <li>And does a really good job in the bikini area.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, the massaging head is great.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I loved it compared to shaving every day.  </li>
            <li>Still, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a nice epilator.</li>
            <li>I liked the narrowness of it for the bikini line and handling.</li>
            <li>this new one is great!</li>
            <li>I always love it, now more!</li>
            <li>motor is good, epilator works fine.</li>
            <li>this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best one on the market as far as that goes though.  </li>
            <li>The HP6492 is BY FAR the best!!  </li>
            <li>you may find it very important.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>even though many years passed since I got it, I still use it with no problem</li>
            <li>but my armpits look fantastic!</li>
            <li>I had another Philips, satinelle ice, and it was doing a better job.</li>
            <li>but then it does get better.</li>
            <li>i also love this on my underarms.</li>
            <li>the ice pack is ok.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with the product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve checked with some different website and brand too, and this is one of the best deal and function i could find.</li>
            <li>but u better make sure put lotion on ur skin after the hair removal,</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Norelco brand anyway.  </li>
            <li>Much better job than my remmington.</li>
            <li>I could not see hair, so most probably it was manufacturing defect.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t freeze that any more.</li>
            <li>the more times you use it,</li>
            <li>Make sure you pull your skin taut</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>despite that, I&#x27;ve found that I like it more than shaving.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>There may be better a better epilator out there</li>
            <li>I thought the ice would be a better thing than it was, but then I was used to the stinging from sugaring - if you have never epilated, waxed or sugared -</li>
            <li>IT FELT MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>I will continue to use my epilator since I like the results better than shaving.</li>
            <li>just right* to feel the ice and have it do any good.</li>
            <li>The reviews for the Braun were pretty good, but they all had one thing in common--PAIN.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it, but the batery died, and I decide to look for a new one, with more tecnology.</li>
            <li>Works great for short hairs.</li>
            <li>I am happy with how this epilator has stood up to the challenges I have presented to it over the last 2 years.  </li>
            <li>legs did feel smooth after i epilated.</li>
            <li>my legs felt as smooth as if i had shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find the ice feature all that important, but then I had sugared before</li>
            <li>I wish I could get the original Epilady that I had for 10 years that worked great--the newer one that Epilady makes did not work at all</li>
            <li>Overall, I have to rate it a successful buy</li>
            <li>so I was familiar with the stinging (yes it does sting).</li>
            <li>I originally saw this item on QVC and wanted it</li>
            <li>The cooling thingy is fairly bulky, but it does a decent job soothing the skin after the first pass of the epilator.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it shave your hair really clean</li>
            <li>First off, epilating is a great option for hair removal if you can&#x27;t afford to wax every time your hair grows back.</li>
            <li>The ice feature is nice for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Does quick work</li>
            <li>Yes, it pulls, but it is so quick and thorough that I didn&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li>Quickly, with no fishing around.  </li>
            <li>I had a previous Satinelle Epilator for many years and have been very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>i only was brave enough to do my lower legs and the epilator did remove most of the hair.</li>
            <li>My problem with it is that the unit would get very hot</li>
            <li>My daughters and I loved the product at first, but we&#x27;ve been using it for only 3 months and the epilator head has stoped working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times and it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than my old one!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL WOMEN!!!</li>
            <li>This epilator/shaver combo works fast, smooth and almost painless.</li>
            <li>and it is very much worth every penny on it.</li>
            <li>&quot; Especially when the warnings and cleaning instructions are a multi-page, mult-language extremely clear instruction booklet: one quibble for an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>This is a big improvement from the first ones that came out many years ago!  </li>
            <li>The Satinelle Ice Epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do: remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root.</li>
            <li>RIGHT NOW</li>
            <li>I RECIEVED IT 2 WEEKS AGO AND STARTED TO USE IT RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, but after 2 uses, I find that there are still LOTS of hairs left on my legs and around the knee area.  </li>
            <li>Its fast, easy, ready to use at anytime.    </li>
            <li>Also, it may help to trim the hair wherever you&#x27;re planning to use it so it doesn&#x27;t grab hairs far away from the root (that causes more pain and more breaking than is necessary).</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure that when i&#x27;ve epillated for a few more months i can go longer between uses.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it hurts much, though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others.</li>
            <li>The epilator works good, the ice thing helps just a little bit, distracts you from the pain.</li>
            <li>Lastly, hair DOES grow in shifts, so you won&#x27;t be able to epilate once and forget about it for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>even it has the ice epilator which can make ur skin feel better, still need extra care to relax it.</li>
            <li>It reaches everywhere and grabs the hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am using an epilator for the first time .</li>
            <li>for the the area you just shave them first time</li>
            <li>It was being used for the first time.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>The ice pack thingy isn&#x27;t so useful, but the massager really helps ease the pain.    </li>
            <li>(I am very grateful for everybody who took the time to write a review!)    </li>
            <li>The first time is definitely more time consuming, but it gets a lot easier and faster with each subsequent use.     </li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried - and although it hurts like waxing the first time, maintenance doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  </li>
            <li>This was the first epilator I&#x27;d used.  </li>
            <li>you, I&#x27;ve never been waxed and this was a first time use.  </li>
            <li>, IT DID HURT THE FIRST TIME, BUT TODAY</li>
            <li>when i saw it for the first time it took my interest and 1 month ago i bought.</li>
            <li>And I have not used the Ice part since the first use.</li>
            <li>This model is a little different from the original, but the results are still great.  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant in purchasing my first epilator, but I believe I made the right decision.</li>
            <li>one day i will be brave enough to try other areas.</li>
            <li>Epilating has not stopped my hair from regrowing but it definitly is the best option I have found as I only have to do it every week on my underarms and every other week on my legs whereas shaving didn&#x27;t even last a day on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>Its much better than shaving, because the hair gets thinner, and reaches every single hair.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a present and it works fine.</li>
            <li>My legs were not as smooth as shaving, but the result last much longer.</li>
            <li>I really want this product</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s fast, it missed hair.</li>
            <li>i really like the cooler, but</li>
            <li>She said it hurted a lot, and it didn&#x27;t take too much time until \\&quot;die\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It made him very upset when I tried.</li>
            <li>i did have to go over my legs several times before they got somewhat smooth.</li>
            <li>With what I have done to it, the motor really should have conked out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the epilator as much as the shaver though.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the ice much because I don&#x27;t use the epilator much.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think the ice thing really helps at all, though.</li>
            <li>The ice part of the epilator did not help much.  </li>
            <li>it makes the whole process much easier.</li>
            <li>Virtually painless and still at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to clean than my earlier non ceramic epilator.</li>
            <li>As long as you remember to do that, you&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li>The repetitive cost of professional waxing doesn&#x27;t appeal to me and I heard about half-and-half whether DIY waxing was a good idea or not.  </li>
            <li>It did a good job of removing hair, but I would have to slowly go over each area a few times to make sure it got all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>i have never tried an epilator before, so the whole process was a new experience for me.</li>
            <li>some of the hair broke off, so i just had to do a quick touch-up about a week later to remove those as they grew in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i just love it, less pain, remove hair fast and completely so the hair grow slower too.</li>
            <li>The cooling element really helped the first time around, but I found I did not need it any longer after my second session.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted to try an epilator for a long time, but wanted to make sure I bought one that actually worked.  </li>
            <li>It hurts almost too much for me to use, and I have a decently high pain tolerance, but I can tough it out and the results are nice.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it had a light like some other models have.</li>
            <li>this epilator did not work at all--it made a lot of noise but did not remove any hair, well maybe a few soft long ones--I had read good reviews of it</li>
            <li>so I was on the prowl for a new razor.  </li>
            <li>After the initial shock of it, my legs became kind of numb and were very smooth when I finished.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less painful and more effective to get it right the first time.  </li>
            <li>It stung mildly at first, but then I figured out to pull the skin taught above the area that I was working on</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in usisng a product like this, I can&#x27;t recommend this one enough.  </li>
            <li>The only thing you can really hold against it in particular is that it has no cordless mode.</li>
            <li>The power cord is a little too long, and it would be nice to have the option of cordless operation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a regular waxer, so maybe I&#x27;m a little more used to the procedure, but I was really surprised at how little discomfort I had with this, and I used it on my bikini line, which is one of the more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that is was not nearly as painful as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>but you get used to it very quickly, although some spots are always super sensitive (behind the knees).</li>
            <li>Hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving, and when it does, it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and I was ready to start crying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried electrolysis, which was too painful, and laser treatments, which were great, but very pricey.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really pull of all short hairs.</li>
            <li>overall i really like this product</li>
            <li>Have only had the product a few days, so can&#x27;t speak to reliability, but so far am really pleased.</li>
            <li>grows back much lighter and finer.</li>
            <li>I am over 50 years old and have never owned an epilator until now.</li>
            <li>The hair has started growing back much slower, although I still shave sometimes after I epilate.</li>
            <li>Product has been satisfactory so far.</li>
            <li>I was rather scared to use it at first and had visions of my skin ripping off and what have you, but I finally dared using it, starting on my legs</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on that, but I&#x27;ve used it several times now with decent results.    </li>
            <li>It should be painless, but still is the best on the market the ice really help make it less painful.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was a bit rough</li>
            <li>and I would have to stop and let it cool down before going on to my second leg</li>
            <li>i exfoliated in the shower and then put on a nice thick lotion (be careful not to use ones that have alcohol in them because they burn after you have epilated!).</li>
            <li>I tried looking on the product&#x27;s website to buy a replacement head, but apparently you can&#x27;t get one.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also great on the bikini area, anywhere further in than that is a bit painful</li>
            <li>The first time it stung a little</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the ice pack after the first few times.  </li>
            <li>helped but the problem with it was it cooled down way to fast.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t really like being tied to the electrical cord, but other than that I really like this product and hope you will too if you decide to purchase it, it&#x27;s definitely cut down on the time and hassle I spend on hair removal!</li>
            <li>As I have used an epilator for years, I don&#x27;t feel the need for the cold pack, but I&#x27;m sure it would benefit a new user.</li>
            <li>but sometimes i feel like it&#x27;s a little too fast even on no.1  </li>

            <li> good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, the massaging head is great.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I loved it compared to shaving every day.  </li>
            <li> Still, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a nice epilator.</li>
            <li> I liked the narrowness of it for the bikini line and handling.</li>
            <li> this new one is great!</li>
            <li> I always love it, now more!</li>
            <li> motor is good, epilator works fine.</li>
            <li> this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best one on the market as far as that goes though.  </li>
            <li> The HP6492 is BY FAR the best!!  </li>
            <li> you may find it very important.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> even though many years passed since I got it, I still use it with no problem</li>
            <li> but my armpits look fantastic!</li>
            <li> I had another Philips, satinelle ice, and it was doing a better job.</li>
            <li> but then it does get better.</li>
            <li> i also love this on my underarms.</li>
            <li> the ice pack is ok.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love with the product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve checked with some different website and brand too, and this is one of the best deal and function i could find.</li>
            <li> but u better make sure put lotion on ur skin after the hair removal,</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Norelco brand anyway.  </li>
            <li> Much better job than my remmington.</li>
            <li> I could not see hair, so most probably it was manufacturing defect.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t freeze that any more.</li>
            <li> the more times you use it,</li>
            <li> Make sure you pull your skin taut</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> despite that, I&#x27;ve found that I like it more than shaving.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> There may be better a better epilator out there</li>
            <li> I thought the ice would be a better thing than it was, but then I was used to the stinging from sugaring - if you have never epilated, waxed or sugared -</li>
            <li> IT FELT MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li> I will continue to use my epilator since I like the results better than shaving.</li>
            <li> just right* to feel the ice and have it do any good.</li>
            <li> The reviews for the Braun were pretty good, but they all had one thing in common--PAIN.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it, but the batery died, and I decide to look for a new one, with more tecnology.</li>
            <li> Works great for short hairs.</li>
            <li> I am happy with how this epilator has stood up to the challenges I have presented to it over the last 2 years.  </li>
            <li> legs did feel smooth after i epilated.</li>
            <li> my legs felt as smooth as if i had shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the ice feature all that important, but then I had sugared before</li>
            <li> I wish I could get the original Epilady that I had for 10 years that worked great--the newer one that Epilady makes did not work at all</li>
            <li> Overall, I have to rate it a successful buy</li>
            <li> so I was familiar with the stinging (yes it does sting).</li>
            <li> I originally saw this item on QVC and wanted it</li>
            <li> The cooling thingy is fairly bulky, but it does a decent job soothing the skin after the first pass of the epilator.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it shave your hair really clean</li>
            <li> First off, epilating is a great option for hair removal if you can&#x27;t afford to wax every time your hair grows back.</li>
            <li> The ice feature is nice for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Does quick work</li>
            <li> Yes, it pulls, but it is so quick and thorough that I didn&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li> Quickly, with no fishing around.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous Satinelle Epilator for many years and have been very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> i only was brave enough to do my lower legs and the epilator did remove most of the hair.</li>
            <li> My problem with it is that the unit would get very hot</li>
            <li> My daughters and I loved the product at first, but we&#x27;ve been using it for only 3 months and the epilator head has stoped working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times and it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than my old one!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL WOMEN!!!</li>
            <li> This epilator/shaver combo works fast, smooth and almost painless.</li>
            <li> and it is very much worth every penny on it.</li>
            <li> &quot; Especially when the warnings and cleaning instructions are a multi-page, mult-language extremely clear instruction booklet: one quibble for an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> This is a big improvement from the first ones that came out many years ago!  </li>
            <li> The Satinelle Ice Epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do: remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root.</li>
            <li> RIGHT NOW</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED IT 2 WEEKS AGO AND STARTED TO USE IT RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, but after 2 uses, I find that there are still LOTS of hairs left on my legs and around the knee area.  </li>
            <li> Its fast, easy, ready to use at anytime.    </li>
            <li> Also, it may help to trim the hair wherever you&#x27;re planning to use it so it doesn&#x27;t grab hairs far away from the root (that causes more pain and more breaking than is necessary).</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure that when i&#x27;ve epillated for a few more months i can go longer between uses.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it hurts much, though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others.</li>
            <li> The epilator works good, the ice thing helps just a little bit, distracts you from the pain.</li>
            <li> Lastly, hair DOES grow in shifts, so you won&#x27;t be able to epilate once and forget about it for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> even it has the ice epilator which can make ur skin feel better, still need extra care to relax it.</li>
            <li> It reaches everywhere and grabs the hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> I am using an epilator for the first time .</li>
            <li> for the the area you just shave them first time</li>
            <li> It was being used for the first time.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> The ice pack thingy isn&#x27;t so useful, but the massager really helps ease the pain.    </li>
            <li> (I am very grateful for everybody who took the time to write a review!)    </li>
            <li> The first time is definitely more time consuming, but it gets a lot easier and faster with each subsequent use.     </li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried - and although it hurts like waxing the first time, maintenance doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  </li>
            <li> This was the first epilator I&#x27;d used.  </li>
            <li> you, I&#x27;ve never been waxed and this was a first time use.  </li>
            <li> , IT DID HURT THE FIRST TIME, BUT TODAY</li>
            <li> when i saw it for the first time it took my interest and 1 month ago i bought.</li>
            <li> And I have not used the Ice part since the first use.</li>
            <li> This model is a little different from the original, but the results are still great.  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant in purchasing my first epilator, but I believe I made the right decision.</li>
            <li> one day i will be brave enough to try other areas.</li>
            <li> Epilating has not stopped my hair from regrowing but it definitly is the best option I have found as I only have to do it every week on my underarms and every other week on my legs whereas shaving didn&#x27;t even last a day on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Its much better than shaving, because the hair gets thinner, and reaches every single hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a present and it works fine.</li>
            <li> My legs were not as smooth as shaving, but the result last much longer.</li>
            <li> I really want this product</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s fast, it missed hair.</li>
            <li> i really like the cooler, but</li>
            <li> She said it hurted a lot, and it didn&#x27;t take too much time until \\&quot;die\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It made him very upset when I tried.</li>
            <li> i did have to go over my legs several times before they got somewhat smooth.</li>
            <li> With what I have done to it, the motor really should have conked out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the epilator as much as the shaver though.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the ice much because I don&#x27;t use the epilator much.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think the ice thing really helps at all, though.</li>
            <li> The ice part of the epilator did not help much.  </li>
            <li> it makes the whole process much easier.</li>
            <li> Virtually painless and still at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to clean than my earlier non ceramic epilator.</li>
            <li> As long as you remember to do that, you&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li> The repetitive cost of professional waxing doesn&#x27;t appeal to me and I heard about half-and-half whether DIY waxing was a good idea or not.  </li>
            <li> It did a good job of removing hair, but I would have to slowly go over each area a few times to make sure it got all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> i have never tried an epilator before, so the whole process was a new experience for me.</li>
            <li> some of the hair broke off, so i just had to do a quick touch-up about a week later to remove those as they grew in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i just love it, less pain, remove hair fast and completely so the hair grow slower too.</li>
            <li> The cooling element really helped the first time around, but I found I did not need it any longer after my second session.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try an epilator for a long time, but wanted to make sure I bought one that actually worked.  </li>
            <li> It hurts almost too much for me to use, and I have a decently high pain tolerance, but I can tough it out and the results are nice.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it had a light like some other models have.</li>
            <li> this epilator did not work at all--it made a lot of noise but did not remove any hair, well maybe a few soft long ones--I had read good reviews of it</li>
            <li> so I was on the prowl for a new razor.  </li>
            <li> After the initial shock of it, my legs became kind of numb and were very smooth when I finished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less painful and more effective to get it right the first time.  </li>
            <li> It stung mildly at first, but then I figured out to pull the skin taught above the area that I was working on</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in usisng a product like this, I can&#x27;t recommend this one enough.  </li>
            <li> The only thing you can really hold against it in particular is that it has no cordless mode.</li>
            <li> The power cord is a little too long, and it would be nice to have the option of cordless operation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular waxer, so maybe I&#x27;m a little more used to the procedure, but I was really surprised at how little discomfort I had with this, and I used it on my bikini line, which is one of the more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that is was not nearly as painful as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> but you get used to it very quickly, although some spots are always super sensitive (behind the knees).</li>
            <li> Hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving, and when it does, it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and I was ready to start crying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried electrolysis, which was too painful, and laser treatments, which were great, but very pricey.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really pull of all short hairs.</li>
            <li> overall i really like this product</li>
            <li> Have only had the product a few days, so can&#x27;t speak to reliability, but so far am really pleased.</li>
            <li> grows back much lighter and finer.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 years old and have never owned an epilator until now.</li>
            <li> The hair has started growing back much slower, although I still shave sometimes after I epilate.</li>
            <li> Product has been satisfactory so far.</li>
            <li> I was rather scared to use it at first and had visions of my skin ripping off and what have you, but I finally dared using it, starting on my legs</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on that, but I&#x27;ve used it several times now with decent results.    </li>
            <li> It should be painless, but still is the best on the market the ice really help make it less painful.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was a bit rough</li>
            <li> and I would have to stop and let it cool down before going on to my second leg</li>
            <li> i exfoliated in the shower and then put on a nice thick lotion (be careful not to use ones that have alcohol in them because they burn after you have epilated!).</li>
            <li> I tried looking on the product&#x27;s website to buy a replacement head, but apparently you can&#x27;t get one.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also great on the bikini area, anywhere further in than that is a bit painful</li>
            <li> The first time it stung a little</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the ice pack after the first few times.  </li>
            <li> helped but the problem with it was it cooled down way to fast.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t really like being tied to the electrical cord, but other than that I really like this product and hope you will too if you decide to purchase it, it&#x27;s definitely cut down on the time and hassle I spend on hair removal!</li>
            <li> As I have used an epilator for years, I don&#x27;t feel the need for the cold pack, but I&#x27;m sure it would benefit a new user.</li>
            <li> but sometimes i feel like it&#x27;s a little too fast even on no.1  </li>
            <li> It also was a bit painful, particularly around my ankles, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle, and it did get better with consecutive use.</li>
            <li> it does clean your short and thin hair &lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful reading the instruction it clearly says that you have to be patient and wait until your hair takes used to the Epilator.</li>
            <li> but it does last a long time.</li>
            <li> i had been waxing and was having to wait a couple of weeks for the hair to grow long enough to wax.</li>
            <li> The epilator&#x27;s cooling feature is an extra, I haven&#x27;t seen on any other epilator, though I don&#x27;t think it is absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li> I am now using a panasonic which works as long as you remove the gadget that is supposed to hold the hairs up.</li>
            <li> The only down note is that it does NOT work on a battery, only pluged-in.</li>
            <li> to try other epilators,satinelle enough for all legs....</li>
            <li> I would suggest this for anyone who wants summer style legs but are too lazy to shave everyday like me.</li>
            <li> I have owned two Philips epilators (this one, and the cheaper model) and both times the epilating head has broken in the course of normal use, and shortly after buying it.</li>
            <li> I have use depilators for years (it does the same as waxing without the mess or costly trip to the beauty salon)and</li>
            <li> The ice-pad helped only a little bit.</li>
            <li> The Philips HP2843 is an inexpensive product, but more painful than the HP6492.      </li>
            <li> The Norelco epilator is not what I have expected.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on a few different epilators before deciding on this one.  </li>
            <li> the ice satinelle part does not really help and it is not working well (the ice part).</li>
            <li> The epilator jammed.</li>
            <li> part is don&#x27;t buy from Amazon, because they give partial amount for opened items.</li>
            <li> (and no, i wasn&#x27;t unduly rough with either of them).    </li>
            <li> A FEW HOURS LATER....</li>
            <li> (thought the Ice idea was a good one), but was fearful of the PAIN I had heard it caused.</li>
            <li> It has the same effect as waxing, but it hurts less than waxing,and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess like waxing does.</li>
            <li> what other web sites I can go to buy this product?</li>
            <li> I decided to get an epilator because I wanted my pubic area bare and never liked shaving it.  </li>
            <li> so read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> That helps a little, but not much.</li>
            <li> I really like it but the Ice attachment is useless</li>
            <li> It works very well, even on underarms which sugaring was useless for.</li>
            <li> I definitely have used the product for at least 15 minutes and have had no motor problem.</li>
            <li> But since I hate shaving I decided to give epilating one more try and bought the Norelco HP6492.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating to see that after spending so much time using the product.  </li>
            <li> It is too expensive to have such a short life span.</li>
            <li> Also, this causes much less irritation.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used a lady remmington and I couldn&#x27;t get the blades anymore</li>
            <li> but they both died after less than 2 years</li>
            <li> Now after less than 6 months the plastic gear in the head stripped and it no longer turns.  </li>
            <li> It made me want to cry just a little</li>
            <li> This little thing should have this as the tagline on the box \\&quot;Beauty is pain\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you will feel a little bit hurt</li>
            <li> I did try using it on my face and that was a little tougher.  </li>
            <li> and I have even recently attempted to slowly introduce the bikini line!</li>
            <li> Understand two things: that I am moving up to an electric epilator from sugaring, and I don&#x27;t have overly heavy hair growth.</li>
            <li> The head on this one is way too narrow.</li>
            <li> You do have to realize that this is painful, but in the dry cold weather, that is better than the itchiness from shaving.  </li>
            <li> it is painful the first time or two</li>
            <li> i must say that the first time i used it, it was quite painful.</li>
            <li> After the first use, it&#x27;s not that painful.  </li>
            <li> and if you keep the skin tight, there is hardly any pain.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the massager bit does.    </li>
            <li> My only warning is that if you use it on your bikini area EXFOLIATE and MOISTURIZE like crazy because like all epilators you can get some pretty bad ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Every woman over 50 knows about those annoying hairs that suddenly migrate from your eyebrows to your chin, stopping off once in a while to your upper lip.  </li>
            <li> My conclusion is that the extra gadgets that these companies keep adding to supposadly make them less painful don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to use on folding skin</li>
            <li> Over the last few years I&#x27;ve had some annoying pitch black hairs growing on my chin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard, but if you don&#x27;t commit to a pass and hover it over your skin, it&#x27;ll just tug at the hairs and hurt like nothing you&#x27;ve ever felt before.  </li>
            <li> Not quite what I was hoping for -- it leaves a little bit of hair, either broken off or not pulled out, but that could be me not spending enough time on it, and it leaves me looking a bit like a plucked chicken</li>
            <li> even i received the product late, but i still apprecaite the well performance of the epilator.</li>
            <li> The only thing that got cold was my hand.</li>
            <li> And i can save time now because i just use the epilator once a week and the hair grow slow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster, painless and takes off even the really small hair!</li>
            <li> The first time was very painful.</li>
            <li> So you can buy the model less expensive.</li>
            <li> and I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> experience overall :(</li>
            <li> I have found that compared to waxing or sugaring, this is less painful.</li>
            <li> it does become less painful</li>
            <li> All in all I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to ANYONE unless you wish to spend PAINFUL hours using it and then weeks healing up from the mess it leaves.    </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sick and tired of shaving my legs almost everyday!</li>
            <li> The Braun product was horrible, very painful and with a bunch of useless gadgets that came with the product so they could charge more for it.  </li>
            <li> silly.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know if the one I received was defective or if this is a flawed product.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> The length and width is somewhat awkward but one gets used to it.</li>
            <li> Parting advice: don&#x27;t be afraid of it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one thinking that the ice would numb the skin a bit.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT&#x27;S WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> I HATE  HATE shaving my legs, seems I was doing this everyday!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d chalk it up to bad luck if it was just one device, but seeing that it happened to both, I&#x27;m getting suspicious.</li>
            <li> This thing pulls the hair out and hurts really bad.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  </li>
            <li> I consider waxing also too painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators before, so I knew how painful they were.</li>
            <li> They will send me an envelop after 10-12 working days :(</li>
            <li> I ended up with HORRIBLE ingrown hairs that took weeks to heal.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really want this product but it is currently unavailable in Amazon..    Does anyone know when it&#x27;s gonna be in stock or what other web sites I can go to buy this product?</li>
            <li> I had one Satinelle Epilator with a massager and I loved it, but the batery died, and I decide to look for a new one, with more tecnology. I found Satinelle Ice Epilator and it&#x27;s better than my old one! It&#x27;s faster, painless and takes off even the really small hair! I always love it, now more!</li>
            <li> The Norelco Epilator does work as advertized, all though it does require  multiple passes to remove all of the hair.  Some of the shorter finer hair did have problems being removed.</li>
            <li> I have tried it for couple weeks. Overall I am very satisfied with this product. My legs were not as smooth as shaving, but the result last much longer. I did not have to worry about shaving for 1-2 weeks. The first time was very painful. The ice-pad helped only a little bit.</li>
            <li> This epilator/shaver combo works fast, smooth and almost painless. The epilator&#x27;s cooling feature is an extra, I haven&#x27;t seen on any other epilator, though I don&#x27;t think it is absolutely necessary. The power cord is a little too long, and it would be nice to have the option of cordless operation.</li>
            <li> great. but sometimes i feel like it&#x27;s a little too fast even on no.1  because it&#x27;s fast, it missed hair. but other than that it&#x27;s great. i really like the cooler, but only last a littel while because of the heat from you hands and the machine itself.</li>
            <li> The epilator works good, the ice thing helps just a little bit, distracts you from the pain.</li>
            <li> I bought it to my sister-in-law on 2007. She said it hurted a lot, and it didn&#x27;t take too much time until \\&quot;die\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the provider&#x27;s fault, but the factory/brand. The order arrived perfect and on time delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased the item from a local Target Store. It does work, when it is functioning. I used it 4 times with good results but then it stopped working. Just clicks and the head doesn&#x27;t spin. It is too expensive to have such a short life span.</li>
            <li> I love it. even though many years passed since I got it, I still use it with no problem</li>
            <li> It made me want to cry just a little but my armpits look fantastic! I would suggest this for anyone who wants summer style legs but are too lazy to shave everyday like me. Even when the hair grows back I can leave it for a while because it&#x27;s so light and thin. My only warning is that if you use it on your bikini area EXFOLIATE and MOISTURIZE like crazy because like all epilators you can get some pretty bad ingrown hairs. Also, don&#x27;t use it on your husband. It made him very upset when I tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for for the legs, but it&#x27;s good for the bikini and armpits.</li>
            <li> It should be painless, but still is the best on the market the ice really help make it less painful. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I have been using and epilator for 3 years  -and this new one is great!</li>
            <li> I bought it in March 2008 and it is now dying so I will need to replace it. I really like it but the Ice attachment is useless so I used it without it. I would buy again although I wish it would last longer than 5 years since I don&#x27;t use it that often (&amp;#60;1 per month)...</li>
            <li> The Norelco epilator is not what I have expected.I had another Philips, satinelle ice, and it was doing a better job.It doesn&#x27;t really pull of all short hairs.</li>
            <li> i bought this because of the good reviews it has. i&#x27;m sick and tired of shaving my legs almost everyday! it is painful the first time or two but then it does get better. by the fourth time i couldn&#x27;t feel it pulling the hair out. i did have to go over my legs several times before they got somewhat smooth. but it does last a long time. i&#x27;m sure that when i&#x27;ve epillated for a few more months i can go longer between uses. i also love this on my underarms. i had been waxing and was having to wait a couple of weeks for the hair to grow long enough to wax. now i just wait for the hair to get noticeable and i use my epillator to pull it out! it&#x27;s also great on the bikini area, anywhere further in than that is a bit painful so i haven&#x27;t ventured any further than the bikini area.   the ice pack is ok. you have to hold it *just right* to feel the ice and have it do any good. overall i really like this product and it is very much worth every penny on it. plus the shipping with amazon is great! i will buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I read reviews on a few different epilators before deciding on this one.  The reviews for the Braun were pretty good, but they all had one thing in common--PAIN.  Of course any product that rips your hair out is going to hurt, but I didn&#x27;t see that same theme in all of the Satinelle reviews.  I&#x27;m a regular waxer, so maybe I&#x27;m a little more used to the procedure, but I was really surprised at how little discomfort I had with this, and I used it on my bikini line, which is one of the more sensitive areas.  I think the trick is to do very tiny patches.  Have only had the product a few days, so can&#x27;t speak to reliability, but so far am really pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. You have to be very careful reading the instruction it clearly says that you have to be patient and wait until your hair takes used to the Epilator. That&#x27;s the problem with my wife, she doesn&#x27;t have any patience and she says is not working properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Norelco machine and know this technology actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product.</li>
            <li> I bought to my sister and she loved. Than, I decide to buy one for me and I&#x27;m in love with the product. Works great for short hairs. And does a really good job in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Satinelle Epilator for many years and have been very satisfied with the results.  When I broke mine, I showed my loyalty by purchasing another.  This model is a little different from the original, but the results are still great.  As I have used an epilator for years, I don&#x27;t feel the need for the cold pack, but I&#x27;m sure it would benefit a new user.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product but the ice does not decreases the pain. So you can buy the model less expensive. It is very nice for the legs and underarms, but not for the bikini.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant in purchasing my first epilator, but I believe I made the right decision. The epilator removes the hair and the ice pack does help. It does have some downfalls, but from I&#x27;ve noticed, so do all epilators, so I didn&#x27;t count them against it with my rating. It does cause some ingrown hair- exfoliation helps. It also was a bit painful, particularly around my ankles, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle, and it did get better with consecutive use. Lastly, hair DOES grow in shifts, so you won&#x27;t be able to epilate once and forget about it for 3 weeks. You will have to epilate again, but once you&#x27;ve gotten all the shifts, it will last for a while. This is definitely a nice epilator. The only thing you can really hold against it in particular is that it has no cordless mode. Ah, pick your battles.</li>
            <li> i just love it, less pain, remove hair fast and completely so the hair grow slower too. i&#x27;ve checked with some different website and brand too, and this is one of the best deal and function i could find. but u better make sure put lotion on ur skin after the hair removal, even it has the ice epilator which can make ur skin feel better, still need extra care to relax it.</li>
            <li> I have use depilators for years (it does the same as waxing without the mess or costly trip to the beauty salon)and this is the best one so far. It reaches everywhere and grabs the hair pretty well. The ice feature is nice for sensitive areas. I love it.</li>
            <li> Epilating has not stopped my hair from regrowing but it definitly is the best option I have found as I only have to do it every week on my underarms and every other week on my legs whereas shaving didn&#x27;t even last a day on my underarms.  Also, this causes much less irritation.  You do have to realize that this is painful, but in the dry cold weather, that is better than the itchiness from shaving.  I am happy with how this epilator has stood up to the challenges I have presented to it over the last 2 years.  With what I have done to it, the motor really should have conked out.</li>
            <li> This little thing should have this as the tagline on the box \\&quot;Beauty is pain\\&quot;.  I have a pretty high pain tolerance, and I was ready to start crying.  I suffered through the session and did my legs up to the knee.  I ended up with HORRIBLE ingrown hairs that took weeks to heal.  I continued to use it on my forearms, because it worked well and didn&#x27;t leave the ingrown hairs my legs did.  I think my hair is too course for this device, so I stopped using it.    All in all I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to ANYONE unless you wish to spend PAINFUL hours using it and then weeks healing up from the mess it leaves.    BOOO</li>
            <li> I am using an epilator for the first time . Did not feel any discomfort and the ice cooler works excellent. Does quick work and if you keep the skin tight, there is hardly any pain. This is a value for money product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> it does clean your short and thin hair &lt;br /&gt;but for the the area you just shave them first time &lt;br /&gt;you will feel a little bit hurt &lt;br /&gt;it shave your hair really clean &lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s hard to use on folding skin</li>
            <li> My daughters and I loved the product at first, but we&#x27;ve been using it for only 3 months and the epilator head has stoped working. Looking at the manual, it seems this part is not for sale and there isn&#x27;t an authorized repair service within 75 miles. So, what an I supposed to do?</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 years now and I do like it.  I don&#x27;t use the epilator as much as the shaver though.  both work great and I had never used an epilator before so I bought this one because it had both.  I love the Norelco brand anyway.  I had previously used a lady remmington and I couldn&#x27;t get the blades anymore so I was on the prowl for a new razor.  I don&#x27;t use the ice much because I don&#x27;t use the epilator much.  I think this is the best one on the market as far as that goes though.  The razor is great too.  Much better job than my remmington.</li>
            <li> good. the ice satinelle part does not really help and it is not working well (the ice part).</li>
            <li> It was being used for the first time. It lasted 15 minutes only. The epilator jammed. I could not see hair, so most probably it was manufacturing defect.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The motor is good, epilator works fine. That is why I m giving 2 stars instead of 1. Customer service said it will take 20-25 days to send me the defective peice and get it repaired or replaced. They will send me an envelop after 10-12 working days :( silly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;FYI they give 2 years warranty, that explains, because they take 2 months to replace one peice. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other part is don&#x27;t buy from Amazon, because they give partial amount for opened items. Otherwise i could have gone to the shop and replaced it in no time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bad experience overall :(</li>
            <li> Great Product!! This is my first epilator and I was a little skeptical. Saves you money, and removes the hair. I have found that compared to waxing or sugaring, this is less painful. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> even i received the product late, but i still apprecaite the well performance of the epilator. i don&#x27;t feel pain at all. And i can save time now because i just use the epilator once a week and the hair grow slow. Anyway, i have introduced this product to my friend and they think they will also purchase one and try it.</li>
            <li> First off, epilating is a great option for hair removal if you can&#x27;t afford to wax every time your hair grows back. It says \\&quot;legs only\\&quot; but I use this thing everywhere (i&#x27;m a guy btw!).    It&#x27;s a nice product, the massaging head is great. The ice pack thingy isn&#x27;t so useful, but the massager really helps ease the pain.    Here&#x27;s my problem. I have owned two Philips epilators (this one, and the cheaper model) and both times the epilating head has broken in the course of normal use, and shortly after buying it. I&#x27;d chalk it up to bad luck if it was just one device, but seeing that it happened to both, I&#x27;m getting suspicious. (and no, i wasn&#x27;t unduly rough with either of them).    I&#x27;m going to try a different brand, and I&#x27;d suggest anyone considering a Philips model to, well, consider again. It would be a great device if it didn&#x27;t break after a week!</li>
            <li> i have never tried an epilator before, so the whole process was a new experience for me. i must say that the first time i used it, it was quite painful. i guess you would have to expect that since it is ripping the hairs out. i only was brave enough to do my lower legs and the epilator did remove most of the hair. some of the hair broke off, so i just had to do a quick touch-up about a week later to remove those as they grew in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my legs did feel smooth after i epilated. i exfoliated in the shower and then put on a nice thick lotion (be careful not to use ones that have alcohol in them because they burn after you have epilated!). my legs felt as smooth as if i had shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, i&#x27;m happy with this product. i chose it because of the review on consumer reports. i don&#x27;t think the ice thing really helps at all, though. i don&#x27;t freeze that any more. it does become less painful the more times you use it, and it&#x27;s awesome that i can go for a couple of weeks without having to shave. one day i will be brave enough to try other areas.</li>
            <li> Is a wonderful product, it´s perfect if you travel, you don´t feel pain. Try this.</li>
            <li> The ice part of the epilator did not help much.  The epilator does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I tried the Braun 5270 before I tried this one and it was horrendous. But since I hate shaving I decided to give epilating one more try and bought the Norelco HP6492. And its awesome. The first time it stung a little but you get used to it very quickly, although some spots are always super sensitive (behind the knees). The skin cooler def. helped but the problem with it was it cooled down way to fast. Make sure you pull your skin taut it makes the whole process much easier. It took me 2-3 times of epilating until my legs were really perfectly hairless they way I wanted them. The hair def. grows back much lighter and finer. I&#x27;d also suggest regularly exfoliating to prevent ingrowns. Great great buy.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 years old and have never owned an epilator until now. Over the last few years I&#x27;ve had some annoying pitch black hairs growing on my chin. I&#x27;ve tried electrolysis, which was too painful, and laser treatments, which were great, but very pricey. I consider waxing also too painful. So I made the decision to buy the Satinelle through this website after reading the reviews here, (I am very grateful for everybody who took the time to write a review!)    I was rather scared to use it at first and had visions of my skin ripping off and what have you, but I finally dared using it, starting on my legs (I had let my hair grow for 3 or 4 days after the last shave). I was surprised that is was not nearly as painful as I expected it to be. The cooling element really helped the first time around, but I found I did not need it any longer after my second session. It also worked great on my chin area, and underarms. The hair remained gone for 2 weeks, what a relief! (Didn&#x27;t do the bikini area as I am no longer bikini material, LOL). The first time is definitely more time consuming, but it gets a lot easier and faster with each subsequent use.     I just wish it would come with a recharger, I don&#x27;t really like being tied to the electrical cord, but other than that I really like this product and hope you will too if you decide to purchase it, it&#x27;s definitely cut down on the time and hassle I spend on hair removal!</li>
            <li> I like this product. The hair has started growing back much slower, although I still shave sometimes after I epilate. Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on recommendations from CR magazine.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, but after 2 uses, I find that there are still LOTS of hairs left on my legs and around the knee area.  It&#x27;s very frustrating to see that after spending so much time using the product.  I don&#x27;t get that \\&quot;baby smooth\\&quot; feel like I do with a razor.</li>
            <li> this epilator did not work at all--it made a lot of noise but did not remove any hair, well maybe a few soft long ones--I had read good reviews of it so don&#x27;t know if the one I received was defective or if this is a flawed product. the part that is supposed to massage just got in the way of the tweezers so I think that may be part of the problem. I am now using a panasonic which works as long as you remove the gadget that is supposed to hold the hairs up. My conclusion is that the extra gadgets that these companies keep adding to supposadly make them less painful don&#x27;t work. I wish I could get the original Epilady that I had for 10 years that worked great--the newer one that Epilady makes did not work at all and then I had 2 Emjois in a row which worked ok but they both died after less than 2 years which is why I was looking for a different brand.</li>
            <li> Product has been satisfactory so far. The length and width is somewhat awkward but one gets used to it. It&#x27;s easier to clean than my earlier non ceramic epilator.</li>
            <li> This is a big improvement from the first ones that came out many years ago!  I&#x27;ve used it several times and it does a pretty good job.  After the first use, it&#x27;s not that painful.  I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  Before finally purchasing the HP6492, I also tried the Braun 5270 and the Philips Norelco HP2843.  The HP6492 is BY FAR the best!!  The Braun product was horrible, very painful and with a bunch of useless gadgets that came with the product so they could charge more for it.  The Philips HP2843 is an inexpensive product, but more painful than the HP6492.      The HP6492 is wonderful.  Virtually painless and still at a reasonable price.  By the way, I have used it on my legs, underarms and on the bikini area, and they were all manageable.    Definitely buy this one!!</li>
            <li> La Satinelle ice epiletor ha cumplido con mis espectativas que tenia antes de la compra.Deja la piel suave como la cera,y no es dolorosa si se usa con el aplicador de frio. Si este no se usa; o en zonas complicadas para la depilacion, como el cavado, la depilacion  resulta un poco mas dolorosa y no es tan practico el aplicador de frio porque resulta casi imposible apoyarlo sobre la piel en estas zonas.Igual de toas maneras el producto es muy bueno y se recomienda.</li>
            <li> I decided to get an epilator because I wanted my pubic area bare and never liked shaving it.  The repetitive cost of professional waxing doesn&#x27;t appeal to me and I heard about half-and-half whether DIY waxing was a good idea or not.  I should also note that I&#x27;m a guy.  I decided to get the epilator and if I couldn&#x27;t handle it I could give it to my girlfriend to use on her legs.  She hasn&#x27;t used it yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but I&#x27;ve used it several times now with decent results.    It hurts almost too much for me to use, and I have a decently high pain tolerance, but I can tough it out and the results are nice.  Not quite what I was hoping for -- it leaves a little bit of hair, either broken off or not pulled out, but that could be me not spending enough time on it, and it leaves me looking a bit like a plucked chicken (wonder why) for a day or two. despite that, I&#x27;ve found that I like it more than shaving.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about razorburn and somehow I&#x27;ve found that the hair doesn&#x27;t hurt growing back in like it does after I shave.  Overall, I have to rate it a successful buy and I think my girlfriend will like to use it for her legs as well.  The cooling thingy is fairly bulky, but it does a decent job soothing the skin after the first pass of the epilator.  Not sure what the massager bit does.    Parting advice: don&#x27;t be afraid of it.  It&#x27;s hard, but if you don&#x27;t commit to a pass and hover it over your skin, it&#x27;ll just tug at the hairs and hurt like nothing you&#x27;ve ever felt before.  It&#x27;s less painful and more effective to get it right the first time.  Also, it may help to trim the hair wherever you&#x27;re planning to use it so it doesn&#x27;t grab hairs far away from the root (that causes more pain and more breaking than is necessary).</li>
            <li> This thing pulls the hair out and hurts really bad. I put it in a drawer after a couple of uses and then threw it away</li>
            <li> I bought it in 2008 and used it quite often. Overall, it met my expectations.However, the epilator head died so ordering the correct one was a nightmare. Philips no longer makes them. No wonder why!</li>
            <li> I have been ecstatic since switching from shaving to using an epilator.  This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried - and although it hurts like waxing the first time, maintenance doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  Even when the hair starts to grow back it&#x27;s not as noticeable because it&#x27;s so light and thin.  The only problem is the gears that spin are plastic and the &#x27;teeth&#x27; have been worn and no longer spin.  If this was fixable I&#x27;d give it a five.  It shouldn&#x27;t be designed to have wear like this.  I&#x27;m hesitant to buy again knowing it will do the same again.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. Understand two things: that I am moving up to an electric epilator from sugaring, and I don&#x27;t have overly heavy hair growth. It works very well, even on underarms which sugaring was useless for. I do agree with one reviewer that folds can be tricky, but stretching the skin helps. I didn&#x27;t find the ice feature all that important, but then I had sugared before so I was familiar with the stinging (yes it does sting). I definitely have used the product for at least 15 minutes and have had no motor problem. I would hope that the person with motor trouble trimmed any really long hair(such as in the bikini area and beyond if you are a first time user) before using because several machines recommend this however the directions for using the satinelle ice are a six panel wordless cartoon that left me scratching my head wondering \\&quot;is this a joke?\\&quot; Especially when the warnings and cleaning instructions are a multi-page, mult-language extremely clear instruction booklet: one quibble for an otherwise great product. There may be better a better epilator out there so read the other reviews. I thought the ice would be a better thing than it was, but then I was used to the stinging from sugaring - if you have never epilated, waxed or sugared - you may find it very important. I liked the narrowness of it for the bikini line and handling. I do wish it had a light like some other models have. Still, I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a present and it works fine. The only down note is that it does NOT work on a battery, only pluged-in.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has the same effect as waxing, but it hurts less than waxing,and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess like waxing does. By the way it has this cooling sensation.. to minimize the pain!IT DOES NOT GIVE ANY ALERGIC REACTION!!!    Its much better than shaving, because the hair gets thinner, and reaches every single hair. Its fast, easy, ready to use at anytime.    I reccomend this product, its wonderful.</li>
            <li> This was the first epilator I&#x27;d used.  I loved it compared to shaving every day.  It did a good job of removing hair, but I would have to slowly go over each area a few times to make sure it got all the hairs.  I didn&#x27;t use the ice pack after the first few times.  My problem with it is that the unit would get very hot and I would have to stop and let it cool down before going on to my second leg otherwise the epilating head would start clicking.  Now after less than 6 months the plastic gear in the head stripped and it no longer turns.  I tried looking on the product&#x27;s website to buy a replacement head, but apparently you can&#x27;t get one.  I haven&#x27;t checked into the warranty yet.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000EX466C Philips Norelco HP6492 Satinelle Ice Epilator]]    I&#x27;ve wanted to try an epilator for a long time, but wanted to make sure I bought one that actually worked.  I read reviews from both Amazon and a consumer guide.  Everyone seemed to like this product.  I received it today and immediately tried it.  What is the fuss about?  It wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  Mind you, I&#x27;ve never been waxed and this was a first time use.  It stung mildly at first, but then I figured out to pull the skin taught above the area that I was working on and, voila, pain gone -- all gone.  As long as you remember to do that, you&#x27;re fine.  After a time, I didn&#x27;t even need to do that.  Have no idea  how the ice attachment works.  I didn&#x27;t wait for it to freeze.  I did try using it on my face and that was a little tougher.  Yes, it pulls, but it is so quick and thorough that I didn&#x27;t mind.  Every woman over 50 knows about those annoying hairs that suddenly migrate from your eyebrows to your chin, stopping off once in a while to your upper lip.  Gone. Quickly, with no fishing around.  If you&#x27;re interested in usisng a product like this, I can&#x27;t recommend this one enough.  Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL WOMEN!!! I&#x27;VE HAD PROBLEMS EVER SINCE I STARTED SHAVING, EACH TIME I WOULD SHAVE I&#x27;D END UP WITH PORCUPINE LEGS A FEW HOURS LATER....I DIDN&#x27;T EVEN WANT MY HUSBAND TO GET CLOSE TO ME ~ MY LEGS WERE ALWAYS ITCHY AND IT WAS TOO THE POINT THAT I COULDN&#x27;T STAND IT ANYMORE. LASER HAIR REMOVAL IS NOT AN OPTION RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT&#x27;S WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! I BOUGHT THIS AND THOUGHT WHAT DO I HAVE TO LOSE? WELL, WOMEN I AM TELLING YOU ITS THE BEST THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME. I RECIEVED IT 2 WEEKS AGO AND STARTED TO USE IT RIGHT AWAY, IT DID HURT THE FIRST TIME, BUT TODAY (THE SECOND TIME)I&#x27;VE USED IT FELT MUCH BETTER AND THE HAIRS WERE A LOT THINNER, THIS IS AMAZING! DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT I&#x27;D DO WITHOUT IT NOW!!!!!</li>
            <li> when i saw it for the first time it took my interest and 1 month ago i bought.Not necessary wax anymore.not to try other epilators,satinelle enough for all legs....</li>
            <li> I HATE  HATE shaving my legs, seems I was doing this everyday!!!! By the end of the same day I was \\&quot;prickly\\&quot;. I originally saw this item on QVC and wanted it (thought the Ice idea was a good one), but was fearful of the PAIN I had heard it caused. The first time I used it, it was a bit rough but now several times later I don&#x27;t even blink.And I have not used the Ice part since the first use. The hair grows back thinner and I have even recently attempted to slowly introduce the bikini line! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> The Satinelle Ice Epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do: remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root. What an advantage! Hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving, and when it does, it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it hurts much, though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others. The trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators before, so I knew how painful they were. I bought this one thinking that the ice would numb the skin a bit. The ice pack sits on the back of the epilator and doesn&#x27;t touch the skin. The only thing that got cold was my hand. Useless. I still use the epilator, but I use after-sun lotion with lidocaine before I use it. That helps a little, but not much. The head on this one is way too narrow. The Emjoi is still the leader of the pack.</li>
            <li> Oh my, this was torture to begin. After the initial shock of it, my legs became kind of numb and were very smooth when I finished. I will continue to use my epilator since I like the results better than shaving. The effects last longer!!!!</li>
