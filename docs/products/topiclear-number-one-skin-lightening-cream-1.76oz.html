            <li>I don&#x27;t see any new results.</li>
            <li>It has a sort of Nair smell to it but who cares as long as it works right.</li>

            <li>it well only cost you 99 cent or $1.30 depending on where you live.</li>
            <li>I gave her some, and about 2 days later she showed me how the cream near completely faded her years-old, large, dark mark!</li>
            <li>The cream lightens my dark spots on my face really well.</li>
            <li>Just like any new product that you try, I seriously recommending you drinks lots of water if you want to see rapid and real results.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent, I have a few days using it and it have worked faster than i thought.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with no damage and within the time frame</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product! Topiclear fades away blemishes and and dark spots.</li>
            <li> I believe that over time the skin lightening works</li>
            <li> I must say this is the best fade cream I had ever used before in my life. The cream lightens my dark spots on my face really well.</li>
            <li> I saw diffenence after a week thanks shipping was fast the product was fantastic thank you so much it browns the skin a tad but oh well</li>
            <li> OMG People GOD as my witness, TopiClear WORKS. I am a 40 y.o. hispanic female I&#x27;ve had dark spots since my early 30s Id say. Ive tried Aveeno, Loreal, Revitalift, YouthCode, Masks, Lemon Juice, No Vejez, Dr Carters Skin Whitener. Needless to say Ive spent alot of money on expensive products for long periods of time with little to NO result. I decided to give TopiClear a try I said why not? it&#x27;s very cheap at 2.79$ the cream &amp; 3.00$ the soap, what did I have to loose right? Well I Lost the redness in my cheek bones within 3 days ONLY &amp; my face already looks smoother NO Lie. When a product sucks I Say it ok but TopiClear is surely a Great product. It has a sort of Nair smell to it but who cares as long as it works right. Just 3 days I&#x27;ve been using it &amp; I already see the results. Please give it a try ... All you have to loose Is The Spots. I will give another review in a few weeks to keep you posted on my progress. Thank You TopiClear</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this product very much!!! I was introduced to this nearly 20 years ago in a different state than where I now live and it is VERY HARD to find this product in beauty supplies stores! It nearly fades dark hyperpigmentation marks and other dark marks almost overnight!!! It works so fast!!! I&#x27;ve tried and still have other fade creams (even had a perscription fade cream) and nothing works (for me) faster than this cream! Even gave some to a friend with an old dark mark on her hand she had for years. I gave her some, and about 2 days later she showed me how the cream near completely faded her years-old, large, dark mark! We couldn&#x27;t believe it!!! Glad you carried this product, and I WILL be ordering more in the very near future!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing to say just perfect!</li>
            <li> thhis is a wonderful product  you can really see and tell this product work.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I use it as a moisturizer and fade cream. The package came in perfect. Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy my topiclear here. I have been using topiclear for about 5 years. I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s. I have acne scars that I have been trying to get rid of and I start using this. I really cleared my scars. I wouldn&#x27;t buy here because you can find it cheaper at Sally or at another beauty supply store it well only cost you 99 cent or $1.30 depending on where you live.</li>
            <li> Well I started using the cream about 6 weeks ago and I have to say that it is amazing. I had dark acne marks on my face that I needed to clear up. Started seeing results in about 3 days and face was totally clear after two weeks. My skin has became shades lighter just like I wanted to, I have my childhood complexion back. All for a very low price. Just like any new product that you try, I seriously recommending you drinks lots of water if you want to see rapid and real results. Believe me a combo of water and topiclear (order face soap too) is all you need.</li>
            <li> my face broke out&lt;br /&gt;my face looked like a tomato my face was bumpy&lt;br /&gt;it was itchy and irritated&lt;br /&gt;oh my god the kids at my school started to laugh at me&lt;br /&gt;i had to go to the doctor and they prescribed me hydro-cortisone&lt;br /&gt;and its smells really bad&lt;br /&gt; my mom tried it and her face didn&#x27;t brake out but she didn&#x27;t see results over a month</li>
            <li> This product have the most disgusting smell. I don&#x27;t know if i received a bad one or if they all smell that horrible. I had to wash it off as soon as i put it on. Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I am an African American, brown skinned woman in my 40&#x27;s.  I have nice skin, but I desired a more even tone.  I&#x27;ve used all types of bleaching products for my old acne scaring, Ambi, Clinique and Neutrogena. None of them gave me the results as quickly as Topiclear. I started seeing results after just two weeks of use. I used twice a day and I would just dab each dark spot with my fingertips.  To start I just used on one side of my face. I loved the results.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> This product works just as described. You must be carefull when appling because wherever its applied will lighten up. May have to take a break too because it iches a little.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is below my standards because I&#x27;m have not seen any difference. I don&#x27;t see any new results.</li>
            <li> No dramatic results seemed to be obvious from this product.  You can easily treat one area and not another then judge for yourself if there is any difference.  I think long term dark spots don&#x27;t seem to change much.</li>
            <li> I have not used this cream, but I used topiclear with cocoa butter lotion. I used this lotion on my face. When I stop using it, my skin around my mouth got jet black. I am African American and have a medium complexion. It has been a horrible journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be cafeful. I would use this product. I would use something natural.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I used it to lighten my underarms and it even lightened my under eye dark circles. Ive been trying for a few yrs to lighten them and this stuff did it within like 2 days! My underarms were really dark from a reaction to a deodorant i used and it has lightened beyond belief. I definitely reccommend this product. The only slight dislike is it has a strong odor but if u use a thin layer like it directs then its not too bad.</li>
            <li> Product is a lot of hype about nothing. Would not recommend product.  I hate it!  I have used the Obagi brand.  Product does not deliver the results promised.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even follow through,I used this for more than a month and I saw no results whatsoever.  waste of money honestly.</li>
            <li> it works very good.. I bought it in the pharmacy for $3.99 it is working very good in my skin.</li>
            <li> I am an African-American female in mid-20s. I had a lot, I mean a lot of dark marks on my face for years. I had tried everything......glycolic peels, salicylic acid peels, all types of skin lightening products. However, none of them worked like Topiclear. Topiclear eliminated majority of the dark marks on my face all in a matter of months and it didn&#x27;t break my skin out. I purchased mine from a local Beauty Supply Store for like $2.99. You won&#x27;t be mad you purchased it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my inner thighs which are hyperpigmented. Sure enough, I saw a difference after one or two weeks of using it religiously. It does have a noticeable odor though and stopped after a couple of weeks.</li>
