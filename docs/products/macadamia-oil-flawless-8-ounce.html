            <li>I feel like they named this a two and one just because they didn&#x27;t know what else to call it, but the texture of it is so unique and delicious.</li>
            <li>Exceptional.</li>
            <li>Even then, I hesitated, but I&#x27;m so very glad</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing...</li>
            <li>Amazing... I use it from time to time and whenever I do I&#x27;m amazed at how my hair looks and feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair nice and silky.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to my sister and mom and they have both liked it.</li>
            <li>It really make my hair flawless, I wish I knew sooner.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of pricey.  </li>
            <li>shampoo/ conditioner makes my hair more manageable and it smells good too.</li>
            <li>It makes keeping your hair in great shape easy and fuss free!</li>
            <li>wonderful mi love the whole line of products.</li>
            <li>Since using Flawless, my hair is tangle free coming out of the shower, dries quickly, styles easily, and is very healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>I wondered if it would get that greasy feel by the end of the day, but I am happy to report it was still in great shape the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample bottle and have found it to be a great timesaver as well as overall great product.  </li>
            <li>The texture is very light and not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling awesome and clean and exceptionally shiny.</li>
            <li>i like it better than Wren.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The price is SO much better than the Wen and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>but I would not pay more than $20 for this product.</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my hair healthy, hydrated, and gives the added bonus of de tangling in the shower which helps avoid breakage.</li>
            <li>On the description at the top it mentions &amp;#34;strong</li>
            <li>and I thought I would never be able to use a shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li>but like this even better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shampoo and conditioner all in one and the macadamia oil that it&#x27;s made from has kept my hair so healthy</li>
            <li>I am in love with this.</li>
            <li>I love this one</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I do have it in a shampoo rotation and make sure to use it when we have a party or event to go to.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>But the aisle container leads yo to believe you are getting a lot more psych</li>
            <li>However, I purchased it here on Amazon this time around to find a better price and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the product overall.</li>
            <li>However,  they need to work on a better fragrance for it.  </li>
            <li>Pleased all around.</li>
            <li>and I love the delivery system.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try but just remember it&#x27;s not a hairspray! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cream you leave on your hair for so many minutes and rinse.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use every day, but when I do, I love how silky my hair looks and feels, and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Usually love Macadamia, son when this came out</li>
            <li>Excellent to travel with as you don&#x27;t need several bottles if product.</li>
            <li>and i told her that her hair looked so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my hair color has lasted much better since using this product.  </li>
            <li>gotta wait for the product to come out of the top.  </li>
            <li>i have gotten so many comments on my hair since started using this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this two in one product.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more when out.</li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I use this one product and my hair is so much more healthier than it was before the perm.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, so far so good!</li>
            <li>Great prodcut  highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time and my hair feels soo good.</li>
            <li>I love how easy this stuff is to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great way to be kind to your hair on days in between deep cleansing shampoos.</li>
            <li>Silky, manageable and clean!</li>
            <li>After trying many of the sulfate free 2-in-one systems out there (Wen, Hair One, etc.)</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good (although Wen smells much better to me) and you need a full palm size for each wash</li>
            <li>I have a very fine full head of hair which can be time consuming to take care of.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, LOVE Macadamia products, especially the new &#x27;&#x27;Flawless&#x27;&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I understand this product is fairly new,  but the smell isn&#x27;t all that pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky, strong, clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s easy on the hair color (doesn&#x27;t cause it to fade)</li>
            <li>It gives you great soft hair while still being light.</li>
            <li>It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair pure and smooth, and truly brings out its best natural self.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and don&#x27;t even have to use styling products.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was free and it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and easy to style.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will work on fine hair though.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>But i don&#x27;t think it will work on fine hair though.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but then so is all good hair care products &amp; you play good money for a hair cut and/or color every six to eight weeks, so why skimp when it comes to taking care of your hair.</li>
            <li>After just one use of this product I can notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Even when its on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; for $20 - I still fit ripped off a bit -</li>
            <li>I also really enjoy the smell, unlike some people who I have heard from.</li>
            <li>This stuff is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>BUT, it&#x27;s important</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but saw this product had very good ones, and thought that I would have liked to know this product is no good.</li>
            <li>But with this shampoo I comb them quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>This product is a bit pricey but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love this as a conditioner, but the spout broke the first time I used it</li>
            <li>and this stuff saves me time and makes my hair look so shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>Great for color treated hair and dry hair.</li>
            <li>It does not make suds but don&#x27;t think it isn&#x27;t getting your hair clean...</li>
            <li>This is a great product for dry hair with an oily scalp.</li>
            <li>That being said, it felt very soft and smelled absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful, the product makes your hair soft and easy to comb through when wet.  </li>
            <li>Thanks :-)</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about how good my hair feels after using this.</li>
            <li>They ended up giving me the full refund.</li>
            <li>I love this hair product:  smells fantastic, who doesn&#x27;t love a shampoo/conditioner that actually WORKS?  </li>
            <li>I was so amazed I went looking for the full size.</li>
            <li>I knew I had to get the full size.</li>
            <li>more importantly - it makes my hair detangled and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product, I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use this product because it goes quickly</li>
            <li>I was using a different all in one cleansing conditioner before trying this and totally switched to the macadamia flawless!</li>
            <li>After just a couple of hours, my hair was super greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>Just a couple quick pumps of the dispenser.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I have tried Wen and some of the other conditioning cleansers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not a fan of such, but this leaves hair feeling clean, lightweight and silky and smells great.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great if you&#x27;re going to be traveling since it cuts down on all the bottles of hair products.</li>
            <li>Make sure to alternate between shampooing and this product, for it doesn&#x27;t do the best job at washing especially if you have naturally greasy hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, healthy hair, not dry nor greasy.</li>
            <li>Try at your own risk, I have only had this same burning tingling experience once before, and it was with Wen, another popular cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and feeling of silky smooth hair after use and no need for extra stuff in your hair.</li>
            <li>When I first got my bottle and used it, the product squirted out like whipped cream under pressure, which was really cool.  </li>
            <li>I am loving this shower short cut.  </li>
            <li>but I am ok with that because it controls the frizz, smell herbal like, my hair is soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>BUT this stuff is worth it.  </li>
            <li>This does not make your hair feel clean or no where near flawless, well at least it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it clean all the product residue out, but it made my hair feel softer than it has in years!!</li>
            <li>would suggest applying this at the beginning of your shower, combing or massaging it throughly through from roots to ends, and then rinsing right before you get out.</li>
            <li>So, I gave this product a good review because I gave it to my sister who has a very full thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Rinses fast and clean, with no detectable residue.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it left the top 2 inches of my hair super oily and greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>The metal container is fun, and pretty.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, as long as you don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell and it will probably last me a good 6 months at this rate (washing every other time).</li>
            <li>Really helps my dry hair, smells great, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>And this is much cheaper than birchbox!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use regular shampoo and conditioner a couple times a week</li>
            <li>I would buy again but the price went up too much for it to be worth it.</li>
            <li>**) for years,</li>
            <li>This shampoo, conditioner and styling product really works!</li>
            <li>Overall, I really love this product-</li>
            <li>I am used to paying about $6 but the cheapest I could find this for was $13 (then again, $13 is still pretty cheap).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>There was a visibly noticeable difference in the texture and shine of my hair after just the first use.</li>
            <li>Great product for thick hair.</li>
            <li>Turns out my hair is better with regular shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I received my first one in a sample.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of any Macadamia Natural Oil products, but this is a straight up scam.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also kind of lifeless, stick straight and absolutely no volume.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft (reduces frizziness) and perfectly clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and feel clean.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is clean and my hair is so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>You will be amazed how clean, soft, manageable your hair is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of weird to use at first because it&#x27;s kind of like a mousse and doesn&#x27;t really lather in the hair</li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>It really does clean and condition my hair and leaves it soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I do love how moist it is for dry split ends.</li>
            <li>My hair was super soft, shiny, detangled and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>I have been using Flawless for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t needed to use any other products!</li>
            <li>I will certainly be repurchasing, again and again.</li>
            <li>son works at a large beauty supply company and gave me this for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and was hoping this would add extra body and simplify my styling routine.</li>
            <li>I have wavy/frizzy hair, but I can blow dry it half way and it air dries to beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>My hair is clean but not dry or frail.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like buying shampoo because I feel like it really dries out my hair</li>
            <li>It was very convenient and worked well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I like the unusual scent.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I continue with my shower and rinse my hair at the very end after I have worked the product through my hair again (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about mid-back length and gets very tangled.</li>
            <li>With that said, I would say I really like it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a curly hot mess most of the time.</li>
            <li>I feel like with this product you need to use more of it - not a quarter size amount you would with other shampoos or conditioners.</li>
            <li>Totally better than I expected!</li>
            <li>I use a lot of product in my hair, so when I use this my hair feels extra clean, it strips away any build up</li>
            <li>My hair is very straw-like from overprocessing, dying and straightening my hair, normal shampoos made my hair feel so dry and would cause my hair to break easily.</li>
            <li>It has been growing much faster than it did using normal shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have to say this is my hands down favorite.</li>
            <li>Also, I use less product than I do with the Evercreme because this is a mousse so it distributes much better than a cream.</li>
            <li>It is silky, less tangled, lighter, and I have more volume.</li>
            <li>This particular bottle may have been defective, but there was a problem with the consistency</li>
            <li>I follow it up with the Macadamia Healing Oil after towel drying my hair, then I style my hair with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip and a light misting of the same hairspray (PM Awapuhi).  </li>
            <li>I think this is the only one that really got this right.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just wish would dispense a little better.</li>
            <li>My blow dey time was cut in half which is great because that means less heat used to style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to comb out tangles when it&#x27;s wet, and after blow drying its sooo silky, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Normally, I have to use Bumble&amp;bumble tonic to untangle my hair, and follow it by a keratin RX with humectant for the humid weather we have here in GA.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my third bottle, so it must be worth it.</li>
            <li>but it gets my hair so clean and leaves it so soft (even after blow drying and flat ironing</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, it is definitely a shampoo not a hairspray or dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I wash it at night and let my hair air dry most of the time, but I get the same results if I use a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It tends to get weighed down easily with some products.  </li>
            <li>so I have no way to get a new bottle, so I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li>My new go to shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I relax my hair and after a blow dry and flat iron it looks so healthy and shiny</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and shiny after using this, although I haven&#x27;t found that it really cuts drying time down by as much as they claim.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and if I don&#x27;t rinse well, it weighs it down a bit.</li>
            <li>I love it and even my husband who is turnings grey and complaining how brittle and dry his hair was getting</li>
            <li>Thousand of $$ in highend products, yet my hair was dry and brittle, I wanted it to grow long and healthy but</li>
            <li>I have oily scalp so not my first choice on shampoo, but I do rotate it with my regular shampoo</li>
            <li>want to note that the first bottle I ordered on here broke the second I tried to dispense the product, but the seller issued a refund immediately.</li>
            <li>A gazillion dollars later - spent on products for my hair - trying to find exactly the right one/s</li>
            <li>I have fine thin slightly wavy hair that turns straight pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, shiny and manageable with this product.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>There is truly nothing like this on the market so far.</li>
            <li>He has now switched to this one because it leaves his hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Too much dispenses and can&#x27;t be put back into the container</li>
            <li>but my hair was not left feeling smooth like my last bottle from a different retailer.</li>
            <li>As does my 5yr old daughter and 17mos old son.  </li>
            <li>After washing your hair is just incredibly soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>so I dye it frequently (about once a month)</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>just wow.  </li>
            <li>I use about half the size of an egg amount, anyway it makes my hair feel thick healthy and full of volume.</li>
            <li>and recently I&#x27;ve been getting asked how my hair still looks so healthy when I dye it so often, so this must be part of it since the only other thing I put on my hair is argan oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used other products from this brand in the past and had been pretty pleased with them, so when I found this on sale, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few other well known cleansing conditioners I wasn&#x27;t happy with mostly due to the menthol in those products.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll definitely feel a difference in your hair after the second rinse, it will be soft and should be easy to comb out with a wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i first noticed a girl with straight caucasian hair at a party few months ago</li>
            <li>and i have not other product in my hair!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product at first, being sulfate free and all, because I use so many products and hairspray that I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t get my hair clean, especially since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday because of how dried out it is.</li>
            <li>This is a product to apparently substitute the shampoo + conditioner process, so if this is what you want then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly disapointed since what i wanted was a hairspray to hold a an actual hair do...</li>
            <li>Being a new mom, this is such a time saver.</li>
            <li>I have very long, very think hair.</li>
            <li>First purchased at my hair salon, but Amazon&#x27;s price is far less than theirs.</li>
            <li>This product is saving my hair, now, I do have good regular thick hair, it does leave my hair slightly heavier</li>
            <li>and I could barely get the product to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to the old way...</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, manageable and silky.</li>
            <li>and it felt like it took a week of regular shampoo to get my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li>I do alternate with a regular shampoo like they recommend, which is something I think it probably necessary with any sulfate free system in order to avoid your hair getting weighted down.</li>
            <li>The only caution is using it everyday can make your hair a little heavy, every other days seemed best for me.</li>
            <li>However, I have very fine limp hair and after using this product, my hair looked like limp noodles.  </li>
            <li>I use daily after shampooing and my blow dry time is much shorter.</li>
            <li>Not a hairspray and not a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product after seeing so many positive reviews, but was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li>At first they were only going to give me half my refund.  </li>
            <li>Also, it cut back on the time it takes to blow dry my hair, so I&#x27;m not having to use a hot dryer as long, which will definitely help keep my hair healthier!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it leaves my dry color processed hair feeling super soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The smell is just alright, not amazing but not bad either.</li>
            <li>I use a decent amount every time I wash my hair (every other day) and the products lasts about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, shiny, easier to dry, etc.</li>
            <li>and now it comes out super slow.....</li>
            <li>I have fine hair strands but a ton of it, so my hair is very thick and almost silky.</li>
            <li>have aging, dry, coarse, processed hair which I like to style, nearly every day.  </li>

            <li> Even my boyfriend commented on how good my hair looked.</li>
            <li> I feel like they named this a two and one just because they didn&#x27;t know what else to call it, but the texture of it is so unique and delicious.</li>
            <li> Exceptional.</li>
            <li> Even then, I hesitated, but I&#x27;m so very glad</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing...</li>
            <li> Amazing... I use it from time to time and whenever I do I&#x27;m amazed at how my hair looks and feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair nice and silky.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to my sister and mom and they have both liked it.</li>
            <li> It really make my hair flawless, I wish I knew sooner.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of pricey.  </li>
            <li> shampoo/ conditioner makes my hair more manageable and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> It makes keeping your hair in great shape easy and fuss free!</li>
            <li> wonderful mi love the whole line of products.</li>
            <li> Since using Flawless, my hair is tangle free coming out of the shower, dries quickly, styles easily, and is very healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine</li>
            <li> I wondered if it would get that greasy feel by the end of the day, but I am happy to report it was still in great shape the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample bottle and have found it to be a great timesaver as well as overall great product.  </li>
            <li> The texture is very light and not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling awesome and clean and exceptionally shiny.</li>
            <li> i like it better than Wren.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The price is SO much better than the Wen and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but I would not pay more than $20 for this product.</li>
            <li> love this product.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my hair healthy, hydrated, and gives the added bonus of de tangling in the shower which helps avoid breakage.</li>
            <li> On the description at the top it mentions &amp;#34;strong</li>
            <li> and I thought I would never be able to use a shampoo/conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> but like this even better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shampoo and conditioner all in one and the macadamia oil that it&#x27;s made from has kept my hair so healthy</li>
            <li> I am in love with this.</li>
            <li> I love this one</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I do have it in a shampoo rotation and make sure to use it when we have a party or event to go to.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> But the aisle container leads yo to believe you are getting a lot more psych</li>
            <li> However, I purchased it here on Amazon this time around to find a better price and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the product overall.</li>
            <li> However,  they need to work on a better fragrance for it.  </li>
            <li> Pleased all around.</li>
            <li> and I love the delivery system.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try but just remember it&#x27;s not a hairspray! :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cream you leave on your hair for so many minutes and rinse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use every day, but when I do, I love how silky my hair looks and feels, and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Usually love Macadamia, son when this came out</li>
            <li> Excellent to travel with as you don&#x27;t need several bottles if product.</li>
            <li> and i told her that her hair looked so healthy.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my hair color has lasted much better since using this product.  </li>
            <li> gotta wait for the product to come out of the top.  </li>
            <li> i have gotten so many comments on my hair since started using this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this two in one product.</li>
            <li> Will purchase more when out.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love that.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this one product and my hair is so much more healthier than it was before the perm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, so far so good!</li>
            <li> Great prodcut  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time and my hair feels soo good.</li>
            <li> I love how easy this stuff is to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to be kind to your hair on days in between deep cleansing shampoos.</li>
            <li> Silky, manageable and clean!</li>
            <li> After trying many of the sulfate free 2-in-one systems out there (Wen, Hair One, etc.)</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good (although Wen smells much better to me) and you need a full palm size for each wash</li>
            <li> I have a very fine full head of hair which can be time consuming to take care of.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE Macadamia products, especially the new &#x27;&#x27;Flawless&#x27;&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I understand this product is fairly new,  but the smell isn&#x27;t all that pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky, strong, clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s easy on the hair color (doesn&#x27;t cause it to fade)</li>
            <li> It gives you great soft hair while still being light.</li>
            <li> It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair pure and smooth, and truly brings out its best natural self.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and don&#x27;t even have to use styling products.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was free and it shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and easy to style.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will work on fine hair though.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But i don&#x27;t think it will work on fine hair though.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but then so is all good hair care products &amp; you play good money for a hair cut and/or color every six to eight weeks, so why skimp when it comes to taking care of your hair.</li>
            <li> After just one use of this product I can notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Even when its on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; for $20 - I still fit ripped off a bit -</li>
            <li> I also really enjoy the smell, unlike some people who I have heard from.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> BUT, it&#x27;s important</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but saw this product had very good ones, and thought that I would have liked to know this product is no good.</li>
            <li> But with this shampoo I comb them quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit pricey but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love this as a conditioner, but the spout broke the first time I used it</li>
            <li> and this stuff saves me time and makes my hair look so shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> Great for color treated hair and dry hair.</li>
            <li> It does not make suds but don&#x27;t think it isn&#x27;t getting your hair clean...</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dry hair with an oily scalp.</li>
            <li> That being said, it felt very soft and smelled absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful, the product makes your hair soft and easy to comb through when wet.  </li>
            <li> Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how good my hair feels after using this.</li>
            <li> They ended up giving me the full refund.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product:  smells fantastic, who doesn&#x27;t love a shampoo/conditioner that actually WORKS?  </li>
            <li> I was so amazed I went looking for the full size.</li>
            <li> I knew I had to get the full size.</li>
            <li> more importantly - it makes my hair detangled and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product, I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use this product because it goes quickly</li>
            <li> I was using a different all in one cleansing conditioner before trying this and totally switched to the macadamia flawless!</li>
            <li> After just a couple of hours, my hair was super greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> Just a couple quick pumps of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I have tried Wen and some of the other conditioning cleansers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not a fan of such, but this leaves hair feeling clean, lightweight and silky and smells great.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great if you&#x27;re going to be traveling since it cuts down on all the bottles of hair products.</li>
            <li> Make sure to alternate between shampooing and this product, for it doesn&#x27;t do the best job at washing especially if you have naturally greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, healthy hair, not dry nor greasy.</li>
            <li> Try at your own risk, I have only had this same burning tingling experience once before, and it was with Wen, another popular cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feeling of silky smooth hair after use and no need for extra stuff in your hair.</li>
            <li> When I first got my bottle and used it, the product squirted out like whipped cream under pressure, which was really cool.  </li>
            <li> I am loving this shower short cut.  </li>
            <li> but I am ok with that because it controls the frizz, smell herbal like, my hair is soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> BUT this stuff is worth it.  </li>
            <li> This does not make your hair feel clean or no where near flawless, well at least it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it clean all the product residue out, but it made my hair feel softer than it has in years!!</li>
            <li> would suggest applying this at the beginning of your shower, combing or massaging it throughly through from roots to ends, and then rinsing right before you get out.</li>
            <li> So, I gave this product a good review because I gave it to my sister who has a very full thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Rinses fast and clean, with no detectable residue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it left the top 2 inches of my hair super oily and greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> The metal container is fun, and pretty.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, as long as you don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> but I love the smell and it will probably last me a good 6 months at this rate (washing every other time).</li>
            <li> Really helps my dry hair, smells great, leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> And this is much cheaper than birchbox!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use regular shampoo and conditioner a couple times a week</li>
            <li> I would buy again but the price went up too much for it to be worth it.</li>
            <li> **) for years,</li>
            <li> This shampoo, conditioner and styling product really works!</li>
            <li> Overall, I really love this product-</li>
            <li> I am used to paying about $6 but the cheapest I could find this for was $13 (then again, $13 is still pretty cheap).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> There was a visibly noticeable difference in the texture and shine of my hair after just the first use.</li>
            <li> Great product for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Turns out my hair is better with regular shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I received my first one in a sample.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of any Macadamia Natural Oil products, but this is a straight up scam.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also kind of lifeless, stick straight and absolutely no volume.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft (reduces frizziness) and perfectly clean.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and feel clean.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is clean and my hair is so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> You will be amazed how clean, soft, manageable your hair is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of weird to use at first because it&#x27;s kind of like a mousse and doesn&#x27;t really lather in the hair</li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> It really does clean and condition my hair and leaves it soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I do love how moist it is for dry split ends.</li>
            <li> My hair was super soft, shiny, detangled and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> I have been using Flawless for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t needed to use any other products!</li>
            <li> I will certainly be repurchasing, again and again.</li>
            <li> son works at a large beauty supply company and gave me this for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and was hoping this would add extra body and simplify my styling routine.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/frizzy hair, but I can blow dry it half way and it air dries to beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> My hair is clean but not dry or frail.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like buying shampoo because I feel like it really dries out my hair</li>
            <li> It was very convenient and worked well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the unusual scent.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I continue with my shower and rinse my hair at the very end after I have worked the product through my hair again (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about mid-back length and gets very tangled.</li>
            <li> With that said, I would say I really like it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a curly hot mess most of the time.</li>
            <li> I feel like with this product you need to use more of it - not a quarter size amount you would with other shampoos or conditioners.</li>
            <li> Totally better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of product in my hair, so when I use this my hair feels extra clean, it strips away any build up</li>
            <li> My hair is very straw-like from overprocessing, dying and straightening my hair, normal shampoos made my hair feel so dry and would cause my hair to break easily.</li>
            <li> It has been growing much faster than it did using normal shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is my hands down favorite.</li>
            <li> Also, I use less product than I do with the Evercreme because this is a mousse so it distributes much better than a cream.</li>
            <li> It is silky, less tangled, lighter, and I have more volume.</li>
            <li> This particular bottle may have been defective, but there was a problem with the consistency</li>
            <li> I follow it up with the Macadamia Healing Oil after towel drying my hair, then I style my hair with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip and a light misting of the same hairspray (PM Awapuhi).  </li>
            <li> I think this is the only one that really got this right.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just wish would dispense a little better.</li>
            <li> My blow dey time was cut in half which is great because that means less heat used to style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to comb out tangles when it&#x27;s wet, and after blow drying its sooo silky, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Normally, I have to use Bumble&amp;bumble tonic to untangle my hair, and follow it by a keratin RX with humectant for the humid weather we have here in GA.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my third bottle, so it must be worth it.</li>
            <li> but it gets my hair so clean and leaves it so soft (even after blow drying and flat ironing</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it is definitely a shampoo not a hairspray or dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I wash it at night and let my hair air dry most of the time, but I get the same results if I use a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It tends to get weighed down easily with some products.  </li>
            <li> so I have no way to get a new bottle, so I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> My new go to shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I relax my hair and after a blow dry and flat iron it looks so healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and shiny after using this, although I haven&#x27;t found that it really cuts drying time down by as much as they claim.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and if I don&#x27;t rinse well, it weighs it down a bit.</li>
            <li> I love it and even my husband who is turnings grey and complaining how brittle and dry his hair was getting</li>
            <li> Thousand of $$ in highend products, yet my hair was dry and brittle, I wanted it to grow long and healthy but</li>
            <li> I have oily scalp so not my first choice on shampoo, but I do rotate it with my regular shampoo</li>
            <li> want to note that the first bottle I ordered on here broke the second I tried to dispense the product, but the seller issued a refund immediately.</li>
            <li> A gazillion dollars later - spent on products for my hair - trying to find exactly the right one/s</li>
            <li> I have fine thin slightly wavy hair that turns straight pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, shiny and manageable with this product.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> There is truly nothing like this on the market so far.</li>
            <li> He has now switched to this one because it leaves his hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Too much dispenses and can&#x27;t be put back into the container</li>
            <li> but my hair was not left feeling smooth like my last bottle from a different retailer.</li>
            <li> As does my 5yr old daughter and 17mos old son.  </li>
            <li> After washing your hair is just incredibly soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> so I dye it frequently (about once a month)</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> just wow.  </li>
            <li> I use about half the size of an egg amount, anyway it makes my hair feel thick healthy and full of volume.</li>
            <li> and recently I&#x27;ve been getting asked how my hair still looks so healthy when I dye it so often, so this must be part of it since the only other thing I put on my hair is argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used other products from this brand in the past and had been pretty pleased with them, so when I found this on sale, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few other well known cleansing conditioners I wasn&#x27;t happy with mostly due to the menthol in those products.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely feel a difference in your hair after the second rinse, it will be soft and should be easy to comb out with a wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i first noticed a girl with straight caucasian hair at a party few months ago</li>
            <li> and i have not other product in my hair!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first, being sulfate free and all, because I use so many products and hairspray that I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t get my hair clean, especially since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday because of how dried out it is.</li>
            <li> This is a product to apparently substitute the shampoo + conditioner process, so if this is what you want then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly disapointed since what i wanted was a hairspray to hold a an actual hair do...</li>
            <li> Being a new mom, this is such a time saver.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very think hair.</li>
            <li> First purchased at my hair salon, but Amazon&#x27;s price is far less than theirs.</li>
            <li> This product is saving my hair, now, I do have good regular thick hair, it does leave my hair slightly heavier</li>
            <li> and I could barely get the product to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the old way...</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft, manageable and silky.</li>
            <li> and it felt like it took a week of regular shampoo to get my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> I do alternate with a regular shampoo like they recommend, which is something I think it probably necessary with any sulfate free system in order to avoid your hair getting weighted down.</li>
            <li> The only caution is using it everyday can make your hair a little heavy, every other days seemed best for me.</li>
            <li> However, I have very fine limp hair and after using this product, my hair looked like limp noodles.  </li>
            <li> I use daily after shampooing and my blow dry time is much shorter.</li>
            <li> Not a hairspray and not a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after seeing so many positive reviews, but was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> At first they were only going to give me half my refund.  </li>
            <li> Also, it cut back on the time it takes to blow dry my hair, so I&#x27;m not having to use a hot dryer as long, which will definitely help keep my hair healthier!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it leaves my dry color processed hair feeling super soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The smell is just alright, not amazing but not bad either.</li>
            <li> I use a decent amount every time I wash my hair (every other day) and the products lasts about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, shiny, easier to dry, etc.</li>
            <li> and now it comes out super slow.....</li>
            <li> I have fine hair strands but a ton of it, so my hair is very thick and almost silky.</li>
            <li> have aging, dry, coarse, processed hair which I like to style, nearly every day.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling very soft and didn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time, I was skeptical at first, but after my shower I let my hair towel dry and brushed it.</li>
            <li> Use a small amount, and rinse your hair REALLY well after.</li>
            <li> The foam is very dense and need a small amount of it to rinse your hair.</li>
            <li> I use this when I&#x27;m in a rush, because it&#x27;s a one-step shampoo/conditioner, and it lets me skip the long middle rinse to get the shampoo out of my hair before conditioning.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from bleach that was left in way too long.  </li>
            <li> The cost was enough to make me cherish my sample for as long as I could.</li>
            <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner but found that I had to use a lot of product and still needed to shampoo every few days to keep my scalp clean.</li>
            <li> After blow drying, my hair felt soft, but not flat or heavy.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that I has to use quite a bit because I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> However, it also tends to dry out by coloring, heat styling products, the flat iron and hair spray.  </li>
            <li> hold long</li>
            <li> When I realized how long the sample lasted</li>
            <li> only possible con is I&#x27;m not sure how long the can will last, but I won&#x27;t know that for a while.  </li>
            <li> I have a stockpile of other shampoos/conditioners that I will be giving away because I will never go back to just a \\&quot;mediocre\\&quot; shampoo.</li>
            <li> so we use every other day and shampoo with our regular shampoo in between.</li>
            <li> so I use this every other day, off days I use my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair, I tried this and was hesitant since it says to use a little bit of water.  </li>
            <li> its always dry and tangly.  </li>
            <li> Rinse and pat dry with a towel.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nearly dry with just pat drying.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for thick, curly, unruly hair.</li>
            <li> It was really intense burning after I used it, and as my hair dried, the feeling got less and less however after 6 hours</li>
            <li> Usually my hair gets split ends really quickly because I blow dry it almost everyday, but with this product I have had hardly any split ends.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, very oily hair</li>
            <li> I find that you use less product than the other similar systems (Wen, Hair One...).</li>
            <li> Only problem is you don&#x27;t get much and its expensive.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the shower and comb through with a wide tooth comb before getting out.</li>
            <li> Now, if you have thin hair that tends to get oily, may be you won&#x27;t like this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li> To use this product your hair is to be wet.  </li>
            <li> So, I wet my hair in the shower, squeeze out the excess water, and then work this in like I would a shampoo and then all the way through the ends.  </li>
            <li> (Side note: don&#x27;t let your friends in beauty school &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; on your hair unless your really not that attached to it.)</li>
            <li> so I made a mental note to try it....</li>
            <li> Scalp to ends and I then use my wet comb.</li>
            <li> I have thick,  naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair with natural waves.</li>
            <li> And my hair didn&#x27;t hold nearly as much moisture as it usually does and dried in about half the time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered it right away, despite it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> Need only a very small amount and can be used daily.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a little different that my other products, and I feel like I need to wash my hair again a little sooner.  </li>
            <li> I too hate that it leaks a little bit from the dispenser after, kind of like how mousse does), but it doesn&#x27;t deter me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is price.....</li>
            <li> Hair looks immediately dirty, right after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I washed about half of what was dispensed this morning down the drain..  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that it&#x27;s expensive and a can typically only lasts me 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> this is a conditioning cleanser for you hair that you use instead of typical shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> As it claims, it does cut blow drying time in half for me.</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> I NEVER right reviews on products,  ever!  </li>
            <li> If you have curly, or thick, or dry hair this will change your life.</li>
            <li> Add a little bit of water to help evenly distribute the product and then put your hair in a clip to let the product penetrate.  </li>
            <li> But, a little practice and I learned to &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> is basically like the Wen method, except this is not used everyday.</li>
            <li> my hair is dried my curls are intact</li>
            <li> Wasted a bit, which I didn&#x27;t like considering the price.</li>
            <li> you can get it on Amazon for half what I&#x27;ve found it in the stores for!  </li>
            <li> I have such thin hair and finding a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down is hard.</li>
            <li> I wish it came in larger quantities or was less expensive but what can ya do?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product without fail for quite some time until this last order.</li>
            <li> Just use a small amount and work it through your hair.</li>
            <li> I usually go 10 mins.</li>
            <li> and I did not experience the usual dryness and brittle, broke hair from being processed.</li>
            <li> Terrible for fine, heavy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother, and even seems to tame a bit of the kink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> and my hair is now dry, my scalp still feels tingly and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair extremely greasy and it weights it down like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it is fanatic.</li>
            <li> At least when you&#x27;ve tried the Wen products beforehand.  </li>
            <li> Allow it to stay at least 5 mins.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is kinky curly underneath and wavy</li>
            <li> It smooths my thick, frizzy hair well.</li>
            <li> I like the texture (thick)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, dense and creamy.</li>
            <li> I would buy this expensive product if it were not for the uncomfortable tingling/burning feeling it left on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I had been using another cleansing conditioner product that was much less expensive and worked well, but I just didn&#x27;t feel like it was &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I only used the product for 2 days because it was so bad</li>
            <li> experiences with shampoo/conditioner combos have been so bad, that only the Macadamia name got me to even try it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s way too expensive to waste  like that....</li>
            <li> with highlights keeping it long is almost impossible.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair stringy, flat and dirty looking!  </li>
            <li> I hate to wash my hair with harsh shampoo everyday</li>
            <li> One bottle didn&#x27;t have any pressure behind it so it wouldn&#x27;t dispense any product.</li>
            <li> I had to style my hair up because it looked so bad down.  </li>
            <li> Usually I hate two in one shampoos and conditioners, they leave my roots greasy and my ends dry, but this stuff is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unsettling to me</li>
            <li> My biggest problem with hair is that it is very difficult to comb them, because they are very much confused after washing.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, as I have very thin strands of wavy hair, but lots of them.  </li>
            <li> Checking the ingredients, I found silicon (dimethicone) to be the 4th one listed. :(</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you have been disappointed in combination shampoo/conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Exceptional. Leaves hair silky, strong, clean and healthy. i like it better than Wren.</li>
            <li> I received a 3 oz sample of this and although I have the oiliest hair on earth (looks unwashed halfway through the day) this took all the grime out. Left my hair feeling awesome and clean and exceptionally shiny. I would buy this expensive product if it were not for the uncomfortable tingling/burning feeling it left on my scalp. It was really intense burning after I used it, and as my hair dried, the feeling got less and less however after 6 hours and my hair is now dry, my scalp still feels tingly and uncomfortable. It&#x27;s unsettling to me and I have only read one review where this happened to someone else. I am therefore giving it away. Try at your own risk, I have only had this same burning tingling experience once before, and it was with Wen, another popular cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have very thick, very oily hair and this stuff saves me time and makes my hair look so shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> Great product!! And this is much cheaper than birchbox!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is kinky curly underneath and wavy every where else. After just one use of this product I can notice a huge difference. My hair is clean but not dry or frail. My blow dey time was cut in half which is great because that means less heat used to style. Very happy with this product! I highly recommend it for thick, curly, unruly hair.</li>
            <li> Flawless eliminates the conditioning process after shampooing. Leaves hair nice and silky. Great for my chemical treated hair!&lt;br /&gt;1 step</li>
            <li> If you have curly, or thick, or dry hair this will change your life. Just be sure to use regular shampoo and conditioner a couple times a week</li>
            <li> Great all in one shampoo, conditioner and styling product. My hair is so soft, shiny and manageable with this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is a curly hot mess most of the time. That is until I found this stuff. I have received numerous compliments on my hair since using it. I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> After trying many of the sulfate free 2-in-one systems out there (Wen, Hair One, etc.) I have to say this is my hands down favorite. The price is SO much better than the Wen and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I find that you use less product than the other similar systems (Wen, Hair One...). My hair is super soft and shiny after using this, although I haven&#x27;t found that it really cuts drying time down by as much as they claim. I do alternate with a regular shampoo like they recommend, which is something I think it probably necessary with any sulfate free system in order to avoid your hair getting weighted down. I have recommended this to my sister and mom and they have both liked it. My niece also loves this product. I think this is the only one that really got this right.</li>
            <li> Love makes hair look healthy!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes my hair soft, shiny, easier to dry, etc. Make sure to alternate between shampooing and this product, for it doesn&#x27;t do the best job at washing especially if you have naturally greasy hair.</li>
            <li> Ahhh the convenience of a shampoo and conditioner in one. Cuts my time in half!&lt;br /&gt;But more importantly - it makes my hair detangled and soft. This is my second &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; and I must say - this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like buying shampoo because I feel like it really dries out my hair and I never felt like using just conditioner was enough. My only complaint is price.....I use a decent amount every time I wash my hair (every other day) and the products lasts about 5 weeks. I feel like with this product you need to use more of it - not a quarter size amount you would with other shampoos or conditioners. Even when its on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; for $20 - I still fit ripped off a bit - but I would not pay more than $20 for this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair is very soft and clean smelling. It has been growing much faster than it did using normal shampoos.</li>
            <li> Being a new mom, this is such a time saver. I also have color treated hair and this is great for holding onto that color smells wonderful mi love the whole line of products. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Shampoo and conditioner in one. Need only a very small amount and can be used daily. Hair is soft &amp; shiny. Great for color treated hair and dry hair. Protects hair from the sun!!......</li>
            <li> love this product.  I relax my hair and after a blow dry and flat iron it looks so healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> I have very long, very think hair. I use this product in the shower and comb through with a wide tooth comb before getting out. It helps keep my hair healthy, hydrated, and gives the added bonus of de tangling in the shower which helps avoid breakage.</li>
            <li> Product is truly a substitute for shampoo, conditioner and styling -- all in one product. Light, beautifully packaged, it works on any type of hair.  Amazing... There is truly nothing like this on the market so far.</li>
            <li> It was very convenient and worked well on my hair. Only thing is that I has to use quite a bit because I have very long hair. I would buy again but the price went up too much for it to be worth it. It was good while it lasted though.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product without fail for quite some time until this last order. One bottle didn&#x27;t have any pressure behind it so it wouldn&#x27;t dispense any product. They do not offer a return policy so I have no way to get a new bottle, so I had to throw it out. I do love the product though!</li>
            <li> This Product is wonderful!!! My hair is very straw-like from overprocessing, dying and straightening my hair, normal shampoos made my hair feel so dry and would cause my hair to break easily. I was skeptical about this product at first, being sulfate free and all, because I use so many products and hairspray that I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t get my hair clean, especially since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday because of how dried out it is. But I was very impressed!! Not only did it clean all the product residue out, but it made my hair feel softer than it has in years!! Also, it cut back on the time it takes to blow dry my hair, so I&#x27;m not having to use a hot dryer as long, which will definitely help keep my hair healthier! This product is a bit pricey but it is worth every penny! I have a stockpile of other shampoos/conditioners that I will be giving away because I will never go back to just a \\&quot;mediocre\\&quot; shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have oily scalp so not my first choice on shampoo, but I do rotate it with my regular shampoo and it&#x27;s fine.  I do love how moist it is for dry split ends. I almost say it&#x27;s reversing them?? I dunno but I love the smell and it will probably last me a good 6 months at this rate (washing every other time).</li>
            <li> If used as directed you will definitly see results. Love the smell and feeling of silky smooth hair after use and no need for extra stuff in your hair.Cant beat Amazon price!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of any Macadamia Natural Oil products, but this is a straight up scam. On the description at the top it mentions &amp;#34;strong hold long lasting&amp;#34;...which i doubt a &amp;#34;6 in 1 conditioner&amp;#34; will do. This is a product to apparently substitute the shampoo + conditioner process, so if this is what you want then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly disapointed since what i wanted was a hairspray to hold a an actual hair do...anyways, make your choice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product, I will definitely be ordering more. It really make my hair flawless, I wish I knew sooner.</li>
            <li> When I first got my bottle and used it, the product squirted out like whipped cream under pressure, which was really cool.  By the end it was just a creamy trickle.  I like the unusual scent.  I use this when I&#x27;m in a rush, because it&#x27;s a one-step shampoo/conditioner, and it lets me skip the long middle rinse to get the shampoo out of my hair before conditioning.  It leaves my hair a little different that my other products, and I feel like I need to wash my hair again a little sooner.  The metal container is fun, and pretty.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it is definitely a shampoo not a hairspray or dry shampoo. I have fine thin slightly wavy hair that turns straight pretty quickly. I use about half the size of an egg amount, anyway it makes my hair feel thick healthy and full of volume. I wash it at night and let my hair air dry most of the time, but I get the same results if I use a hair dryer. Once a week or every 2 weeks I use a regular shampoo because the directions state you should but I think my hair looks best when I use this shampoo. Oh and I have color treated hair too. I would recommend this product. Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> Love this product! No need to wash my every day, just condition with this great product &amp; it looks wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!  My hair is very fine and I thought I would never be able to use a shampoo/conditioner combo. The conditioner was never enough.  Since using Flawless, my hair is tangle free coming out of the shower, dries quickly, styles easily, and is very healthy.</li>
            <li> this is a conditioning cleanser for you hair that you use instead of typical shampoo and conditioner.  It does not make suds but don&#x27;t think it isn&#x27;t getting your hair clean... it does!  I had used the hair cleanser product that you see in the infomercials (W**) for years, but like this even better.  This product makes my hair soft (reduces frizziness) and perfectly clean.  I have fine hair and don&#x27;t even have to use styling products.  you can get it on Amazon for half what I&#x27;ve found it in the stores for!  So it is especially worth it!!</li>
            <li> This product is great.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for color treated and wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;No conditioner needed here - my hair feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased this product from this seller, but this is the best product for my hair that I&#x27;ve EVER tried. Shortly after I got my hair cut (about 6 months ago), I purchased this product. It&#x27;s a shampoo and conditioner all in one and the macadamia oil that it&#x27;s made from has kept my hair so healthy and it&#x27;s made my hair grow faster. Usually my hair gets split ends really quickly because I blow dry it almost everyday, but with this product I have had hardly any split ends. The only down side is that it&#x27;s expensive and a can typically only lasts me 2-3 months. But I will continue to repurchase it because it&#x27;s done wonders for my hair!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this. It makes your hair pure and smooth, and truly brings out its best natural self.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from bleach that was left in way too long.  Anyways, I have tried Wen and some of the other conditioning cleansers and this one is by far the best. I love it and even my husband who is turnings grey and complaining how brittle and dry his hair was getting is really impressed. He has now switched to this one because it leaves his hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product!  It leaves my hair stringy, flat and dirty looking!  Too much dispenses and can&#x27;t be put back into the container and it&#x27;s way too expensive to waste  like that....I washed about half of what was dispensed this morning down the drain..  I was so hopeful this product work on my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am loving this shower short cut.  This cleansing conditioner smells wonderful!  A little goes a long way and it leaves my dry color processed hair feeling super soft and moisturized.  I have tried quite a few other well known cleansing conditioners I wasn&#x27;t happy with mostly due to the menthol in those products.  I love this one and I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I love the &amp;#34;all in one&amp;#34; product.  It smooths my thick, frizzy hair well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  It&#x27;s kind of weird to use at first because it&#x27;s kind of like a mousse and doesn&#x27;t really lather in the hair but it gets my hair so clean and leaves it so soft (even after blow drying and flat ironing everyday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this product because it goes quickly and it&#x27;s kind of pricey.  I do have it in a shampoo rotation and make sure to use it when we have a party or event to go to.  I wish it came in larger quantities or was less expensive but what can ya do?</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years. This particular bottle may have been defective, but there was a problem with the consistency and I could barely get the product to come out of the bottle. It was a waist of money.</li>
            <li> So good!!!... Got to say, Again... Thousand of $$ in highend products, yet my hair was dry and brittle, I wanted it to grow long and healthy but with highlights keeping it long is almost impossible. This product is saving my hair, now, I do have good regular thick hair, it does leave my hair slightly heavier but I am ok with that because it controls the frizz, smell herbal like, my hair is soft and shinny. Now, if you have thin hair that tends to get oily, may be you won&#x27;t like this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Love the product. NOT the way it arrived.. Came without a cap and it was all over the inside of my box and on the product itself.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful, the product makes your hair soft and easy to comb through when wet.  The only caution is using it everyday can make your hair a little heavy, every other days seemed best for me. I have thinner blonde hair as does my daughter so we use every other day and shampoo with our regular shampoo in between.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after seeing so many positive reviews, but was very disappointed.  I have fine hair and was hoping this would add extra body and simplify my styling routine. Unfortunately it left the top 2 inches of my hair super oily and greasy looking.  I had to style my hair up because it looked so bad down.  I also feel like it made my naturally blonde hair look darker at the roots where it was oily.  I only used the product for 2 days because it was so bad and it felt like it took a week of regular shampoo to get my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> Meh. Got like 4 good a uses our if out. The product does feel good. But the aisle container leads yo to believe you are getting a lot more psych</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it is fanatic. My hair has never felt so good! However, I purchased it here on Amazon this time around to find a better price and whatever I got in my bottle is not the same as what I have used before. Same texture coming out but my hair was not left feeling smooth like my last bottle from a different retailer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZballs!</li>
            <li> I have such thin hair and finding a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down is hard. I love, love, LOVE Macadamia products, especially the new &#x27;&#x27;Flawless&#x27;&#x27;. This shampoo, conditioner and styling product really works! I tried it for the first time, I was skeptical at first, but after my shower I let my hair towel dry and brushed it. Normally, I have to use Bumble&amp;bumble tonic to untangle my hair, and follow it by a keratin RX with humectant for the humid weather we have here in GA. But honestly, I didn&#x27;t need one of those products! My hair was super soft, shiny, detangled and frizz-free. I think this product is great if you&#x27;re going to be traveling since it cuts down on all the bottles of hair products. It makes keeping your hair in great shape easy and fuss free! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have really short hair so I use this every other day, off days I use my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner. I think you would use it about every three to four days with longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is basically like the Wen method, except this is not used everyday. I use a lot of product in my hair, so when I use this my hair feels extra clean, it strips away any build up &amp; it&#x27;s easy on the hair color (doesn&#x27;t cause it to fade) it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side, but then so is all good hair care products &amp; you play good money for a hair cut and/or color every six to eight weeks, so why skimp when it comes to taking care of your hair.</li>
            <li> Totally better than I expected! I was using a different all in one cleansing conditioner before trying this and totally switched to the macadamia flawless!</li>
            <li> Love this as a conditioner, but the spout broke the first time I used it and now it comes out super slow.....</li>
            <li> Amazing... I use it from time to time and whenever I do I&#x27;m amazed at how my hair looks and feels afterwards. It&#x27;s so much easier to comb out tangles when it&#x27;s wet, and after blow drying its sooo silky, soft and smooth. How is this product under $20?? Definitely a staple in my hair product rotation. Smells nice as well! I&#x27;m recommending to anyone I know with hair.</li>
            <li> Will give Wen a run for the money Good product will rebuy  Amazon has the best price too</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. Just used this for the first time and my hair feels soo good. I&#x27;m in love with this product. I also really enjoy the smell, unlike some people who I have heard from. I guess it all depends on your personal taste. Shipping was free and it shipped very quickly. On top of that it came packaged perfectly. I am very impressed with this seller.</li>
            <li> I love how easy this stuff is to use. It really does clean and condition my hair and leaves it soft and silky. The only downside is I can feel a film left on it afterwards. Checking the ingredients, I found silicon (dimethicone) to be the 4th one listed. :(</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, as long as you don&#x27;t use it every day. Use a small amount, and rinse your hair REALLY well after. My hair is fine, and if I don&#x27;t rinse well, it weighs it down a bit. Makes my hair smooth and easy to style. I too hate that it leaks a little bit from the dispenser after, kind of like how mousse does), but it doesn&#x27;t deter me. I&#x27;m impressed with the product overall.</li>
            <li> I found it!  A gazillion dollars later - spent on products for my hair - trying to find exactly the right one/s and THIS IS IT!  A shampoo AND conditioner in one.  How wonderful is that?  I follow it up with the Macadamia Healing Oil after towel drying my hair, then I style my hair with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip and a light misting of the same hairspray (PM Awapuhi).  I am in Nirvana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have aging, dry, coarse, processed hair which I like to style, nearly every day.  To use this product your hair is to be wet.  So, I wet my hair in the shower, squeeze out the excess water, and then work this in like I would a shampoo and then all the way through the ends.  I continue with my shower and rinse my hair at the very end after I have worked the product through my hair again (the same application - I do not do repeats).  I will never go back to the old way...</li>
            <li> Great prodcut  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff &amp; you had a great price!</li>
            <li> I NEVER right reviews on products,  ever!  BUT this stuff is worth it.  I have thick,  naturally curly hair.  As does my 5yr old daughter and 17mos old son.  I have now used this on all three of us and it is amazing.  However,  they need to work on a better fragrance for it.  I understand this product is fairly new,  but the smell isn&#x27;t all that pleasant.  At least when you&#x27;ve tried the Wen products beforehand.  I will continue to use this for a while.  This and the oil.  The oil is incredible!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and feel clean.  I hate to wash my hair with harsh shampoo everyday but sometimes i need to do something after the gym, this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> This is quite an excellent thing! The foam is very dense and need a small amount of it to rinse your hair. After washing your hair is just incredibly soft and shiny. My biggest problem with hair is that it is very difficult to comb them, because they are very much confused after washing. But with this shampoo I comb them quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for dry hair with an oily scalp. I usually use L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner but found that I had to use a lot of product and still needed to shampoo every few days to keep my scalp clean. I have been using Flawless for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t needed to use any other products! My scalp is clean and my hair is so soft and moisturized. I have wavy/frizzy hair, but I can blow dry it half way and it air dries to beautiful waves. Also, I use less product than I do with the Evercreme because this is a mousse so it distributes much better than a cream. Overall, I really love this product- the only downside is the price. I am used to paying about $6 but the cheapest I could find this for was $13 (then again, $13 is still pretty cheap).&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have color treated hair; it&#x27;s red so I dye it frequently (about once a month) and recently I&#x27;ve been getting asked how my hair still looks so healthy when I dye it so often, so this must be part of it since the only other thing I put on my hair is argan oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to be kind to your hair on days in between deep cleansing shampoos. It gives you great soft hair while still being light.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC. I stopped using regular shampoo and conditioner on my hair about a year and a half ago after a particularly damaging color job. (Side note: don&#x27;t let your friends in beauty school &amp;#34;experiment&amp;#34; on your hair unless your really not that attached to it.) I had been using another cleansing conditioner product that was much less expensive and worked well, but I just didn&#x27;t feel like it was &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;. I&#x27;d used other products from this brand in the past and had been pretty pleased with them, so when I found this on sale, I decided to give it a try. So so very glad I did! There was a visibly noticeable difference in the texture and shine of my hair after just the first use. Silky, manageable and clean! Even my boyfriend commented on how good my hair looked. And my hair didn&#x27;t hold nearly as much moisture as it usually does and dried in about half the time.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest applying this at the beginning of your shower, combing or massaging it throughly through from roots to ends, and then rinsing right before you get out. Works best when it has time to sit in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I want to note that the first bottle I ordered on here broke the second I tried to dispense the product, but the seller issued a refund immediately. Pleased all around.</li>
            <li> I love all of the macadamia products, but Flawless is something special.  If you&#x27;re like me, you have been disappointed in combination shampoo/conditioners.  That won&#x27;t happen this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experiences with shampoo/conditioner combos have been so bad, that only the Macadamia name got me to even try it.  Even then, I hesitated, but I&#x27;m so very glad I gave it a chance.  My hair feels AMAZING after I use it!  It&#x27;s smoother, and even seems to tame a bit of the kink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair strands but a ton of it, so my hair is very thick and almost silky. It&#x27;s about mid-back length and gets very tangled. It&#x27;s also kind of lifeless, stick straight and absolutely no volume. Usually I hate two in one shampoos and conditioners, they leave my roots greasy and my ends dry, but this stuff is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair felt like someone else&#x27;s hair! It is silky, less tangled, lighter, and I have more volume. It looks so gorgeous and shinny too, I&#x27;m getting tons of compliments! I will never go back to regular shampoos and conditioners! I feel like they named this a two and one just because they didn&#x27;t know what else to call it, but the texture of it is so unique and delicious. The smell is just alright, not amazing but not bad either. I will certainly be repurchasing, again and again.</li>
            <li> Great product for thick hair. I use daily after shampooing and my blow dry time is much shorter. Helps with frizz and tames your hair all day.</li>
            <li> I just used this product this morning and I like it.  BUT, it&#x27;s important you know what you are getting as this is not a hairspray as in hairspray. It&#x27;s is a 2-in-1 cleanser conditioner that you use in the shower.  Not a hairspray and not a dry shampoo.  With that said, I would say I really like it.  The closest comparison I can give is it is very similar to Wen cleansing conditioner products. If you have used Wen, then you will know how to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my pro&#x27;s: I like the texture (thick) and I love the delivery system.  Almost like how gel shave cream dispenses (not foam).  It&#x27;s thick, dense and creamy. It smells pretty good (although Wen smells much better to me) and you need a full palm size for each wash (I rinse and repeat which I recommend).  Keep in mind it won&#x27;t lather and you&#x27;ll need to work it in well to get the coverage.  Add a little bit of water to help evenly distribute the product and then put your hair in a clip to let the product penetrate.  Fully rinse and then repeat.  You&#x27;ll definitely feel a difference in your hair after the second rinse, it will be soft and should be easy to comb out with a wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only possible con is I&#x27;m not sure how long the can will last, but I won&#x27;t know that for a while.  I wash my hair every 2-3 days (a work in progress for the benefit of my hair) so we will see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, so far so good! Give it a try but just remember it&#x27;s not a hairspray! :)</li>
            <li> This now my BFF!!!&lt;br /&gt;My son works at a large beauty supply company and gave me this for Christmas.  I was very skeptical, as I have very thin strands of wavy hair, but lots of them.  It tends to get weighed down easily with some products.  However, it also tends to dry out by coloring, heat styling products, the flat iron and hair spray.  I used this once and was hooked!  After blow drying, my hair felt soft, but not flat or heavy. It feel nourished, but not greasy.  I wondered if it would get that greasy feel by the end of the day, but I am happy to report it was still in great shape the next morning.  I cannot say enough about how good my hair feels after using this.</li>
            <li> So, I gave this product a good review because I gave it to my sister who has a very full thick head of hair.  However, I have very fine limp hair and after using this product, my hair looked like limp noodles.  After just a couple of hours, my hair was super greasy looking.  That being said, it felt very soft and smelled absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my hair. It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t not understand why this is labeled hairspray. It&#x27;s a cream you leave on your hair for so many minutes and rinse. I told the company that it wasn&#x27;t  hairspray. They apologized but then sent me the same one again. I then told them I was just returning both. At first they were only going to give me half my refund.  I told them I would let Amazon know this. They ended up giving me the full refund. I still had to buy packaging to return both bottles. Not cool.</li>
            <li> I love this hair product:  smells fantastic, who doesn&#x27;t love a shampoo/conditioner that actually WORKS?  I don&#x27;t use every day, but when I do, I love how silky my hair looks and feels, and love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but saw this product had very good ones, and thought that I would have liked to know this product is no good. I hate this product. Usually love Macadamia, son when this came out I ordered it right away, despite it was so expensive. I have fine, healthy hair, not dry nor greasy. I don&#x27;t dye it or use heat to style it. It leaves my hair extremely greasy and it weights it down like crazy. Hair looks immediately dirty, right after getting out of the shower. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I received a sample bottle and have found it to be a great timesaver as well as overall great product.  I have a very fine full head of hair which can be time consuming to take care of.  This product is a great timesaver.</li>
            <li> Terrible for fine, heavy hair. I had to buy a clarifier to remove the build-up.</li>
            <li> My daughter brought this product with her to visit and after trying ordered two bottles. I have longer color treated hair. It was a shampoo, conditioner and styling aid in one bottle. It left my hair soft, manageable and silky. This is one of the best shampoos I have ever used. You just apply it creams up and then rinse and style. Excellent to travel with as you don&#x27;t need several bottles if product. But watch out you will have to share.</li>
            <li> wow.  just wow.  tried it this morning.  I have kinky hair that i color/highlight.  its always dry and tangly.  this stuff is amazing.  i first noticed a girl with straight caucasian hair at a party few months ago and i told her that her hair looked so healthy.  she said it was this product so I made a mental note to try it....I am a believer!  my hair is dried my curls are intact and i have not other product in my hair!</li>
            <li> My new go to shampoo.  I feel like my hair color has lasted much better since using this product.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> gotta wait for the product to come out of the top.  i have gotten so many comments on my hair since started using this product. Just wish would dispense a little better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this two in one product. I&#x27;m usually not a fan of such, but this leaves hair feeling clean, lightweight and silky and smells great. Only problem is you don&#x27;t get much and its expensive. It&#x27;s my third bottle, so it must be worth it.</li>
            <li> Once I tried this I can&#x27;t go back to using regular shampoo/conditioner. Leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my fiancé and she loves this product. Will purchase more when out.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Really helps my dry hair, smells great, leaves hair soft and manageable. First purchased at my hair salon, but Amazon&#x27;s price is far less than theirs. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite cleansing conditioner. First, it doesn&#x27;t take much. Just a couple quick pumps of the dispenser. The texture is very light and not greasy feeling. Smooths through the hair very easily and has a pleasant scent. Rinses fast and clean, with no detectable residue. As it claims, it does cut blow drying time in half for me. I love that. It left my hair feeling very soft and didn&#x27;t weigh it down. The only problem I had with it is that, it keeps dispensing a bit after I let up on the button. Wasted a bit, which I didn&#x27;t like considering the price. But, a little practice and I learned to &amp;#34;control&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with natural waves. This product is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t think it will work on fine hair though.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo/ conditioner makes my hair more manageable and it smells good too. But i don&#x27;t think it will work on fine hair though.</li>
            <li> love this product. All you need is two pumps to clean and condition your hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair, I tried this and was hesitant since it says to use a little bit of water.  Turns out my hair is better with regular shampoo and conditioner.  This does not make your hair feel clean or no where near flawless, well at least it didn&#x27;t work for me.  It felt like a residue was left in my hair after using it  also.</li>
            <li> I received my first one in a sample. I was so amazed I went looking for the full size. The cost was enough to make me cherish my sample for as long as I could. When I realized how long the sample lasted I knew I had to get the full size. I can&#x27;t believe how great this stuff works. Don&#x27;t think of it like shampoo, there is no foaming bubbles, it&#x27;s a cream. Just use a small amount and work it through your hair. Scalp to ends and I then use my wet comb. Allow it to stay at least 5 mins. I usually go 10 mins. Rinse and pat dry with a towel. You will be amazed how clean, soft, manageable your hair is. And it&#x27;s nearly dry with just pat drying. My hair was permed and I used this starting the 3rd day and I did not experience the usual dryness and brittle, broke hair from being processed. It&#x27;s because of this product. I highly recommend. I no longer use the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioners. I use this one product and my hair is so much more healthier than it was before the perm. Awesome product!</li>
