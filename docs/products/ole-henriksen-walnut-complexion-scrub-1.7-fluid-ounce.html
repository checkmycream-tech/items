            <li>The best thing about it was how CLEAN my face actually felt.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and the tiny pieces of walnuts do an excellent job of exfoliating without being too harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li>The husks are gentle but effective and the smell is phenomenal.</li>

            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>this stuff will get your skin polished and smooth.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and tighter after each use.  </li>
            <li>It has a great scent and the texture is very gritty</li>
            <li>I just love how soft and clean it makes my skin feel!!</li>
            <li>Not only does this smell wonderful and natural but</li>
            <li>and I just had to buy the full size.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend to anyone looking for a new exfoliator.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>and it is SO worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Before this I was using Fresh however at $50/jar, I can get two of the walnut scrub and get just as fab of results.</li>
            <li>After using it, my skin felt so fresh</li>
            <li>other people absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleansing scrub that can be used weekly if not more.</li>
            <li>This walnut scrub gives such great results you won&#x27;t need to get a facial.  </li>
            <li>FINALLY to the bottom of the jar and going to order more.  </li>
            <li>This scrub really works!  </li>
            <li>Recently discovered Ole, and am in love with his products.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my face, which is acne prone, and does a good job removing dead skin.</li>
            <li>After one minute of gentle scrubbing (with warm water too) it left my face clean, clear, and soft.</li>
            <li>Loved the scrub,,,,used very little, left my skin very soft and smooth the first time after using it.  </li>
            <li>(as your skin will be very receptive to whatever you put on it afterwards).</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t really like the scent  -</li>
            <li>It really does a great job of getting off the dead skin and clearing up any rough patches.  </li>
            <li>Switching out my usual gentle cleanser for this scrub 2-3 nights a week resulted in fewer acne spots and a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>That said, I haven&#x27;t broken out once, my skin is super soft, and always feels clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle scrub, but definitely  a scrub.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a constant effort to keep it looking decent with the Clarisonic and a variety of lotions.  </li>
            <li>First, the walnut scrub is too rough.</li>

            <li> First, the walnut scrub is too rough.</li>
            <li> Not only is it less expensive the results are truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I will continue to use for a long time!  </li>
            <li> I had some dry skin issues with the start of the midwest winter</li>
            <li> The scrub is very grainy so I would recommend being very careful not to scrub too hard when using, and it might also be helpful to have a face cream</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin that can get oily during the cold winter season.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and after my break outs begin to heal, I get scabby-like, rough patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other rave reviews</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t us any other product!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, try this and  Oles other products!</li>
            <li> It does have a slight nutty fragrance but that&#x27;s because of the walnut ingredient and is temporary in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have leisure time to go to a spa to get a facial  but was seriously considering that as an option.  </li>
            <li> so you have to be VERY careful and not scrub your face too hard.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would dry my skin but has done just the opposite!  </li>
            <li> and there is no more flaking since I have used it.</li>
            <li> at least that&#x27;s been my experience.  </li>
            <li> Like a thick sand.</li>
            <li> Get it - you won&#x27;t be sorry and for less than $30 -</li>
            <li> But after 1 month the contents started drying off and it was weird.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this scrub. I have pretty sensitive skin that can get oily during the cold winter season. That said, I haven&#x27;t broken out once, my skin is super soft, and always feels clean.  The scrub is very grainy so I would recommend being very careful not to scrub too hard when using, and it might also be helpful to have a face cream that you know works well for your skin (as your skin will be very receptive to whatever you put on it afterwards).</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. It is very gritty so you have to be VERY careful and not scrub your face too hard. After one minute of gentle scrubbing (with warm water too) it left my face clean, clear, and soft. I have acne prone skin and after my break outs begin to heal, I get scabby-like, rough patches on my face. This walnut scrub worked excellently on my face! The best thing about it was how CLEAN my face actually felt.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing scrub that can be used weekly if not more. The husks are gentle but effective and the smell is phenomenal. It reminds me of tropical suntan lotion. My skin looks revitalized after using this scrub.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!!  FINALLY to the bottom of the jar and going to order more.  My skin looks sooo much better.</li>
            <li> This line of face products was recomended to me by a good friend and I am not dissapointed. This Walnut scrub not only makes my skin feel great, it also smells great too!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on other rave reviews and I&#x27;m not crazy about it. First, the walnut scrub is too rough. I&#x27;d like something  bit gentler. Also, I don&#x27;t really like the scent  - other people absolutely loved it. But I paid a lot for it, so now I have to use it up... maybe on my heels.</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell wonderful and natural but OMG this leaves your skin feeling a baby&#x27;s bum&#x27;s skin! No joke this cleanses deeper than ever! In love!</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would dry my skin but has done just the opposite!  Not only does it exfoliate but it also hydrates....at least that&#x27;s been my experience.  I would definitely order again!!  It does have a slight nutty fragrance but that&#x27;s because of the walnut ingredient and is temporary in my opinion.  I just love how soft and clean it makes my skin feel!!</li>
            <li> Best. Scrub. Ever.  I discovered this in the sample pack that comes with the peel....and I just had to buy the full size.  I use it once a week and it is SO worth it.  It really does a great job of getting off the dead skin and clearing up any rough patches.  This is my second bottle and I will continue to use for a long time!  Added bonus is the smell....I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have ever used. I wouldn&#x27;t us any other product! It&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s wait in gold.</li>
            <li> This scrub was recommended to me by a friend as she has had great results - I have experienced the same. Switching out my usual gentle cleanser for this scrub 2-3 nights a week resulted in fewer acne spots and a more even skin tone. I love it and would recommend to anyone looking for a new exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of, if not my favorite face product of all time!  Incredibly effective exfoliator without overly drying my skin.  Definitely not a &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; face scrub, but using this a couple times a way has dramatically improved the texture of my skin!  As an added bonus, it smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> I just used this on my face for the first time and it is UNBELIEVABLE.  My skin is glowing!!  For many years I used Philosophy Micro-Delivery Peel and this is 1000 times better.  Not only is it less expensive the results are truly amazing.  At 46 my skin is still pretty good but it&#x27;s a constant effort to keep it looking decent with the Clarisonic and a variety of lotions.  I don&#x27;t have leisure time to go to a spa to get a facial  but was seriously considering that as an option.  This walnut scrub gives such great results you won&#x27;t need to get a facial.  Get it - you won&#x27;t be sorry and for less than $30 - it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells. Wish I could use it every day! Gentle on my face, which is acne prone, and does a good job removing dead skin. I had some dry skin issues with the start of the midwest winter and I got this and there is no more flaking since I have used it. Will definitely be getting again!</li>
            <li> Loved the scrub,,,,used very little, left my skin very soft and smooth the first time after using it.  I would buy it again, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used....</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this scrub. I purchased it when I had a facial at the Ole Hendrickson spa in L.A. and I was hooked! I&#x27;m an exfoliating freak and I&#x27;ve tried tons. Before this I was using Fresh however at $50/jar, I can get two of the walnut scrub and get just as fab of results. I now use Ole Hendrickson serums, eye treatments and moisturizers and I have no complaints.  Take it from someone who is a scrub junkie...this stuff will get your skin polished and smooth.</li>
            <li> It was a very pleasant scrub. It smelled nice. But after 1 month the contents started drying off and it was weird. Like a thick sand.</li>
            <li> This scrub really works!  My face feels smooth and tighter after each use.  The only thing is that it feels and looks like termite droppings when you apply it to your face.  But who cares...it works great!</li>
            <li> Got this at a spa one time after a they used it during a facial. Great product and I&#x27;ll continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> Recently discovered Ole, and am in love with his products. This walnut scrub is the best scrub I have ever used, and trust me, I have tried them all!  The scent is wonderful and the tiny pieces of walnuts do an excellent job of exfoliating without being too harsh on your skin. Do yourself a favor, try this and  Oles other products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle scrub, but definitely  a scrub. I like the way it lathers.  Smells wonderful.  Skin is radiant afterwards.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night. It has a great scent and the texture is very gritty so it really feels like it is doing a great exfoliation on the face. After using it, my skin felt so fresh and i would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Made my face oily and caused breakouts</li>
            <li> Good product, cleans my face perfectly and also made it smooth.</li>
    </ol>
