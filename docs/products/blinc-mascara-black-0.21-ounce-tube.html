            <li>Brilliant!</li>
            <li>So...this is the best mascara ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite my knowing how perfect this stuff is, I admit, I&#x27;ve strayed and tried others that claim to tube your lashes.</li>
            <li>AWESOME AWESOME stuff.</li>

            <li>and I continue to be very happy with it.</li>
            <li>With that said, I am still really impressed with this product and will continue to wear and recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best at lengthening but it does make your lashes thicker because of the tube that forms around your lashes.</li>
            <li>Go to wal mart, you&#x27;ll have better results with mascara from there!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on beautifully and no clumping and it gives your lashes length and definition.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased this mascara and am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Lol.    </li>
            <li>I recommend this masacra to all women who want great looking lashes.  </li>
            <li>I think it is great</li>
            <li>I have skimpy lashes and this does make them look very very nice.</li>
            <li>I am happy to be able to say that it performs beautifully.</li>
            <li>It was there for good immediately until I used soap and water.  </li>
            <li>I slept in it overnight, and it looked just as good in the morning as it did when I put it on.</li>
            <li>It IS that good.</li>
            <li>I loved this product and will continue to use...</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara for those who sleep over their boyfriends house and must wake up without racoon eyes.</li>
            <li>I think a good product, I&#x27;ve tried any number of masks, of all brands and all prices, this I liked it.</li>
            <li>It gives me amazing lash definition and length.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>that technique also loosens my own lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spend the money and start loving your mascara routine</li>
            <li>Nicely lashed girl, Tumeric</li>
            <li>If you have smudging and running problems with your mascara, I highly recommend you try this awesome product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone searching for the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li>Good buy, easy to apply, does what it claims.</li>
            <li>so the product doesn&#x27;t clump up, but once you get the hang of it, it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>In theory I&#x27;m supposed to love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I like to use mascara so that they are darker and more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Because I have the wonderful combination of oily skin and allergies (which cause my eyes to tear up), most mascaras last about an hour before they start giving me raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>And yes, you can apply more than one coat.  </li>
            <li>after more than 12 hours it looked like I had just put it on.  </li>
            <li>the top of the lash also.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>But it really does stay on, doesn&#x27;t smear or run, and looks great.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to wear mascara on my bottom lashes-</li>
            <li>You will LOVE this mascara</li>
            <li>got a free sample, and could not believe my eyes!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I think my lashes are in better condition because of it--</li>
            <li>You might think all your lashes just fell out :)</li>
            <li>If you work in an office you could find a dozen or more mascaras that perform better than this one.</li>
            <li>This mascara is absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>I really do love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!HIGHLY RECOMMEND worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I have very long lashes and have searched for the perfect mascara for years.</li>
            <li>I laugh a lot too and even the top lash mascara used to end up all over the place, not just under the eyes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so different and cool and promises great lash!  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and comes off like a dream.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to remove --</li>
            <li>But comes of extremely easy.</li>
            <li>I have tried this product, Too Faced Lash Injection, and Imju Fiberwig, and this one is hands down the best product.</li>
            <li>This one has been the best for me, hands down.  </li>
            <li>Application of the product is a bit tricky, you have to apply fairly quickly and make sure to comb out the lashes</li>
            <li>Like others have stated, I have always had a HUGE problem with mascara smudging.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, it does not smudge and it does not run...</li>
            <li>After trial and error, I&#x27;ve found that washing my eye area with soap and warm water (which is what I use to wash my face) and gently using circular motions on the lash area will cause the tubes to slide off effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>and then just lightly rubbing your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>this mascara is awesome for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Basically this product is an easy clean up.</li>
            <li>you will have beautiful, long, natural-looking lashes--no clumping, no smudging--in fact, this stuff won&#x27;t go anywhere until you rub your eyes lightly with water.</li>
            <li>If I took more time and was more gentle while removing the \\&quot;tubes,\\&quot; it probably wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great concept, but you are better off saving it for a special occ- like a wedding, beach or any hot, humid local.  </li>
            <li>Spend the money and start loving your mascara routineascara may be a bit costly, but it lasts a good long while, is gentle on your eyes and lashes, easy to apply, lasts all day, doesnt clump, washes off like a breeze.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price for those of us with problematic lash issues!</li>
            <li>The product arrived in the mail today and I excitedly tried it on.  </li>
            <li>Yes the prices is steep, but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>It also keeps you lashes looking shiney and clean all day.  </li>
            <li>Once you wash this stuff off, your eyes feel clean and not abused.</li>
            <li>The application of the mascara side (its a double sided wand) is just as good as Blinc&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The claims and the illustration are 100% true.</li>
            <li>; &lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t mind spending a little more for a truly superior product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy a product like this has come out, I can now wear mascara out at night and not worry about checking in the mirror every hour for dark circles.</li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews and, even though this mascara costs more than I would normally spend, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>, Black]]if you have long lashes and just want to darken, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>This mascara may be a bit costly, but it lasts a good long while, is gentle on your eyes and lashes, easy to apply, lasts all day, doesnt clump, washes off like a breeze.</li>
            <li>I tend to laugh a lot</li>
            <li>I tried products in every price range before without success.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To remove, simply run your hands under warm water and rub your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>mascara is not cheap--but is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try..</li>
            <li>I agree with all the good things the other reviewers say.</li>
            <li>but I have very fine, blond eyelashes, so I have tried tons of different mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I can go to the gym, play hard sports for 90 minutes and get completely sweaty, and still have perfect mascara.</li>
            <li>It great that it REALLY last and last (kinda like the energizer bunny)</li>
            <li>wondered when I first tried this stuff if it would work for swimming.  </li>
            <li>This is the first mascara that has stayed in place and leaves no rings around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The first sign this product was a winner was when I goofed up a bit putting it on and accidentally got some on my eye lid...</li>
            <li>Do not over apply the first coat.</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>Turns out that is pretty wasteful, since you pay for both the mascara and primer...</li>
            <li>Like if you&#x27;re going to be working over a hot steamy stove all day I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Only took 27 years to find one I like :-)</li>
            <li>When I first saw the Kiss</li>
            <li>At first I had a heart attack thinking \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li>It too claims to wash off with warm water and minimal pressure, but i found that i would really have to tug on my lashes to get all the product off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get clumps, but it would be easy enough to separate any you get before the first coat dries.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers that this product is great for those who can&#x27;t wear regular mascara because their eyes are prone to getting \\&quot;racoon-ed\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have naturally long but blond lashes, but tend to like my lashes a bit fuller and faker looking &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much \\&quot;meh\\&quot; as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just warm water and a little tug from your fingertips -- no greasy eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It does form little tubes, they do stay on until you deliberately rub them with warm water, and when you do rub them with warm water they do come off completely, in little tubes, with no smudging.</li>
            <li>And yes REAL lashes came out too.</li>
            <li>and it is still there when I&#x27;m ready to take it off in the evening.  </li>
            <li>But, who really cares about makeup when they&#x27;re swimming anyway?</li>
            <li>I washed my face and gently rubbed my lashes and it came off kinda stringy like.  </li>
            <li>I had to have this product, and really cannot imagine ever using anything else.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, when it&#x27;s not under unusual stress</li>
            <li>I was incredibly gentle both times I used it, but both times I lost lashes.  </li>
            <li>AS LONG as you are taking it easy.  </li>
            <li>As noted by most of the other reviewers, I had a continuing problem with my mascara smudging and leaving rings under my eyes.</li>
            <li>As soon as you engage in rigorous exercise (with serious sweating) or go for anything more than a light dip, the mascara begins to come off in its little tubes....as much as i love it</li>
            <li>The problem is - it doesn&#x27;t make your lashes as full as regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>This mascara does nothing more and nothing less than add color to your lashes.</li>
            <li>As I get older, however, my lashes seem to be getting blonder, or grayer, whatever.  </li>
            <li>It will wash off easily but be aware that when you wash it off the little tubes come off.</li>
            <li>and I have high cheekbones.</li>
            <li>It goes on as easily as any other mascara, without clumping or making your lashes look spidery.</li>
            <li>It does create some kind of tube like around your eye lashes, but it&#x27;s so dull and barley noticeable when you put it on.</li>
            <li>I prefer &#x27;normal&#x27; mascara</li>
            <li>Use the black if you want to look made up, the brown for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>Then just dry your face and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how clean your eyes are.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily and my eye make up always runs all over and leaves me with raccoon eyes even only a couple hours after I first put it on.  </li>
            <li>Apply a second coat,if needed, after the first coat dries.</li>
            <li>Well, it looks like your average, cheap mascara.  </li>
            <li>Was I ever pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of its formulation it tends to dry very quickly and you&#x27;ll likely see it start to clump about 2 weeks after opening the tube.</li>
            <li>I recommend applying this mascara FIRST before all other makeup, when the lashes are very clean and not oily from any other products you are putting on your face.</li>
            <li>it off is easy, although it can be messy.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw a magazine ad for this product with its illustration of the little tubes, I said \\&quot;yeah right - an &#x27;artist&#x27;s conception&#x27;\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>you really can&#x27;t stand black racoon mascara under your eyes, this mascara is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I found that at first, I too lost a couple of lashes when removing...but figured out if you really wet down your lashes, then the mascara comes off really easily.</li>
            <li>Only thing I would like is for it to give a little more thickness to lashes.</li>
            <li>It helps if you do the top and bottom lashes separately so one can dry before doing the other.</li>
            <li>it did come off with water and soft rubbing.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>(im a sensitive girl, what can i say?).</li>
            <li>okay if you&#x27;ve got freakishly thick lashes already and just need to darken them.</li>
            <li>You can pretty much create any look you are going for and don&#x27;t have to worry about the black residue that accumulates below the eyes...</li>
            <li>It comes off very easily by just splashing your face with water a few times to get your eyes really wet</li>
            <li>Blinc makes a lash primer that is pretty much similar to the L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend...</li>
            <li>It is true that it does not \\&quot;bulk up\\&quot; your lashes like some mascara do, but you can get more than thin, spiky lashes, as described by other reviewer, if you take your time.</li>
            <li>Then you see the little tubes slide off--it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>I had ZERO flaking, ZERO smudging/smearing, and the brush is a great size for getting the lower lashes and inner corners -- not too big and thick like other brands.</li>
            <li>sometimes i debate whether it&#x27;s better to suffer with the ubiquitous racoon eyes of other mascaras than to have little lash tubes stuck all over my face....</li>
            <li>I was a little put off by the price before I tried it, but found it sooooo worth the price.</li>
            <li>My lashes will just have to stay bare in the pool.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy another mascara product for as long as I live.  </li>
            <li>wand is back to its original small size with makes it easier to work with</li>
            <li>The few extra seconds a day is worth it.</li>
            <li>seeing those little tubes slide off my lashes the first time i used it.  </li>
            <li>- however it will not give you the super thick, dark lashes that normal mascara will.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s so different and cool and promises great lash!  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily, and comes off like a dream.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to remove --</li>
            <li> But comes of extremely easy.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product, Too Faced Lash Injection, and Imju Fiberwig, and this one is hands down the best product.</li>
            <li> This one has been the best for me, hands down.  </li>
            <li> Application of the product is a bit tricky, you have to apply fairly quickly and make sure to comb out the lashes</li>
            <li> Like others have stated, I have always had a HUGE problem with mascara smudging.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, it does not smudge and it does not run...</li>
            <li> After trial and error, I&#x27;ve found that washing my eye area with soap and warm water (which is what I use to wash my face) and gently using circular motions on the lash area will cause the tubes to slide off effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> and then just lightly rubbing your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> this mascara is awesome for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Basically this product is an easy clean up.</li>
            <li> you will have beautiful, long, natural-looking lashes--no clumping, no smudging--in fact, this stuff won&#x27;t go anywhere until you rub your eyes lightly with water.</li>
            <li> If I took more time and was more gentle while removing the \\&quot;tubes,\\&quot; it probably wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great concept, but you are better off saving it for a special occ- like a wedding, beach or any hot, humid local.  </li>
            <li> Spend the money and start loving your mascara routineascara may be a bit costly, but it lasts a good long while, is gentle on your eyes and lashes, easy to apply, lasts all day, doesnt clump, washes off like a breeze.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price for those of us with problematic lash issues!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in the mail today and I excitedly tried it on.  </li>
            <li> Yes the prices is steep, but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It also keeps you lashes looking shiney and clean all day.  </li>
            <li> Once you wash this stuff off, your eyes feel clean and not abused.</li>
            <li> The application of the mascara side (its a double sided wand) is just as good as Blinc&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The claims and the illustration are 100% true.</li>
            <li> ; &lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t mind spending a little more for a truly superior product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy a product like this has come out, I can now wear mascara out at night and not worry about checking in the mirror every hour for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and, even though this mascara costs more than I would normally spend, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> , Black]]if you have long lashes and just want to darken, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li> This mascara may be a bit costly, but it lasts a good long while, is gentle on your eyes and lashes, easy to apply, lasts all day, doesnt clump, washes off like a breeze.</li>
            <li> I tend to laugh a lot</li>
            <li> I tried products in every price range before without success.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To remove, simply run your hands under warm water and rub your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> mascara is not cheap--but is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth a try..</li>
            <li> I agree with all the good things the other reviewers say.</li>
            <li> but I have very fine, blond eyelashes, so I have tried tons of different mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I can go to the gym, play hard sports for 90 minutes and get completely sweaty, and still have perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> It great that it REALLY last and last (kinda like the energizer bunny)</li>
            <li> wondered when I first tried this stuff if it would work for swimming.  </li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that has stayed in place and leaves no rings around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The first sign this product was a winner was when I goofed up a bit putting it on and accidentally got some on my eye lid...</li>
            <li> Do not over apply the first coat.</li>
            <li> So pretty.</li>
            <li> Turns out that is pretty wasteful, since you pay for both the mascara and primer...</li>
            <li> Like if you&#x27;re going to be working over a hot steamy stove all day I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Only took 27 years to find one I like :-)</li>
            <li> When I first saw the Kiss</li>
            <li> At first I had a heart attack thinking \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li> It too claims to wash off with warm water and minimal pressure, but i found that i would really have to tug on my lashes to get all the product off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get clumps, but it would be easy enough to separate any you get before the first coat dries.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that this product is great for those who can&#x27;t wear regular mascara because their eyes are prone to getting \\&quot;racoon-ed\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have naturally long but blond lashes, but tend to like my lashes a bit fuller and faker looking &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much \\&quot;meh\\&quot; as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just warm water and a little tug from your fingertips -- no greasy eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It does form little tubes, they do stay on until you deliberately rub them with warm water, and when you do rub them with warm water they do come off completely, in little tubes, with no smudging.</li>
            <li> And yes REAL lashes came out too.</li>
            <li> and it is still there when I&#x27;m ready to take it off in the evening.  </li>
            <li> But, who really cares about makeup when they&#x27;re swimming anyway?</li>
            <li> I washed my face and gently rubbed my lashes and it came off kinda stringy like.  </li>
            <li> I had to have this product, and really cannot imagine ever using anything else.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, when it&#x27;s not under unusual stress</li>
            <li> I was incredibly gentle both times I used it, but both times I lost lashes.  </li>
            <li> AS LONG as you are taking it easy.  </li>
            <li> As noted by most of the other reviewers, I had a continuing problem with my mascara smudging and leaving rings under my eyes.</li>
            <li> As soon as you engage in rigorous exercise (with serious sweating) or go for anything more than a light dip, the mascara begins to come off in its little tubes....as much as i love it</li>
            <li> The problem is - it doesn&#x27;t make your lashes as full as regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> This mascara does nothing more and nothing less than add color to your lashes.</li>
            <li> As I get older, however, my lashes seem to be getting blonder, or grayer, whatever.  </li>
            <li> It will wash off easily but be aware that when you wash it off the little tubes come off.</li>
            <li> and I have high cheekbones.</li>
            <li> It goes on as easily as any other mascara, without clumping or making your lashes look spidery.</li>
            <li> It does create some kind of tube like around your eye lashes, but it&#x27;s so dull and barley noticeable when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I prefer &#x27;normal&#x27; mascara</li>
            <li> Use the black if you want to look made up, the brown for a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> Then just dry your face and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how clean your eyes are.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and my eye make up always runs all over and leaves me with raccoon eyes even only a couple hours after I first put it on.  </li>
            <li> Apply a second coat,if needed, after the first coat dries.</li>
            <li> Well, it looks like your average, cheap mascara.  </li>
            <li> Was I ever pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of its formulation it tends to dry very quickly and you&#x27;ll likely see it start to clump about 2 weeks after opening the tube.</li>
            <li> I recommend applying this mascara FIRST before all other makeup, when the lashes are very clean and not oily from any other products you are putting on your face.</li>
            <li> it off is easy, although it can be messy.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw a magazine ad for this product with its illustration of the little tubes, I said \\&quot;yeah right - an &#x27;artist&#x27;s conception&#x27;\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> you really can&#x27;t stand black racoon mascara under your eyes, this mascara is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I found that at first, I too lost a couple of lashes when removing...but figured out if you really wet down your lashes, then the mascara comes off really easily.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would like is for it to give a little more thickness to lashes.</li>
            <li> It helps if you do the top and bottom lashes separately so one can dry before doing the other.</li>
            <li> it did come off with water and soft rubbing.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> (im a sensitive girl, what can i say?).</li>
            <li> okay if you&#x27;ve got freakishly thick lashes already and just need to darken them.</li>
            <li> You can pretty much create any look you are going for and don&#x27;t have to worry about the black residue that accumulates below the eyes...</li>
            <li> It comes off very easily by just splashing your face with water a few times to get your eyes really wet</li>
            <li> Blinc makes a lash primer that is pretty much similar to the L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend...</li>
            <li> It is true that it does not \\&quot;bulk up\\&quot; your lashes like some mascara do, but you can get more than thin, spiky lashes, as described by other reviewer, if you take your time.</li>
            <li> Then you see the little tubes slide off--it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> I had ZERO flaking, ZERO smudging/smearing, and the brush is a great size for getting the lower lashes and inner corners -- not too big and thick like other brands.</li>
            <li> sometimes i debate whether it&#x27;s better to suffer with the ubiquitous racoon eyes of other mascaras than to have little lash tubes stuck all over my face....</li>
            <li> I was a little put off by the price before I tried it, but found it sooooo worth the price.</li>
            <li> My lashes will just have to stay bare in the pool.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy another mascara product for as long as I live.  </li>
            <li> wand is back to its original small size with makes it easier to work with</li>
            <li> The few extra seconds a day is worth it.</li>
            <li> seeing those little tubes slide off my lashes the first time i used it.  </li>
            <li> - however it will not give you the super thick, dark lashes that normal mascara will.</li>
            <li> It forms little tubes around your eyelashes, odd but true.</li>
            <li> The first time you take this mascara off it can be a little alarming since it comes off in one piece.</li>
            <li> I always buy high end cosmetics with a few exceptions.</li>
            <li> You can hardly see it at first.</li>
            <li> The big draw back is after using it for a couple of weeks, my lashes seemed pretty thin.  </li>
            <li> While the application was simple, it looked VERY natural - there was very little in terms of making my lashes look fuller or elongating them.  </li>
            <li> The only downside, which is very minor, is that it takes just a bit longer than normal mascara to dry, so you have to be careful for a few minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> I have found a tube lasts an incredibly long time.  </li>
            <li> and yes, it does darken your lashes, but it makes them spindly, not lush - and it clumps like no body&#x27;s business, if you try and build it up - your lashes all stick together.  </li>
            <li> This stays on for as long as you want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesnt have that harsh chemically odor that sometimes can irritate sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a mascara I use everyday because I usually go for a more dramatic lush look.</li>
            <li> (although I admit, I don&#x27;t cry often and don&#x27;t make a practice of rubbing my eyes throughout the day, so my experience may be different from other reviewers).</li>
            <li> I popped this baby back into the makeup bag, but will def pull it out when I need extreme mascara.</li>
            <li> Keep splashing water and don&#x27;t let the area dry out until everything has come off.</li>
            <li> Apply and let dry.</li>
            <li> Apply and let dry again and, VOILA--</li>
            <li> you want thick waterproof lashes try benefits badgal mascara, or any other volumizing mascara of your choice and use urban decays lingerie and galoshes primer and waterproofer to keep your mascara smudge, flake and run free even from eye rubbing and excessive crying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think this product is only for the person who finds herself in an environment that causes other mascaras to break down.</li>
            <li> , the mascara was STILL THERE -- I had only lost a couple of little \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; off of my lower lashes from rubbing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the second coat is not really necessary unless you want really thick lashes.</li>
            <li> this is just a warning that if you were planning to buy it for long swims in the ocean or to wear to your kick boxing class, expect to end up with little spider legs across your face.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown away my eye makeup remover and all other mascaras.</li>
            <li> You let it dry for a moment--and it will form little tubes around each eyelash.</li>
            <li> If you try to \\&quot;build volume\\&quot; as described in the instructions, you get scary, daddy-long-legs crooked spider-leg lashes that are not full or natural looking at all.    </li>
            <li> the only thing is that it leaves me a bit hard lashes.</li>
            <li> When you wipe off this mascara you get ugly black smears on your washcloth, just exactly the same as you would with any other mascara.    </li>
            <li> But with this price tag its just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, the \\&quot;extend\\&quot; side of the mascara (its the white primer stuff that is supposed to make prep your lashes with fibers that once the mascara is applied will make them look fuller and longer) sucks.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the look of mascara on my lower lashes, but hate the smudge.    </li>
            <li> Given that lashes grow back at an insanely slow rate, if at all, this is not a product that I would recommend.    </li>
            <li> The tubes come off and you have all these tube fragments to rinse down the drain (don&#x27;t recommend doing this in the bathtub, unless you like soaking with things that look like spider legs).  </li>
            <li> I also did not like the black stains</li>
            <li> But if you want really thick long lashes then this is not the mascara for you.</li>
            <li> This product is a gel that creates a little coating around the lash that won&#x27;t come off until you apply both water and a little friction.</li>
            <li> However after a few hours and if you tend to rub your eye or cry even the tiniest bit</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Because of the way it dries it will tend to make the lashes look a bit stiff and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then at night it&#x27;s hard to get fully off and still leaves dark marks under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was intrigued with the idea of this mascara - little tubes!  </li>
            <li> My mother thought something was wrong with me because i had at least ten little flakes on my cheeks one time.</li>
            <li> They come off in small eyelash-shaped tubes.  </li>
            <li> This is way to expensive and I was one who got tricked into paying such money.</li>
            <li> I have tried a series of various mascara&#x27;s including waterproof, expensive, inexpesive etc.</li>
            <li> No more smudging or running</li>
            <li> Months later I saw it in a store, and, fed up with smudging mascara (even the best-quality brands) and the need for expensive makeup remover to get it off every night, I tried it.</li>
            <li> If I work a double shift, I never have to feel insecure about the smuges under my eyes, or my eyelashes looking dull.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever wear makeup</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 4 years now and I would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> Just like someone else complained of.</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled to spend $24 on mascara</li>
            <li> , it was a little weird</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara there is--including expensive ones like Jane Iredale--to little avail.</li>
            <li> I will be going back to Benefit Bad Gal Lash, no doubt.</li>
            <li> if: &lt;br /&gt;you hate smudges under your eyes; &lt;br /&gt;your eyes are sensitive, you wear contacts, or you have allergies;</li>
            <li> I also always hated how regular mascara always seemed to leave dark circles around my eyes even whilst using eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It sucks to take off!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical given my past experience but decided to try it</li>
            <li> Just give the mascara a few seconds to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; a little after removing the applicator from the tube and then apply from base to tip of lash.</li>
            <li> Trying to put the mascara then over this stuff makes the clump-factor even worse.</li>
            <li> But once I got it off which wasn&#x27;t difficult</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s total crap, so save your money!</li>
            <li> The one bad thing is that it seems to thin out my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you hate clumping or flaking;</li>
            <li> What is the point of wearing mascara if it makes you look terrible...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever. I tend to laugh a lot and I have high cheekbones. I seemed to always look in the mirror and find smudged mascara under my eyes. What is the point of wearing mascara if it makes you look terrible... I would think as I wiped it away. I have used this product for at least 4 years now and I would not use anything else. It goes on smoothly, it does not smudge and it does not run...and yet it gently comes of without harsh chemicals and without scrubbing. I tried products in every price range before without success. I was a little put off by the price before I tried it, but found it sooooo worth the price. I have found a tube lasts an incredibly long time.  It works and it lasts. If you have smudging and running problems with your mascara, I highly recommend you try this awesome product!</li>
            <li> If this were a LOT cheaper i&#x27;d repurchase. I always buy high end cosmetics with a few exceptions. But with this price tag its just not worth it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In theory...well this is a really awesome idea. But if you want really thick long lashes then this is not the mascara for you. The best thing about this mascara is it doesn&#x27;t smudge. However after a few hours and if you tend to rub your eye or cry even the tiniest bit it FLAKES and you have these things that look like eyelashes all over your cheeks. Yes, it looks like your eyelashes are falling out everywhere. My mother thought something was wrong with me because i had at least ten little flakes on my cheeks one time. They look like lashes because they form tubes around each individual lash. They&#x27;re supposed to not come off unless you use soap and water and rub your lashes but i had mascara flakes everywhere. And yes REAL lashes came out too. Just like someone else complained of. I have no idea why. Still, this didn&#x27;t make my eyes itchy or watery so it gets points for that. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you want thick waterproof lashes try benefits badgal mascara, or any other volumizing mascara of your choice and use urban decays lingerie and galoshes primer and waterproofer to keep your mascara smudge, flake and run free even from eye rubbing and excessive crying.</li>
            <li> In theory I&#x27;m supposed to love this mascara.  It&#x27;s so different and cool and promises great lash!  The problem is - it doesn&#x27;t make your lashes as full as regular mascara.  Not at all.  It&#x27;s sort of like acrylic paint, you brush it on and yes, it does darken your lashes, but it makes them spindly, not lush - and it clumps like no body&#x27;s business, if you try and build it up - your lashes all stick together.  I suppose this would work okay if you&#x27;ve got freakishly thick lashes already and just need to darken them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the plus side - it did not flake, run, wipe off and it did come off with water and soft rubbing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I prefer &#x27;normal&#x27; mascara and I won&#x27;t be using this product.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this mascara and am happy with the product.  I agree with the other reviewers that this product is great for those who can&#x27;t wear regular mascara because their eyes are prone to getting \\&quot;racoon-ed\\&quot; - however it will not give you the super thick, dark lashes that normal mascara will. I use it with Blinc&#x27;s eyelash primer, which seems to give my lashes some added volume. Application of the product is a bit tricky, you have to apply fairly quickly and make sure to comb out the lashes so the product doesn&#x27;t clump up, but once you get the hang of it, it is very easy to use. I recommend applying this mascara FIRST before all other makeup, when the lashes are very clean and not oily from any other products you are putting on your face. This will ensure that the lashes don&#x27;t flake off.  I am so happy a product like this has come out, I can now wear mascara out at night and not worry about checking in the mirror every hour for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I should probably mention that I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup (not since the 80s, anyway).  As I get older, however, my lashes seem to be getting blonder, or grayer, whatever.  I like to use mascara so that they are darker and more noticeable.  Because I have the wonderful combination of oily skin and allergies (which cause my eyes to tear up), most mascaras last about an hour before they start giving me raccoon eyes.  This is a look I like to avoid.  So, I went without any mascara for several years until I found Kiss Me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome!  I put it on in the morning and it is still there when I&#x27;m ready to take it off in the evening.  The only thing I&#x27;ve found that makes it flake a bit is getting my hour-long massage.  Something about pressing my eyes into the head rest and the aforementioned teary eyes makes it start to flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking it off is easy, although it can be messy.  The tubes come off and you have all these tube fragments to rinse down the drain (don&#x27;t recommend doing this in the bathtub, unless you like soaking with things that look like spider legs).  After trial and error, I&#x27;ve found that washing my eye area with soap and warm water (which is what I use to wash my face) and gently using circular motions on the lash area will cause the tubes to slide off effortlessly.  Do not moisten and pull at the tubes, as I&#x27;ve found that technique also loosens my own lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered when I first tried this stuff if it would work for swimming.  Um, no.  My lashes will just have to stay bare in the pool.  But, who really cares about makeup when they&#x27;re swimming anyway?</li>
            <li> Una aclaración: el Blinc rizador térmico no funcionó. Entonces opté por un rizado en una estética. El resultado fue de toda mi satisfacción.     Probé la máscara sobre las pestañas rizadas en la estética y no en mis pestañas naturales. Me parece un buen producto, he probado cualquier cantidad de mascaras, de todas las marcas y todos los precios, esta me ha gustado mucho. Lo único es que me deja las pestañas un poco duras. Creo que podrían mejorar la forma del cepillo. Hice la prueba de dormir con la máscara puesta y adiós a los ojos manchados y las pestañas mantuvieron la forma.    -  A clarification: the Blinc heat curler did not work. So I opted for a lash curler in an aesthetic. The result was my entire satisfaction.    I think a good product, I&#x27;ve tried any number of masks, of all brands and all prices, this I liked it. the only thing is that it leaves me a bit hard lashes. I think they could improve the shape of the brush. I tested sleep with the mask on and goodbye the raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another mascara product for as long as I live.  If I work a double shift, I never have to feel insecure about the smuges under my eyes, or my eyelashes looking dull.  This stays on for as long as you want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove, simply run your hands under warm water and rub your eyes.  They come off in small eyelash-shaped tubes.  And yes, you can apply more than one coat.  I do.</li>
            <li> I have short Asian eyelashes so mascara always smeared and left marks on my upper and lower lids. This is the first mascara that has stayed in place and leaves no rings around my eyes. I have tried all companies and this is a miracle product. It is worth the price for those of us with problematic lash issues!</li>
            <li> I actually fell asleep on white pillows and in the morning not a smudge anywhere .. face or pillow ....just sent an email to all my girlfriends to tell them about this !!! Love it!!!HIGHLY RECOMMEND worth the price!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST make up item I have EVER bought.  I was not thrilled to spend $24 on mascara but I was so fed up with the drug store brands I took a risk.  Best decision ever.  My skin is oily and my eye make up always runs all over and leaves me with raccoon eyes even only a couple hours after I first put it on.  Then at night it&#x27;s hard to get fully off and still leaves dark marks under my eyes.  For a while I stopped wearing eye make up all together just because I looked so unprofessional with my make up always failing.  The first sign this product was a winner was when I goofed up a bit putting it on and accidentally got some on my eye lid...I couldn&#x27;t get it off!  It was there for good immediately until I used soap and water.  I couldn&#x27;t even smudge it or blend it in with my finger.  Then I wore it all day moving... after more than 12 hours it looked like I had just put it on.  I had no circles under eyes and no flaking.  I washed my face and gently rubbed my lashes and it came off kinda stringy like.  But once I got it off which wasn&#x27;t difficult I had zero residue.  I tried to use a make up remover pad on my eye lids and there was nothing left to take off after just a simple face washing.  I&#x27;m hooked and will probably buy this for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> As noted by most of the other reviewers, I had a continuing problem with my mascara smudging and leaving rings under my eyes. I also did not like the black stains regular mascara would leave on my washcloth even after using make-up remover. I read all of the reviews and, even though this mascara costs more than I would normally spend, I decided to give it a try. I am happy to be able to say that it performs beautifully. It goes on easily, and comes off like a dream. I have been using it every day for over 3 months and have not ever had it come off before I took it off (although I admit, I don&#x27;t cry often and don&#x27;t make a practice of rubbing my eyes throughout the day, so my experience may be different from other reviewers). It is true that it does not \\&quot;bulk up\\&quot; your lashes like some mascara do, but you can get more than thin, spiky lashes, as described by other reviewer, if you take your time. Just give the mascara a few seconds to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; a little after removing the applicator from the tube and then apply from base to tip of lash. Coat the top of the lash also. Do not over apply the first coat. I don&#x27;t get clumps, but it would be easy enough to separate any you get before the first coat dries. Apply a second coat,if needed, after the first coat dries. Then stop worrying about your mascara for the rest of the day (or even overnight). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my experience with this mascara, I have had no eyelashes fall out when removing it. It comes off very easily by just splashing your face with water a few times to get your eyes really wet and then just lightly rubbing your eyelashes. Keep splashing water and don&#x27;t let the area dry out until everything has come off. Then just dry your face and you&#x27;ll be surprised at how clean your eyes are. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you really can&#x27;t stand black racoon mascara under your eyes, this mascara is well worth the price. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It gives me amazing lash definition and length. It is so easy to remove -- just warm water and a little tug from your fingertips -- no greasy eye makeup remover. I put this mascara to the test. I slept in it overnight, and it looked just as good in the morning as it did when I put it on. I went swimming in it, and not only did I *not* come out with Alice Cooper eyes, the mascara was STILL THERE -- I had only lost a couple of little \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; off of my lower lashes from rubbing. I had ZERO flaking, ZERO smudging/smearing, and the brush is a great size for getting the lower lashes and inner corners -- not too big and thick like other brands. Only thing I would like is for it to give a little more thickness to lashes. I have tried this product, Too Faced Lash Injection, and Imju Fiberwig, and this one is hands down the best product.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever wear makeup but I have very fine, blond eyelashes, so I have tried tons of different mascaras.  This one has been the best for me, hands down.  I have to admit, it was a little weird seeing those little tubes slide off my lashes the first time i used it.  But it really does stay on, doesn&#x27;t smear or run, and looks great.  Use the black if you want to look made up, the brown for a more natural look.  I&#x27;ve found that the second coat is not really necessary unless you want really thick lashes.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this mascara.  It&#x27;s a great concept, but you are better off saving it for a special occ- like a wedding, beach or any hot, humid local.  It great that it REALLY last and last (kinda like the energizer bunny) and it doesn&#x27;t run, smear or wear off until you take it off.  The big draw back is after using it for a couple of weeks, my lashes seemed pretty thin.  I popped this baby back into the makeup bag, but will def pull it out when I need extreme mascara.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the good things the other reviewers say. I have NEVER been able to wear mascara on my bottom lashes- I have my racoon limits! I laugh a lot too and even the top lash mascara used to end up all over the place, not just under the eyes! But with the Kiss Me mascara, I feel so racy, I can wear mascara on the bottom lashes every day! So pretty. I found that at first, I too lost a couple of lashes when removing...but figured out if you really wet down your lashes, then the mascara comes off really easily. The few extra seconds a day is worth it. I have skimpy lashes and this does make them look very very nice. You won&#x27;t get the uber-thick-and-goopy-chunky look that some gals like, though.</li>
            <li> You will LOVE this mascara if: &lt;br /&gt;you hate smudges under your eyes; &lt;br /&gt;your eyes are sensitive, you wear contacts, or you have allergies; &lt;br /&gt;you hate clumping or flaking; &lt;br /&gt;you like a longer lash; &lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t like to spend a ton of time applying makeup; &lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t mind spending a little more for a truly superior product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got a free sample, and could not believe my eyes! I had to have this product, and really cannot imagine ever using anything else. It IS that good.</li>
            <li> this mascara is awesome for everyday use. it lasts ages and doesnt smudge or flake until you take it off....AS LONG as you are taking it easy.  As soon as you engage in rigorous exercise (with serious sweating) or go for anything more than a light dip, the mascara begins to come off in its little tubes....as much as i love it sometimes i debate whether it&#x27;s better to suffer with the ubiquitous racoon eyes of other mascaras than to have little lash tubes stuck all over my face....As mentioned, when it&#x27;s not under unusual stress this stuff rocks- this is just a warning that if you were planning to buy it for long swims in the ocean or to wear to your kick boxing class, expect to end up with little spider legs across your face.</li>
            <li> I have very long lashes and have searched for the perfect mascara for years. \\&quot;Kiss Me Mascara\\&quot; by Blinc is groundbreaking. It never clumps, never leaves you with \\&quot;racoon eyes\\&quot;, never smudges or melts, and best of all - it lasts all day! This is the only mascara I will use and I swear by it. I highly recommend this product to anyone searching for the perfect mascara. :) Well worth the money. Thank you, Blinc!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was intrigued with the idea of this mascara - little tubes!  Brilliant! Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.    The product arrived in the mail today and I excitedly tried it on.  Well, it looks like your average, cheap mascara.  It flakes and makes your eyelashes get all stuck together.  If you try to \\&quot;build volume\\&quot; as described in the instructions, you get scary, daddy-long-legs crooked spider-leg lashes that are not full or natural looking at all.    And as for the \\&quot;tiny tubes\\&quot; that you&#x27;re supposed to see when you remove it -- there aren&#x27;t any.  When you wipe off this mascara you get ugly black smears on your washcloth, just exactly the same as you would with any other mascara.    It&#x27;s total crap, so save your money!</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase. I LOVE the look of mascara on my lower lashes, but hate the smudge.    This mascara does nothing more and nothing less than add color to your lashes. Don&#x27;t expect volume or length. I have naturally long but blond lashes, but tend to like my lashes a bit fuller and faker looking &#x3D;) Lol.    Good buy, easy to apply, does what it claims.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000LJI6NI Blinc Kiss Me Tube Mascara, Black]]if you have long lashes and just want to darken, this is a good choice.  Other than that, you&#x27;re not going to get any length or volume.</li>
            <li> I have been using this masacra for over 3 years now and I can say it is the only mascara I will ever use.  It goes on beautifully and no clumping and it gives your lashes length and definition.  It also keeps you lashes looking shiney and clean all day.  I recommend this masacra to all women who want great looking lashes.  Yes the prices is steep, but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> So...this is the best mascara ever. I have tried all the drugstore brands, the designer brands, the \\&quot;oh so gentle\\&quot; mineral mascaras, but none of them hold a candle to this mascara. It goes on as easily as any other mascara, without clumping or making your lashes look spidery. This stuff stays put! It doesnt smudge or flake off into your eyes. It doesnt have that harsh chemically odor that sometimes can irritate sensitive eyes (im a sensitive girl, what can i say?). I also always hated how regular mascara always seemed to leave dark circles around my eyes even whilst using eye makeup remover. Once you wash this stuff off, your eyes feel clean and not abused. I think my lashes are in better condition because of it--no chemicals overdrying my lashes, no chemicals needed to remove the junk, no tugging, pulling, scrubbing to remove it. Makes sense, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my knowing how perfect this stuff is, I admit, I&#x27;ve strayed and tried others that claim to tube your lashes. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Double Extend for example...While it is cheaper, you get what you pay for! The application of the mascara side (its a double sided wand) is just as good as Blinc&#x27;s but when it comes time to remove it, that&#x27;s when you see the difference. It sucks to take off! It too claims to wash off with warm water and minimal pressure, but i found that i would really have to tug on my lashes to get all the product off. Not to mention, the \\&quot;extend\\&quot; side of the mascara (its the white primer stuff that is supposed to make prep your lashes with fibers that once the mascara is applied will make them look fuller and longer) sucks. It will flake and clump. Trying to put the mascara then over this stuff makes the clump-factor even worse. When using this mascara, i would never use that primer end. Turns out that is pretty wasteful, since you pay for both the mascara and primer...Blinc makes a lash primer that is pretty much similar to the L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend...it&#x27;s pretty much \\&quot;meh\\&quot; as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: This mascara may be a bit costly, but it lasts a good long while, is gentle on your eyes and lashes, easy to apply, lasts all day, doesnt clump, washes off like a breeze. AWESOME AWESOME stuff. Spend the money and start loving your mascara routineascara may be a bit costly, but it lasts a good long while, is gentle on your eyes and lashes, easy to apply, lasts all day, doesnt clump, washes off like a breeze. AWESOME AWESOME stuff. Spend the money and start loving your mascara routine</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes it would give me fuller eyelashes. It don&#x27;t. Basically this product is an easy clean up. It does create some kind of tube like around your eye lashes, but it&#x27;s so dull and barley noticeable when you put it on. But comes of extremely easy. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money. This is way to expensive and I was one who got tricked into paying such money. Go to wal mart, you&#x27;ll have better results with mascara from there!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping it would make my average-length lashes look thicker and play up the glamour.  While the application was simple, it looked VERY natural - there was very little in terms of making my lashes look fuller or elongating them.  That in and of itself wasn&#x27;t necessarily a deal breaker, but removing the product was - I was incredibly gentle both times I used it, but both times I lost lashes.  Given that lashes grow back at an insanely slow rate, if at all, this is not a product that I would recommend.    I will be going back to Benefit Bad Gal Lash, no doubt.</li>
            <li> This product is a gel that creates a little coating around the lash that won&#x27;t come off until you apply both water and a little friction. I personally guarantee it will not cause raccoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of its formulation it tends to dry very quickly and you&#x27;ll likely see it start to clump about 2 weeks after opening the tube. The product will give some definition and length though it doesn&#x27;t give a lot of volume or curl. Because of the way it dries it will tend to make the lashes look a bit stiff and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand is back to its original small size with makes it easier to work with (there was a couple year period when they switched to a big fat brush which made application awful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want to remove this product when you&#x27;re in the shower. The first time you take this mascara off it can be a little alarming since it comes off in one piece. You might think all your lashes just fell out :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this product is only for the person who finds herself in an environment that causes other mascaras to break down. Like if you&#x27;re going to be working over a hot steamy stove all day I&#x27;d recommend this product. If you work in an office you could find a dozen or more mascaras that perform better than this one.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and will continue to use... You can pretty much create any look you are going for and don&#x27;t have to worry about the black residue that accumulates below the eyes... Woo hooo.. Only took 27 years to find one I like :-)</li>
            <li> I have tried a series of various mascara&#x27;s including waterproof, expensive, inexpesive etc. With each type I have had a similar problem that the mascara ultimately ended up smudging under my eyes during the day. When I first saw the Kiss Me mascara touted as a no smudge mascara I was skeptical given my past experience but decided to try it, what did I have to lose after all? Was I ever pleasantly surprised! This mascara is absolutely fantastic! No more smudging or running and it lasts all day. It comes off like a dream without any make-up remover. In a recent Sephora store visit they were out of this mascara and the sales women tried to sell me a different brand. No way! I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about 2 years now and I continue to be very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Gals--you won&#x27;t believe your eyes--literally! I had NO EYELASHES to speak of. I have tried every mascara there is--including expensive ones like Jane Iredale--to little avail. Just stubbly, almost non-existent eyelashes. Until I tried Kiss Me mascara. It&#x27;s different--it goes on lightly--thinly. You can hardly see it at first. You let it dry for a moment--and it will form little tubes around each eyelash. Apply and let dry. Apply and let dry again and, VOILA--you will have beautiful, long, natural-looking lashes--no clumping, no smudging--in fact, this stuff won&#x27;t go anywhere until you rub your eyes lightly with water. Then you see the little tubes slide off--it&#x27;s cool. Kiss me mascara is not cheap--but is worth every penny. Let me know if it works for you! Nicely lashed girl, Tumeric</li>
            <li> I really do love this mascara. I am a makeup artist for another brand and wear every one of their products except for the mascara. Like others have stated, I have always had a HUGE problem with mascara smudging. Kiss Me mascara has never smudged on me. I think it is great and I recommend it to my clients who have problems with smudging. The one bad thing is that it seems to thin out my eyelashes. Every time I remove the mascara, I pull out an eyelash or two.  If I took more time and was more gentle while removing the \\&quot;tubes,\\&quot; it probably wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. I think I&#x27;ll have to stop using it during the summer to let my lashes plump back up. With that said, I am still really impressed with this product and will continue to wear and recommend it. It is definitely worth a try..I say \\&quot;go for it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara for those who sleep over their boyfriends house and must wake up without racoon eyes. It forms little tubes around your eyelashes, odd but true. It will wash off easily but be aware that when you wash it off the little tubes come off. At first I had a heart attack thinking \\&quot;Oh my God, it&#x27;s taking my eyelashes off!\\&quot; Nope, it&#x27;s the tubes! It&#x27;s not the best at lengthening but it does make your lashes thicker because of the tube that forms around your lashes. It&#x27;s not a mascara I use everyday because I usually go for a more dramatic lush look.</li>
            <li> When I first saw a magazine ad for this product with its illustration of the little tubes, I said \\&quot;yeah right - an &#x27;artist&#x27;s conception&#x27;\\&quot;. Months later I saw it in a store, and, fed up with smudging mascara (even the best-quality brands) and the need for expensive makeup remover to get it off every night, I tried it. The claims and the illustration are 100% true. It does form little tubes, they do stay on until you deliberately rub them with warm water, and when you do rub them with warm water they do come off completely, in little tubes, with no smudging. I can go to the gym, play hard sports for 90 minutes and get completely sweaty, and still have perfect mascara. Amazing. I&#x27;ve thrown away my eye makeup remover and all other mascaras. The only downside, which is very minor, is that it takes just a bit longer than normal mascara to dry, so you have to be careful for a few minutes after applying. It helps if you do the top and bottom lashes separately so one can dry before doing the other.</li>
