            <li> a very different smell, but clean smell and very safe like it. also like the extra bottle protection keeps UV rays at bay. nice smell</li>
            <li> Getting far more compliments than I expected. Glad I purchased this one! Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I&#x27;d say if you like it try Success De Paris Fujiyama Private Number.  I think it smells similar but better for quite a lot less money too.</li>
            <li> Smells like a Bear tackled a Dragon, had babies with a Panda, and caressed the woman that you&#x27;re trying to impress with this cologne. It smells great and lasts about 4-5 hours, although i&#x27;ve had females compliment me in the hours past 6pm and i put the cologne on at around 8am before leaving to work. So maybe my nasal smell acuity sucks. Overall, super satisfied and I&#x27;d go with the big bottle b/c this is great for every day use.</li>
            <li> very masculine fragance.</li>
            <li> Not very intense but good enough for a couple of hours</li>

            <li> Stronger smelling version of the very good Perry Ellis 18. The non-intense version has a nice smell, but tends to be very subtle and fade during the day. This version goes on stronger and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> it smells nice. not on your face kind of cologne. i dont think anybody can say i dont like it. it is mild and pleasant.</li>
