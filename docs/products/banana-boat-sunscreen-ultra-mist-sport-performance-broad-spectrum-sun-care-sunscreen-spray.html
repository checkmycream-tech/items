    <ol>

            <li>This is the best stuff I have ever used!</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s got to be the best seeing as it says it&#x27;s 100  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy and he is too!</li>
            <li>However, the best protection is to stay out of the sun if you can.</li>
            <li>so thought the sunscreen would be awesome also,</li>
            <li>Rub it in, and reapply when you can, but this works great!</li>
            <li>so all in all a win!</li>
            <li>has a perfect even spray.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the beach.</li>
            <li>So I am impressed with the fourty minutes or so.</li>
            <li>I found that this product protects a very fair skinned child excellently.</li>
            <li>I have this one for my Thailand trip, perfect... Very good for my beach day and sunshine day.</li>
            <li>I set a timer on my phone to remind me to spray it every 30 minutes because the sun was very bright.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead with VERY fair ivory skin.</li>
            <li>Being very fair (albino)</li>
            <li>Great item at a great price!</li>
            <li>This is the good stuff!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have a 100 SPF sunscreen in a spray can.  </li>
            <li>Great product otherwise.</li>
            <li>it went on great and didnt leave any missed spots.</li>
            <li>Their sport 50 SPF works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>great when your out fishing.</li>
            <li>Even protects my fair skinned wife.</li>
            <li>Supposedly this stuff is good for 80 minutes</li>
            <li>It is a good product though,</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend who has vitiligo and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Good cost and benefit</li>
            <li>I find even with its 80 minute rating, I need to find shade after about 40minutes of exposure to the sun, which is quite good.</li>
            <li>plus we love the smell of banana boat!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing...</li>
            <li>This works great, protects against burning and is perfect for the beach or any outside activities.</li>
            <li>I am very, very fair skinned, and I had my first beach vacation ever without a sunburn after using this product.  </li>
            <li>After using it this summer I will stick with the lotion kind as it works a lot better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s every effective and gives us protection from harmful sunrays. :)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>Easy application, light scent, great protection.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fine line between \\&quot;use in a well-ventilated area\\&quot; and \\&quot;do not apply in windy conditions\\&quot;, as even the smallest breeze seems to cause application problems.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen ,a little sticky, but excellent protection</li>
            <li>One star because it&#x27;s very light weight but who cares if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The texture is not too greasy, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel very comfortable with the spray.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This spray is very light on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, effective blockage from the harmful sun rays.</li>
            <li>i love the spray</li>
            <li>Love the protection grate product</li>
            <li>I love the smell of banana boat</li>
            <li>The spray works wonders and I love the twist pock instead of having to deal with the cap.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the beach for my husband&#x27;s head, legs, and feet, which are all so white they are blinding, and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love the sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it if the nozzle worked better.</li>
            <li>I feel like it protects longer than most brands.</li>
            <li>love the lip balm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure {that&#x27;s why I bought it, quicker to spray on}.</li>
            <li>Plus, my kids love the spray as opposed to the lotion.</li>
            <li>I make sure my husband and kids apply it too before they go for a swim and play under the sun.</li>
            <li>I have to buy it online, though, because most stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li>No greasy feel, which I love.</li>
            <li>I still got a bit sun burn but much better than my friend who refused to put it on</li>
            <li>With most products, I tend to be allergic to them.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to apply.</li>
            <li>Most sunscreens give me about 20minutes of protection in strong sun.</li>
            <li>I love using this sunscreen specially when I at the beach enjoying the sun with my family.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and has no offensive smell.</li>
            <li>burns easy.</li>
            <li>Spray sunscreen is so wasteful but it is also so easy to apply..  </li>
            <li>The fumes from the fine alcohol-based mist are noxious, though, so you won&#x27;t want to use it indoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain, you have to really work to get sufficient sunscreen out.  </li>
            <li>Goes on light and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>This is what kept me burn free and probably skin cancer free</li>
            <li>generally gives good protection.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, and I highly recommend it, with the proper precautions</li>
            <li>It has worked even if not applied a full 15 minutes before exposure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the feeling and look due to knowing how great it works.</li>
            <li>I purchased this with some other items and got a great deal.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works tremendously well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily and spraying it on is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This is offers great protection at a relatively low cost in comparison to supermarkets.</li>
            <li>and she was so right.  </li>
            <li>Spraying on hand to apply to face or body doesn&#x27;t really work since it sticks and dries so quickly.</li>
            <li>Normally I prefer to use a lotion sunscreen or a stick type sunscreen, but I knew my daughter would not want to hold still to have it applied that often being excited at the zoo.</li>
            <li>First time this summer using the spray sunscreen on my kids and self.  </li>
            <li>It is important to follow the directions and wait until it completely dries until you get in the water.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>, as with any sunscreen all day isn&#x27;t really all day!</li>
            <li>When I find myself at the point where I need to stop getting any more red, I hit myself with this</li>
            <li>Mist pretty well.</li>
            <li>I would rather have the small amount of greasiness than burn and, honestly, the greasiness goes away quickly after it is applied.</li>
            <li>The sunblock may be ok, but the sprayer shoots a small mist, and it&#x27;s easy to miss covering some spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on sunblock</li>
            <li>My wife can attest I was pretty excited; for the first time in my life, I could look forward to going some place outdoors without the constant fear of burning.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>The only problem is using this in windy conditions the spray mist will get diverted easily.  </li>
            <li>The initial wetness makes it easy to see where you&#x27;ve sprayed or missed.</li>
            <li>I know tis product is highly rated and such but didn&#x27;t really realize just how good i was until one day, because my mind was elsewhere, I forgot to spray my legs prior to my bike ride.  </li>
            <li>So you know it hold up to water and sweat very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product just as described</li>
            <li>believe that the Banana Boat 110 spray really works.</li>
            <li>Not one bit of sunburn despite the intense sun.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and worked out really well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>his was didnt tan much with the spray</li>
            <li>WILL STAIN ALL WHITE AND LIGHT COLORED CLOTHING</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work, and it is non-greasy, and it seems to be very persistent.</li>
            <li>Not a huge fan of the lotion kind.</li>
            <li>I spent about a full minute spraying my upper body which felt like &amp;#34;way more than enough&amp;#34; since the Coppertone covers that area in about 8 seconds.</li>
            <li>but you will use more doing it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found spraying and arm and then using the other arm to rub it in and then vice-versa works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color picked up was astonishing and it took some days for it to get the skin color back near normal.  </li>
            <li>Most albinos can only stay out in the sun with a sunscreen generally for a quarter of the stated exposure time before burning, and needing to seek shelter from the sun.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily and rubs in very easily.  </li>
            <li>It was a very sunny day with a UV index of 9 (which is really really high, and for someone like me, NOT recommended).</li>
            <li>I bought this because it is much cheaper than neutrogena, but I now think it&#x27;s worth the extra couple dollars.</li>
            <li>Who knew that SPF went that high?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this and &amp;#34;Coppertone Sport High Performance Continuous Spray&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Strong smell of alcohol also, due to being aerosol</li>
            <li>WOW it really will stay on all day at the beach or pool.</li>
            <li>I was sort of worried at first, as I could barely feel it on my skin after application.</li>
            <li>Very fair skinned and or Albinos have to be aware of the sun, and seek shelter or shade even with the highest rated sunscreen within a half hour of exposure, or get a very serious sun burn.  </li>
            <li>Not a single sunburn the whole week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and compact and can fit anywhere without using much room in your purse or luggage.</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised to see the reviews on here that said</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this works nearly as well as sunscreen lotion.</li>
            <li>I discovered this product through my adult daughter.  </li>
            <li>It lasts well even after swimming, though you are always advised to reapply frequently to obtain maximum protection.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised this product is on the market.</li>
            <li>They recalled it and offer no refunds - they responded to my request with a \\&quot;no reply\\&quot; letter saying it could be disposed of in the regular trash if legal in your area and hoped I would buy their product again.  </li>
            <li>I have used multiple sunscreens in the past, most to no avail.</li>
            <li>Oh, sure, the lotion will work, but only after leaving me greasy and uncomfortable, and at that point, nothing&#x27;s really fun anymore since that&#x27;s all I can focus on.</li>
            <li>I use a 50 spf and wanted something for even higher protection, this looked good to me, the button to spray is difficult to press down on, you have to put ALOT of pressure for the mist to come out,, Sprayed it on me, was shiny and greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li>We went to FL in May with our very white New England skin and we never got burnt using this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>As someone who has had melanoma in the past, I pretty much bathe in sunscreen.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coppertone sprays a fast, wet, even coating.</li>
            <li>(waterproof only means it will last the suggested time in water which is normally 90 mins) and after sweating..</li>
            <li>It is really hard to press the top down.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and airy feeling on the skin, and softens the feel of the skin, unlike creams which tend to be thick and heavy.</li>

            <li> Normally I prefer to use a lotion sunscreen or a stick type sunscreen, but I knew my daughter would not want to hold still to have it applied that often being excited at the zoo.</li>
            <li> First time this summer using the spray sunscreen on my kids and self.  </li>
            <li> It is important to follow the directions and wait until it completely dries until you get in the water.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> , as with any sunscreen all day isn&#x27;t really all day!</li>
            <li> When I find myself at the point where I need to stop getting any more red, I hit myself with this</li>
            <li> Mist pretty well.</li>
            <li> I would rather have the small amount of greasiness than burn and, honestly, the greasiness goes away quickly after it is applied.</li>
            <li> The sunblock may be ok, but the sprayer shoots a small mist, and it&#x27;s easy to miss covering some spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on sunblock</li>
            <li> My wife can attest I was pretty excited; for the first time in my life, I could look forward to going some place outdoors without the constant fear of burning.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The only problem is using this in windy conditions the spray mist will get diverted easily.  </li>
            <li> The initial wetness makes it easy to see where you&#x27;ve sprayed or missed.</li>
            <li> I know tis product is highly rated and such but didn&#x27;t really realize just how good i was until one day, because my mind was elsewhere, I forgot to spray my legs prior to my bike ride.  </li>
            <li> So you know it hold up to water and sweat very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product just as described</li>
            <li> believe that the Banana Boat 110 spray really works.</li>
            <li> Not one bit of sunburn despite the intense sun.</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and worked out really well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> his was didnt tan much with the spray</li>
            <li> WILL STAIN ALL WHITE AND LIGHT COLORED CLOTHING</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does work, and it is non-greasy, and it seems to be very persistent.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the lotion kind.</li>
            <li> I spent about a full minute spraying my upper body which felt like &amp;#34;way more than enough&amp;#34; since the Coppertone covers that area in about 8 seconds.</li>
            <li> but you will use more doing it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found spraying and arm and then using the other arm to rub it in and then vice-versa works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color picked up was astonishing and it took some days for it to get the skin color back near normal.  </li>
            <li> Most albinos can only stay out in the sun with a sunscreen generally for a quarter of the stated exposure time before burning, and needing to seek shelter from the sun.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily and rubs in very easily.  </li>
            <li> It was a very sunny day with a UV index of 9 (which is really really high, and for someone like me, NOT recommended).</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is much cheaper than neutrogena, but I now think it&#x27;s worth the extra couple dollars.</li>
            <li> Who knew that SPF went that high?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this and &amp;#34;Coppertone Sport High Performance Continuous Spray&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Strong smell of alcohol also, due to being aerosol</li>
            <li> WOW it really will stay on all day at the beach or pool.</li>
            <li> I was sort of worried at first, as I could barely feel it on my skin after application.</li>
            <li> Very fair skinned and or Albinos have to be aware of the sun, and seek shelter or shade even with the highest rated sunscreen within a half hour of exposure, or get a very serious sun burn.  </li>
            <li> Not a single sunburn the whole week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact and can fit anywhere without using much room in your purse or luggage.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised to see the reviews on here that said</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works nearly as well as sunscreen lotion.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product through my adult daughter.  </li>
            <li> It lasts well even after swimming, though you are always advised to reapply frequently to obtain maximum protection.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised this product is on the market.</li>
            <li> They recalled it and offer no refunds - they responded to my request with a \\&quot;no reply\\&quot; letter saying it could be disposed of in the regular trash if legal in your area and hoped I would buy their product again.  </li>
            <li> I have used multiple sunscreens in the past, most to no avail.</li>
            <li> Oh, sure, the lotion will work, but only after leaving me greasy and uncomfortable, and at that point, nothing&#x27;s really fun anymore since that&#x27;s all I can focus on.</li>
            <li> I use a 50 spf and wanted something for even higher protection, this looked good to me, the button to spray is difficult to press down on, you have to put ALOT of pressure for the mist to come out,, Sprayed it on me, was shiny and greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li> We went to FL in May with our very white New England skin and we never got burnt using this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> As someone who has had melanoma in the past, I pretty much bathe in sunscreen.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coppertone sprays a fast, wet, even coating.</li>
            <li> (waterproof only means it will last the suggested time in water which is normally 90 mins) and after sweating..</li>
            <li> It is really hard to press the top down.  </li>
            <li> It is very light and airy feeling on the skin, and softens the feel of the skin, unlike creams which tend to be thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> The time ratings are for normal, not very light skinned people.</li>
            <li> I had planned on sending this to camp with my 9 year old daughter, but she is not strong enough to spray it.</li>
            <li> I immediatly had to put a long shirt on to cover up because i felt burning..</li>
            <li> used it per the instructions, applied every two hours and immediately after towel dry.</li>
            <li> I was in Mexico for a few days using this and only got a tiny bit of a tan</li>
            <li> I put it on my son every morning before school and it takes only a few seconds to give him some extra protection for the day!</li>
            <li> Here is my history; every single occasion I have gone to an amusement park, water park, or beach, I have burned.</li>
            <li> Nozzle to be fixed, another brand not sure the name</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they are selling old sunscreen or</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t sweat, don&#x27;t swim, down use a towel, it will probably last all day..</li>
            <li> But again, the above activities break it down and cause it to not work as well..</li>
            <li> Whenever we took a food break or bathroom break, I would take the time to spray down my exposed areas (my hair is thinning, so that includes turning this sunscreen into a pseudo-hairspray).&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have used this sunscreen on my other trips; to amusement parks, to the lake, and whenever I knew I would be outside for extended periods.</li>
            <li> After the exposure, my nose was a little red, but there was no real burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought 6 bottles and my family got badly sunburned after using this and we reapplied many times.</li>
            <li> sure this is another convenience that is bad for the environment, and probably my respiratory health but</li>
            <li> and I knew I was going to be sitting in direct sunlight for at least 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I came across this at Wal-Mart a few months back and decided to use it on a trip to King&#x27;s Island in Mason, Ohio.</li>
            <li> I also closed my eyes and sprayed my ears.</li>
            <li> I spent a day at the zoo with my family and took this along with me.</li>
            <li> I applied this stuff at home, then spent 4 hours at an outdoor event, and never burned.</li>
            <li> thought maybe it was due to being out in the sun all day rather than the fault of the sunscreen</li>
            <li> If your goal is to NOT get burned and have extremely reliable protection in water environments, go with the Coppertone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I re-applied 4 times throughout the day spent at the pool and still got burned!</li>
            <li> We spent twelve and a half hours at King&#x27;s Island, from 9:30 AM to 10:00 PM, and upon returning home, I immediately began checking myself for burns.</li>
            <li> mark/spray on dark clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Areas can be missed during spray.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The nozzle does not spray as it should unless it is upside down.</li>
            <li> Every 30 minutes I sprayed us all down well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember all sunscreen has to be reapplied after toweling, after swimming (The chemicals break it down)</li>
            <li> The only unfortunate thing is it didn&#x27;t even give me a tan, being a software developer I&#x27;m still as white as I was before going to the waterpark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completed Half Ironmans without having to reapply.</li>
            <li> This cost me $2 less that what Walmart charged Aug. 2014).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see where you&#x27;ve sprayed because it will dry before you finish.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this happens to any other bottles, but ours had a defect.</li>
            <li> were both a little</li>
            <li> My skin did burn a little.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> so I brought it with me to the pool a few times.</li>
            <li> These are always hard to protect.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever had sun burns working as an aquatics director..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out in the sun for work, and some clients complained about BB not working.  </li>
            <li> relatives have skin cancer, it sucks.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat sprays a slow, puny mist.</li>
            <li> Not a good replacement for lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Sticky consistency after spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this formula.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I went to a baseball game</li>
            <li> it is worse than the 30 or 50 proofs I have used.  </li>
            <li> SPF, broad spectrum and water resistant, I was wrong!!!</li>
            <li> The sprayer in difficult to work on this sunscreen, at times.  </li>
            <li> my goodness I think I got the worst sunburn of my life and after re-applying religiously throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> but I am noticing an undesirable trend in all Banana Boat products I&#x27;ve ever tried, because every bottle I buy leaves my skin so greasy and it looks wet and disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Worse than worthless.  </li>
            <li> Even after reapplying still had bad burn</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed and in pain</li>
            <li> It might feel a bit annoying (and you do look a bit shiny), but</li>
            <li> I thought this provided very bad coverage....</li>
            <li> This product is horrible, I bought this thinking</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and had never used the mist type sprayers before - It was awful and came out just as a runny dribble.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this s*** keeps me from being lobster boy.  i love the spray</li>
            <li> for the price this stuff is in stores i can&#x27;t complain about this at all! I was great for the beach!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Northern European extraction and I don&#x27;t get along well with the Sun. I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on sunblock and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s best for me to just stay in the shade. Yesterday I went to a baseball game and I knew I was going to be sitting in direct sunlight for at least 3 hours. (As it turned out, it was 5 hours) The stadium does not allow you to bring things like this into the park so I gave myself a liberal application before entering. It did not burn me or feel greasy as others here have said. I baked for 5 hours in 90+ degree heat and when I went home there was no sun burn!,nothing, nada. This is the best stuff I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised to see the reviews on here that said it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I am a chronic burner; I come from a pasty German/Norwegian family in Minnesota, so the sun is my arch enemy. I have used multiple sunscreens in the past, most to no avail. Oh, sure, the lotion will work, but only after leaving me greasy and uncomfortable, and at that point, nothing&#x27;s really fun anymore since that&#x27;s all I can focus on. I came across this at Wal-Mart a few months back and decided to use it on a trip to King&#x27;s Island in Mason, Ohio. It was a very sunny day with a UV index of 9 (which is really really high, and for someone like me, NOT recommended). I applied it before leaving the house, giving it time to set in the car while we traveled. I was sort of worried at first, as I could barely feel it on my skin after application. Here is my history; every single occasion I have gone to an amusement park, water park, or beach, I have burned. Period. 100% of the time, ever since I was a baby, which was 25 years ago. This sunscreen broke that curse, whoo boy. We spent twelve and a half hours at King&#x27;s Island, from 9:30 AM to 10:00 PM, and upon returning home, I immediately began checking myself for burns. I found nothing, at all. My wife can attest I was pretty excited; for the first time in my life, I could look forward to going some place outdoors without the constant fear of burning.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I should add, I did reapply periodically throughout the day. Whenever we took a food break or bathroom break, I would take the time to spray down my exposed areas (my hair is thinning, so that includes turning this sunscreen into a pseudo-hairspray).&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have used this sunscreen on my other trips; to amusement parks, to the lake, and whenever I knew I would be outside for extended periods. My family used it as well during a recent visit, and none of them burned where it was applied.&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t vouch for everyone, I can say that for someone like me, I THINK I&#x27;ve foundmy sunscreen of choice from now on.</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t think anyone would recommend going for 5 hours without reapplying I did. I had 5 hours in the Arizona sun with one application and I didn&#x27;t even have the slightest hint of a burn. I was at a water park constantly getting soaked as well. This stuff is amazing. The only unfortunate thing is it didn&#x27;t even give me a tan, being a software developer I&#x27;m still as white as I was before going to the waterpark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out in the sun for work, and some clients complained about BB not working.  Sprayed this 110 and another brand of 15 in different areas.  Areas sprayed with BB 110 burned, those with the 15 didn&#x27;t.  Worse than worthless.  Tried contacting them on their site, that doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> The sprayer in difficult to work on this sunscreen, at times.  Kind of a pain, you have to really work to get sufficient sunscreen out.  No complaints about coverage or scent.  I bought this because it is much cheaper than neutrogena, but I now think it&#x27;s worth the extra couple dollars.</li>
            <li> I thought this provided very bad coverage....it is worse than the 30 or 50 proofs I have used.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and lasts forever. I&#x27;ve completed Half Ironmans without having to reapply. So you know it hold up to water and sweat very well. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily and rubs in very easily.  Even protects my fair skinned wife. Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I like this product! It&#x27;s not oily and spraying it on is fast and easy. Just wish it was cheaper though.</li>
            <li> Love the protection grate product</li>
            <li> I love the smell of banana boat and I know it is a reliable product but I am noticing an undesirable trend in all Banana Boat products I&#x27;ve ever tried, because every bottle I buy leaves my skin so greasy and it looks wet and disgusting.  I do not recommend this for that fact alone, and I guess whether you buy it or not is a personal judgement call because I have only used it once and I won&#x27;t use it again.  YUCK</li>
            <li> This product is horrible, I bought this thinking it&#x27;s got to be the best seeing as it says it&#x27;s 100  SPF, broad spectrum and water resistant, I was wrong!!! We went to Soak City this weekend and I was the only one that only used the BB 100 SPF Sport everyone else either combined it throughout the day with the Coppertone baby sunscreen or the Coppertone 45 SPF spray and had no problems, but my goodness I think I got the worst sunburn of my life and after re-applying religiously throughout the day.  I am so disappointed and in pain, I will never buy another BB product again!!!</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the lotion kind. The spray works wonders and I love the twist pock instead of having to deal with the cap. Sprays on evenly and non greasy. Always kept this on hand when my boyfriend and I went on our road trip. It&#x27;s small and compact and can fit anywhere without using much room in your purse or luggage.</li>
            <li> I found that this product protects a very fair skinned child excellently. It has worked even if not applied a full 15 minutes before exposure.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the beach for my husband&#x27;s head, legs, and feet, which are all so white they are blinding, and it worked great!  Not a single sunburn the whole week. I&#x27;m happy and he is too!</li>
            <li> The nozzle does not spray as it should unless it is upside down. I am not sure if this happens to any other bottles, but ours had a defect. Otherwise, I love the sunscreen. IT WORKS! The sun does not burn us with this sunscreen. I don&#x27;t mind the feeling and look due to knowing how great it works. I would rather have the small amount of greasiness than burn and, honestly, the greasiness goes away quickly after it is applied. It is an amazing product. I would recommend it if the nozzle worked better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have a 100 SPF sunscreen in a spray can.  The only problem is using this in windy conditions the spray mist will get diverted easily.  Great product otherwise.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Just make sure you apply it evenly, otherwise you will end up with weird tan/burn lines.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product just as described</li>
            <li> For my current vacation in Colorado, I did not bring any sunscreen with me. I have been a longtime Banana Boat user. So, when I saw the Banana Boat 110 spray, I decided to give it a try. Who knew that SPF went that high? For walking around Breckenridge, altitude 9,500 feet and lots of solar UV, I sprayed it on my legs, arms, and neck. The result was that there was no evidence of sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, we did a climb of Mt. Evans, 14,264 feet. This involved over four hours of exposure above tree line with no shade. Again, in preparation, I sprayed it on my legs, arms, and neck. I also closed my eyes and sprayed my ears. These are always hard to protect. I also rubbed it on my face. After the exposure, my nose was a little red, but there was no real burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that the Banana Boat 110 spray really works. However, the best protection is to stay out of the sun if you can. After that, keep exposed skin to a minimum and always wear a hat.</li>
            <li> We used this spray on a recent trip to The Bahamas. Not one bit of sunburn despite the intense sun. Will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen ,a little sticky, but excellent protection</li>
            <li> First time this summer using the spray sunscreen on my kids and self.  After using it this summer I will stick with the lotion kind as it works a lot better.</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff!  Works to block the effects of sunlight.  I highly recommend this product.  I use it everyday so I know it works, and works for hours after application.  Easy to use and has no offensive smell.</li>
            <li> As someone who has had melanoma in the past, I pretty much bathe in sunscreen. So, SPF 100 is my saving grace. I love how easy it is to apply. The scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering like Nutrogena is. I feel like it protects longer than most brands. I&#x27;m outside a lot, and I haven&#x27;t gotten a tan yet this summer. That&#x27;s saying a lot considering I&#x27;m Spanish.</li>
            <li> only on my grandson though.&lt;br /&gt;I love the lip balm so thought the sunscreen would be awesome also, NOT! Well not for me that is. I bought it for protection for my tattoos and it didn&#x27;t work at all. Strong smell of alcohol also, due to being aerosol I&#x27;m sure {that&#x27;s why I bought it, quicker to spray on}. Think I will just use it on my grandson when needed because it worked extremely well on him and not sure why when it didn&#x27;t for me but think I&#x27;ll go back to my original brand for my tats.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful! I spent a day at the zoo with my family and took this along with me. I set a timer on my phone to remind me to spray it every 30 minutes because the sun was very bright. Normally I prefer to use a lotion sunscreen or a stick type sunscreen, but I knew my daughter would not want to hold still to have it applied that often being excited at the zoo. Every 30 minutes I sprayed us all down well. Supposedly this stuff is good for 80 minutes but I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance. At the end of the day we all had tan lines and my husband and I were both a little burned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe it was due to being out in the sun all day rather than the fault of the sunscreen so I brought it with me to the pool a few times. I always apply a lotion sunscreen and then later I apply the spray. After trying it several times and still getting burned (I spend max 45 mins - 1 hour at the pool) I don&#x27;t think this works nearly as well as sunscreen lotion.</li>
            <li> I was in Mexico for a few days using this and only got a tiny bit of a tan and I&#x27;m the type that is white white, burns easy. I finally had to quite using it just so i could get a tan.</li>
            <li> We went to FL in May with our very white New England skin and we never got burnt using this sunscreen. It is non greasy and worked out really well. I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with VERY fair ivory skin. I can burn in 15 minutes without sunblock. I applied this stuff at home, then spent 4 hours at an outdoor event, and never burned. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> When you don&#x27;t want to burn just use this. Rub it in, and reapply when you can, but this works great!</li>
            <li> It helps when I can not avoid the sun. However I found a bit cheaper rite aid. It is a good product though,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has vitiligo and he loved it. his was didnt tan much with the spray so his spots werent as visable!!!  it went on great and didnt leave any missed spots. plus we love the smell of banana boat! so all in all a win!</li>
            <li> 100 SPF! Plus, my kids love the spray as opposed to the lotion.</li>
            <li> I love using this sunscreen specially when I at the beach enjoying the sun with my family. I make sure my husband and kids apply it too before they go for a swim and play under the sun. It&#x27;s every effective and gives us protection from harmful sunrays. :)</li>
            <li> This will definitely protect you from the sun but they need to fix the way it sprays out. Nozzle to be fixed, another brand not sure the name but it has a baby on the beach for a logo has a perfect even spray.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good sunscreen.  I purchased this with some other items and got a great deal.  It is important to follow the directions and wait until it completely dries until you get in the water.</li>
            <li> I use this brand every time I use sunscreen and this product did not work! I bought 6 bottles and my family got badly sunburned after using this and we reapplied many times. I&#x27;m not sure if they are selling old sunscreen or what but I&#x27;ll never buy sunscreen online again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the brands of sunscreen that my family used over the summer. This works great, protects against burning and is perfect for the beach or any outside activities.</li>
            <li> Simply does not work. End the day burnt as if I didn&#x27;t put anything on. Their sport 50 SPF works great. Not sure what&#x27;s wrong with this formula. Don&#x27;t buy it.    One star because it&#x27;s very light weight but who cares if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!  I am very, very fair skinned, and I had my first beach vacation ever without a sunburn after using this product.  I have to buy it online, though, because most stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have this one for my Thailand trip, perfect... Very good for my beach day and sunshine day. It helps not get sunburnt.</li>
            <li> Easy application, light scent, great protection. I put it on my son every morning before school and it takes only a few seconds to give him some extra protection for the day! No greasy feel, which I love.</li>
            <li> WILL STAIN ALL WHITE AND LIGHT COLORED CLOTHING</li>
            <li> does not perform as a 100% sunscreen the way we thought it would, but it does offer some protection but has to be reapplied often!!</li>
            <li> Amazing... Good cost and benefit</li>
            <li> Spray sunscreen is so wasteful but it is also so easy to apply..  I was an aquatics director for 10 years and this is all I used! If a user is following the directions, this stuff works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember all sunscreen has to be reapplied after toweling, after swimming (The chemicals break it down) (waterproof only means it will last the suggested time in water which is normally 90 mins) and after sweating..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as with any sunscreen all day isn&#x27;t really all day! If you don&#x27;t sweat, don&#x27;t swim, down use a towel, it will probably last all day.. But again, the above activities break it down and cause it to not work as well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this stuff is great.  I hardly ever had sun burns working as an aquatics director.. This is what kept me burn free and probably skin cancer free</li>
            <li> It is really hard to press the top down.  I have to use my thumb to do it.  I had planned on sending this to camp with my 9 year old daughter, but she is not strong enough to spray it.</li>
            <li> Products that offer multi-skin benefits that go beyond UVA/UVB protection, like water-resistance, ease of application and comfort.</li>
            <li> used while on our trip to Hawaii. I was in the sun all day. used it per the instructions, applied every two hours and immediately after towel dry. the result is zero burn and no pain. used 3 bottles in one week. wouldn&#x27;t use anything else in the future</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use, effective blockage from the harmful sun rays. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just spray this stuff on, despite the promise of being \\&quot;rub-free\\&quot; on the front. The back says \\&quot;spray liberally and spread evenly by hand\\&quot;. While I was spraying it I got the impression that lots of it wasn&#x27;t ending up on my skin, even though I was \\&quot;.. 4 to 6 inches from the skin...\\&quot;. It&#x27;s a very fine line between \\&quot;use in a well-ventilated area\\&quot; and \\&quot;do not apply in windy conditions\\&quot;, as even the smallest breeze seems to cause application problems. The fumes from the fine alcohol-based mist are noxious, though, so you won&#x27;t want to use it indoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took 11 grams of product to cover my arms, legs, and neck (determined by weighing the container before and after usage). It sprays out at a rate of about 2/3 of a gram a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, and it is non-greasy, and it seems to be very persistent. The scent clung to my arms even after a shower, and even after I washed my arms thoroughly again.</li>
            <li> Bought this and while it worked for blocking the sun, it left this gross white sticky film everywhere!  Took 3 showers to scrub it all off!!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product through my adult daughter.  She tends to get rashes from the sun so living here in the South, protection is a must.  She mentioned this one left no stickiness and she was so right.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is offers great protection at a relatively low cost in comparison to supermarkets.This cost me $2 less that what Walmart charged Aug. 2014). It lasts well even after swimming, though you are always advised to reapply frequently to obtain maximum protection.</li>
            <li> The sunblock may be ok, but the sprayer shoots a small mist, and it&#x27;s easy to miss covering some spots. Will never buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this and &amp;#34;Coppertone Sport High Performance Continuous Spray&amp;#34;. Summary: I managed to still get burned with Banana Boat, whereas the Coppertone felt as though I was in the shade all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coppertone sprays a fast, wet, even coating. The initial wetness makes it easy to see where you&#x27;ve sprayed or missed. It dries within about a minute, leaving an almost waxy coating. It might feel a bit annoying (and you do look a bit shiny), but WOW it really will stay on all day at the beach or pool. If your goal is to NOT get burned and have extremely reliable protection in water environments, go with the Coppertone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison Banana Boat sprays a slow, puny mist. It&#x27;s hard to see where you&#x27;ve sprayed because it will dry before you finish. I spent about a full minute spraying my upper body which felt like &amp;#34;way more than enough&amp;#34; since the Coppertone covers that area in about 8 seconds. I re-applied 4 times throughout the day spent at the pool and still got burned!</li>
            <li> When I find myself at the point where I need to stop getting any more red, I hit myself with this and it stops the sunburn in it&#x27;s tracks. great when your out fishing.</li>
            <li> I use a 50 spf and wanted something for even higher protection, this looked good to me, the button to spray is difficult to press down on, you have to put ALOT of pressure for the mist to come out,, Sprayed it on me, was shiny and greasy on my skin. Then i walked around for 1 hour in 90 degree weather.. My skin started burning.. I immediatly had to put a long shirt on to cover up because i felt burning.. My skin did burn a little. I am really surprised this product is on the market. I hope children do not use this and get burned.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this sunscreen, it&#x27;s spray on, avoiding the hassle of getting greasy lotion on your hands. The texture is not too greasy, which is very important to me. I used this when we were on a vacation to the beach, I sprayed it on and then I got into the water. I still got a bit sun burn but much better than my friend who refused to put it on</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and had never used the mist type sprayers before - It was awful and came out just as a runny dribble.  They recalled it and offer no refunds - they responded to my request with a \\&quot;no reply\\&quot; letter saying it could be disposed of in the regular trash if legal in your area and hoped I would buy their product again.  I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> Not a good replacement for lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Sticky consistency after spray.&lt;br /&gt;Can leave a &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; mark/spray on dark clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Areas can be missed during spray.&lt;br /&gt;Will burn after haircut/shave.</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price!</li>
            <li> Mist pretty well. Don&#x27;t even bother in the wind. Spraying on hand to apply to face or body doesn&#x27;t really work since it sticks and dries so quickly. Well, you can do it but you will use more doing it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found spraying and arm and then using the other arm to rub it in and then vice-versa works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this is another convenience that is bad for the environment, and probably my respiratory health but what to do?&lt;br /&gt;My relatives have skin cancer, it sucks.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Even after reapplying still had bad burn</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel very comfortable with the spray.&lt;br /&gt;But generally gives good protection.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the beach. No one got sunburned.</li>
            <li> This spray is very light on the skin.  It does not feel clammy, or cakey.  Being very fair (albino) I find even with its 80 minute rating, I need to find shade after about 40minutes of exposure to the sun, which is quite good. I stay inside for about 20minutes or so, then reapply the spray.  With most products, I tend to be allergic to them. No such reaction to the banana boat product. Most sunscreens give me about 20minutes of protection in strong sun. So I am impressed with the fourty minutes or so. It is very light and airy feeling on the skin, and softens the feel of the skin, unlike creams which tend to be thick and heavy. Most albinos can only stay out in the sun with a sunscreen generally for a quarter of the stated exposure time before burning, and needing to seek shelter from the sun. The time ratings are for normal, not very light skinned people. Very fair skinned and or Albinos have to be aware of the sun, and seek shelter or shade even with the highest rated sunscreen within a half hour of exposure, or get a very serious sun burn.  This is a very good product, and I highly recommend it, with the proper precautions</li>
            <li> I know tis product is highly rated and such but didn&#x27;t really realize just how good i was until one day, because my mind was elsewhere, I forgot to spray my legs prior to my bike ride.  The color picked up was astonishing and it took some days for it to get the skin color back near normal.  This stuff works tremendously well and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
