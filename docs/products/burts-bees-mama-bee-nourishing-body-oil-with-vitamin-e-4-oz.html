            <li>Plus I really liked the smell.</li>

            <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li>To me, an option like almond, vanilla or something else would be nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>The texture of the oil is nice.</li>
            <li>But for the overwhelming smell I would have loved this product.</li>
            <li>It did have a nice smell and was not oily.</li>
            <li>and I know is popular.</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>

            <li>This oil smells good and is easy to apply all over my belly and thighs.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say I prefer this Mama Bee Baby Oil much better.  </li>
            <li>Great product, great smell, love that it is natural.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, nice and fresh lemon scent.</li>
            <li>Not too strong for me but a nice lemony scent.</li>
            <li>The oil goes on easily and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>I used this while pregnant, while I loved the smell</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say for sure that if it stops stretch marks, but I can say that I never had any</li>

            <li>The smell of this is way better than the belly butter</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and am looking forward to growing with this.</li>
            <li>Like a lemon drop :) And keeps your skin shiny and moisture.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT and recommend it.</li>
            <li>A delight to be able to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li>( Lemons :) )&lt;</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say that the resulting skin quality is very pleasing.</li>
            <li>great smell but dries fast.</li>
            <li>so i believe is mostly genetic</li>
            <li>Make sure you wear clothing</li>
            <li>Also, I love all things lemon</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>After using a similar product and not liking it I am very happy with this!!</li>
            <li>Love the lemon oil scents also.</li>
            <li>It smells really good like fresh lemon</li>
            <li>This oil smells wonderful and was the only product during pregnancy that stopped the itching of my stretching skin.</li>
            <li>and this was my favorite.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed both the belly butter and the oil.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this and apply every morning after a shower.</li>
            <li>Love the smell &amp; even if it didn&#x27;t remove my marks it made marks lighter in color.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>The smell was so potent</li>
            <li>It smells FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>the oil is okay, just did not like the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees products before and love them.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and absorbs well, so you&#x27;re not left with an oily residue.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and was the only product that soothed my friend&#x27;s itchy skin during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this body oil.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 39 weeks :)</li>
            <li>so we were able to keep a stable supply.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for my second pregnancy, and I&#x27;m still very happy with the feel and smell of it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this oil</li>
            <li>so so far so good!</li>
            <li>and this has a nice, light, and sweet lemon scent!</li>
            <li>but usually I am in good shape if I apply it first and then brush my teeth, put lotion on my face, etc.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, almost 5 months pregnant and showing....</li>
            <li>I started using this since I was 5mon pregnant, and I hv been loving this product.</li>
            <li>The lemon aroma is very strong when you&#x27;re putting it on, which I found very energizing and pleasant while pregnant.</li>
            <li>This oil is not greasy, smells amazing and fresh and controls itching if used twice a day or each time I shower.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this through the add-on program at Amazon, and wished I would have purchased more than one bottle.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the fresh scent, and it leaves me feeling moisturized!</li>
            <li>and I have done hours of research on products that are not only good for you but that work!</li>
            <li>I am a picky person and don&#x27;t like sticky or oily products but this product goes on smoothly and has been doing a great job of keeping my skin soft and hopefully helping to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Easy ordering and shipping.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this oil as much as others did, but it just hasn&#x27;t done anything spectacular for me.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Thanks already received the product I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li>It however dose not spred very well but is great to put in a hot bath and soak in leaving me feeling greasy at first but then nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Much better than baby oils (even the gel kinds) because the oil absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you al greasy.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly!  </li>
            <li>And dries quickly!</li>
            <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s and this product has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and did not leave my skin oily.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product to help reduce stretch marks during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Absorbs well, I have yet to see any \\&quot;oil\\&quot; transfer to clothing or on my light tan sheets (when applying before bed time.)</li>
            <li>It makes my belly smooth</li>
            <li>Love this natural oil - it feels nice and keeps belly hydrated.</li>
            <li>Great product, absorbs really well &amp; fast.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth and feels so good after a shower or bath.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I am able to get dressed right away with no oily residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this particular oil is amazing.  </li>
            <li>when I was 33wks pregnant, but I still like this oil since it is so easy to apply &amp; helps with the itch.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells first off</li>
            <li>but I can imagine it even being better after a hot bath.</li>
            <li>I use this oil with q-tips for his hands and also for the one fold in his neck that I can never seem to get clean in the bath.</li>
            <li>Not too strong - a fresh lemony scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for my dry skin!</li>
            <li>Hard to find and a great product!</li>
            <li>and my belly is nice and soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nice soft, not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>I have since learned that getting stretch marks is more determined by genetics and how much your skin can stand to stretch.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that my wife swears by this product after having two kids and her tummy looking and feeling in such good shape</li>
            <li>(I did not like the sweet smell of cocoa butter).  </li>
            <li>Smells really really good, but I don&#x27;t think it actually did anything for my body.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>Coco butter smelled too sweet for me this pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it helps when your belly gets itchy from stretching too much.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for something to easy the itchiness and make my belly feel smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, smell good and light enough, I also use the Burt&#x27;s Bees belly butter on top of it, but somehow they still do not stop the itch on a growing belly (it works for a couple of hours when I first put it on, then the itch would come back)</li>
            <li>So far I love the oil, I put it on my legs when their dry and my face, and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I used this every day after I got out of the shower while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>but what else would you wear pregnant anyways?</li>
            <li>I think I am going to just stick with this on my pregnant belly and buy some quality lotion for the rest of my body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A must for all pregnant women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on my stomach because I&#x27;m pregnant, but I also use it on my arms, legs, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my pregnant belly</li>
            <li>And I like the mild lemon drop scent.  </li>
            <li>A must have item when you&#x27;re pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Im 17 weeks pregnant, using it with the body butter on my breasts and growing belly.</li>
            <li>The smell is a very light lemon scent, not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive pregnant nose.  </li>
            <li>not sure about the stretch mark claims but really love the citrus smell and loved the feeling of putting it on my belly.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of most other stretch mark preventing lotions, but this has a nice natural, refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>This smells nice, my legs stay smoother for longer, and it&#x27;s nice to soak in a hot tub with just a few drops of this with some Epsom salts.</li>
            <li>I like the lemony scent and it does absorb quickly into my skin right after a shower.</li>
            <li>The scent after application is still pleasant but more subtle.</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my skin feeling soft and it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.</li>
            <li>I love this product not only because it&#x27;s all natural but because it rubs in nice without making you feel too greasy.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t showed signs of stretch marks, however, I was not expecting this product to be able to prevent them.  </li>
            <li>Love that.&lt;br /&gt;All natural.</li>
            <li>I use this fresh out of the shower then apply my lotion</li>
            <li>You only have to use the smallest amount for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li>This lovely Lemon smell oil is not messy at all.  </li>
            <li>I use this right when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I put this on right before i get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s recommended for right after a shower/bath and that works.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for a newly pregnant friend on the basis of all the positive comments.</li>
            <li>So far so good and no stretch marks but have a few months to go:-).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know the issues that I would have with dry skin during pregnancy, even in warm and humid weather.</li>
            <li>It does dry and absorb nicely too.</li>
            <li>It is also very, very greasy.</li>
            <li>It is light and smells citrusy, and I don&#x27;t have one stretch mark in 28 weeks of pregnancy thus far.</li>
            <li>I used this for my first pregnancy every day and had no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil in the first trimester of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The lemon smell is just too much though!</li>
            <li>It really helps with the appearance of my mommy marks!</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li>It does have more unnatural ingredients in it, but still beats a belly scratch red all the time..</li>
            <li>I use the belly butter on my belly only and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t feel slick and slimy like most oils</li>
            <li>Smells very lemony and fresh.  </li>
            <li>To me it was even better than my Gold Bond Ultimate Care lotion for my legs.</li>
            <li>great product but the bottle is so small!</li>
            <li>Has a fresh lemon scent that was particularly helpful during my morning sickness weeks.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees in general and this is another quality product.</li>
            <li>It was my first pregnancy and a did have one or two very faded stretch marks on my breast from puberty.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I guess I put too much because it stained my pajama shirt.</li>
            <li>lovely aroma &amp; stays on long</li>
            <li>I use this for my belly w/ the butter as well and super soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to my pure vitamin-E or almond oil brands I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the oil does have vitamin e because that&#x27;s one of the main reasons I bought it!</li>
            <li>Messy, but makes the skin feel smooth and itch free.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Very relaxing and helped reduce stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I am a real advocate of these guys.  </li>
            <li>Like the smell but don&#x27;t really find this product to be very hydrating.</li>
            <li>You can oil and lotion and grease yourself up as much as you want but if the stretch marks are coming, they won&#x27;t be stopped.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is much different than using a cheap body lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid of him putting his hands in his mouth since the oil is all natural.</li>
            <li>I used this with the Mama Bee Belly Butter during my whole pregnancy and no stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>Really greasy.</li>
            <li>I used it throughout my pregnancy for moisturizing whole body and preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Fast absorption and healing properties.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very hydrated</li>
            <li>and I think it (along with the Mama Bees Belly Butter) has really helped with the itchiness from my expanding belly.  </li>
            <li>Skin very moist and whiney after.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It worked well and after the baby there really isn&#x27;t much evidence of stretching and the like.  </li>
            <li>The smell is my other favorite part of this product as well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as oily as other products which I love.</li>
            <li>Love the light citrus smell, but once open the cap leaks a little if the bottle falls over</li>
            <li>I have used this product throughout my second and third trimesters and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My wife would use this constantly while she was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my skin feel, but it&#x27;s a mess.</li>
            <li>I was highly dissatisfied with this shipment of Burt&#x27;s Bees body oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>No marks so far!!</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and how it is a little thicker</li>
            <li>I tried some other vitamin E oils and like this by far the best as it wasn&#x27;t too thick and greasy feeling and it dried pretty quickly</li>
            <li>It is 100% natural, smells like lemons, and gentle.</li>
            <li>I normally use in the evenings when I&#x27;m not worried about the oily feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of thick going on</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark my entire pregnancy!!!:)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone with dry skin or eczema pregnant or not.</li>
            <li>So far im 28 weeks and have been using this since i was 8 weeks!</li>
            <li>Just know that if you have skin that is genetically not built to stretch and bounce back, there are most likely stretch marks in your future.</li>
            <li>My son would never open his hands for the first couple of months</li>
            <li>Soft skin and elasticity return!</li>
            <li>So i am may try to find other oroduct of same quality with better price</li>
            <li>The only thing has consistently worked for me is the Aveeno skin relief lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this at least helped!</li>
            <li>The only positive I can say here is the packaging.</li>
            <li>This is a hard product to find at many retailers, and it is rather expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my skin was extremely soft.</li>
            <li>so I put it on at bedtime and always wear old tshirts.....</li>
            <li>My breasts were covered in stretch marks early in pregnancy</li>
            <li>Use regularly and appears to be very nourishing for skin.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 5 month of pregnancy and have begun to worry about getting stretch marks.</li>
            <li>None so far</li>
            <li>I like it because it makes my growing belly soft</li>
            <li>This body oil makes my skin feel buttery soft.</li>
            <li>All natural.  </li>
            <li>Helps with the itchy belly and keeps your belly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I would say that if you are sensitive to smell during pregnancy, do not use this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>All natural moisture for anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>The pregnant wife loves this stuff and lathers down with it every night before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>I use this mainly for back massages</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li>with little to no clothing on, you&#x27;ll be fine to get dressed later on.</li>
            <li>, they are purple though so a lot of people say they will go back to normal.</li>
            <li>I only was able to salvage half the bottle, but sending it back and reordering would have taken a while and perhaps yielded the same result.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind and it absorbs pretty quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>I no longer have a need for this bottle for maternity use (miscarriage), but I still recommend this product for general use.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling soft and hydrated but not greasy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s completely gotten rid of the eczema that I&#x27;ve had on the back of my arms since I was 12</li>
            <li>Luckily the bubble packs held the bottle and book firmly in place in different areas of the box, and the book was not ruined.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly, not leaving me feeling too &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 weeks pregnant and use this everyday!</li>
            <li>and I found them so hard to get clean.</li>
            <li>It works very well and cost a lot cheaper than other anti-stretch mark cream.</li>
            <li>The scent was subtle, and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>other than that, i wouldn&#x27;t use it any other time because it wouldn&#x27;t absorb as quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks after my first pregnancy, and I used it everyday.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Plus I really liked the smell.</li>
            <li> I use it on myself (even on my face) and it absorbs really nicely.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> To me, an option like almond, vanilla or something else would be nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> The texture of the oil is nice.</li>
            <li> But for the overwhelming smell I would have loved this product.</li>
            <li> It did have a nice smell and was not oily.</li>
            <li> and I know is popular.</li>
            <li> and I liked it</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very expensive and smells wonderful.</li>

            <li> This oil smells good and is easy to apply all over my belly and thighs.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I prefer this Mama Bee Baby Oil much better.  </li>
            <li> Great product, great smell, love that it is natural.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, nice and fresh lemon scent.</li>
            <li> Not too strong for me but a nice lemony scent.</li>
            <li> The oil goes on easily and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I used this while pregnant, while I loved the smell</li>

            <li> The smell of this is way better than the belly butter</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and am looking forward to growing with this.</li>
            <li> Like a lemon drop :) And keeps your skin shiny and moisture.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT and recommend it.</li>
            <li> A delight to be able to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> ( Lemons :) )&lt;</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say that the resulting skin quality is very pleasing.</li>
            <li> great smell but dries fast.</li>
            <li> so i believe is mostly genetic</li>
            <li> Make sure you wear clothing</li>
            <li> Also, I love all things lemon</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> After using a similar product and not liking it I am very happy with this!!</li>
            <li> Love the lemon oil scents also.</li>
            <li> It smells really good like fresh lemon</li>
            <li> This oil smells wonderful and was the only product during pregnancy that stopped the itching of my stretching skin.</li>
            <li> and this was my favorite.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed both the belly butter and the oil.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this and apply every morning after a shower.</li>
            <li> Love the smell &amp; even if it didn&#x27;t remove my marks it made marks lighter in color.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> The smell was so potent</li>
            <li> It smells FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> the oil is okay, just did not like the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees products before and love them.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and absorbs well, so you&#x27;re not left with an oily residue.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and was the only product that soothed my friend&#x27;s itchy skin during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this body oil.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 39 weeks :)</li>
            <li> so we were able to keep a stable supply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for my second pregnancy, and I&#x27;m still very happy with the feel and smell of it.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil</li>
            <li> so so far so good!</li>
            <li> and this has a nice, light, and sweet lemon scent!</li>
            <li> but usually I am in good shape if I apply it first and then brush my teeth, put lotion on my face, etc.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, almost 5 months pregnant and showing....</li>
            <li> I started using this since I was 5mon pregnant, and I hv been loving this product.</li>
            <li> The lemon aroma is very strong when you&#x27;re putting it on, which I found very energizing and pleasant while pregnant.</li>
            <li> This oil is not greasy, smells amazing and fresh and controls itching if used twice a day or each time I shower.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this through the add-on program at Amazon, and wished I would have purchased more than one bottle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fresh scent, and it leaves me feeling moisturized!</li>
            <li> and I have done hours of research on products that are not only good for you but that work!</li>
            <li> I am a picky person and don&#x27;t like sticky or oily products but this product goes on smoothly and has been doing a great job of keeping my skin soft and hopefully helping to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Easy ordering and shipping.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this oil as much as others did, but it just hasn&#x27;t done anything spectacular for me.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Thanks already received the product I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li> It however dose not spred very well but is great to put in a hot bath and soak in leaving me feeling greasy at first but then nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Much better than baby oils (even the gel kinds) because the oil absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you al greasy.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly!  </li>
            <li> And dries quickly!</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and this product has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and did not leave my skin oily.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product to help reduce stretch marks during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, I have yet to see any \\&quot;oil\\&quot; transfer to clothing or on my light tan sheets (when applying before bed time.)</li>
            <li> It makes my belly smooth</li>
            <li> Love this natural oil - it feels nice and keeps belly hydrated.</li>
            <li> Great product, absorbs really well &amp; fast.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and smooth and feels so good after a shower or bath.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I am able to get dressed right away with no oily residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this particular oil is amazing.  </li>
            <li> when I was 33wks pregnant, but I still like this oil since it is so easy to apply &amp; helps with the itch.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells first off</li>
            <li> but I can imagine it even being better after a hot bath.</li>
            <li> I use this oil with q-tips for his hands and also for the one fold in his neck that I can never seem to get clean in the bath.</li>
            <li> Not too strong - a fresh lemony scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> Hard to find and a great product!</li>
            <li> and my belly is nice and soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nice soft, not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have since learned that getting stretch marks is more determined by genetics and how much your skin can stand to stretch.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that my wife swears by this product after having two kids and her tummy looking and feeling in such good shape</li>
            <li> (I did not like the sweet smell of cocoa butter).  </li>
            <li> Smells really really good, but I don&#x27;t think it actually did anything for my body.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> Coco butter smelled too sweet for me this pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and how it helps when your belly gets itchy from stretching too much.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for something to easy the itchiness and make my belly feel smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, smell good and light enough, I also use the Burt&#x27;s Bees belly butter on top of it, but somehow they still do not stop the itch on a growing belly (it works for a couple of hours when I first put it on, then the itch would come back)</li>
            <li> So far I love the oil, I put it on my legs when their dry and my face, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I used this every day after I got out of the shower while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> but what else would you wear pregnant anyways?</li>
            <li> I think I am going to just stick with this on my pregnant belly and buy some quality lotion for the rest of my body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A must for all pregnant women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my stomach because I&#x27;m pregnant, but I also use it on my arms, legs, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my pregnant belly</li>
            <li> And I like the mild lemon drop scent.  </li>
            <li> A must have item when you&#x27;re pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Im 17 weeks pregnant, using it with the body butter on my breasts and growing belly.</li>
            <li> The smell is a very light lemon scent, not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive pregnant nose.  </li>
            <li> not sure about the stretch mark claims but really love the citrus smell and loved the feeling of putting it on my belly.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of most other stretch mark preventing lotions, but this has a nice natural, refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> This smells nice, my legs stay smoother for longer, and it&#x27;s nice to soak in a hot tub with just a few drops of this with some Epsom salts.</li>
            <li> I like the lemony scent and it does absorb quickly into my skin right after a shower.</li>
            <li> The scent after application is still pleasant but more subtle.</li>
            <li> I love how it leaves my skin feeling soft and it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.</li>
            <li> I love this product not only because it&#x27;s all natural but because it rubs in nice without making you feel too greasy.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t showed signs of stretch marks, however, I was not expecting this product to be able to prevent them.  </li>
            <li> Love that.&lt;br /&gt;All natural.</li>
            <li> I use this fresh out of the shower then apply my lotion</li>
            <li> You only have to use the smallest amount for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li> This lovely Lemon smell oil is not messy at all.  </li>
            <li> I use this right when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I put this on right before i get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s recommended for right after a shower/bath and that works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a newly pregnant friend on the basis of all the positive comments.</li>
            <li> So far so good and no stretch marks but have a few months to go:-).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know the issues that I would have with dry skin during pregnancy, even in warm and humid weather.</li>
            <li> It does dry and absorb nicely too.</li>
            <li> It is also very, very greasy.</li>
            <li> It is light and smells citrusy, and I don&#x27;t have one stretch mark in 28 weeks of pregnancy thus far.</li>
            <li> I used this for my first pregnancy every day and had no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil in the first trimester of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The lemon smell is just too much though!</li>
            <li> It really helps with the appearance of my mommy marks!</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li> It does have more unnatural ingredients in it, but still beats a belly scratch red all the time..</li>
            <li> I use the belly butter on my belly only and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t feel slick and slimy like most oils</li>
            <li> Smells very lemony and fresh.  </li>
            <li> To me it was even better than my Gold Bond Ultimate Care lotion for my legs.</li>
            <li> great product but the bottle is so small!</li>
            <li> Has a fresh lemon scent that was particularly helpful during my morning sickness weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees in general and this is another quality product.</li>
            <li> It was my first pregnancy and a did have one or two very faded stretch marks on my breast from puberty.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I guess I put too much because it stained my pajama shirt.</li>
            <li> lovely aroma &amp; stays on long</li>
            <li> I use this for my belly w/ the butter as well and super soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my pure vitamin-E or almond oil brands I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the oil does have vitamin e because that&#x27;s one of the main reasons I bought it!</li>
            <li> Messy, but makes the skin feel smooth and itch free.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Very relaxing and helped reduce stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I am a real advocate of these guys.  </li>
            <li> Like the smell but don&#x27;t really find this product to be very hydrating.</li>
            <li> You can oil and lotion and grease yourself up as much as you want but if the stretch marks are coming, they won&#x27;t be stopped.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is much different than using a cheap body lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid of him putting his hands in his mouth since the oil is all natural.</li>
            <li> I used this with the Mama Bee Belly Butter during my whole pregnancy and no stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Really greasy.</li>
            <li> I used it throughout my pregnancy for moisturizing whole body and preventing stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Fast absorption and healing properties.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very hydrated</li>
            <li> and I think it (along with the Mama Bees Belly Butter) has really helped with the itchiness from my expanding belly.  </li>
            <li> Skin very moist and whiney after.</li>
            <li> It absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It worked well and after the baby there really isn&#x27;t much evidence of stretching and the like.  </li>
            <li> The smell is my other favorite part of this product as well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as oily as other products which I love.</li>
            <li> Love the light citrus smell, but once open the cap leaks a little if the bottle falls over</li>
            <li> I have used this product throughout my second and third trimesters and I love it.  </li>
            <li> My wife would use this constantly while she was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel, but it&#x27;s a mess.</li>
            <li> I was highly dissatisfied with this shipment of Burt&#x27;s Bees body oil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> No marks so far!!</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and how it is a little thicker</li>
            <li> I tried some other vitamin E oils and like this by far the best as it wasn&#x27;t too thick and greasy feeling and it dried pretty quickly</li>
            <li> It is 100% natural, smells like lemons, and gentle.</li>
            <li> I normally use in the evenings when I&#x27;m not worried about the oily feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of thick going on</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark my entire pregnancy!!!:)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone with dry skin or eczema pregnant or not.</li>
            <li> So far im 28 weeks and have been using this since i was 8 weeks!</li>
            <li> Just know that if you have skin that is genetically not built to stretch and bounce back, there are most likely stretch marks in your future.</li>
            <li> My son would never open his hands for the first couple of months</li>
            <li> Soft skin and elasticity return!</li>
            <li> So i am may try to find other oroduct of same quality with better price</li>
            <li> The only thing has consistently worked for me is the Aveeno skin relief lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this at least helped!</li>
            <li> The only positive I can say here is the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a hard product to find at many retailers, and it is rather expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin was extremely soft.</li>
            <li> so I put it on at bedtime and always wear old tshirts.....</li>
            <li> My breasts were covered in stretch marks early in pregnancy</li>
            <li> Use regularly and appears to be very nourishing for skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 5 month of pregnancy and have begun to worry about getting stretch marks.</li>
            <li> None so far</li>
            <li> I like it because it makes my growing belly soft</li>
            <li> This body oil makes my skin feel buttery soft.</li>
            <li> All natural.  </li>
            <li> Helps with the itchy belly and keeps your belly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I would say that if you are sensitive to smell during pregnancy, do not use this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin really soft.  </li>
            <li> All natural moisture for anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> The pregnant wife loves this stuff and lathers down with it every night before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> I use this mainly for back massages</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> with little to no clothing on, you&#x27;ll be fine to get dressed later on.</li>
            <li> , they are purple though so a lot of people say they will go back to normal.</li>
            <li> I only was able to salvage half the bottle, but sending it back and reordering would have taken a while and perhaps yielded the same result.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind and it absorbs pretty quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> I no longer have a need for this bottle for maternity use (miscarriage), but I still recommend this product for general use.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling soft and hydrated but not greasy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s completely gotten rid of the eczema that I&#x27;ve had on the back of my arms since I was 12</li>
            <li> Luckily the bubble packs held the bottle and book firmly in place in different areas of the box, and the book was not ruined.</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly, not leaving me feeling too &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 weeks pregnant and use this everyday!</li>
            <li> and I found them so hard to get clean.</li>
            <li> It works very well and cost a lot cheaper than other anti-stretch mark cream.</li>
            <li> The scent was subtle, and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> other than that, i wouldn&#x27;t use it any other time because it wouldn&#x27;t absorb as quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks after my first pregnancy, and I used it everyday.  </li>
            <li> but you only really need a small amount at a time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating but can be a little heavy for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re worried about stretch marks like I was (I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 6\\&quot; and 140 lbs with a flat tummy (pre-baby))</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last too long!</li>
            <li> Hubby is a fan of the scent, as it is very subtle, but a clean smell.</li>
            <li> but I think it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I could apply and then get dressed without having to wipe off excess or wait a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Especially if you don&#x27;t like the cocoa butter smell of all those other products.</li>
            <li> I keep this in the shower and after I shower, I lightly dry off and use this while I am still damp.</li>
            <li> I can never find this locally when I need it, so I keep it active in my &amp;#34;buy it later&amp;#34; list, and throw it into another order when I start running out.</li>
            <li> Oh, and no new stretch marks.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get a single one on my belly until my ninth month.</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb lotion well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because since being pregnant my skin has been acting crazy</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get one single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> Good product but very expensive and very small sized bottle.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is really hard to find anywhere but Amazon.com, and they should sell it in larger sized bottles!</li>
            <li> The bottle is small so it won&#x27;t last long if you apply it generously as instructed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not much</li>
            <li> Everything is just as expected.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> It absorbs within a few second after I put it on my belly.  </li>
            <li> I used this and a few other products for preventing stretch marks during my pregnancy on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The smell fresh and clean, no cocoa nasty smell.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other lotions to cut the scent...</li>
            <li> I like this compared to other options for keeping my stretching skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your body greasy, but my hands do get a little greasy, so I have started putting in my contacts before I shower, because I am a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t wash off my hands well enough.</li>
            <li> Other vendors ship it with packing tape wrapped around where the lid meets the bottle, preventing the lid from unscrewing or any product from leaking during shipping.</li>
            <li> I will also be getting this for other expecting mothers as well.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it actually works or not because I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tired other products, which are more expensive.</li>
            <li> Easily washes off hands unlike some oils, and it doesn&#x27;t have too bad of a smell.</li>
            <li> but it does take a few minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the bottle opened during delivery and soaked all of the products it was delivered with.</li>
            <li> Only a few small stretch marks on my hips</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t going down without a fight -</li>
            <li> The only &#x27;downfall&#x27; is that it is a very small bottle.</li>
            <li> I prefer the mama bee butter, it is less greasy.</li>
            <li> I already had stretch marks from my previous pregnancy</li>
            <li> However, it seems like it&#x27;s not completely absorbed and skin feels little greasy under the clothes.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and a lotion during the day since I don&#x27;t like the mess of the oil during the day when it gets all over your clothes.</li>
            <li> The four stars are because when I received this Amazon order, the lid was not screwed on tightly and the bottle had leaked in transit.</li>
            <li> it was a little greasy for my liking.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed that Amazon did not do this, particularly because the same order included a book for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I started out with a few belly butters but did not like the smells including the Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter</li>
            <li> when I received my order-half the bottle of oil was missing.</li>
            <li> you wouldn&#x27;t mind getting messy because it will get your clothes oily.</li>
            <li> and I gained 40 pounds and used this everyday.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few minutes to soak in but feels so hydrating.</li>
            <li> So, I was disappointed because I bought this and the belly butter for myself as I am pregnant.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a little small and it does have a lemon scent but did not bother me.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from extreme morning sickness and this was not a good scent for me.</li>
            <li> I tried at least 6 other commonly recommended oils/lotions</li>
            <li> Either way, the packaging is a little confusing.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail today, the bottle is small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works for stretch marks</li>
            <li> small bottle</li>
            <li> Said she had been looking for just this and was unable to find it locally.</li>
            <li> (at least mine does, not sure if it&#x27;s every bottle).</li>
            <li> I rub this on after my raw Shea butter!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moist for at least 2 days.</li>
            <li> : To reply to the comment, not all oil leaves stains after the wash and not all oil feels so thick.</li>
            <li> but it gave my sensitive skin a rash. :(</li>
            <li> This had a very thick feel to it and didn&#x27;t soak in.</li>
            <li> Recieved product broken.</li>
            <li> Tired of all the chemicals in lotions?  </li>
            <li> This body oil seemed very thin compaired to others I have used.</li>
            <li> The oil, however, is disappointing.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> but really disappointed-</li>
            <li> Like the lemon scent a lot, some of the alternatives smell awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! Easy ordering and shipping.</li>
            <li> This smells like lemon.  A lot.  I mix it with other lotions to cut the scent... if I didn&#x27;t I&#x27;d smell like a cleaning product!  That being said, I mixed this with Kirkland lotion (from Costco) and applied it to my abdomen during pregnancy.  Yes, stretch marks are supposedly hereditary but I wasn&#x27;t going down without a fight - and I won.  No stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know the issues that I would have with dry skin during pregnancy, even in warm and humid weather. I use this oil every day from shoulder to toe. It is light and smells citrusy, and I don&#x27;t have one stretch mark in 28 weeks of pregnancy thus far.</li>
            <li> LOVE! I used this every day after I got out of the shower while I was pregnant. I did not get any stretch marks! I don&#x27;t know for sure if it was this oil or genetics but either way I would definitely recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> This product smells really nice (like lemons). It went on smooth and did not leave my skin oily. I originally bought this through the add-on program at Amazon, and wished I would have purchased more than one bottle. This is a hard product to find at many retailers, and it is rather expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for sure that if it stops stretch marks, but I can say that I never had any and my skin was extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this oil after reading reviews on Amazon. I am in my 50&#x27;s and this product has made a huge difference. I use it daily when I get out of the shower on my legs, arms, neck and chest. The texture of my skin is noticeably smoother. It absorbs well and does not leave my skin feeling oily. This product is a staple in my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I get out of the shower in an attempt to prevent stretch marks. I absolutely love the fresh scent, and it leaves me feeling moisturized!</li>
            <li> loved this product during my pregnancy - used it with the mama bee belyy butter and loved both products! I tried some other vitamin E oils and like this by far the best as it wasn&#x27;t too thick and greasy feeling and it dried pretty quickly so I could apply and then get dressed without having to wipe off excess or wait a long time to dry. Plus I really liked the smell. Overall very happy with this product and price!</li>
            <li> Came broke and spilled out.</li>
            <li> I started out with a few belly butters but did not like the smells including the Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter and I can honestly say I prefer this Mama Bee Baby Oil much better.  The smell of this is way better than the belly butter and my belly is nice and soft in the morning.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and am looking forward to growing with this.</li>
            <li> The best thing to happen to my itchy belly since not being pregnant.</li>
            <li> Love the way this stuff smells! Much better than baby oils (even the gel kinds) because the oil absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you al greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this right when I get out of the shower. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark my entire pregnancy!!!:)</li>
            <li> Fantastic product to help reduce stretch marks during pregnancy. Nice soft, not overpowering scent. I used this for my first pregnancy every day and had no stretch marks. I am now using it for my second pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Thanks already received the product I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li> great product but the bottle is so small!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  The bottle is a little small and it does have a lemon scent but did not bother me.  Wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this stuff during her pregnancy. Very relaxing and helped reduce stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It certainly does smell great! Like a lemon drop :) And keeps your skin shiny and moisture. However, it seems like it&#x27;s not completely absorbed and skin feels little greasy under the clothes.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin like the Palmer&#x27;s oil did. Has a fresh lemon scent that was particularly helpful during my morning sickness weeks. It&#x27;s kind of thick going on so I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! Hoping it prevent stretchmarks! So far im 28 weeks and have been using this since i was 8 weeks! No marks so far!!</li>
            <li> Recieved product broken.</li>
            <li> Great oil.. My skin tends to make stretch marks , well with this oil and the  Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter combined I got ZERO marks during my pregnancy ! LOVE IT and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a real advocate of these guys.  Used this throughout the pregnancy and now use it in my LO&#x27;s hair.  An excellent hydrating oil for the winter.  I also mix it with their baby oil for her skin as creams come off so waxy on such skin.  A delight to be able to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like this compared to other options for keeping my stretching skin hydrated. It smells nice and it is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I love how it leaves my skin feeling soft and it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue. It does dry and absorb nicely too. The smell is my other favorite part of this product as well.( Lemons :) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to buy this, even after my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Works amazing! I&#x27;ve used with all of my pregnancies and no stretch marks! The only downside is it is greasy so I put it on at bedtime and always wear old tshirts.....but what else would you wear pregnant anyways?</li>
            <li> I love the lemon scent to this! It is taking some getting used to since I haven&#x27;t used a body oil before. I keep this in the shower and after I shower, I lightly dry off and use this while I am still damp. It doesn&#x27;t leave your body greasy, but my hands do get a little greasy, so I have started putting in my contacts before I shower, because I am a little worried it wouldn&#x27;t wash off my hands well enough.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly for back massages and I&#x27;m happy to say that the resulting skin quality is very pleasing. I no longer have a need for this bottle for maternity use (miscarriage), but I still recommend this product for general use.</li>
            <li> I love this product not only because it&#x27;s all natural but because it rubs in nice without making you feel too greasy. It&#x27;s still oil so you may want to dab yourself with a towel. Smells nice, almost 5 months pregnant and showing....still no stretch marks so I hope it stays that way!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I started using this since I was 5mon pregnant, and I hv been loving this product. I got quite a bit stretch marks almost all of sudden when I was 33wks pregnant, but I still like this oil since it is so easy to apply &amp; helps with the itch.</li>
            <li> I use this for my belly w/ the butter as well and super soft the oil has like a lemon scent that I like a lot</li>
            <li> So far I love the oil, I put it on my legs when their dry and my face, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Like the smell but don&#x27;t really find this product to be very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil in the first trimester of my pregnancy. It was my first pregnancy and a did have one or two very faded stretch marks on my breast from puberty. I used this and a few other products for preventing stretch marks during my pregnancy on a daily basis. I have since learned that getting stretch marks is more determined by genetics and how much your skin can stand to stretch. You can oil and lotion and grease yourself up as much as you want but if the stretch marks are coming, they won&#x27;t be stopped. I did like the smell of this oil. Not too strong for me but a nice lemony scent. The oil goes on easily and absorbs nicely. The entire bottle lasted for maybe six months for me. I applied it to my breasts, belly, hips, and bottom. This oil definitely helped to lessen the itchy skin on the belly during pregnancy. It did not, however, prevent stretch marks. My breasts were covered in stretch marks early in pregnancy but I didn&#x27;t get a single one on my belly until my ninth month. Then one day I woke up and my belly was covered in them. I will not tell anyone to not use anything like this during pregnancy. Just know that if you have skin that is genetically not built to stretch and bounce back, there are most likely stretch marks in your future.</li>
            <li> Love this natural oil - it feels nice and keeps belly hydrated. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Use regularly and appears to be very nourishing for skin. No have on auto order list. Pire is also good</li>
            <li> I can never find this locally when I need it, so I keep it active in my &amp;#34;buy it later&amp;#34; list, and throw it into another order when I start running out.</li>
            <li> This oil smells good and is easy to apply all over my belly and thighs. I wish it adsorbed a bit faster but usually I am in good shape if I apply it first and then brush my teeth, put lotion on my face, etc. I am not very big yet so I cannot comment on the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I put this on right before i get out of the shower. It keeps my skin moist for at least 2 days. I dislike lotions and with this product I have no need to put any extra lotion on. Absolutely Wonderful</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle. I mix this with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Cocoa &amp; Cupaucu Butters body lotion. What a pairing!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this oil as much as others did, but it just hasn&#x27;t done anything spectacular for me. I like the lemony scent and it does absorb quickly into my skin right after a shower. I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is much different than using a cheap body lotion. I think I am going to just stick with this on my pregnant belly and buy some quality lotion for the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body butter however is the best!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 5 month of pregnancy and have begun to worry about getting stretch marks. None so far but I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Nourishing Body Oil with Vitamin-E three times daily, ESPECIALLY when I get out of the shower. Great product, absorbs really well &amp; fast. Has a refreshing hint of lemon that smells great, my husband even loves it!</li>
            <li> when I received my order-half the bottle of oil was missing. I was highly dissatisfied with this shipment of Burt&#x27;s Bees body oil.</li>
            <li> great smell but dries fast. i have used alot of products throughout the pregnancy only stretch marks on my boobs so i believe is mostly genetic</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it although it can be overpowering. It however dose not spred very well but is great to put in a hot bath and soak in leaving me feeling greasy at first but then nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Messy, but makes the skin feel smooth and itch free. Easily washes off hands unlike some oils, and it doesn&#x27;t have too bad of a smell. Make sure you wear clothing you wouldn&#x27;t mind getting messy because it will get your clothes oily. I try to only use it at night when I&#x27;m wearing bed shirts I don&#x27;t care about.</li>
            <li> My son would never open his hands for the first couple of months and I found them so hard to get clean. I use this oil with q-tips for his hands and also for the one fold in his neck that I can never seem to get clean in the bath. I&#x27;m not afraid of him putting his hands in his mouth since the oil is all natural. I also used it on his scalp when he had cradle cap. Also, I love all things lemon and this has a nice, light, and sweet lemon scent! I use it on myself (even on my face) and it absorbs really nicely. The bottles are small but I think it goes a long way. I would suggest buying two at a time though, since it can never be found in stores it seems. Great gift for a baby shower to, since when does mama get anything? ;)</li>
            <li> I used this with the Mama Bee Belly Butter during my whole pregnancy and no stretch marks.  Did not stain my clothing and smells great.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a bigger bottle, for the price it&#x27;s not much but it smells yummy. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> not sure about the stretch mark claims but really love the citrus smell and loved the feeling of putting it on my belly.</li>
            <li> Love the light citrus smell, but once open the cap leaks a little if the bottle falls over (at least mine does, not sure if it&#x27;s every bottle). I use it in conjunction with the mama bee belly butter (which doesn&#x27;t smell so great) for pregnancy stretch marks, works wonders!</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling soft and hydrated but not greasy. The lemon aroma is very strong when you&#x27;re putting it on, which I found very energizing and pleasant while pregnant. The scent after application is still pleasant but more subtle.</li>
            <li> The pregnant wife loves this stuff and lathers down with it every night before going to bed.  Its not too greasy and doesn&#x27;t stain the sheets.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an oil, so you do have to plan on when you are going to apply it on. it&#x27;s recommended for right after a shower/bath and that works. other than that, i wouldn&#x27;t use it any other time because it wouldn&#x27;t absorb as quickly. no so greasy after and it hasn&#x27;t gotten on my clothes, so i can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The smell of this particular oil is amazing.  I use it for the face and body.  Great product.  Absolutely amazing and will buy again!</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel sticky, &amp; keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love it.... I used this and the body butter and it actually faded my stretch marks!!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly!  I use all over my midsection this after an evening shower.  It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and great price.</li>
            <li> The only positive I can say here is the packaging. I  like that it is plastic which to me, makes sense for oil. I think I&#x27;ve seen a larger size in a glass bottle which I find unsafe, as it could drop and shatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product smells like lemons and I abhor anything citrus for body care. So many people said the smell was wonderful. To me, an option like almond, vanilla or something else would be nice. I opened it, took a whiff and thought, &amp;#34;Nope!&amp;#34;. So, I was disappointed because I bought this and the belly butter for myself as I am pregnant.  I passed it to a gf who likes citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another option would be to offer this in a pump style bottle, so the oil doesn&#x27;t go everywhere. Just something to consider. But overall, the reason I do not like this is because of the scent.</li>
            <li> Tired of all the chemicals in lotions?  You can pronounce EVERYTHING in this product and know where it comes from.  It smells wonderful with its hint of lemon and my skin drinks this up.  Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that my wife swears by this product after having two kids and her tummy looking and feeling in such good shape I say it works. She did use it in conjunction with the Burts bees Butter</li>
            <li> Soft skin and elasticity return! Great oil</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel, but it&#x27;s a mess. Really greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff. After using a similar product and not liking it I am very happy with this!!</li>
            <li> Like the lemon scent a lot, some of the alternatives smell awful! I use this at night and a lotion during the day since I don&#x27;t like the mess of the oil during the day when it gets all over your clothes.</li>
            <li> Good product but very expensive and very small sized bottle. So i am may try to find other oroduct of same quality with better price</li>
            <li> Used this product throughout my entire pregnancy. Helped with dryness without soiling my clothes. Does not prevent stretch marks, but it was comforting.</li>
            <li> I used it throughout my pregnancy for moisturizing whole body and preventing stretch marks. It works very well and cost a lot cheaper than other anti-stretch mark cream. Love the lemon oil scents also.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. The bottle is small so it won&#x27;t last long if you apply it generously as instructed. The texture of the oil is nice. It moisturizes well without leaving a greasy residue. The front of the bottle says that it has vitamin e, but vitamin e is not listed as one of the ingredients on the back. Hopefully the oil does have vitamin e because that&#x27;s one of the main reasons I bought it! Either way, the packaging is a little confusing.</li>
            <li> But for the overwhelming smell I would have loved this product. The lemon smell is just too much though! I had to give it away to a friend because I could not stand it!</li>
            <li> This body oil seemed very thin compaired to others I have used. It did have a nice smell and was not oily. I would NOT recommend getting the Mama Bee body butter, however, it is FOUL!</li>
            <li> I used Weleda stretch mark oil which my friend recommended and I know is popular. That smelled like aroma therapy stuff and I liked it but it gave my sensitive skin a rash. :( After the rash cleared up I tried this and it did not give me a rash so I will keep using it. It is 100% natural, smells like lemons, and gentle. I prefer the Burt&#x27;s Bees Belly Butter though. Maybe I am just not an oil person. The first time I used it I guess I put too much because it stained my pajama shirt.</li>
            <li> I loved this oil, it smells great and goes on without staining clothes or leaving a greasy feel. It didnt help with stretch marks AT ALL like i thought it would, but stretch marks can be genetic so maybe I was predisposed.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail today, the bottle is small. I got this because I heard it works well for itchy tummys. It smells really good like fresh lemon and it&#x27;s not as oily as other products which I love. I&#x27;m not sure if it works for stretch marks but I am also using this product with mama bee belly butter.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, I have been using it for years for me and my children. The four stars are because when I received this Amazon order, the lid was not screwed on tightly and the bottle had leaked in transit. Other vendors ship it with packing tape wrapped around where the lid meets the bottle, preventing the lid from unscrewing or any product from leaking during shipping. I was a bit disappointed that Amazon did not do this, particularly because the same order included a book for my daughter. Luckily the bubble packs held the bottle and book firmly in place in different areas of the box, and the book was not ruined. However, one entire corner of the box was soaked with oil.</li>
            <li> This oil smells wonderful and was the only product during pregnancy that stopped the itching of my stretching skin. I tried at least 6 other commonly recommended oils/lotions and this was my favorite. I used it twice a day and still got stretch marks, but I don&#x27;t think an oil alone can prevent that. It was the best product on the market for me, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not gonna lie, I use this on my legs after shaving. I like it on my décolletage, too. My skin gets very dry, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb lotion well. This smells nice, my legs stay smoother for longer, and it&#x27;s nice to soak in a hot tub with just a few drops of this with some Epsom salts.</li>
            <li> I rub this on after my raw Shea butter! It really helps with the appearance of my mommy marks! I also exfoliate the best I can! The belly butter isn&#x27;t a fav of my.. It doesn&#x27;t last too long!</li>
            <li> I use this each moring after I get out of the shower.  I like it because it makes my growing belly soft but it does take a few minutes to dry.  I use this in combination with the mama bee butter.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my dry skin! And I use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I prefer the mama bee butter, it is less greasy.</li>
            <li> This body oil makes my skin feel buttery soft. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind and it absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. Love it! Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed both the belly butter and the oil. The scent was subtle, and it went on smoothly. My only complaint would be that the bottle opened during delivery and soaked all of the products it was delivered with. I only was able to salvage half the bottle, but sending it back and reordering would have taken a while and perhaps yielded the same result. Better packaging would be my recommendation! I won&#x27;t order again though I might pick it up in a store to avoid the issue.</li>
            <li> Awesome oil for use as a carrier oil.  I combined two of these with a bottle of AVO lavender oil and it&#x27;s amazing.  Fast absorption and healing properties.  When combined with AVO lavender oil, it made a great soothing oil for insect bites.</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy and I have done hours of research on products that are not only good for you but that work! I LOVE this and apply every morning after a shower. Hubby is a fan of the scent, as it is very subtle, but a clean smell. My skin feels very hydrated and I have yet to see any stretch marks (thankful for good genes!) and will continue to use this up until after baby comes. I will also be getting this for other expecting mothers as well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell &amp; even if it didn&#x27;t remove my marks it made marks lighter in color.</li>
            <li> I bought this because since being pregnant my skin has been acting crazy and I thought this would help with the dryness.  Not only has it helped with the dryness but it&#x27;s completely gotten rid of the eczema that I&#x27;ve had on the back of my arms since I was 12 (I&#x27;m 29 now.)  I literally can&#x27;t believe it.  I haven&#x27;t been using anything else that&#x27;s different so I can only assume it&#x27;s this.  The smell is a very light lemon scent, not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive pregnant nose.  I would recommend this for anyone with dry skin or eczema pregnant or not.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells first off (I did not like the sweet smell of cocoa butter).  This is lemony and refreshing!  It makes my skin so soft and smooth and feels so good after a shower or bath.</li>
            <li> Great product, great smell, love that it is natural.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a great product! Smells good and not too greasy either. I combine with the Burts lotion balm..</li>
            <li> This is the best. I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;m 33 weeks pregnant and use this everyday! The lemon scent is wonderful and really refreshing. Absorbs well, I have yet to see any \\&quot;oil\\&quot; transfer to clothing or on my light tan sheets (when applying before bed time.) Highly recommended. I utilize the subscribe and save option and receive this often! I also recommend the mama bee belly butter.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Smells wonderful.  All natural.  Feels great on skin.  A must for all pregnant women.</li>
            <li> The smell was so potent I just couldn&#x27;t take it. It smells like lemon furniture cleaner. I suffer from extreme morning sickness and this was not a good scent for me. It is also very, very greasy. I have no idea if it actually works or not because I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, once you put it on you have to avoid getting it on any clothing you like. I got it on my shirt and it left a discoloration even after it was laundered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: To reply to the comment, not all oil leaves stains after the wash and not all oil feels so thick. This had a very thick feel to it and didn&#x27;t soak in. It just wasn&#x27;t for me and this was my personal experience with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product to hydrate and moist your skin while pregnant. The smell fresh and clean, no cocoa nasty smell. It has a hint of citrus which didnt give me any nauseas. LOVED IT!! AS for today, Im 30 weeks and NO stretch marks in my belly. Now, in my boobs, yes I do have some stretch marks :-(, they are purple though so a lot of people say they will go back to normal.</li>
            <li> Everything is just as expected.  Fast Shipping!  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this body oil!  I&#x27;m using it on my stomach because I&#x27;m pregnant, but I also use it on my arms, legs, etc.  It dries pretty quickly, not leaving me feeling too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of most other stretch mark preventing lotions, but this has a nice natural, refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> small bottle but you only really need a small amount at a time.  Helps with the itchy belly and keeps your belly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells and feels good. I&#x27;ll continue to use it even after I give birth.</li>
            <li> I have used this product throughout my second and third trimesters and I love it.  It smells FANTASTIC!  It makes my belly smooth and I think it (along with the Mama Bees Belly Butter) has really helped with the itchiness from my expanding belly.  So far I haven&#x27;t showed signs of stretch marks, however, I was not expecting this product to be able to prevent them.  I was really hoping for something to easy the itchiness and make my belly feel smooth and moisturized.  For what I wanted, it definitely does the trick!</li>
            <li> the oil is okay, just did not like the smell. I would say that if you are sensitive to smell during pregnancy, do not use this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good and no stretch marks but have a few months to go:-). I use this in combination with Burt&#x27;s Bees mamma Bee belly butter.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the Vitamin E content during my pregnancy.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the wonderful lemon smell or the great feeling of the oils.  I am a picky person and don&#x27;t like sticky or oily products but this product goes on smoothly and has been doing a great job of keeping my skin soft and hopefully helping to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Love be the smell! Kind of like lemon! Consistency is perfect-absorbs without being too greasy! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this oil! The only &#x27;downfall&#x27; is that it is a very small bottle.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. It&#x27;s greasy, but if you put it on as soon as you get out of the shower and then do your hair, makeup, etc. with little to no clothing on, you&#x27;ll be fine to get dressed later on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my pregnant belly and it&#x27;s awesome! I love how it smells and how it is a little thicker so it stays on my belly! Hard to find and a great product!</li>
            <li> This oil smells good and takes away the itch from stretching skin during pregnancy. It&#x27;s very hydrating but can be a little heavy for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This has a very pleasant lemon scent and feels great on my 7+ month pregnant belly. I normally use in the evenings when I&#x27;m not worried about the oily feel. I use the Burts Mama Bee Butter in the morning for nongreasy feel. Only a few small stretch marks on my hips so so far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees products before and love them. I decided to give their body oil a try. I knew it had some citrus smell to it but it&#x27;s stronger than I expected. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I&#x27;ll stick to my pure vitamin-E or almond oil brands I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, smell good and light enough, I also use the Burt&#x27;s Bees belly butter on top of it, but somehow they still do not stop the itch on a growing belly (it works for a couple of hours when I first put it on, then the itch would come back) The only thing has consistently worked for me is the Aveeno skin relief lotion. It does have more unnatural ingredients in it, but still beats a belly scratch red all the time..</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product. I bought this and the Mama Bee Belly Butter. I use the belly butter on my belly only and I love it. The oil, however, is disappointing. I put it on as soon as I get out of the shower and I find that it just sits on my skin and does not soak in at all. Will continue to use since I have it but really disappointed- will probably just use the belly butter all over!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t feel slick and slimy like most oils</li>
            <li> This lemon scented body oil is a life saver. I used it twice a day, every day, during my pregnancy and I didn&#x27;t get one single stretch mark! I also drank a ton of water, and I know they say there&#x27;s nothing that prevents stretch marks, but I don&#x27;t know- I&#x27;m pretty sure this at least helped! My belly wasn&#x27;t itchy at all and did I mention the smell- it&#x27;s just like opening a bag of lemon sugar cookies, yummy! If you&#x27;re worried about stretch marks like I was (I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 6\\&quot; and 140 lbs with a flat tummy (pre-baby)) then I recommend giving this a try- it&#x27;s not very expensive and smells wonderful. Especially if you don&#x27;t like the cocoa butter smell of all those other products.</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and smells good!</li>
            <li> smells so good and feels really nice going on</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantasic. It smells wonderful and absorbs well, so you&#x27;re not left with an oily residue. I used it all through my pregnancy and now still use it when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Put some in bath water, then use bath water in bathing. Nice scent. Skin very moist and whiney after. Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells really really good, but I don&#x27;t think it actually did anything for my body.&lt;br /&gt;Was hydrating. though.</li>
            <li> I already had stretch marks from my previous pregnancy so my need for this was strictly to stop itching.  No cream was working.  Coco butter smelled too sweet for me this pregnancy.  This oil is not greasy, smells amazing and fresh and controls itching if used twice a day or each time I shower.  I use it on my belly and breasts.  I am able to get dressed right away with no oily residue on my clothes.  I highly recommend this product.  Smells very lemony and fresh.  Oh, and no new stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This product is beyond amazing. It smells wonderful and was the only product that soothed my friend&#x27;s itchy skin during pregnancy. Her husband even borrows it to use as beard oil! The only problem is that it is really hard to find anywhere but Amazon.com, and they should sell it in larger sized bottles!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a newly pregnant friend on the basis of all the positive comments. She was delighted. Said she had been looking for just this and was unable to find it locally.</li>
            <li> Smells like lemon and almond. Love that.&lt;br /&gt;All natural. Love that.&lt;br /&gt;HUGE! This might last me for all of my future pregnancies.</li>
            <li> Works well to help keep moisture locked in. I use this fresh out of the shower then apply my lotion</li>
            <li> Smells AWESOME! And dries quickly!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It leaves my skin really soft.  And I like the mild lemon drop scent.  It absorbs really well.  So don&#x27;t fear feeling you&#x27;ll be all greasy.  I&#x27;ve not used it after a bath or shower but I can imagine it even being better after a hot bath.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks from this stuff and I gained 40 pounds and used this everyday.  I wish they did not discontinue the mama bee balm but this just had to work and it did.</li>
            <li> I used this while pregnant, while I loved the smell it was a little greasy for my liking.  You only have to use the smallest amount for it to be effective.  Good thing it never stained any of my clothes.</li>
            <li> Great product! Just wish they would of put the lid on all the way so it wouldnt of leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> lovely aroma &amp; stays on long</li>
            <li> All natural moisture for anywhere on your body. I even sleep with it on my face. It has helped with redness around my nose.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, especially for the cost. I have tired other products, which are more expensive.</li>
            <li> Good oil. some smell to it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and not greasy</li>
            <li> This lovely Lemon smell oil is not messy at all.  It absorbs within a few second after I put it on my belly.  A must have item when you&#x27;re pregnant.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I credit this product for me not getting stretch marks through 2 pregnancies! I love the smell and how it helps when your belly gets itchy from stretching too much. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this body oil. Im 17 weeks pregnant, using it with the body butter on my breasts and growing belly. It smells so good, nice and fresh lemon scent. It does take a few minutes to soak in but feels so hydrating. I even used it after showering on my legs, locked in the moisture. To me it was even better than my Gold Bond Ultimate Care lotion for my legs. Great product!</li>
            <li> no stretch marks here and I&#x27;m 39 weeks :)</li>
            <li> It smells like lemon.Just started using.Not yet know the effect.</li>
            <li> My wife would use this constantly while she was pregnant.  It got to the point to where she would be upset if she didn&#x27;t have it or if she couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  It worked well and after the baby there really isn&#x27;t much evidence of stretching and the like.  Thankfully amazon carries this so we were able to keep a stable supply.  I am a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees in general and this is another quality product.</li>
            <li> My preggo wife LOVES it and uses it every day! Need I say more?!</li>
            <li> Best thing to use on my pregnant belly!  I didn&#x27;t have any stretch marks after my first pregnancy, and I used it everyday.  I&#x27;ve been using it for my second pregnancy, and I&#x27;m still very happy with the feel and smell of it.  Not too strong - a fresh lemony scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil and it is moisturizing for winter time.</li>
