            <li> This fit my Clarisonic just fine. It is a two-pack so you get both for a great price and they last a long time. Shipping was prompt as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was offered this item at a discounted rate/free in exchange for a review. However, that does not sway my opinion of the product. All feedback is 100% my own words and opinion.*</li>
            <li> AWESOME! WORK SO WELL!</li>

            <li> I needed replacement brush heads and these certainly fit the bill.  Fit perfectly and work just like the original ones.</li>
            <li> With my choice of acne solution I use this brush to get all the dirt and grime off of my face. These brushes are super useful and have really made a large impact on my face!</li>
            <li> These work great! Just as good as the name brand ones or better. Will purchase again.</li>

            <li> In love with these brushes...can&#x27;t believe how affordable they are..I&#x27;m not complaining. .love all the brushes plus they come in two which is a plus..I can save one for later or added it to my travel bag and leave one at home..</li>
            <li> Great replacements! As good as the name brand replacement heads!</li>
            <li> Awesome little gadget</li>
            <li> This was given to me at a discounted rate, but regardless, this did fit my Clarisonic just fine. This is a great priced item and they last a long time. Shipping was prompt as well and the item was packaged to avoid damage.</li>
            <li> Great!  Just as I expected and a lot less money!</li>
            <li> Nice. Very high quality.</li>
            <li> No need to buy the original heads. These replacement heads work perfect and feel the same on my Clairsonic. Each head last around 2.5-3months depending on use. Great product. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> No complaints.  They work just as well as the name brand.  No issues with either cleaning nor operation of the tool.</li>
            <li> Love these replacement heads. Brush them off when you first put them on to get the stray brissels out. They are super soft and great for sensitive skin, and fit my Clarasonic Mia beautifuly.</li>
            <li> I researched these a few months ago, but was skeptical. When my dermatologist recommended it for my sun damaged skin, I ordered it. I&#x27;ve been using it two times/day for a month and I have to say, the hyper-pigmentation is definitely fading. My pores are smaller and I think the dark circles under my eyes look better. I think another two months will see even more improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with these brush heads for my Clarsonic. It works just as well as the brand name and face feels good and smooth afterwards. Good to exfoliate. There is a little rattle that my original one doesn&#x27;t, but for the price difference this is a good buy as it does not affect the funcation at all.</li>
            <li> Good brushes,that are durable</li>
            <li> I love to switch out the brush heads on my Clairsonic from sensitive to deep pore brush depending on season and the price point on these brushes make it possible.</li>
            <li> although item says generic (i think generic equivalent to the clairsonic system) the packaging and items are actually clairsonic...so double bonus!  Can&#x27;t wait to find and buy the system cheap so I can use these replacement brushes!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great alternative to replacement heads for my Clarisonic. The fit perfectly and I did not notice a difference.  Will defiantly purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered item from Pack-and-Supply; it was delivered promptly, and I am pleased with the quality.</li>
