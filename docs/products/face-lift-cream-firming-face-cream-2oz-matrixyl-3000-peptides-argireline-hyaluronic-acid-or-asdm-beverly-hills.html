            <li>I love it !!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product - reduces wrinkles and plumps the skin! LOVE!</li>
            <li>but it is great.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is as good quality as I might find in the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin very smooth and taunt - does a great job in lifting skin.  </li>
            <li>Smell really nice and leaves my face silky smooth</li>
            <li>This was a re-order by my wife and she is well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and it actually seems to work.  </li>
            <li>Super, kind of smelly when first applied</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs quickly and does a bit of firming.  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery, product has softened my face.</li>
            <li>I reducing fine lines and overall firmness.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference in my skin, however I think that it is sill a  pretty decent moisturizer</li>
            <li>Work very well</li>
            <li>and I am beginning to see more smoothness in my neck area and less indentations of wrinkles around my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Perhaps their tests are tried on young people with young completions.&lt;br /&gt;S</li>
            <li>No big difference so far, maybe by the time I get to the bottom of the jar.....</li>
            <li>I made a poor choice for sure.</li>
            <li>I believe it is false advertising for sure and way over priced.  </li>
            <li>change.&lt;br /&gt;However, since I have used only about half a jar I would like to use at least a month to two to give it more of a chance.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Super, kind of smelly when first applied but it is great.  My skin loves it</li>
            <li> This was a re-order by my wife and she is well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference in my skin, however I think that it is sill a  pretty decent moisturizer</li>
            <li> Smells great, and it actually seems to work.  I would order this product again, and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this cream.  Have been using it a little over a week now and I am beginning to see more smoothness in my neck area and less indentations of wrinkles around my cheeks.</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs quickly and does a bit of firming.  However it cannot replace a surgical procedure.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product buy somewhat underwhelming for the money.</li>
            <li> Same as above.  Very disappointed in the product as I see no visible change.&lt;br /&gt;However, since I have used only about half a jar I would like to use at least a month to two to give it more of a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on the products side.  I have been trying different products from Amazon to see how they compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t seen anything that I&#x27;m impressed with.  Perhaps their tests are tried on young people with young completions.&lt;br /&gt;S Fo</li>
            <li> Excellent product - reduces wrinkles and plumps the skin! LOVE!</li>
            <li> I found no difference whatsoever!  Maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Have just started using</li>
            <li> Face feels burned and is RED...allergy I am thinking...will not use&lt;br /&gt;..</li>
            <li> have used this for several months no lift or firmer skin yet Now after 4 months of use I am seeing results my chin and neck are firmer</li>
            <li> Work very well I reducing fine lines and overall firmness.</li>
            <li> nothing but a pasty cream.  I did test on both arms, one this cream and the other OPI lotion.  Cream...no change...OPI looked and felt&lt;br /&gt;great.  I don&#x27;t think it is as good quality as I might find in the grocery store.  I don&#x27;t believe their claims are anywhere&lt;br /&gt;close to what they say. I believe it is false advertising for sure and way over priced.  I made a poor choice for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of all the anti-aging ingredients in it &amp; it did not disappoint.  It makes my skin very smooth and taunt - does a great job in lifting skin.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this cream. It&#x27;s  very heavy feeling on my skin. It  doesn&#x27;t  absorb into the skin the way I thought it would. I don&#x27;t see any change in the firmness of my neck either.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know the results.  I do like the feel of it on my face though.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel and look firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Product as described and delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to help soften wrinkles or hydrate my very dry face until I found this product.  I know that the wrinkle are there to stay but this product softens them so they are not so noticeable.  I love it !!!</li>
