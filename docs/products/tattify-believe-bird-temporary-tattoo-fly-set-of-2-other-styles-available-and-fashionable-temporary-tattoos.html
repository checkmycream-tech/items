            <li>I absolutely love these temporary tattoos.</li>
            <li>and I just love the design of this one.</li>
            <li>Cute and just as pictured.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay on too easily, but what did I expect from a temporary tattoo.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and take off, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend these for anyone else who wants a cute temporary tattoo!</li>
            <li>So cute and fun.</li>
            <li>Get a real tattoo and how about not a terrible one.</li>
            <li>(As in she loves them, not bad quality).</li>
            <li>Very pretty design but did not adhere.  </li>
            <li>Super cute on, easy to put on, but only lasted a couple hours.</li>
            <li>Fast service!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super easy to apply and they look pretty real, aside from the shininess.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for the finger</li>
            <li>Great product in a little package!</li>
            <li>The clear coat on top of it makes the tattoo look super old after just being there for a day.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves the tattoo&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Sometimes less is more and this little tattoo is a great example of that mantra.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If I wanted it to be permanent I would get a real one.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s quite tiny, but the statement is uplifting and the graphic is simplistically lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this little tattoo!</li>
            <li>Also, I put this tattoo on my wrist the first time and on my finger the second time and both times the tattoo stayed intact for 5 days.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it comes off really quick (easy to wash off) by the end of the day a lot of it is rubbed off.</li>

            <li> I am pretty active and run every other day, so even with sweat and playing with my dogs, the tattoo held up.</li>
            <li> These were great...but didn&#x27;t last very long at all...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay on too long.</li>
            <li> did not stay on very long</li>
            <li> her only complaint is that they don&#x27;t stay long enough.</li>
            <li> THAN EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I have ordered other designs from Tattify as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I&#x27;m unable to get a real tattoo for myself</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t look trashy because they&#x27;re just plain black.</li>
            <li> Really small to the point</li>
            <li> they were hard to read.</li>
            <li> , IT WAS HARD TO PUT THIS ON WITHOUT A TON OF THE SHINY EXCESS AROUND THE TATTOO THAT SHOWS HOW FAKE IT IS.  </li>
            <li> This tattoo is cliche, boring, and over produced in actual tattoo form.</li>
            <li> Looks too fake??</li>

            <li> My sister just loved this super cute temporary tattoos I will be ordering soon for me I just loved them. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves the tattoo&#x27;s! her only complaint is that they don&#x27;t stay long enough. (As in she loves them, not bad quality).</li>
            <li> Super cute on, easy to put on, but only lasted a couple hours. If you are artistically inclined, just use a sharpie.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stay on too long.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay on too easily, but what did I expect from a temporary tattoo. Bought these for my sister&#x27;s daughter, she liked them.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because after an hour it sarted to come off.</li>
            <li> These were great...but didn&#x27;t last very long at all...</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t even last 1hr before it was gone....</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS TATTOO,  HOWEVER, IT WAS HARD TO PUT THIS ON WITHOUT A TON OF THE SHINY EXCESS AROUND THE TATTOO THAT SHOWS HOW FAKE IT IS.  IT WAS ALSO MUCH SMALLER THAN EXPECTED BUT ALL IN ALL I LIKED THEM</li>
            <li> So cute and fun. They last about a day or so, but you have to watch if putting on hands it washes off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these temporary tattoos. They go on very easy. They only last for 2-3 days before they start to peel away but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. If I wanted it to be permanent I would get a real one.  I have ordered other designs from Tattify as well. Great company.</li>
            <li> Really small to the point they were hard to read.</li>

            <li> I love tattoos unfortunately I cant decide what to get permanently on my skin so these will fill the spot of tattoos till I decide on what to get. This is so dainty. but unfortunately it comes off really quick (easy to wash off) by the end of the day a lot of it is rubbed off. this is perfect for going to music festival</li>
            <li> The kids loved them!!!! Easy to put on and take off, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. They also don&#x27;t look trashy because they&#x27;re just plain black.</li>
            <li> this product was great</li>

            <li> Very pretty design but did not adhere.  Lasted all of 5 minutes and the bird was totally smudged.</li>
            <li> Cute and just as pictured.</li>
            <li> These temporary tattoos look just like the picture.</li>
            <li> This tattoo is cliche, boring, and over produced in actual tattoo form. Why have people bought these?? Why are there reviews?? Looks too fake?? Get a real tattoo and how about not a terrible one.</li>
