    <ol>
            <li>I am taking the sea buckthorn supplement and thought this would be perfect for the bags under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this since I loved their body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I think it worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>Smells good, absorbs good and good nutrients for your skin.</li>
            <li>Many difficulties with eye creams , this has been a great product.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite sibu product!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for great service as always!</li>
            <li>Excellent for oily skin, even normal skin.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue using it for sure!</li>
            <li>The best part is it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Great eye cream, really creamy!</li>
            <li>Nice texture and easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting when I put it on like most eye creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get a richer, more moisturizing eye cream</li>
            <li>This eye cream is my favorite of all I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Do a price comparison to get a better price on Sea Buckthorn products.</li>
            <li>It also made my eyes look much better all around.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I would advise to everybody, who want good  effective, gentle staff for their face.</li>
            <li>Smooths out wrinkles and feels moist, smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love using pure buckthorn oil</li>
            <li>Recently listed as a great value in a fashion magazine, I really wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my eyes feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in texture and in color almost right away.</li>
            <li>But I can CLEARLY see a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>Thought this would be a lot better than it actually is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating and doesn&#x27;t cause any issues with the skin around my eyes!</li>
            <li>Really like this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but leaves my eye area feeling hydrated, and it dries quick enough that I can put on make up after applying it.</li>
            <li>so I recommend just using the pure oil (seed or berry or both) on your eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet...</li>
            <li>I have quite a bit of wrinkle/sun damage around my eyes and nose and have tried everything under the sun - from department store brands to almost every line of skin care in Whole Foods Market.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a relatively cheap product that was all natural, and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Sets very well under makeup.</li>
            <li>And so happy that this costs a fraction of what I spent on all my other eye creams.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is with that.</li>
            <li>I had expected more from this product than it actually delivered.  </li>
            <li>This brand is so good, that I ended up buying the whole system and never felt sorry.  </li>
            <li>I have normal eyelids, but the skin around my under eye is pretty dry, and this has helped to keep that area hydrated.</li>
            <li>Catch it early girls.</li>
            <li>This has made majorly improved the puffiness and irritation I constantly felt under my eyes!</li>
            <li>The price has gone up about $8 on Amazon since I first posted my review a little under 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>This cream is meant for those with dry and sensitive skin around the eyes!</li>

            <li> Also, Iâ€™m not sure if this product has anything to do with the sudden lengthening in my eyelashes</li>
            <li> and sometimes it just shoots out water and other times cream...</li>
            <li> I had extreme dryness and flakiness around my eye</li>
            <li> I had dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to use it as I dont want to waste the money I spent</li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin and tones down my lines.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this yet because the tube of eye cream had been previously opened...</li>
            <li> but this is too light &amp; it feels drying  after a few minutes :-(</li>
            <li> i tear a little after application</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without being heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few months but didn&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
            <li> Feels heavy and sticky .</li>
            <li> Purchased after reading a review in a health magazine, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> there is crusty, dried up eye cream all over the cap and opening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Not good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> No more, and I get complements all the time telling me</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s alittle expensive, I have used several Sea Buckthorn items before.</li>
            <li> so I either get watery goo or thick cream.  </li>
            <li> its not a good product.</li>
            <li> The bottle tube was not sealed and the product smelled like stale olive oil.</li>
            <li> Sadly, that means that my skin has taken a beating.</li>
            <li> At one point it got so bad, it was pealing.</li>
            <li> Boo! :(</li>
            <li> Disgusting.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is terrible.  </li>

            <li> I had expected more from this product than it actually delivered.  I am taking the sea buckthorn supplement and thought this would be perfect for the bags under the eyes.  From what I can tell, I see no change.  Probably would work for someone without the severe problem I have.  Catch it early girls.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see any difference yet.  i tear a little after application</li>
            <li> Just received today.  The bottle tube was not sealed and the product smelled like stale olive oil.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite sibu product! It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting when I put it on like most eye creams I&#x27;ve tried. I would constantly rub my eyes and it would irritate my skin, make it red and puffy. At one point it got so bad, it was pealing. This has made majorly improved the puffiness and irritation I constantly felt under my eyes! I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles yet... So I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is with that. But I can CLEARLY see a HUGE difference. I love it and will continue using it for sure!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me! I was hoping to get a richer, more moisturizing eye cream but this is too light &amp; it feels drying  after a few minutes :-(</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a lot better than it actually is. With all the hype about the sea buckthorn I was at least hoping for some positive results. Nothing!  It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting so guess that&#x27;s something.I have been using for a month.  I will not purchase again.  Thanks amazon for great service as always!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without being heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> Many difficulties with eye creams , this has been a great product.</li>
            <li> i DO NOT recommend this product. after using it i would say it leaves ur eye drier than prior to applying the product. its not a good product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this cream twice now, and can&#x27;t rave enough about it.  I had dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.  No more, and I get complements all the time telling me I look 10 to 15 years younger.  What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m 37 and grew up worshipping the sun. Sadly, that means that my skin has taken a beating. I have quite a bit of wrinkle/sun damage around my eyes and nose and have tried everything under the sun - from department store brands to almost every line of skin care in Whole Foods Market. I decided to try this since I loved their body lotion.  Iâ€™ve been using it for about 3 weeks and can definitely tell that itâ€™s working. When I smile, the lines around my eyes have surprisingly decreased and are less deep. Amazing! Also, Iâ€™m not sure if this product has anything to do with the sudden lengthening in my eyelashes (I use the cream on my upper lids, too).  Iâ€™m a fan. And so happy that this costs a fraction of what I spent on all my other eye creams.  Additional comment: The price has gone up about $8 on Amazon since I first posted my review a little under 2 years ago. Boo! :(</li>
            <li> no for me. I used it for a few months but didn&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in texture and in color almost right away. it leaves my eyes feeling fresh. i use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Over priced and no results. Feels heavy and sticky . Purchased after reading a review in a health magazine, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this product for the age-defying aspect. I thought this was a relatively cheap product that was all natural, and so far I really like it. I only give it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t noticed any &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; aspects, but it has kept my eyes hydrated. I have normal eyelids, but the skin around my under eye is pretty dry, and this has helped to keep that area hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  Can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this yet because the tube of eye cream had been previously opened...there is crusty, dried up eye cream all over the cap and opening.  Disgusting.  Prior to use I had already thrown away all of the packaging and shipping materials otherwise I would be sending this back.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream, really creamy!</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream at the local health store.  I love using pure buckthorn oil so I thought I would try this.  The consistency is terrible.  I try to squirt some out and sometimes it just shoots out water and other times cream... The tube doesn&#x27;t allow you to shake it or mix it up so I either get watery goo or thick cream.  I&#x27;m still trying to use it as I dont want to waste the money I spent but they need to improve the formula or packaging.  I haven&#x27;t noticed that it works so I recommend just using the pure oil (seed or berry or both) on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Excellent for oily skin, even normal skin. Not good for dry skin. Sets very well under makeup. Smells good, absorbs good and good nutrients for your skin.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is my favorite of all I have tried.  Smooths out wrinkles and feels moist, smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I think it worked fairly well. It seems to softened the lines around eyes.  I will probably order it again.</li>
            <li> This brand is so good, that I ended up buying the whole system and never felt sorry.  I would advise to everybody, who want good  effective, gentle staff for their face.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream. It hydrates my skin and tones down my lines. The best part is it is all natural. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I do like this eye cream although it&#x27;s alittle expensive, I have used several Sea Buckthorn items before. Do a price comparison to get a better price on Sea Buckthorn products.</li>
            <li> I had extreme dryness and flakiness around my eye and I tried every cream and ointment I could find.  Sibu is the only one that helped.  It also made my eyes look much better all around.  Nice texture and easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> This cream is meant for those with dry and sensitive skin around the eyes! It&#x27;s very hydrating and doesn&#x27;t cause any issues with the skin around my eyes! Really like this!</li>
            <li> Recently listed as a great value in a fashion magazine, I really wanted to try it.  I absolutely love it. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now. It&#x27;s light but leaves my eye area feeling hydrated, and it dries quick enough that I can put on make up after applying it.</li>
