            <li>It is a very fine and distinguishd perfume.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as good as it was originally.  </li>
            <li>The major department stores stopped stocking this excellent men&#x27;s product and I have no idea why??</li>

            <li>One of my hubby&#x27;s fav colognes, for many years.  </li>
            <li>He smelled so much better than the tree and the cat combined.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have some and price not a rip off.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m satisfied with the chypres and fougeres</li>

            <li>I am a man that has 15 or 20 bottles of cologne, as all my relatives know I love colognes, so I am easy to shop for.</li>
            <li>To feel the worth of smelling AMAZING.</li>

            <li>Thanks,  good deal.</li>
            <li>Nice worth to order ....</li>
            <li>If your are looking something  special than this the one colon that I used for years!</li>
            <li>The packaging is very clean and precise looking as well.</li>
            <li>It is VERY strong for the first 20 minutes!</li>
            <li>love it.smells like my original bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a spicy, strong scent.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, but I have an issue with having to pay a $16 fee for overnight shipping, and not having the product arrive until a day after the weekend was over.  </li>
            <li>Just returned to this one for the first time since back in the day and it makes me very, very happy.</li>
            <li>Love it - arrived quickly too n</li>
            <li>This cologne is just right and very light.</li>
            <li>Your body chemistry plays a huge factor in how a scent will smell on you.</li>
            <li>I have been in a number of situations where women, I have not even known, have asked me what cologne I am using and that they liked it so much they want to buy it for their husband/boyfriend.  </li>
            <li>and he happens to enjoy wearing Kouros.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great smelling cologne that has gotten me several compliments.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this is like nothing I&#x27;ve experienced (I have over 30 different sents)</li>
            <li>Not the cheapest but well worth it :)</li>
            <li>It smells so fantastic.</li>
            <li>its cucumbery and light</li>
            <li>I really like this scent and am glad we were able to get it via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>, I like it SO much (and seems also women like it!!! &#x27;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fun to tell olfactory admirers of kouros that it&#x27;s made in part from the anal glandular secretions of a civet!  </li>
            <li>Try &amp; See for yourself if you are a man of confidence and another thing; compliment your worth, like ME?!</li>
            <li>for the first time he is satisfied with a cologne in the US</li>
            <li>does not feel like original  </li>
            <li>i dont think this original</li>
            <li>It seemed that the product had been altered chemically and did not seem to be as the original scent.</li>
            <li>but it did not seem to be the original scent.&lt;br /&gt;#3.)</li>
            <li>While I like the scent of the original product as stated before it seemed to be altered to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;#5.</li>
            <li>Great smell and lasts long</li>
            <li>it wears off within hours as original lasted 24 plus hours...</li>
            <li>This is a re formulated version of the original Kouros....</li>
            <li>I usually get the latest and greatest, but just happened to come across an old favorite from the 80&#x27;s that I had forgotten about.</li>
            <li>but this one is just SPECIAL by itself.</li>
            <li>... Came right on time!</li>
            <li>This product is very good for everyday use in any situation, whether it be a first-time business interview or just a night out with your friends and family.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, thanks to Amazon and Scents World, I now know where to get one of my all time favorite scents.</li>
            <li>If you like Cool Water, Davidoff Echo, A*MEN</li>
            <li>A bit heavy-handed for my tastes, but really not bad.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite fragances, I really buy it many more times later.</li>
            <li>After that it is clean, fresh musk all day.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Received the packages quickly.</li>
            <li>Super compliments from fried and family,  on the fragrance.</li>
            <li>and was delighted to find it, to my nose, unchanged from the days before the Eurozone began curtailing important scent ingredients... the key in wearing it successfully is to apply it in the briefest possible bursts of spray - VERY LITTLE smells best - lasting and original</li>
            <li>Dont last on you,this must be the watered one,i have been using this brand for years.really good perfume if you get the right one..</li>
            <li>He is a Man very aware of the importance of Image</li>
            <li>In a flight of nostalgia, had to purchase it as this was the very first cologne I bought for myself when growing up in Europe.</li>
            <li>Like all YSL frags, this sweet baby is worth your money.</li>
            <li>I loved this scent when I first smelled it on someone back in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Shipment came on time and has the same old beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is such an incredibly rich and nuanced scent that has always been one of the most unique and treasured in my collection.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks tremendously will absolutely have to buy more.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available..</li>
            <li>It is super clean and very alluring.</li>
            <li>It is very manly and every person I have come in contact with in the last 24 hours has commented on how good I smelled.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an old fragance, I have used for many years</li>
            <li>the smell is powerful though.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak for the one on here but the one in kohl&#x27;s is powerful as all heck.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews I read about Kouros are about the old formulation.  </li>
            <li>but this is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>It got to my home on time and was worth the order.</li>
            <li>I was unaware that it was still available and very pleased to receive a new bottle in spray format..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a very positive effect on women.  </li>
            <li>Same old good quality and original packing.</li>
            <li>I have other good fragrances</li>
            <li>It really has a unique smell.</li>
            <li>The bottle and packaging looked right</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>It makes life easier to get it right to your door.</li>
            <li>right away they send it to me</li>
            <li>When first applied, it has a soapy, powdery fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying it at a reputable retailer even if it cost a little more.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It is very reasonable compared to the newer ones.</li>
            <li>he loves it very much</li>
            <li>thank  you very  much</li>
            <li>It is sometimes hard to find, but great to see it here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>However, when he first puts it on I run.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My Father is the First Man in my life.</li>
            <li>I have been using this French product for many years.</li>
            <li>Also the scent does not last for more than two hours..</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes since my teen years in the 80&#x27;s..</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well aware that this is a masterpiece.</li>
            <li>I brought several bottles to make sure my husband doesn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>most likely how Kouros use to be.</li>
            <li>The products always show up on exactly the day that they promise and the fragrances are always well packaged.</li>
            <li>I recently found it again on Amazon and was glad to see in fact that it is still being made.  </li>
            <li>Totally as advertised and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love YSL fragrances and products and this one is no different.</li>
            <li>11/16 wtih the regular free super saver shipping.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find any other cologne that has this kind of mysterious and comforting scent - absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I first used this product years ago, and more recent Men&#x27;s fragrances might come close, but can&#x27;t really compare to the sense of &amp;#34;character&amp;#34; that provides.</li>
            <li>the Anglophile type who likes big floppy dogs, old books, tweeds, and I&#x27;d own a Jag or a Bentley if I could afford one, rather than a Ferrari.</li>
            <li>Long lasting does not fade,it is a clean fresh scent that all ladies love</li>
            <li>I have used many different fragrances and Kouros definitely has a unique smell.</li>
            <li>Long time favorite,  very robust aroma.</li>
            <li>I will stock up for the day it is no long available.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested Amazon, and lo and behold, not only was it available but at a much cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>You should really order this product for it really works..</li>
            <li>My wife said it smelled like flowers, and that it wasn&#x27;t something she wants her man to smell like..... stick with \\&quot;Caribbean Bay Rum\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>It also lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>You will absolutely send people running if you over-apply.</li>
            <li>but it is not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Really like and my girl friend loves it</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I bought Kouros for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>None really stood out to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really takes on the notes of lavender and vinilla.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li>I wanted the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>smell fades away fast.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Also saves me looking at local stores for this fabulous product.</li>
            <li>The internet has been instrumental in me finding it at a reasonable price at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love Kouros but the top of the bottle was broken when I received it.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed it on myself 4-5 times and thats more than enough;  nearly got a headache.  </li>
            <li>However I am just guessing based on the many reviews that I have read as I have actually not smelled the old formulation of Kouros.  </li>
            <li>Only Monsieur Houbigant&#x27;s Musk Men&#x27;s Cologne (before Dana Perfumes destroyed the fragrance, having acquired the right to make and sell it when Houbigant went bankrupt) smelled better and last longer than Kouros.</li>
            <li>Clean, unique fresh scent hard to forget..</li>
            <li>I have been using this for many years and it is becoming harder and harder to find...</li>
            <li>Both my 18 year old son and my 79 year old father enjoy wearing my new bottle of Kouros.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and stays with you a long time.</li>
            <li>I like Kouros and have used it since it first came out in the early 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks to the Amazon purchasing department, which obviously obtained surplus stock at a deep discount from a respected manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It has a very powerful fragrance that lasts really long.</li>
            <li>There is a slight synthetic top note that I don&#x27;t recall that reminds me of celery salt, but it disappears qiuckly.</li>
            <li>I have used Kouros for many years and have found it more difficult to find.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Homme is what I compare all YSL scents to, and while this is no L&#x27;Homme, it&#x27;s a decent change-it-up option.</li>
            <li>A classic and funky work of art.</li>
            <li>My dad has used Kouros for over 30yrs, my older brother followed in his footsteps and now yours truly.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different men&#x27;s fragrances over the years - always come back to this favorite one.</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>Classic.  </li>
            <li>So I bought it for my son in high school.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase this at high end retailers..</li>
            <li>I have been using Kouros since high school</li>
            <li>highly recomended been using it for years</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s available on Amazon since it&#x27;s harder to find it each year.</li>
            <li>&quot; more than a few times.</li>
            <li>Have used for many years and have been having trouble finding it.</li>
            <li>reasonable price for an object getting harder to find, shipped on time, would like to be able to buy testers again if possible</li>
            <li>This cologne smells so good, and it just takes a small spray and it last all day.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough to last</li>
            <li>He gets compliments left and right on it.  </li>
            <li>Some colognes are very harsh smelling or too strong!</li>
            <li>Kouros is a great fragrance for men that is very hard to find in regular retail.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone shopping for a new cologne.  </li>
            <li>This new formula lasts about and hour.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order this because I wanted their new age</li>
            <li>But I received the new formulation and it was in the new formulation bottle too.  </li>
            <li>The seller should advertise this product in the new formulation bottle so customers will know which formulation they are getting.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and strong.</li>
            <li>I am surprised; this cologne lasts every bit of 12 hours!</li>
            <li>Smell is pretty personal, so don&#x27;t just take my word for it - go to a store and find out for yourself.</li>
            <li>Come out with Kouros Classic (the real thing this time) and build back the trust you betrayed in your customers.</li>
            <li>the price was just right, he has used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li>Light scent long lasting smell</li>
            <li>but I would pick this cologne over any other one if I&#x27;m going out for something special.</li>
            <li>So hard to find, glad they carry.  </li>
            <li>My favorite scent, although it&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Holy wow.</li>
            <li>But it is loud, and funky.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve read a hundred dozen reviews saying that young dudes shouldn&#x27;t wear this.</li>
            <li>-- so individualistic that it&#x27;s nearly sui generis.</li>
            <li>Not too loud...</li>
            <li>The old formula lasted all day or longer.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cologne for my father who wore this all the time as a young man (age 56 now).</li>
            <li>Assuming that said distributor reads this and wants to send a ship back to label to me and or replace product for defective unit, I will adjust the review on this site, but for now this was my experience with this distributor and this product.</li>
            <li>I am really surprise that Kouros actually pricier than Body Kouros,</li>
            <li>you for fast shipping and aditional gift.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll comme back</li>
            <li>I was very ashamed when my friend I gave it to as a gift brought it back to me to let me know it was fake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The picture advertising this fragrance was the bottle used for the old formulation.  </li>
            <li>This is not the old Kourous, probably a knock off from China.</li>
            <li>Seller is great, but Yves Saint Laurent could have done better with this scent, or it is stale, as packaging is in several foreign languages and not english or french.</li>
            <li>This time I was able to buy some containers at the lowest price met anywhere during the past 15 years, probably due to the economic slowdown.</li>
            <li>RECOMMEND NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS A SIMPLE IMITATION OF THE ORIGINAL</li>
            <li>I usually wear Kouros when I go out on special occasions and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li>Please keep the old standard.</li>
            <li>You should note that paying a third of the real thing, you only get a third.</li>
            <li>I have had several women comment that &amp;#34;I smell good&amp;#34; and this scent is not real common.</li>
            <li>My wife has liked it all these years and has never become bored with it or recommended I try another scent.</li>
            <li>Just hold your horses, because this monster dries down to be one smooth, long lasting work of art.</li>
            <li>I had to write a new review after I started to wear Kouros again after not wearing it for a long time.</li>
            <li>The negative comments I have read about the old formulation like civet have been removed from the new formulation and this is where the new formulation has lost its overall strength and longevity.  </li>

            <li> product has been in my family since 1981, popular and never worn without getting rave revues.  </li>
            <li> He loves it too even thought it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s a nice size bottle.</li>
            <li> I also own Antaeus as well</li>
            <li> So Kouros is still a popular fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My Uncle has been looking for this for years and remembered how much he liked it.  </li>
            <li> very very good, shipp[ng was very fast</li>
            <li> This cologne has been out for a awhile and still holds true and one of the great YLS scents out there.</li>
            <li> Ysl truly created something amazing and delightful here and this sale was a bargain and a find as this scent is becoming increasingly more rare.</li>
            <li> My husband is so happy to find that his favorite frangrances are available.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> Amazing that this excellent product is no longer sold in the major department store, men&#x27;s departments.</li>
            <li> This by far one of the best colognes out there........</li>
            <li> It is a very fine and distinguishd perfume.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as good as it was originally.  </li>
            <li> The major department stores stopped stocking this excellent men&#x27;s product and I have no idea why??</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>

            <li> Glad to have some and price not a rip off.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m satisfied with the chypres and fougeres</li>

            <li> Shower fresh!!</li>
            <li> I have loved this cologne for decades, and I was so excited to get it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> I am a man that has 15 or 20 bottles of cologne, as all my relatives know I love colognes, so I am easy to shop for.</li>
            <li> To feel the worth of smelling AMAZING.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re going to be in close space to someone or in a car with people for a while, might be ideal to go with a different</li>
            <li> Thanks,  good deal.</li>
            <li> Nice worth to order ....</li>
            <li> If your are looking something  special than this the one colon that I used for years!</li>
            <li> The packaging is very clean and precise looking as well.</li>
            <li> It is VERY strong for the first 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> love it.smells like my original bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a spicy, strong scent.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but I have an issue with having to pay a $16 fee for overnight shipping, and not having the product arrive until a day after the weekend was over.  </li>
            <li> Just returned to this one for the first time since back in the day and it makes me very, very happy.</li>
            <li> Love it - arrived quickly too n</li>
            <li> This cologne is just right and very light.</li>
            <li> Your body chemistry plays a huge factor in how a scent will smell on you.</li>
            <li> I have been in a number of situations where women, I have not even known, have asked me what cologne I am using and that they liked it so much they want to buy it for their husband/boyfriend.  </li>
            <li> and he happens to enjoy wearing Kouros.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne that has gotten me several compliments.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this is like nothing I&#x27;ve experienced (I have over 30 different sents)</li>
            <li> Not the cheapest but well worth it :)</li>
            <li> It smells so fantastic.</li>
            <li> its cucumbery and light</li>
            <li> I really like this scent and am glad we were able to get it via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> , I like it SO much (and seems also women like it!!! &#x27;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fun to tell olfactory admirers of kouros that it&#x27;s made in part from the anal glandular secretions of a civet!  </li>
            <li> Try &amp; See for yourself if you are a man of confidence and another thing; compliment your worth, like ME?!</li>
            <li> for the first time he is satisfied with a cologne in the US</li>
            <li> does not feel like original  </li>
            <li> i dont think this original</li>
            <li> It seemed that the product had been altered chemically and did not seem to be as the original scent.</li>
            <li> but it did not seem to be the original scent.&lt;br /&gt;#3.)</li>
            <li> While I like the scent of the original product as stated before it seemed to be altered to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;#5.</li>
            <li> Great smell and lasts long</li>
            <li> it wears off within hours as original lasted 24 plus hours...</li>
            <li> This is a re formulated version of the original Kouros....</li>
            <li> I usually get the latest and greatest, but just happened to come across an old favorite from the 80&#x27;s that I had forgotten about.</li>
            <li> but this one is just SPECIAL by itself.</li>
            <li> ... Came right on time!</li>
            <li> This product is very good for everyday use in any situation, whether it be a first-time business interview or just a night out with your friends and family.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, thanks to Amazon and Scents World, I now know where to get one of my all time favorite scents.</li>
            <li> If you like Cool Water, Davidoff Echo, A*MEN</li>
            <li> A bit heavy-handed for my tastes, but really not bad.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragances, I really buy it many more times later.</li>
            <li> After that it is clean, fresh musk all day.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Received the packages quickly.</li>
            <li> Super compliments from fried and family,  on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> and was delighted to find it, to my nose, unchanged from the days before the Eurozone began curtailing important scent ingredients... the key in wearing it successfully is to apply it in the briefest possible bursts of spray - VERY LITTLE smells best - lasting and original</li>
            <li> Dont last on you,this must be the watered one,i have been using this brand for years.really good perfume if you get the right one..</li>
            <li> He is a Man very aware of the importance of Image</li>
            <li> In a flight of nostalgia, had to purchase it as this was the very first cologne I bought for myself when growing up in Europe.</li>
            <li> Like all YSL frags, this sweet baby is worth your money.</li>
            <li> I loved this scent when I first smelled it on someone back in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Shipment came on time and has the same old beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is such an incredibly rich and nuanced scent that has always been one of the most unique and treasured in my collection.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks tremendously will absolutely have to buy more.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available..</li>
            <li> It is super clean and very alluring.</li>
            <li> It is very manly and every person I have come in contact with in the last 24 hours has commented on how good I smelled.</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an old fragance, I have used for many years</li>
            <li> the smell is powerful though.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t speak for the one on here but the one in kohl&#x27;s is powerful as all heck.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews I read about Kouros are about the old formulation.  </li>
            <li> but this is my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li> It got to my home on time and was worth the order.</li>
            <li> I was unaware that it was still available and very pleased to receive a new bottle in spray format..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a very positive effect on women.  </li>
            <li> Same old good quality and original packing.</li>
            <li> I have other good fragrances</li>
            <li> It really has a unique smell.</li>
            <li> The bottle and packaging looked right</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> It makes life easier to get it right to your door.</li>
            <li> right away they send it to me</li>
            <li> When first applied, it has a soapy, powdery fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying it at a reputable retailer even if it cost a little more.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is very reasonable compared to the newer ones.</li>
            <li> he loves it very much</li>
            <li> thank  you very  much</li>
            <li> It is sometimes hard to find, but great to see it here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> However, when he first puts it on I run.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My Father is the First Man in my life.</li>
            <li> I have been using this French product for many years.</li>
            <li> Also the scent does not last for more than two hours..</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes since my teen years in the 80&#x27;s..</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well aware that this is a masterpiece.</li>
            <li> I brought several bottles to make sure my husband doesn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> most likely how Kouros use to be.</li>
            <li> The products always show up on exactly the day that they promise and the fragrances are always well packaged.</li>
            <li> I recently found it again on Amazon and was glad to see in fact that it is still being made.  </li>
            <li> Totally as advertised and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love YSL fragrances and products and this one is no different.</li>
            <li> 11/16 wtih the regular free super saver shipping.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find any other cologne that has this kind of mysterious and comforting scent - absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I first used this product years ago, and more recent Men&#x27;s fragrances might come close, but can&#x27;t really compare to the sense of &amp;#34;character&amp;#34; that provides.</li>
            <li> the Anglophile type who likes big floppy dogs, old books, tweeds, and I&#x27;d own a Jag or a Bentley if I could afford one, rather than a Ferrari.</li>
            <li> Long lasting does not fade,it is a clean fresh scent that all ladies love</li>
            <li> I have used many different fragrances and Kouros definitely has a unique smell.</li>
            <li> Long time favorite,  very robust aroma.</li>
            <li> I will stock up for the day it is no long available.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested Amazon, and lo and behold, not only was it available but at a much cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> You should really order this product for it really works..</li>
            <li> My wife said it smelled like flowers, and that it wasn&#x27;t something she wants her man to smell like..... stick with \\&quot;Caribbean Bay Rum\\&quot;....</li>
            <li> It also lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> You will absolutely send people running if you over-apply.</li>
            <li> but it is not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Really like and my girl friend loves it</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought Kouros for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> None really stood out to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really takes on the notes of lavender and vinilla.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I wanted the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> smell fades away fast.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Also saves me looking at local stores for this fabulous product.</li>
            <li> The internet has been instrumental in me finding it at a reasonable price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Kouros but the top of the bottle was broken when I received it.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it on myself 4-5 times and thats more than enough;  nearly got a headache.  </li>
            <li> However I am just guessing based on the many reviews that I have read as I have actually not smelled the old formulation of Kouros.  </li>
            <li> Only Monsieur Houbigant&#x27;s Musk Men&#x27;s Cologne (before Dana Perfumes destroyed the fragrance, having acquired the right to make and sell it when Houbigant went bankrupt) smelled better and last longer than Kouros.</li>
            <li> Clean, unique fresh scent hard to forget..</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and it is becoming harder and harder to find...</li>
            <li> Both my 18 year old son and my 79 year old father enjoy wearing my new bottle of Kouros.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and stays with you a long time.</li>
            <li> I like Kouros and have used it since it first came out in the early 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks to the Amazon purchasing department, which obviously obtained surplus stock at a deep discount from a respected manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It has a very powerful fragrance that lasts really long.</li>
            <li> There is a slight synthetic top note that I don&#x27;t recall that reminds me of celery salt, but it disappears qiuckly.</li>
            <li> I have used Kouros for many years and have found it more difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Homme is what I compare all YSL scents to, and while this is no L&#x27;Homme, it&#x27;s a decent change-it-up option.</li>
            <li> A classic and funky work of art.</li>
            <li> My dad has used Kouros for over 30yrs, my older brother followed in his footsteps and now yours truly.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different men&#x27;s fragrances over the years - always come back to this favorite one.</li>
            <li> A classic.</li>
            <li> Classic.  </li>
            <li> So I bought it for my son in high school.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this at high end retailers..</li>
            <li> I have been using Kouros since high school</li>
            <li> highly recomended been using it for years</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s available on Amazon since it&#x27;s harder to find it each year.</li>
            <li> &quot; more than a few times.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years and have been having trouble finding it.</li>
            <li> reasonable price for an object getting harder to find, shipped on time, would like to be able to buy testers again if possible</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good, and it just takes a small spray and it last all day.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough to last</li>
            <li> He gets compliments left and right on it.  </li>
            <li> Some colognes are very harsh smelling or too strong!</li>
            <li> Kouros is a great fragrance for men that is very hard to find in regular retail.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone shopping for a new cologne.  </li>
            <li> This new formula lasts about and hour.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this because I wanted their new age</li>
            <li> But I received the new formulation and it was in the new formulation bottle too.  </li>
            <li> The seller should advertise this product in the new formulation bottle so customers will know which formulation they are getting.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and strong.</li>
            <li> I am surprised; this cologne lasts every bit of 12 hours!</li>
            <li> Smell is pretty personal, so don&#x27;t just take my word for it - go to a store and find out for yourself.</li>
            <li> Come out with Kouros Classic (the real thing this time) and build back the trust you betrayed in your customers.</li>
            <li> the price was just right, he has used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Light scent long lasting smell</li>
            <li> but I would pick this cologne over any other one if I&#x27;m going out for something special.</li>
            <li> So hard to find, glad they carry.  </li>
            <li> My favorite scent, although it&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Holy wow.</li>
            <li> But it is loud, and funky.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve read a hundred dozen reviews saying that young dudes shouldn&#x27;t wear this.</li>
            <li> -- so individualistic that it&#x27;s nearly sui generis.</li>
            <li> Not too loud...</li>
            <li> The old formula lasted all day or longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my father who wore this all the time as a young man (age 56 now).</li>
            <li> Assuming that said distributor reads this and wants to send a ship back to label to me and or replace product for defective unit, I will adjust the review on this site, but for now this was my experience with this distributor and this product.</li>
            <li> I am really surprise that Kouros actually pricier than Body Kouros,</li>
            <li> you for fast shipping and aditional gift.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll comme back</li>
            <li> I was very ashamed when my friend I gave it to as a gift brought it back to me to let me know it was fake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The picture advertising this fragrance was the bottle used for the old formulation.  </li>
            <li> This is not the old Kourous, probably a knock off from China.</li>
            <li> Seller is great, but Yves Saint Laurent could have done better with this scent, or it is stale, as packaging is in several foreign languages and not english or french.</li>
            <li> This time I was able to buy some containers at the lowest price met anywhere during the past 15 years, probably due to the economic slowdown.</li>
            <li> RECOMMEND NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS A SIMPLE IMITATION OF THE ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> I usually wear Kouros when I go out on special occasions and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li> Please keep the old standard.</li>
            <li> You should note that paying a third of the real thing, you only get a third.</li>
            <li> I have had several women comment that &amp;#34;I smell good&amp;#34; and this scent is not real common.</li>
            <li> My wife has liked it all these years and has never become bored with it or recommended I try another scent.</li>
            <li> Just hold your horses, because this monster dries down to be one smooth, long lasting work of art.</li>
            <li> I had to write a new review after I started to wear Kouros again after not wearing it for a long time.</li>
            <li> The negative comments I have read about the old formulation like civet have been removed from the new formulation and this is where the new formulation has lost its overall strength and longevity.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m wrong, but the scent seems the almost the same but weaker and maybe a bit more &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; and it does not seem to last as long.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> i been using for long time last time</li>
            <li> Seems like the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> scent does not last as long as it used to ...</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find except through duty free shops when I travelled over seas.</li>
            <li> About an hour after applying, it loses that harshness from the beginning and is very wearable.</li>
            <li> Yes that long ago.  </li>
            <li> The opening is funky and strange.</li>
            <li> continues to deliver been using for a longtime and plan to continue using for a long time to come</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Stays for a long time and smells like you just sprayed on the cologne</li>
            <li> The received product did not work as expected, the plastic part that was glued to the bottom of the bottle broke off or fell off and not from any of my actions, not a real big deal about the plastic part of the bottle</li>
            <li> Have been using it for over 10 years;  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When I ordered Kouros from Amazon I was not sure if I would be getting the new formulation.  </li>
            <li> Have always loved this scent on my husband and was very disappointed when the Macy&#x27;s near us quit carrying it.  </li>
            <li> It has a masculine scent that doesn&#x27;t punch too hard and the scent last all day.</li>
            <li> what Quorum is to dry fougeres and Yatagan is to chypres</li>
            <li> If you can, try it out before buying as this cologne&#x27;s unfolding layers of complex scents highly depend on your skin.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a problem with this design because the same thing happened to another bottle I had bought previously.</li>
            <li> Time to time I use other parfums, but I always have to go back to Kouros unlike any other parfume.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> The fragrance of the product is not exactly the same and appears to have less fixative.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Or perhaps this is not real Kuoros, but a counterfeit?  </li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s nothing subtle about it, and I&#x27;d strongly suggest thinking twice before doing this as a blind buy, unless you&#x27;re totally gonzo on high-testosterone orientals and you want something that makes Obsession look cowardly.</li>
            <li> and I got it before expected date.</li>
            <li> &quot; that dispenses the cologne did not work as it was expected or was tampered with.</li>
            <li> After 30 years YSL has either changed the formula and bottle style or this is NOT real.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product was  not really kouros  </li>
            <li> I like the fragrance very much - this is a difficult to find cologne for men.</li>
            <li> Try the other Yves Saint Laurent products too.</li>
            <li> so other people must like it too.</li>
            <li> With other dermatic spices.</li>
            <li> I should have believed other reviewers that said that this was a watered-down reformulation.</li>
            <li> Use&#x27;s 1 other type beside&#x27;s this one.</li>
            <li> imitation perfume seemed to me &amp;#60;(</li>
            <li> HAD CHECKED THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED IN OTHER STORE</li>
            <li> This fragrance is not powerful to the degree of affecting how he breathes and he uses it as his form of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews saying that Kouros has been reformulated and is weaker, or toned down from what it used to be.</li>
            <li> As it dries down, the mint, herbal lemony balm type odors come through along with the civit and sandalwood aromas.</li>
            <li> I pushed the button down then the sprayer stuck in that position and stayed there,</li>
            <li> it has either been watered down or something diff all together..</li>
            <li> the picture was not the same as what arrived-I am extremely disappointed especially since it came directly from amazon</li>
            <li> the quality of the product is identical to previous store bought product.  </li>
            <li> Again, this was just what I purchased previously.  </li>
            <li> Then I decided to try this rather odd looks sent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few bottles since the early 90&#x27;s along with as lot of other ones some twice as expensive and those went in to trash or to someone I don&#x27;t like much.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> My oldest boy can&#x27;t live w/o this stinker stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells a little sweeter than store bought Kouros.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not able to wear a number of men&#x27;s colognes due to woodsy or heavy scents which trigger sneezing, but  Kouros doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> To bad that you can only get it online, but as long as I can still get it; that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> I wear Kouros in winter or summer and it smells unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Calvin Klein and / or Chanel</li>
            <li> I have used Kouros for 20 years and usually buy it at the Navy Exchange</li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Now after a weeks of two of use it only fails about 50% of the time instead of 100%.&lt;br /&gt;#2.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for the past 30years</li>
            <li> This is all my dad wears, unable to find in stores anymore, On the bad side It does appear to be not as full a bottle as before</li>
            <li> The bottle is newly redesigned (missing the silver around the neck and base) but this does nothing to take away from the product.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find this in a store anymore.</li>
            <li> Hard to find except on Internet.  </li>
            <li> This is so hard to find anymore.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes you memorable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stocked up a lifetime supply just in case Amazon stops carrying it because it is hard to get</li>
            <li> For me it has always lasted me at least a year.</li>
            <li> complex permanent distinctive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean like 2 or 3 sprays max, dudes.</li>
            <li> About two years ago i emptied my last bottle of Kouros and was disappointed to be informed by a clerk at a retail store that Kouros was no longer being made.  </li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s very hard to please.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I bought on Amazon because it&#x27;s very hard to find it in Italy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> It gives you a boulder-sized chunk of incense, with some civet and honey to soften the blow -- but it&#x27;s so blatant and unidimensional  that I get bored with it after a few hours.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t irritating to others, as some men&#x27;s colognes tend to be overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> such a disappointment :(</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this product.</li>
            <li> Sad that I can&#x27;t find it in a department store.</li>
            <li> BUT what was disturbing was the \\&quot;Sprayer\\</li>
            <li> This was a fake product.</li>
            <li> it was fake</li>
            <li> even the packaging was fake-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> He is really crazy about this brand</li>
            <li> sent you&#x27;ll drive everyone crazy.</li>
            <li> It smelles dirty, sweaty and just plain disgusting.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding this product in the stores, Thank God for Amazon!</li>
            <li> This cologne is FAKE!</li>
            <li> THIS IS FAKE DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> if I have to pick between them I would no doubt choose Body Kouros, too bad</li>
            <li> Very bad service.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This has to be the worst scent I have ever had the displeasure of smelling.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> GOOD AFTERNOON I NEED TO KNOW THE STATUS OF THIS PRODUCT AND TO MAKE THE PURCHASE IN AUGUST AND STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY PURCHASE, THANKS</li>
            <li> If your are looking something  special than this the one colon that I used for years! The women will love the smell!</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne for my husband. He has been wearing this sent for years. For some reason the one we ordered from amazon smelt like a woman&#x27;s perfume. Very disappointed and I will look into getting a refund.</li>
            <li> I like Kouros and have used it since it first came out in the early 1980&#x27;s.  I think the formulation has changed over the years and it&#x27;s not as good as it was originally.  Perhaps I&#x27;m wrong, but the scent seems the almost the same but weaker and maybe a bit more &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; and it does not seem to last as long.  Or perhaps this is not real Kuoros, but a counterfeit?  However, I&#x27;d still recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best-smelling stuff ever!  It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite scent and I love it on him!  I&#x27;m so glad I found it so now we can always get it.  It can be hard to find in stores.  I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.  The only drawback is that you may have to beat the women off of your man with a stick.</li>
            <li> This is the best, long lasting, wonderful top, middle is killer, and the bottom is magnificent.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne, as do most people who smell it on him.  However, when he first puts it on I run.  It is VERY strong for the first 20 minutes!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love purchasing through Amazon. The prices are fair and right on target.. You should really order this product for it really works..</li>
            <li> found Kouros! The major department stores stopped stocking this excellent men&#x27;s product and I have no idea why?? I guess their \\&quot;buyers\\&quot; need to keep current and get rid of the \\&quot;old\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, thanks to Amazon and Scents World, I now know where to get one of my all time favorite scents. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used Kouros for many years and have found it more difficult to find.  Happy to find it on Amazon. Price and service excellent! Lowest price I have found either on-line or from local, discount, cologne, outlet stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not able to wear a number of men&#x27;s colognes due to woodsy or heavy scents which trigger sneezing, but  Kouros doesn&#x27;t do that. It also isn&#x27;t irritating to others, as some men&#x27;s colognes tend to be overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a very positive effect on women.  My wife has liked it all these years and has never become bored with it or recommended I try another scent. I have been in a number of situations where women, I have not even known, have asked me what cologne I am using and that they liked it so much they want to buy it for their husband/boyfriend.  Certainly great for the ego even if you aren&#x27;t seeking that kind of attention.  Amazing that this excellent product is no longer sold in the major department store, men&#x27;s departments.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding this product in the stores, Thank God for Amazon!</li>
            <li> the product is not avaialable in department stores, i was very pleased to find it on amazon.  the quality of the product is identical to previous store bought product.  shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I loved this scent when I first smelled it on someone back in the 80&#x27;s.  Yes that long ago.  So I bought it for my son in high school.  He gets compliments left and right on it.  They absolutely love it.  Even the guys are asking what it is so they can get it. It is a shame that you cannot find it in the department stores anymore.  But you can get some good deals on line.  Just remember one scent does not always smell the same on everyone.  Your body chemistry plays a huge factor in how a scent will smell on you.</li>
            <li> My Father is the First Man in my life. He pays a great deal of attention to how he looks and smells. He is a Man very aware of the importance of Image and he happens to enjoy wearing Kouros.&lt;br /&gt;He has received many compliments regarding his &#x27;Scent&#x27; ... and I take a great deal of pleasure in keeping him supplied. He will be 89 years of age this month ... and Kouros has been his signature scent.</li>
            <li> Again, this was just what I purchased previously.  Well done and delivery was on time.  Thank you.  RN</li>
            <li> I use this personally. It was difficult to find except through duty free shops when I travelled over seas. I love it</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone shopping for a new cologne.  This one is a winner.  Buy it on line according to best price.</li>
            <li> Once again,  I enjoyed my kouros.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago and liked it.  I have had several women comment that &amp;#34;I smell good&amp;#34; and this scent is not real common.</li>
            <li> Loved this scent...all you need is a spritz or 2</li>
            <li> Just discovered this scent again on Amazon. In a flight of nostalgia, had to purchase it as this was the very first cologne I bought for myself when growing up in Europe. You won&#x27;t find any other cologne that has this kind of mysterious and comforting scent - absolutely love it. If you can, try it out before buying as this cologne&#x27;s unfolding layers of complex scents highly depend on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this French product for many years. Its smell seems to arouse sympathy at any place I traveled to in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. This time I was able to buy some containers at the lowest price met anywhere during the past 15 years, probably due to the economic slowdown. Many thanks to the Amazon purchasing department, which obviously obtained surplus stock at a deep discount from a respected manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Ladies seem to like this stuff!</li>
            <li> liked cologne , bought as a gift</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! It has been my favorite and my wife loves it on me</li>
            <li> Have always loved this scent on my husband and was very disappointed when the Macy&#x27;s near us quit carrying it.  Someone suggested Amazon, and lo and behold, not only was it available but at a much cheaper price.  I am a believer of the &amp;#34;Amazon way&amp;#34; now!</li>
            <li> This is such an incredibly rich and nuanced scent that has always been one of the most unique and treasured in my collection. It&#x27;s also fun to tell olfactory admirers of kouros that it&#x27;s made in part from the anal glandular secretions of a civet!  Ysl truly created something amazing and delightful here and this sale was a bargain and a find as this scent is becoming increasingly more rare. Thanks tremendously will absolutely have to buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product and price.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s (and my) favorite scent.Shower fresh!!</li>
            <li> I have loved this cologne for years.  It is sometimes hard to find, but great to see it here at Amazon.  I ask for this as a gift about once a year.  I get lots of comments on the fragrance and it seems to be uncommon.</li>
            <li> This cologne is FAKE! I got it for my dad for father&#x27;s day and the bottle does not even look the same as the picture! Also the scent does not last for more than two hours.. Where as the Kouros my dad used to used lasted ALL DAY! THIS IS FAKE DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but I have an issue with having to pay a $16 fee for overnight shipping, and not having the product arrive until a day after the weekend was over.  It was for birthday gift and didn&#x27;t make it on time.  I would have chosen regular shipping, not overnight.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  The guy who received it as a gift smells real nice,</li>
            <li> So hard to find, glad they carry.  Very happy with service, ordered on Thurs. 11/11 and rec. on Tues. 11/16 wtih the regular free super saver shipping.  Good price too.  Will order again thru this company.</li>
            <li> Love it - arrived quickly too n</li>
            <li> It is hard to find this in a store anymore. Thanks for making it available..it is our favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came as listed as and on schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. Koruros is a Greek word used for strength and vitality.She can&#x27;t keep her hands off me. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for 15 years. Fair price for this higher end cologne.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragances, I really buy it many more times later. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of this 20 years ago in splash format.  I was unaware that it was still available and very pleased to receive a new bottle in spray format..</li>
            <li> been wearing since the 80&#x27;s, love the smell, very unique and everyone asks what it is, no other fragrance like it around, totally original, the best ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great cologne, i&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this and so does he. I will be buying on a regular basis since I cannot find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I had to write a new review after I started to wear Kouros again after not wearing it for a long time. I have used many different fragrances and Kouros definitely has a unique smell. The combination of spices and florals in Kouros is just perfect. I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how many compliments you get when you wear Kouros. I usually wear Kouros when I go out on special occasions and it never disappoints. This cologne last 2 days if you don&#x27;t take a shower.(I&#x27;m not kidding!) Kouros is the best cologne I have in my collection. I have other good fragrances but I would pick this cologne over any other one if I&#x27;m going out for something special. Kouros Tip: spray 2 sprays on your hair and 5 or 6 sprays on your clothes.......perfect. I wear Kouros in winter or summer and it smells unbelievable. This is my 100 dollar cologne. Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Kouros is a great fragrance for men that is very hard to find in regular retail. It is super clean and very alluring. You can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this product. Try the other Yves Saint Laurent products too. They are all good.</li>
            <li> This is a spicy, strong scent. Long lasting. A bit heavy-handed for my tastes, but really not bad. L&#x27;Homme is what I compare all YSL scents to, and while this is no L&#x27;Homme, it&#x27;s a decent change-it-up option.</li>
            <li> This cologne gets noticed! I&#x27;ve heard \\&quot;You smell GREAT!\\&quot; and \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot; more than a few times. But Kourus flies under the radar, I never tell anyone what I&#x27;m wearing. If everyone wore it, it wouldn&#x27;t be mine.</li>
            <li> My man smells great! He is really crazy about this brand and he&#x27;s very hard to please.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes since my teen years in the 80&#x27;s.. Clean, unique fresh scent hard to forget..</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, have used it for years.  Hard to find except on Internet.  Always get compliments!</li>
            <li> My wife hates it, but I love it. I have been using it for 20 plus years. It predates my wife.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My father&#x27;s favorite cologne.  Had to get it for him for Christmas</li>
            <li> You &amp; i know what we want... 1) To impress the ladies 2) To feel the worth of smelling AMAZING. I can go on &amp; on about what cologne smells perfect for a guy like YOU but the truth won&#x27;t change that KOUROS gives you the scent of YOU. You can only wear a cologne perfectly if you can compliment it&#x27;s awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;There are wonderful colognes out there for guys but this one is just SPECIAL by itself. Try &amp; See for yourself if you are a man of confidence and another thing; compliment your worth, like ME?!</li>
            <li> I am a man that has 15 or 20 bottles of cologne, as all my relatives know I love colognes, so I am easy to shop for. I usually get the latest and greatest, but just happened to come across an old favorite from the 80&#x27;s that I had forgotten about. It was Kouros by YSL. I had been given an Amazon gift card so I bought this cologne. It arrived yesterday, and after showering, I sprayed this on, and my wife walked in and asked what I was wearing and said it was the best smelling cologne she had ever smelled. My daughter and neighbor have said the same thing. This stuff is amazing. I usually wear Calvin Klein and / or Chanel but now I am going to wear this one for awhile. It smells fantastic and stays with you a long time. It really has a unique smell. It is very manly and every person I have come in contact with in the last 24 hours has commented on how good I smelled. Give this a chance. It is very reasonable compared to the newer ones. You will be glad you purchased this item.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband. We both love this scent! He also gets a lot of compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> Bought this product b/c it was reviewed as one of \\&quot;the sexiest aftershaves\\&quot;.... My wife said it smelled like flowers, and that it wasn&#x27;t something she wants her man to smell like..... stick with \\&quot;Caribbean Bay Rum\\&quot;.... now THAT&#x27;S the best aftershave there is.  Period.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite EDT that he&#x27;s been using all of his life. I appreciate that it&#x27;s available on Amazon since it&#x27;s harder to find it each year. I trust Amazon and the customer service of Palm Beach Perfumes was amazing!</li>
            <li> I love Kouros but the top of the bottle was broken when I received it.  This seems to be a problem with this design because the same thing happened to another bottle I had bought previously.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Kouros deodorant spray, but I had never used this perfume before. It has a very powerful fragrance that lasts really long. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> this is my father scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is his favorit perfume since he was in the university 1985&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the best perfume ever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highlyyyyyyyyy recomend it for everybody&lt;br /&gt;somehow it give u a uniqe and good as reputaion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they will know who came they smell the smell&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and it is becoming harder and harder to find... I will stock up for the day it is no long available.</li>
            <li> Great and smooth transaction... thank you!</li>
            <li> My dad loves this cologne</li>
            <li> Holy wow. I have read some reviews saying that Kouros has been reformulated and is weaker, or toned down from what it used to be. If this is the case, I can&#x27;t imagine how potent it was before reformulation. Lordamercy. So anyways, on to the scent. The opening is funky and strange. Has some incense going on, and God knows what all. But it is loud, and funky. Just hold your horses, because this monster dries down to be one smooth, long lasting work of art. About an hour after applying, it loses that harshness from the beginning and is very wearable. It also lasts the whole day. I mean like 2 or 3 sprays max, dudes. You will absolutely send people running if you over-apply. Like all YSL frags, this sweet baby is worth your money. A classic and funky work of art. Oh yeah, I&#x27;ve heard people say stuff about Kouros smelling like sweat,feces, pee, semen, and the like. (no, I&#x27;m not kidding, go to basenotes and read for yourself) Don&#x27;t concern yourself with that, I don&#x27;t get any of that at all. Also, I&#x27;ve read a hundred dozen reviews saying that young dudes shouldn&#x27;t wear this. Bullcrap. People nowadays are too used to watery-ADGio-fresh-wussified-melon-ball-smelling-wuss cologne. Stand out from the crowd, show people you got a pair, and buy a man&#x27;s cologne. Word.</li>
            <li> Dont last on you,this must be the watered one,i have been using this brand for years.really good perfume if you get the right one..</li>
            <li> Was purchased for my husband.  This is his favorite.  Gets so many compliments.  He is called Mr. Smell Good. Great choice</li>
            <li> THIS is my husband&#x27;s favorite.  I Love it, too.  WE are so happy that it is available. Through you.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this product and I love the scent.  It is strong enough to last and I would highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> One of my hubby&#x27;s fav colognes, for many years.  This was a Christmas refill.  He smelled so much better than the tree and the cat combined.  I&#x27;m keeping him and he loves the cologne.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I ordered it and received it in a timely manner. That was great.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> An excellent cologne.  I am surprised; this cologne lasts every bit of 12 hours! When first applied, it has a soapy, powdery fresh scent. As it dries down, the mint, herbal lemony balm type odors come through along with the civit and sandalwood aromas. This is definitely a man&#x27;s cologne! What a steal at this price.  I sprayed it on myself 4-5 times and thats more than enough;  nearly got a headache.  I highly recommend this product!!! Again, a steal for this quality and price...</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance very much - this is a difficult to find cologne for men. Happy to find through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only fragrance my husband will wear...he loves it and I love it too! I couldn&#x27;t find it at Macy&#x27;s so I tried Amazon and there it was...Thanks!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smell very good, I can make business, with this seller again</li>
            <li> my husband lived in France and since he got to the US he never found a cologne like the one in France. for the first time he is satisfied with a cologne in the US and I am so happy. he loves it very much</li>
            <li> Smell is pretty personal, so don&#x27;t just take my word for it - go to a store and find out for yourself. Smells good to me.</li>
            <li> My dad has used Kouros for over 30yrs, my older brother followed in his footsteps and now yours truly. Sad that I can&#x27;t find it in a department store. If you want to smell like a million bucks this is it....... Cheers</li>
            <li> I have used Kouros for 20 years and usually buy it at the Navy Exchange but they quit carrying it so I bought it on Amazon. This is definitely not Kouros. The bottle and packaging looked right but it is not the real stuff. Smells nothing like it. I would recommend buying it at a reputable retailer even if it cost a little more.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and strong.</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find anymore.  Glad to have some and price not a rip off.  That&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well aware that this is a masterpiece. Kouros is to orientals what Quorum is to dry fougeres and Yatagan is to chypres -- so individualistic that it&#x27;s nearly sui generis. It gives you a boulder-sized chunk of incense, with some civet and honey to soften the blow -- but it&#x27;s so blatant and unidimensional  that I get bored with it after a few hours. As I see it, this is for the Mediterranean seducer type -- Al Pacino or Armand Assante, maybe -- driving a knockout redhead around in a Ferrari convertible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the Anglophile type who likes big floppy dogs, old books, tweeds, and I&#x27;d own a Jag or a Bentley if I could afford one, rather than a Ferrari. So I&#x27;m satisfied with the chypres and fougeres I&#x27;ve got now. If Quorum and Yatagan, which I review,  haven&#x27;t got the cojones, what does? They satisfy my inner Connery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YSL Jazz, which I also review, is a lot more my style than this is. ANYONE can wear it, at any time. Jazz invites women, while Kouros overwhelms them. Truly gorgeous stuff, but there&#x27;s nothing subtle about it, and I&#x27;d strongly suggest thinking twice before doing this as a blind buy, unless you&#x27;re totally gonzo on high-testosterone orientals and you want something that makes Obsession look cowardly.</li>
            <li> love the smell, very unique and everyone asks what it is, no other fragrance like it around, totally original, the best ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> love it.smells like my original bottle.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, well known and liked</li>
            <li> 1995 Ibiza. &#x27;nuff said.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your woman will love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kouros is an ageless time-piece for the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Memorable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly and all-star manly scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a winner</li>
            <li> does not feel like original  i been using for long time last time i bought it from amazon and was good this one  after 2 3 hours bearly u smell any thing  i dont think this original</li>
            <li> continues to deliver been using for a longtime and plan to continue using for a long time to come</li>
            <li> Spoiled more of a alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite cologne. Can&#x27;t find it in stores nearby. So best place to buy it is on here.</li>
            <li> I loved I liked thats Kouros. Is my favorite fragance. I recommended. Thanks,  good deal.</li>
            <li> Husband has been using this cologne for many years.  The scent is not the same as it used to be.</li>
            <li> RECOMMEND NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS A SIMPLE IMITATION OF THE ORIGINAL HAD CHECKED THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED IN OTHER STORE</li>
            <li> The fragrance of the product is not exactly the same and appears to have less fixative.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product since 1986</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 30 yrs. It is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my dad. He loves it and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. It is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Simply one of the best scent ever,after taking a bath spray on,omg,the rest is history.Long lasting does not fade,it is a clean fresh scent that all ladies love</li>
            <li> I loved this spray but when i received it it was leak. I will not recommend anyone to buy this productonline. I tried to contact them but they never replied me back. Very bad service.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance. This is my favorite cologne. I would highly recommend it. Not too loud...just right. Everyone have their own subjective opinion but I would suggest trying it...you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Really like and my girl friend loves it</li>
            <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
            <li> My husband is so happy to find that his favorite frangrances are available. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Like flies on doo doo, the ladies will be all over you with this nice and original smelling cologne. I&#x27;ve been wearing Kouros for 25 years, I don&#x27;t wear anything else. Kouros is the best.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful</li>
            <li> Light scent long lasting smell I&#x27;ve had a few bottles since the early 90&#x27;s along with as lot of other ones some twice as expensive and those went in to trash or to someone I don&#x27;t like much.&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford 50$  I recommend you get one ,people always ask what are u wearing kinda nice to hear.</li>
            <li> Did not like the smell of it. Will not recommend anyone I know.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my father. It was a hit.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years and have been having trouble finding it. My husband will not use anything else. Thanks</li>
            <li> I opened this package, sprayed it one.  I have been wearing this for 15 years, maybe 20 years, maybe longer.  THIS IS NOT&lt;br /&gt;KOUROS.  Whatever is in this bottle is not what I have been using for all these years.  I know the smell.  This is not it.&lt;br /&gt;I would return it, but Amazon wouldn&#x27;t take it back.  I have been ripped off.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne. I&#x27;m glad you still sell it. I ordered it and I got it before expected date. Thank you</li>
            <li> I first used this product years ago, and more recent Men&#x27;s fragrances might come close, but can&#x27;t really compare to the sense of &amp;#34;character&amp;#34; that provides.</li>
            <li> Good... Came right on time!</li>
            <li> I have been using Kouros since 1984, and always liked the aroma, and when I was dating, all the women absolutely loved it. Even men would ask me the name of it and where to get it. I always get compliments, and you use it sparingly so it lasts a long time. For me it has always lasted me at least a year.</li>
            <li> I recommend it arrived all well greetings from Venezuela.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent, although it&#x27;s hard to find.  This is a great price for it, and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> i love this aftershave on my husband, for the size of the bottle you couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price.</li>
            <li> The maker changed the formula. Not the same quality. The old formula lasted all day or longer. This new formula lasts about and hour.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cologne!! The packaging is very clean and precise looking as well.</li>
            <li> Seems like the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long. I can remember the smell, lasting for hours and still smell it the next day.</li>
            <li> If you like Cool Water, Davidoff Echo, A*MEN then this cologne is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like Azzaro PH, Rive Gauche, Aramis (900 and/or devin), Terre D&#x27;Hermes then this will be among your top 10.</li>
            <li> My oldest boy can&#x27;t live w/o this stinker stuff. Got him 2 jugs for XMas.  He swears it has thermions in it and attracts EZ gals. Who am I to judge, been there, done that.  May buy a bottle as a virility test. Stay Tuned.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Brilliant. It was great to find one of my favorite colognes that I couldn&#x27;t find in the stores anymore. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this fragrance for many years and was very happy to receive as a gift.  It has become his personal fragrance, and we recognize his presence in the room!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this spray for almost 30 years! He loves it and I love it too!  Some colognes are very harsh smelling or too strong! This cologne is just right and very light. Thanks again for a great product!</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne that has gotten me several compliments.  The cologne also came nicely packaged to prevent against breakage.  I would highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> Long time favorite,  very robust aroma. Stays for a long time and smells like you just sprayed on the cologne</li>
            <li> Smells a little sweeter than store bought Kouros. It may be that YSL have changed the formula, although I doubt it. Not sure I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> A great product, I love it!</li>
            <li> reasonable price for an object getting harder to find, shipped on time, would like to be able to buy testers again if possible</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my father who wore this all the time as a young man (age 56 now). He has COPD and has been afflicted by this for about the last 19 years. This fragrance is not powerful to the degree of affecting how he breathes and he uses it as his form of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I bought Kouros for my husband and he really likes it. I&#x27;d like to recommend it to everyone looking for a good scent that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Classic YSL for my brother-in-law, who loved it!</li>
            <li> I bought on Amazon because it&#x27;s very hard to find it in Italy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an old fragance, I have used for many years, I like it SO much (and seems also women like it!!! &#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy of being able to buy thru this website.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a chance in future to do the same in Italy?</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good, and it just takes a small spray and it last all day. It is the only cologne I want my husband to wear.</li>
            <li> Last order ... product is not what it used to be ... scent does not last as long as it used to ...</li>
            <li> called  NY headquarters. product has been in my family since 1981, popular and never worn without getting rave revues.  I have been, for over 25 years, getting daily compliments and referring people to the brand name.  NY corporate could not tell me why this fragrance is discontinued....I have been stocking this fragrance and now only wear it sparingly.....It has a masculine scent that doesn&#x27;t punch too hard and the scent last all day.</li>
            <li> The received product did not work as expected, the plastic part that was glued to the bottom of the bottle broke off or fell off and not from any of my actions, not a real big deal about the plastic part of the bottle BUT what was disturbing was the \\&quot;Sprayer\\&quot; that dispenses the cologne did not work as it was expected or was tampered with. I pushed the button down then the sprayer stuck in that position and stayed there, so I has to manually had to pull it up EVERY TIME. Now after a weeks of two of use it only fails about 50% of the time instead of 100%.&lt;br /&gt;#2.) It seemed that the product had been altered chemically and did not seem to be as the original scent. It seemed  to be close but it did not seem to be the original scent.&lt;br /&gt;#3.) I do not have a lot of time to \\&quot;Dick Around\\&quot; and send stuff back that does not work so I rate this product as defective.&lt;br /&gt;#4.) Assuming that said distributor reads this and wants to send a ship back to label to me and or replace product for defective unit, I will adjust the review on this site, but for now this was my experience with this distributor and this product. While I like the scent of the original product as stated before it seemed to be altered to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;#5.) I have no way of knowing IF this gets read by the distributor that I purchased this from but the name is Nadeem Ahmad located in Sunrise Florida, balance address withheld for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I heard the discontinued this line. What a shame if they did.</li>
            <li> I am really surprise that Kouros actually pricier than Body Kouros, if I have to pick between them I would no doubt choose Body Kouros, too bad I already bought Kouros so I have both Kouros and Body Kouros.</li>
            <li> this is the best place to buy this product!</li>
            <li> I start usin&#x27;it over 20 years ago. Time to time I use other parfums, but I always have to go back to Kouros unlike any other parfume.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for fast shipping and aditional gift.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll comme back</li>
            <li> This cologne has been out for a awhile and still holds true and one of the great YLS scents out there.</li>
            <li> As described. Love it! Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have used Kouros for years and like the way I smell.  I get many compliments about it so other people must like it too.</li>
            <li> This was a fake product. I was very ashamed when my friend I gave it to as a gift brought it back to me to let me know it was fake.&lt;br /&gt;i am very very disappointed. It a quite a shame !! I will never buy from Amazon again !!</li>
            <li> I have loved this cologne for decades, and I was so excited to get it at such a great price. I am sure I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> This has to be the worst scent I have ever had the displeasure of smelling. It is a cross between Chanel number 5 and manure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this horrendously offensive cologne. It smelles dirty, sweaty and just plain disgusting.</li>
            <li> I love this product, It work well with my body chemistry. I get compliments from both women and men. I am sure they want their man smelling like me, but I will never tell</li>
            <li> Received the packages quickly. it was as shown and described. thank you for great service.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they are discontinuing this fragrances. It smells so goooooood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I brought several bottles to make sure my husband doesn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> its great and it was delivered on time</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product. After 30 years YSL has either changed the formula and bottle style or this is NOT real.</li>
            <li> This is the best men&#x27;s cologne out there, I have been using it for 26 years now. There is something about it that makes women follow you around.</li>
            <li> My husband wore this when we were dating, way back in the stone ages.  It isn&#x27;t out at the stores anymore, so I was happy to find it online.  Its a great manly type scent.</li>
            <li> Great smell and lasts long</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product was  not really kouros  it was fake even the packaging was fake- the picture was not the same as what arrived-I am extremely disappointed especially since it came directly from amazon</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different men&#x27;s fragrances over the years - always come back to this favorite one.</li>
            <li> this cologne is my husbands favorite and I love too. the price was just right, he has used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Super compliments from fried and family,  on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very nice.....and my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband smells great.  Very pleased with the price.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this at high end retailers..this colonge turns heads but NOT this Kouros sold at Amazon...it has either been watered down or something diff all together..it wears off within hours as original lasted 24 plus hours...shame on you Amazon..will never purchase again</li>
            <li> Smell so suave and good. Last all day. Been getting a lot of compliments from the ladies :-)</li>
            <li> I was at kohl&#x27;s and decided to try some sent out. None really stood out to me. Then I decided to try this rather odd looks sent. And I was not dissipointed. The smell of this is like nothing I&#x27;ve experienced (I have over 30 different sents) the smell is powerful though. So if you&#x27;re going to be in close space to someone or in a car with people for a while, might be ideal to go with a different sent you&#x27;ll drive everyone crazy. That being said the smell of this is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really takes on the notes of lavender and vinilla. With other dermatic spices. It will get you noticed for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for the one on here but the one in kohl&#x27;s is powerful as all heck. And if you just so happen to get it from there have them price match. I was about to pay 78 for this in store before having them match this online price.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years. It is very hard to find. And, the online price was excellant. Much cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> If you like Shalimar on a woman you will like Kouros on a man&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powerful but not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;Pervasive complex permanent distinctive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes you memorable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stocked up a lifetime supply just in case Amazon stops carrying it because it is hard to get</li>
            <li> Shipment came on time and has the same old beautiful fragrance. Same old good quality and original packing. Will recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using Kouros since high school that&#x27;s over 40 years. Always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> There is a reason for the 1 star and this is it. I should have believed other reviewers that said that this was a watered-down reformulation. I didn&#x27;t order this because I wanted their new age interpretation-- I wanted the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember when Coca-Cola changed their recipe? How did that work for them? Oh yeah, it bombed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to YSL? Come out with Kouros Classic (the real thing this time) and build back the trust you betrayed in your customers.</li>
            <li> and was delighted to find it, to my nose, unchanged from the days before the Eurozone began curtailing important scent ingredients... the key in wearing it successfully is to apply it in the briefest possible bursts of spray - VERY LITTLE smells best - lasting and original</li>
            <li> Had this spray years ago. When I tried others they always affected my sinuses. I&#x27;m glad I can still obtain this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a great fragrance. Unfortunately, it has been discontinued. Glad I could find it here. Not the cheapest but well worth it :)</li>
            <li> Kouros of the 1980S are much better than the one of 2012. Please keep the old standard. Thanks. smell fades away fast.</li>
            <li> I love this on my husband. It smells so fantastic. He loves it too even thought it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s a nice size bottle.</li>
            <li> When I ordered Kouros from Amazon I was not sure if I would be getting the new formulation.  The picture advertising this fragrance was the bottle used for the old formulation.  But I received the new formulation and it was in the new formulation bottle too.  The seller should advertise this product in the new formulation bottle so customers will know which formulation they are getting.  I am a little disappointed but I still like what I received in the mail from the seller.  Most of the reviews I read about Kouros are about the old formulation.  The negative comments I have read about the old formulation like civet have been removed from the new formulation and this is where the new formulation has lost its overall strength and longevity.  It still smells good but not like a power house fragrance from the 80&#x27;s. I also own Antaeus as well and I get much more strength and longevity most likely how Kouros use to be. However I am just guessing based on the many reviews that I have read as I have actually not smelled the old formulation of Kouros.  I am always impressed by the service that I receive from Amazon. The products always show up on exactly the day that they promise and the fragrances are always well packaged. Both my 18 year old son and my 79 year old father enjoy wearing my new bottle of Kouros. So Kouros is still a popular fragrance.  Kouros will always have a place in my fragrance collection. I can only hope that my bottle of Kouros gets stronger with age as some reviewers have said would happen.</li>
            <li> People online say this is but a shadow of it&#x27;s former glory days but I will say that it is close enough to suit me. Just returned to this one for the first time since back in the day and it makes me very, very happy. There is a slight synthetic top note that I don&#x27;t recall that reminds me of celery salt, but it disappears qiuckly. After that it is clean, fresh musk all day. Love it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Outstanding value.</li>
            <li> Excellent value. Also saves me looking at local stores for this fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent and am glad we were able to get it via Amazon.  It makes life easier to get it right to your door.</li>
            <li> About two years ago i emptied my last bottle of Kouros and was disappointed to be informed by a clerk at a retail store that Kouros was no longer being made.  Well it appears she was just trying to sell me something else because that did not have Kouros.  I recently found it again on Amazon and was glad to see in fact that it is still being made.  A classic.</li>
            <li> This by far one of the best colognes out there........Classic.  I&#x27;ve used it for going on 20 years now and people still ask: What&#x27;s that you&#x27;re wearing&amp;#34;?  I have many fragrances but this is my favorite by far.  To bad that you can only get it online, but as long as I can still get it; that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> Came on time.  Smells wonderful.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> SMELL IS DIFFERENT ON EVERYONE</li>
            <li> This is not the old Kourous, probably a knock off from China. Amazon should review the source.</li>
            <li> My husband has used Kouros for tens of years. This is not the same product in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, what can you tell me about this? You stock it, can you verify supplier.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to have my money back.&lt;br /&gt;I used to pay 65+ dollars a bottle for this men&#x27;s cologne. This bottle was 40 something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please help, let me know. Thank you for your time.</li>
            <li> This product is very good for everyday use in any situation, whether it be a first-time business interview or just a night out with your friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is still one of the best men&#x27;s fragrances ever.  Only topped by Jean Patou Pour Homme and Chanel&#x27;s Anteaus Pour Homme.  I hope this is never discontinued.  Roger &amp; Gallet recently introduced &amp;#34;OPEN White&amp;#34; that is similar in fragrance and about a third of the price.  You should note that paying a third of the real thing, you only get a third.</li>
            <li> highly recomended been using it for years</li>
            <li> Totally as advertised and I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good perfume and I like to smell it on my husband</li>
            <li> I say awesome because of the product and the speed in which my order was processed and received. I have been using Kouros EDT cologne since its introduction in the U.S. market. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find it in stores now. The internet has been instrumental in me finding it at a reasonable price at Amazon. This is the only cologne I use, and I have often received complements and requests for its name.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, very good. My order arrived on schedule.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased and happy with my purchase&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> Nice worth to order ....reall deal i am gonna order more ..</li>
            <li> imitation perfume seemed to me &amp;#60;(</li>
            <li> My Uncle has been looking for this for years and remembered how much he liked it.  Well, he still does!  Gets compliments everywhere he goes.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne at a great price.  Have been using it for over 10 years;  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> very very good, shipp[ng was very fast</li>
            <li> its cucumbery and light</li>
            <li> This is a re formulated version of the original Kouros....such a disappointment :(</li>
            <li> This is all my dad wears, unable to find in stores anymore, On the bad side It does appear to be not as full a bottle as before</li>
            <li> very  good product.  thank  you very  much</li>
            <li> Seller is great, but Yves Saint Laurent could have done better with this scent, or it is stale, as packaging is in several foreign languages and not english or french.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Use it for many years.</li>
            <li> I order Kourus, because i used before and i like the smell. It is a very fine and distinguishd perfume. I order it and right away they send it to me, i&#x27;m very pleased with my purchased, i&#x27;ll do it again.</li>
            <li> Number one cologne !!! Makes you happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for the past 30years this is the only cologne I wear.  It&#x27;s suttle and not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best! If you want a cologne with a great Scent then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years. never have I had so many compliments!!</li>
            <li> My honey has used this product before I met him which is over 12 years.He love&#x27;s it.Use&#x27;s 1 other type beside&#x27;s this one.</li>
            <li> Everyone Loves this fragrance !!!!!</li>
            <li> I love YSL fragrances and products and this one is no different. It got to my home on time and was worth the order. Men should wear this if they want to smell refined :)</li>
            <li> Its so very very very nice to smell not over powering at all.&lt;br /&gt;I buy it every year don&#x27;t stop making this</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the 80s and it is among the best, and longest lasting, I have used. Anyone one who appreciates quality products will attest to the quality of this product. The bottle is newly redesigned (missing the silver around the neck and base) but this does nothing to take away from the product. Only Monsieur Houbigant&#x27;s Musk Men&#x27;s Cologne (before Dana Perfumes destroyed the fragrance, having acquired the right to make and sell it when Houbigant went bankrupt) smelled better and last longer than Kouros.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and a good price!</li>
            <li> Best cologne ever. Been using it for over 10 years!</li>
