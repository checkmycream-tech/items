            <li> It is worthless. The loofah is so minimal that it is not worth using.</li>
            <li> This arrived yesterday. Boy, was I excited. Tried to use it in the shower this morning, and first thing, one of the handles broke. Not good! In fairness, the Loofah pad portion seems good. I guess I&#x27;ll trim it down and try to use it as a scrub pad. Giving this item one star is simply a courtesy. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a little more unwieldy than you would imagine. On top of the difficulty of use, one of my handholds tore off after about a week. You&#x27;re better off with one of those scrubber wands.</li>
            <li> I thought this was supposed to be for men. Size-wise, it is more for small women. The loofah section was too short, the overall scrubber was short and narrow, and the cord that makes the handle broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Only worked through 3 showers</li>
            <li> The thing broke after the first use the handles fell off piece of junk</li>
            <li> Really does the job , exfoliates my back as described and really made well. I have been using this product now for 2 months would recommend as well with people with back acne .Truly easy to use plan on buying another as a gift for mothers day!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Extremely durable , truly able to give you that spa exfoliating experience without to much exertion. its kind of all in the design. I would recommend this to anyone that has trouble reaching their back wit a traditional scrubber. This was sent to me as a sample for review and this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use. Made with ultra soft cotton and perfect for any kind of skin. Though my skin is allergic and i couldn&#x27;t use any of those cheap Loofah that sold in markets. But when i heard about this Loofah from my friend and he said it&#x27;s really comfortable for allergic skin. I ordered it right the moment and he is right this Amazing Loofah is really perfect for my skin and clean my back, neck, shoulders and feet pretty finely.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works as advertised. The whole family loves it!</li>
            <li> Loofah section is just in the middle. I would have liked it to extend end to end.</li>
            <li> The item is actually a lot smaller than it appears.  The model must be pretty tiny.  I got this for my husband...definitely too small for him.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it one of the strings broke. Product but strings not sturdy</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve purchased because of its longevity and stay-clean look. It does not compress and become useless.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> Handle broke w/in a week---cheap!!!</li>
            <li> My only concern is the size of the item and the potential strength of the two hand cords.  The cords could be a bit longer.</li>
            <li> This works well for me.  I am a petite women so it&#x27;s the perfect size.  I would not order if you are a male,or an average to large women.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my back and works well. Delivered quickly too.</li>
            <li> Love is what i wanted</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and comfort.</li>
            <li> The handle pulled out on the first use.  Had to sew it myself.  Loofah was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The handle broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting use to</li>
            <li> I have only used it 3 times, and the sore fabric edges started to break apart. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The handle broke off of this the first time I tried to use it. I&#x27;m female, small, not a body builder, it&#x27;s not like there was a lot of strain on the handles this is just a poorly made product.</li>
