            <li>I love it (as much as one can love dental floss).</li>
            <li>I love Smart Floss!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li>This flavor is much more natural than most dental products.  </li>
            <li>Taste is mild and natural(cloves).</li>
            <li>Now I won&#x27;t have to worry about running out for a good long while.</li>
            <li>And it has a nice subtle cardamom flavor that&#x27;s good for your breath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made up of many tiny fibers, kind of like twine, so that it flattens and widens slightly against the teeth, affecting more area at once.</li>
            <li>Great for really cleaning between teeth but probably not for those with tight teeth.</li>
            <li>Then we had some notable improvement, but only to a point.  </li>
            <li>love the fact this floss is sold in bulk, as I floss several times a day.  </li>
            <li>a real value Love the big pack.</li>
            <li>I bought a 6-pack in desperation, based on the ridiculously positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>fibers are kind of fluffy and seem to scrub off more gunk than regular floss.</li>
            <li>A dental hygienist is the one that recommended Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Dental Floss to me and I have been using it ever since.</li>

            <li>It is super soft and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Some of my teeth are very close together - it goes through, doesn&#x27;t shred, and doesn&#x27;t snap on my gums.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>compact, well made and so gentle on your gums.</li>
            <li>We have switched so many people from Glide to Smart Floss because it works well with tight contacts.  </li>
            <li>Floss that does the job better than others and it is not full of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>For a tight gap, just keep more tension on the floss.</li>
            <li>(Highly recommend.)  </li>
            <li>We love the cardamom flavor and Dr. Tung&#x27;s floss is that expandable type that works for large and small gaps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also just slightly coarse, more so than ordinary floss, which creates a mild scrubbing effect.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to slide between tight spaces and expands to fill gaps for the cleanest outcome.</li>
            <li>The floss is made of multiple fibers which enables the floss to remove food between teeth better than other floss.</li>

            <li> You won&#x27;t miss the wax (and I have tight spaces between my teeth). The texture of the floss does an excellent job of removing food, plaque, etc.</li>
            <li> I have long-standing issues with gum recession and pocketing, and I therefore brush and floss religiously and sleep with a night guard.  It was a losing battle until I threw out my electric toothbrush and bought a Colgate 360 manual brush.  (Highly recommend.)  Then we had some notable improvement, but only to a point.  I had also been looking for a woven floss for ages, but even the nasty mint-infused one I used to use seems to have disappeared.  My dentist told me even he couldn&#x27;t get it anymore, but still recommended I get some if I could.  So I went searching online, and stumbled across this floss.  I bought a 6-pack in desperation, based on the ridiculously positive reviews.  I didn&#x27;t understand how a dental floss could generate such enthusiasm.  I mean, it&#x27;s floss!  But it&#x27;s not like any other floss I&#x27;ve ever used.  My teeth feel so clean after I use it.  Also, I love the taste.  I love mint, but not in my floss.  This flavor is much more natural than most dental products.  But the kicker was this:  My dental hygienist was amazed at the improvement in the pocketing after I had been using this floss for only a month or two!  I brought some in for my visit, and both she and the dentist approved of it, though neither had ever heard of it.  After getting confirmation that I wasn&#x27;t delusional about  how great this floss is, I ordered another 12-pack.  It arrived almost immediately.  Now I won&#x27;t have to worry about running out for a good long while.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST floss ever! This floss offers the &amp;#34;best of both worlds&amp;#34; meaning it cleans without fraying. My experience with floss is either it is too slippery and does not clean the tooth well or it cleans the tooth well but frays leaving parts of itself between my teeth (UGH!). A dental hygienist is the one that recommended Dr. Tung&#x27;s Smart Dental Floss to me and I have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> Love this floss. It&#x27;s durable, flexible, and gets all the junk out. And it has a nice subtle cardamom flavor that&#x27;s good for your breath.</li>
            <li> Floss that does the job better than others and it is not full of harmful chemicals. I always buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Been using for years, but now looking for a beeswax-free version. Bees shouldn&#x27;t have to give wax for my teeth to be healthy.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss ever! It&#x27;s easy to slide between tight spaces and expands to fill gaps for the cleanest outcome. A must have product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular flosser and find that my teeth feel cleaner using Dr Tung&#x27;s floss.  Good stuff with a pleasant taste - not minty.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite floss! It has a great flavor and is not waxy. Taste is mild and natural(cloves). Not too spicy for my kids. I feel like I get a more thorough clean with this floss because it&#x27;s fibers are kind of fluffy and seem to scrub off more gunk than regular floss. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this. I love it (as much as one can love dental floss). Some of my teeth are very close together - it goes through, doesn&#x27;t shred, and doesn&#x27;t snap on my gums. I used to spend my time flossing thinking about what a pain it was. Now I just think about other things. Nice taste, too.</li>
            <li> after used this floss, I do not want use anything else. It is super soft and cleans very well. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best floss I have ever used. It works well for people with tight teeth as well as any other type of teeth. The floss is made of multiple fibers which enables the floss to remove food between teeth better than other floss. This floss is so great you won&#x27;t mind having 12 rolls it!!</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;know how some brands of floss shred as you pull it between your teeth? Not this one! This goes in, between and out without any problems. Really does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality product! Try some today.</li>
            <li> This floss is light years ahead of all others! It&#x27;s made up of many tiny fibers, kind of like twine, so that it flattens and widens slightly against the teeth, affecting more area at once.

            <li> This is the best floss I have ever used. It gets in between teeth that no other floss can.</li>
            <li> The cardamon flavor is now stronger than it ever was.  Would have preferred these to be unflavored.</li>

            <li> Great floss! compact, well made and so gentle on your gums. It does the job perfectly. Healthy gums, happy smile :)</li>
            <li> We love the cardamom flavor and Dr. Tung&#x27;s floss is that expandable type that works for large and small gaps. We have a variety of gap types in our family and this floss works for everyone. For a tight gap, just keep more tension on the floss. It is the only floss I&#x27;ve used that actually seems to remove calculus. This vendor sent us 12 rolls, they were in the retail individual blister packs, in three different colors.</li>
            <li> Is it weird to have a favorite dental floss? Well, this is my favorite. I feel like it cleans my teeth more thoroughly and massages my gums.</li>
            <li> Great floss that can be used with a drop of essential oil for a healing treatment on your gums and tooth crevices.</li>
            <li> This is the only floss I use now.  The rest seem so inferior.</li>
            <li> Best dental floss I&#x27;ve used.  Great for really cleaning between teeth but probably not for those with tight teeth.</li>
