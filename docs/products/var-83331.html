            <li>Loving it!</li>
            <li>Great product and I can&#x27;t wait to use more products from e.l.f.!</li>
            <li>It has light-diffusing particles that made my fine lines disappear and made my skin look perfect.  </li>
            <li>but it is so fine and sets my makeup perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my makeup flawless for hours and doesn&#x27;t settle into any fine lines.  </li>

            <li>but this is a good one, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>This is not as good as the MAKE UP FOR EVER HD powder</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>At any price, this is a good cosmetic.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>This powder is every bit as good as M*A*C* at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>But after I blended, it looked good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Good option for those on a budget.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my engagement and wedding pictures and I loved how it made me look for my engagement pictures</li>
            <li>It does the strangest thing on the face and does not look good at all.  </li>
            <li>A good product compared to the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great, good amount of product, and it has great coverage, love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>it is so good</li>
            <li>My skin is on the fair side.</li>
            <li>Item was everything I wanted and correct color, feels good on face and does what it was suppose to and look like.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s good for photo shoots, (</li>
            <li>This is a good dupe for Makeup Forever&#x27;s HD powder.</li>
            <li>This is especially true if you&#x27;re going to be taking pictures with flash, because an excess of powder will show up in your photos.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product and packaging itself is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thought it would be good for a powder cover.</li>
            <li>but it was a good buy to add to my makeup collection</li>
            <li>I think that this is good for all skin complexions and types.</li>
            <li>It has good coverage and has a matte look on the skin</li>
            <li>this works surprisingly good for an Elf product..</li>
            <li>So it is a good translucent powder.</li>
            <li>and so are all fair colored powders, they all turn me orange.</li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>It is also good just by itself</li>
            <li>Good powder.</li>
            <li>Had to give it 4 stars because of the texture/ appearance it leaves given its&#x27; nature, but it is a great product and when used to give &amp;#34;high definition&amp;#34;-gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is good.</li>
            <li>but this one is just as good.</li>
            <li>Good size also so gt alot for my money.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and use the translucent color.</li>
            <li>and I was expecting a somewhat good product</li>
            <li>This powder is just as good as the (HD-MAKE UP FOREVER), BUT CHEAPER.</li>
            <li>I do still use the powder and get good use out of it.</li>
            <li>In the end, I would recommend this product if your looking for a good finishing powder on a budget.</li>
            <li>Goes on very easily and makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>Most products are $1 to $3.00 and others are a great price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got what I wanted so very pleased.</li>

            <li>It leaves a smooth finish and beautiful glow.</li>

            <li>Really sets your foundation!!!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>But this product made my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li>does amazing tricks on the skin.</li>
            <li>looks light but works great</li>
            <li>Great at minimizing shine as a light coverage over foundation.</li>
            <li>This is great to smooth out a finished face.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading all of the amazing reviews on MakeUpAlley.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no pigment to this powder, but the effect is amazing</li>
            <li>This powder is so amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>gives u a nice finished look</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>Elf is really nice product for the price.</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>it does somewhat deal the makeup to a nice finish, so for me</li>
            <li>honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this unless you&#x27;ve already tried it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice powder to set concealer, I&#x27;m using this with a synthetic brush to set my make-up.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the powder puff, nice product though.</li>
            <li>It works perfect for very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Photos look much better and that&#x27;s always a good thing.</li>
            <li>The pouf is a nice addition for when I am in a hurry or need to take it with me.</li>
            <li>The product arrived, and I really liked the container it came in.  </li>
            <li>I own this product</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of wearing a matte nail polish.  </li>
            <li>and this may make it a teensy bit lighter, but it does give a really nice finish.  </li>
            <li>but I think it sets my makeup nicely.</li>
            <li>and this gives me a nice, matte look and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice powder.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice matte finish and makes makeup stay in place.</li>
            <li>It works really well and always gives me a flawless look.</li>
            <li>Packaging is nice and price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice, too.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and leaves a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li>It sets my makeup wonderfully and really polishes off my look.  </li>
            <li>It does make a nice difference of the look of my skin.</li>
            <li>This one is really nice and helps the application go on</li>
            <li>Nice amount.. nice package.</li>
            <li>make sure you apply in front of a mirror that has good lighting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice too if you find you&#x27;ve &amp;</li>
            <li>Really highlights and creates a flawless look</li>
            <li>It minimizes my pores and creates a nice finish evening out my skin tone as well</li>
            <li>I really liked this powder and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Fairly pleased and fair price.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li>Great combination and totally worth the $6 for each item!</li>
            <li>I use this mainly when I have photo shoots because it sets my makeup and keeps my face looking flawless even after a couple hours of shooting.</li>
            <li>Instead, I use it as a finishing powder, just a light application to seal in my makeup after I&#x27;ve finished everything and, for that purpose, it is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Love how it catches the light &amp; does great when your taking pictures.</li>
            <li>Cruelty free products are great and I commend elf for being better than the rest for this.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, affordable, and does what it says.  </li>
            <li>The price is right!!!</li>
            <li>I generally trust elf to produce a great product at a great price point, and I&#x27;m definitely super happy with this.</li>
            <li>and it has a flash also in bright light</li>
            <li>To sum up, it’s the best powder I used so far</li>
            <li>This is by far the best value for translucent powders.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was amazing for prime members and I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely, makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>I had never used this kind of powder before, but love that it does not interfere with your make up, or change the color.  </li>
            <li>It does make your skin look really flawless and soft in photos though.  </li>
            <li>This gives me a soft, flawless finish.</li>
            <li>The lure of having flawless skin IS alluring, I know, but your skin is young and fresh and looks great by itself.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly to keep a matte natural finish all day 6 hours without irritation.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your skin feeling velvety smooth... almost slippery but in a good way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just blend</li>
            <li>I think its value-quality relation hits right in the target, It&#x27;s absolutely great.</li>
            <li>and it does the job very quick!</li>
            <li>Very fine powder</li>
            <li>cause this powder is very very fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fine and makes my makeup stay on all day.</li>
            <li>Powder is very fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fine</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this powder!</li>
            <li>Love, love , love this powder!</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this powder!</li>
            <li>I love love love this!</li>
            <li>I love the price of ELF make up products, but what I love more is they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li>I still prefer my Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, but for the price I&#x27;d say this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth</li>
            <li>I have very light skin</li>
            <li>so I already have a somewhat dewy start to my face, but spf is very important</li>
            <li>It offers a beautiful satiny finish that isn&#x27;t too powdery, but still covers nicely.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me shine free for most of the day (and that is a feat!) and sets my concealer and cream shadows and blushes.  </li>
            <li>the powder is fine and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li>If you have good skin and just need light coverage, this is fine.</li>
            <li>and it goes on so natural (I&#x27;m very fair skinned) and</li>
            <li>And it blurs my huge pores too!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite translucent powder.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and goes on clear, and sets nicely.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, so I&#x27;m not as skilled.</li>
            <li>but its ok for me.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to try out finishing powder but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot for something I wasn&#x27;t even sure I would like.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with a light touch over foundation and blush and the effect is quite nice.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Nice n light.fragrance free..</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>It is an ok product.</li>
            <li>So glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>and I love the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then press it and pause to look in a mirror to make sure I haven&#x27;t over applied.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this powder MUCH MORE than tinted powder.</li>
            <li>Kinda white, but kinda awesome moreso.</li>
            <li>I love how this sets my foundation.</li>
            <li>Still, I wanted more and went in search of another container at Target.</li>
            <li>I wish it had better packaging</li>
            <li>I love eyes</li>
            <li>Coverage is okay...</li>
            <li>I love ELF products, I tried this one</li>
            <li>Just sits on top of your skin filling any pores and lines with whiteness.</li>
            <li>I love the powder.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>if you peel the whole inside seal off, the powder has a tendency to fly all over the place.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I think I was expecting more from it</li>
            <li>I was really hoping i was just as pleased all the people that were leaving great reviews on this product and</li>
            <li>it made my skin look sooo smooth!</li>
            <li>I love love love this product</li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>8 more words.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>love this powder.</li>
            <li>I love - love - love these powders.</li>
            <li>(sep 2014) when sold by Amazon when compared to a seller more than a year ago, by almost three bucks.</li>
            <li>I like Elf for mostly everything I have ever purchased make up-wise from them</li>
            <li>It did nothing except make my makeup look more chunky.</li>
            <li>It sets my make up perfectly, and doesn&#x27;t seem as if I have any extra product on at all.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret this purchase, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>2 more words.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best sheer powder I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>I really love this powder.</li>
            <li>I really love this HD powder, I use it to set my foundation</li>
            <li>I WILL BUYING MORE PRODUCTS IN YOUR STORE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>I usually love elf products but there is better powder out there.  </li>
            <li>I will let my mom use this and see if she likes it since her face is more on the oily side.  </li>
            <li>If anyone can advise something better</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The top screws off/on.</li>
            <li>I prefer MAC&#x27;s primer powder of course, but this is an ok alternative.  </li>
            <li>I am going to see if I can find something better.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this powder lasts forever and stays all day:)</li>
            <li>I prefer to use a light dusting with my own kabuki.</li>
            <li>Ok, but too &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;...makes me look like I need oxygen</li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps the vendor has another item I may b able to buy</li>
            <li>I have medium brown skin and I am able to use this, with a kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>I personally love Eyes, Lips and face.</li>
            <li>Everything feels and looks so smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok powder but dosent work wonders.</li>
            <li>just something to keep in mind :)</li>
            <li>If you are planning to get more of their products it might make sense to shop at their site rather than here.  </li>
            <li>If this is the only product you are buying and there are no deals, amazon does have the best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looking forward to buying more elf products.</li>
            <li>even watched videos and professionals (MUAs, entertainment workers) reviews to make sure I&#x27;m doing it &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This really is translucent, and is great for setting foundation and concealer.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product, it makes your skin feel so smooth but sets foundation amazingly.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product is only for fair skinned people lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll experiment with it more and update my review.</li>
            <li>Go to the elf Studio website if this is more then $6.</li>
            <li>Love this powder.</li>
            <li>Will try it some more</li>
            <li>but this is much better then the pressed powder I used to wear.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this powder as a finisher.  </li>
            <li>I love how this sets my makeup.</li>
            <li>ok so you can buy this for 6.00 on the ELF website</li>
            <li>I did not have any kind of reaction from this powder so that is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and my skin feels like silk.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>and it did the job and kept my hair looking healthy-</li>
            <li>I am a nurse and my makeup tends to &#x27;melt&#x27; off most days.</li>
            <li>I apply it on top of a my liquid concealer and powder foundation.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so oil free before!</li>
            <li>Love this powder.  </li>
            <li>Love this powder.  </li>
            <li>is mostly in the container.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t see a thing, so I put on some more...and some more...and some more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love e.l.f products and for me this product is a must have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try a powder brush to see if it works better.</li>
            <li>I really love that I can apply it and not have the caked on look</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it was able to set my makeup</li>
            <li>One of my favorite elf products.</li>
            <li>But, most of all...I&#x27;m not shiny.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s translucent, it can be used by people of many skin tones.</li>
            <li>Add such a great highlight and brightness to the face!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments on my skin since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li>I chose to purchase this, hoping it would appear mostly transparent and not change the color of my liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>because it is so transparent you might be tempted to put more on than you have to-</li>
            <li>LOVE this powder.</li>
            <li>After I mist to set, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>And while I still use it occasionally, I recently purchased two ELF HD powders on Amazon because I am truly impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li>On the ELF website, they charge $6 or $7 for shipping unless you spend more than $25 (and I didn&#x27;t need anything else)</li>
            <li>On the ELF website, they charge $6 or $7 for shipping unless you spend more than $25 (and I didn&#x27;t need anything else)</li>
            <li>It is a great, very affordable powder.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>The top twists off.</li>
            <li>I love the cverage that it gives and i love the fact that i dont have to find a color to match my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>Was using more expansive brand</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice smooth appearance.  </li>
            <li>there was more</li>
            <li>I felt that if I put more than my makeup, I would break out.</li>
            <li>it comes with and PAT don&#x27;t wipe across your face, goes on much better than a brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 :)</li>
            <li>I use this as my top layer over my makeup to help &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love ELF products and do find (like most makeup experiences) that they can be a hit or miss.</li>
            <li>My mac powder cost around 30-40 bucks and this for $6 does a better job.</li>
            <li>I actually really love this powder.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li>I love elf makeup.  </li>
            <li>I used a translucent powder for the first time and really enjoyed its lightweight texture and good shine control.</li>
            <li>lol highly embarrassing.</li>
            <li>It blurs nicely, has a great relationship with my skin (aka, oil control without dry patches), and really does set my makeup beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It really does work amazing!</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and for a whopping four dollars, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>I first tried this powder when it came as a bonus with another purchase, and I immediately loved it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty good price, it has like</li>
            <li>It blends perfectly and keeps my foundation looking matte all day long.</li>
            <li>but it certainly makes it look even more gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Powder is very good quality&lt;br /&gt;Great for stage and prosthetic makeup along with everyday use on fair skin</li>
            <li>(I have to separate that to pass the filter) where this product is originally from and it cost $6!</li>
            <li>I love the fine powder that seems to just disappear onto your skin and leave you looking like you&#x27;re in the perfect lighting all day long.</li>
            <li>ones make my skin look dry but this one is perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite fair so the white color didn&#x27;t matter, but it seems fairly transculent; if your skin is darker, for $3</li>
            <li>it gives you face a nice smooth and oily free look</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s really light, and it does a great job controlling shine and camouflaging large pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>This invisible powder is great for getting rid of shine and leaves my skin feeling soft!  </li>
            <li>Elf is one of my top three favorite cosmetic companies, and face powder is my favorite kind of makeup to use, but I really can&#x27;t say I like this</li>
            <li>but this felt very light and smooth.</li>
            <li>it looks better with a setting spray, and its not as fine as it should be.</li>
            <li>The texture is not as fine as most department store brands and may feel a bit course upon application.</li>
            <li>Covers up for filmmaking very nicely, used in projects all over New England.</li>
            <li>Good price for large quantity</li>
            <li>Very cool looking container and design.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on me (I am very fair though)</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping, would buy again, powder is nice and smooth, gives a photo ready finish, love this product, would deff buy again.</li>
            <li>From what I exlerienced it is a great product so as far as the product goes</li>
            <li>It does not seem to settle in to lines and give any sort of chalky look, but a fresh kind of smoothness.</li>
            <li>Do not use a lot, you don&#x27;t need much to get good</li>
            <li>My got the &amp;#34;Translucent&amp;#34; powder as a gift, I was really looking forward to trying it out because I had heard good things too.</li>
            <li>- I am extremely fair and if I apply too much it does make me look ghostly.</li>
            <li>But if you get the right consistency on your face, it leaves a nice matte</li>
            <li>I liked that I don’t need to worry about getting the right color because there is no color.</li>
            <li>Blends super easy!</li>
            <li>Wish it was a tad stronger, but overall good buy!</li>
            <li>So I am going to use it again, I love the Elf products and so excited to use them.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s easily blended out with some bronzing powder.</li>
            <li>i get shiny easily.</li>
            <li>easy to apply.</li>
            <li>no color was added to my face, blended well easy to use</li>
            <li>This product is so weightless and glides on so easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and has power puff inside.</li>
            <li>i jus buy after a make up tutorial,i dont like the finish,, to sparkly (for me) and the cover comes out easily..</li>
            <li>so I think its not as strong as the makeup forever hd one, but it still works and keeps my concealer from budging.</li>
            <li>It works fine just not as flawless as other powders.</li>
            <li>First off, this is a nicely packaged product and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very finely milled so the powder is super smooth and easy to apply and blend.</li>
            <li>Amazing, makes your makeup look very matte, controls oil and shine!</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how it blended in everything amazingly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fine and easily applied.  </li>
            <li>The ladies&#x27; complexions range from fair to tawny to olive-toned, and it blended perfectly on them all, and my mom only applied it to in select spots, here and there, not to her entire face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I definitely recommend it to women who want to look beautiful.</li>
            <li>To be honest, at first I thought for the price</li>
            <li>The product is not only packaged beautifully but it also works as it should.</li>
            <li>I also did my best friends make up (AA as well and dark skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 and more than aware of my not so fine lines, but this stuff makes my skin look young and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have very fair and dry skin</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>and it marks fine lines instead of disguising them.</li>
            <li>The product does what is says it does, but not super impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>But now that it&#x27;s opened it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Oil control is fine, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d say if you have fine lines under the eye</li>
            <li>does nothing for fine lines or aging skin skin.anything for aging skiskin</li>
            <li>This high-definition powder has turned my skin into a finely painted image in photos.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to apply if you use a brush.</li>
            <li>the powder is so fine</li>
            <li>Like it promises, the ELF powder doesn&#x27;t sink into fine lines.</li>
            <li>Reduces shine and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I use it under my eyes so my fine lines are not noticeable.</li>
            <li>I always hear great things about the Makeup Forever High Definition powder, but it&#x27;s too pricey for me right now, so I tried this</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take very much and goes on very easy.  </li>
            <li>Perfect over foundation and certainly does not appear white on skin!</li>
            <li>Good product a little chalky but over all a good product and price point.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of E.L.F. products - they can be hit or miss</li>
            <li>You definitely need to be sure to blend in all the powder though - otherwise you can see it under bright lights or flashes.</li>
            <li>It also it very affordable for the kind of quality.</li>
            <li>Goes on velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>Great for summer when your makeup becomes a melting pot of different colors..</li>
            <li>Then I lightly press the powder on my nose, cheeks, and forehead, then spread out with the brush.  </li>
            <li>Light and trasparent.</li>
            <li>and I have light complexion</li>
            <li>This is a light, non sparkly power that I use to set my foundation.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so smooth like doll, didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li>makes my skin baby smooth</li>
            <li>I have tried it on and it immediately noticed how light it feels on the skin VS my drug store product.</li>
            <li>It gives the appearance of smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Plus it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;m constantly hearing about how great elf products are,</li>
            <li>I have a light, olive skin tone and this does nothing for it.  </li>
            <li>Great powder especially for the money</li>
            <li>The powder is really light and feels really smooth</li>
            <li>A great purchase, especially for $6!</li>
            <li>I lightly coat my brush when I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried applying heavily, lightly, nothing works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>It was cheap and it&#x27;s been serving it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and matte.</li>
            <li>This keeps my nose and forehead shine free all day.</li>
            <li>Worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li>I read reviews for her, and were reviewers ever justified in their rave reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li>FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth and not looking oily all day.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is great</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a light weight face powder</li>
            <li>It finish my makeup in a smooth feel.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so cheap that I figured i mind as well.  </li>
            <li>When used with a light hand it doesn&#x27;t create a chalky finish</li>
            <li>Thank you E.L.F for making such great product.</li>
            <li>Great for diminishing facial creases!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Light finishing powder.</li>
            <li>This HD face powder provides a smooth &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>However, you should use a light hand with it</li>
            <li>but this is just way too light.</li>
            <li>The thing is it&#x27;s TOO light.</li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>A light touch is required to keep product from settling.</li>
            <li>I do just a light dusting all over my face and then finish with bronzer.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for bringing me such a great product and it was someone else&#x27;s review here that praised it and encouraged me to buy-this</li>
            <li>Its light on the skin and never looks caked on.  </li>
            <li>It is very affordable and applies nicely.</li>
            <li>and it keep you oily free for awhile</li>
            <li>It keeps my cheaper foundation put and gives me a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>If you really don&#x27;t mind buying it from this seller, then yes, this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy it</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin looking flawless without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>Fantastic deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>I use a brush and lightly dust to set my foundation.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a light matte diffuser over a non oil based moisturizer and a titanium dioxide sunscreen.</li>
            <li>made my face smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light - it makes my skin silky smooth for hours.  </li>
            <li>Not fully filled.</li>
            <li>e.l.f. products really impress me...such wonderful quality for such an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>For this powder any suitable brush like flat top powder brush or kabuki is a must, because it is very easy to overdo it with a puff.</li>
            <li>The price is right, though, and I like how well it blends, so I&#x27;ll be buying it again :)</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t to sure about the powder and how it would look on my skin since im light skinned, but after applying it properly it made me look great.</li>
            <li>The product gives you a more gentle look in pictures and provides a bit of shine control so its pretty nice</li>
            <li>It help to keep my makeup clean and make my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li>great setting powder, really makes your foundation look normal</li>
            <li>Application is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Most setting powders now have mineral it which is not great for stage work or even camera as the mineral reflects the light not in the most ideal way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super fine and disguises imperfections well.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t tried many higher end ones</li>
            <li>The puff is really nice and soft and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I was SO excited for this product when I read the reviews.</li>
            <li>Include a small mirror, make the container drop-proof and it would be perfect!</li>
            <li>WARNING:  Not flash friendly.</li>
            <li>The powder is super fine.  </li>
            <li>It works great and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Powder is fine and soft... comes with a nice pouf, too.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and is well worth the low price.</li>
            <li>I only wish that it came in a pressed form, which would be more handy for touch ups.  </li>
            <li>seller is good.. item quality... not so good at least for me</li>
            <li>This is great for pale skinned beauties who don&#x27;t want the orange look of most setting powders.</li>
            <li>The price is extremely reasonable so I am holding out hope that I will eventually find the right technique to produce the amazing results others have reported.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, I like the loose powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great loose powder.</li>
            <li>This loose powder is great.  </li>
            <li>Very light, easy to apply, also leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Very useful keeps my makeup looking fresh and is very useful</li>
            <li>I wish they looked better in low light photos but its absolutely stunning in the day light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no scent, it goes on very smooth, and covers well, and it just makes your face glow and look so much</li>
            <li>This is a good price for the powder compared to many other brands, but it is even cheaper at eyeslipsface.com, where I buy all of my e.l.f.</li>
            <li>i love this product, i have acne prone skin and large pores</li>
            <li>Nothing special, doesn&#x27;t blend.  </li>
            <li>I got this for doing special make-up for halloween.</li>
            <li>The powder is a little abrasive feeling, but the container that it came in is made incredibly well.</li>
            <li>very nice powder, great soft focus, but very messy.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nice, very fine loose powder.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a GREAT setter I feel like it makes my makeup last much longer!</li>
            <li>But the risk of creating a powder cloud in your bathroom is far outweighed by the amazing performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>This powder is completely clear and leaves an amazing matte look to my face.</li>
            <li>The ELF powder sets my makeup beautifully, providing a soft focus finish that looks really natural.  </li>
            <li>This powder helps keep my makeup fresh and face shine free.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good HD powder, definitely try the ELF version!  </li>
            <li>a side note, I also used the ELF Makeup Setting Spray &amp; I found it to be just as good as Urban Decay....</li>
            <li>elf makes good cosmetics and this is no different.</li>
            <li>It seems to give full coverage even though it&#x27;s translucent.</li>
            <li>I really want to be able to find something that will set my face</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say if that&#x27;s true or not.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s quite good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Not cover much but mostly oil control.</li>
            <li>this shimery shine when you take pictures u lighted up more and just dont ware to much tho..</li>
            <li>Makes my face look very even, polished &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>Really helps make your hair not look as greasy and helps it look more presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Freakishly white in container, but works for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Remember that you can always add more, but if you start off with too much</li>
            <li>The price on this product is low, so it seems like a good deal.</li>
            <li>I love this powder and it&#x27;s reasonable price-at six dollars via Amazon</li>
            <li>This powder is definitely a nice way to set your foundation and everything - leaving a clear finish.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any cracks or lines blended or filled, it&#x27;s like a very very very VERY VERY fine soft focus look, a matte finish.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and covers well.nice fine powder really like the package it came in kepps</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m happy &amp; will buy again.</li>
            <li>Studio High Definition Translucent Powder is pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have sometimes added an extra bit of my regular powder over this, and the look is excellent -- makes your pores begin to disappear.</li>
            <li>I put it on after my foundation and it softens up the appearance of my face and makes my skin super velvety to the touch.</li>
            <li>I love most of their products for their affordability and relative quality</li>
            <li>super shiny &amp; makeup stayed on.</li>
            <li>Works perfect, last all day, sheer glow</li>
            <li>However the product disappears quickly during use.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be a cheaper replacement for my Make Up Forever High Definition Powder which I love</li>
            <li>My favorite translucent high definition powder.  </li>
            <li>It does on light and really does make your makeup stay in place all day!</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s important not to use too much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light complected and really knowlegable about makeup, this would not be good on any skin tone its wayyyy to white.</li>
            <li>Ive loved this HD piwder for a long time ..</li>
            <li>It does fly everywhere when you peal of the plastic and tip it upside down on the pad so beware.</li>
            <li>If I get a few grains that are too coarse to adhere to the skin properly, I use the ELF kabuki brush (another excellent buy) to buff off those bits of powder, and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>okay, I live in Las Vegas NV</li>
            <li>People should check it out they have sales ALL the time, great ones, and this product without a sale is literally half this price.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good especially for the price</li>
            <li>it for the first time today, but so far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>If you get too much, on your face it blends easily.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>than that, it keeps my makeup perfect and my pores are far less noticeable.</li>
            <li>When applied properly over my concealer/foundation with my dry beauty blender sponge dupe it does give me a flawless airbrushed face ..</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to give this powder a try since it is so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>dust lightly of concieler and all over face.. very light and def alot of product to last!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of big, so that&#x27;s one of the reasons I don&#x27;t carry it along, but honestly I don&#x27;t need more than one application in the morning on a typical day anyway.</li>
            <li>it is what I would recommend using when you apply the powder to your face, the plush really makes it to where you get the right amount on your skin and when you get too much, it&#x27;s easy to wipe away the excess without smearing the makeup underneath.</li>
            <li>Powerful and hot!</li>
            <li>This powder is great if you&#x27;re a little greasy and already have makeup on and don&#x27;t want to blot or wipe.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very liberal with my usage because it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>I was expecting to receive what I paid for in terms of how cheap it is, but it is a great product that I prefer to my more expensive designer powders.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives my face a photo ready finish that I really enjoy</li>
            <li>I really use is light</li>
            <li>Scent free, really sets makeup, have worn for 16 hr.</li>
            <li>it is translucent and really does not lighten your skin tone, unless you are wearing a foundation that is too light for you.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I lead a very health lifestyle and have a super clean diet</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I use it throughout the day to keep my make up looking fresh and get rid of shine.</li>
            <li>I love the natural looking glow that all the celebs have</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the experiment.</li>
            <li>,i honestly thought that i was guna go back to my oily skin in a matter of time</li>
            <li>While the powder itself is good and did control my oil for several hours(I am very oily in T-zone)</li>
            <li>If you get too much on your brush, you&#x27;ll get a very powdery finish which just highlights your oh so cute peach fuzz hairs on your face.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m more into the dewy, natural look</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily/combo skin, which i don&#x27;t really mind most of the time as I tend to just look dewey.</li>
            <li>My makeup holds all day and looks fresh.</li>
            <li>This one, for the price, is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice sheer powder for finishing off your makeup.</li>
            <li>followed by\\&quot; E.L.F makeup mist &amp; set\\&quot;, for more natural look.</li>
            <li>I no longer believe this powder is worth the price.</li>
            <li>And like I&#x27;ve said, there&#x27;s a lot of product in the ELF container, which makes it doubly economical.  </li>
            <li>I wear a sticky blush which can get kind of gross and smudgy</li>
            <li>WORTH</li>
            <li>It sinks RIGHT into your skin!!!!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s with good skin (only very fine lines &amp; normal</li>
            <li>I think there are some good things about this product, and I&#x27;ll get to those in a minute, but the first thing I&#x27;ll say is that I think it might be better in pressed form where you can control how much you pick up a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally used the puff pad that came with it, it not only wiped some of my foundation/blush off, but it wasn&#x27;t able to blend.</li>
            <li>I have used other face powders before to set my foundation, but this one is definitely one of the best!</li>
            <li>Arrived pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it produces a finish superior to other powders I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and this makes powder right here</li>
            <li>Darned if they weren&#x27;t right on the money.</li>
            <li>right in</li>
            <li>The finishing powder is super light, leaves an awesome finish to my skin, and tones down some of my dark spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll typically do my makeup and put a very, VERY light dusting of this on top (</li>
            <li>VERY translucent, and does exactly what it says - creates a smooth, photo-ready appearance and fills in the shadows caused by bumps and scars on less-than-flawless skin.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and looks very natural on me.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with very large pores.</li>
            <li>like this white kind a lot and will for sure buy the shimmer color next</li>
            <li>My old loose powder didn&#x27;t give me great results like this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous dupe for high end setting powders, and for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than some of the high end high definition powders.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and has not broken out my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>WIll create a huge powder cloud if you&#x27;re not careful, but if you&#x27;re ok with a little Hiroshima for a nice face, you and me can be friends.</li>
            <li>The powder is so fine and silky smooth, if you took the entire sticker off, it would be everywhere.</li>
            <li>It comes white and very finely milled.  </li>
            <li>but it wont last you all day, its very fine powder</li>
            <li>powder is very fine and white.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s invisible, the puff doesn&#x27;t drag off my foundation, and it lasts me nearly the whole day (reapply maybe once o twice to forehead, and I have fairly oily skin!).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s meant to copy, but it&#x27;s still a good alternative if you&#x27;re looking to spend a lot less.</li>
            <li>I would probably only use this e.l.f. powder if I was completely out of my good stuff, but for the price it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it&#x27;s snow white, appears completely translucent when applied.  </li>
            <li>I use a makeup brush straight in the powder and brush off the excess; hence, it goes fast, but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Having to use less is a sign of a good quality product anyways.</li>
            <li>This is the only elf brand product I haven&#x27;t loved so far.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for everyday use as well as for under intense studio lights.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice plain powder, My wife doesn&#x27;t find much difference in her skin as her skin is already smooth and normal .</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have to re-apply during the day, unless it&#x27;s a VERY hot day.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I like this very much.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how it goes after continued usage, but for starters it&#x27;s much finer causing better blending and the color is much more natural as opposed to elf&#x27;s starch white, while retaining what looks like an ability to blend into a variety of skin colors.</li>
            <li>so it goes on your face very gently.</li>
            <li>Also very very drying.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Soft, 100% translucent, inexpensive, just as good as more expensive brands (like MUFE&#x27;s HD setting powder) for a way better price.</li>
            <li>This is very much like it&#x27;s higher priced MF cousin.</li>
            <li>Love all the elf products and this one is no different.</li>
            <li>Elf has a few good products and this is most definitely one of them</li>
            <li>My favorite at the moment, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Actually it is higher here as it costs $6 on their website (eyeslipsface.com).  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s odd is that the description says &amp;#34;masks fine lines&amp;#34; and mine look more prominent after applying this powder, especially my frown lines.  </li>
            <li>I use it to mattify my lipsticks when I wear them and they bleed out to much!</li>
            <li>(I used a Neutrogena liquid foundation first).  </li>
            <li>Love it and had it for a uear already nd still the same since i bought it.</li>
            <li>I only use this as a top coat</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I bought this because so many people said it looked white when applied (it doesn&#x27;t, though I can&#x27;t speak for people with darker skin).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about the lightest shade most cosmetic companies produce and while this didn&#x27;t make me look any paler, it still was very obvious I was wearing powder.</li>
            <li>It fell off the brush pretty often and got everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but the translucent is very white if not applied thoroughly even.</li>
            <li>Let me get my one gripe out of the way first.</li>
            <li>sure enough i was.</li>
            <li>the first couple of times I used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my belief that better ingredients could be used to get a similar result.</li>
            <li>If I see my makeup doesn&#x27;t look entirely together, I can count on this powder to make me look stunning.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my mom, who&#x27;s most recently used Translucide.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s white and that, I think, gives the desired affect but it lightens up makeup maybe more than you may want.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff because the ratings were so stellar</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s a dupe for higher end powders</li>
            <li>I use this after my make up application and it blends everything in finishing the look not cakey very lightweight!</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep the accompanying puff in the container when you close it, especially if you&#x27;re travelling with it!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Got this first on Amazon for $8 before I realized it was cheaper on the elf site.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t sink into my pores and make them look even larger as most powders do.</li>
            <li>[I have acne so my face is never &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;].</li>
            <li>I first started using MAC translucent powder, but when I ran out, I decided to try a less-expensive option.</li>
            <li>My skin looks luminous, feels soft and smooth, and does not break out.</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than the MAC powder I was using.</li>
            <li>I would recommend everyone to try this product out to give you that camera ready look!</li>
            <li>In pictures it looks funny, there is nothing HD about this powder.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the powder I needed.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even notice a difference when I first applied.</li>
            <li>I bought the white powder and love that it just makes my skin look matte.  </li>
            <li>This product is probably more for fairer skinned individuals which I am definitely not, maybe if you blend it well well with a powder brush it will blend</li>
            <li>I was between many different translucent face powders</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an HD finishing powder.</li>
            <li>This is the only translucent powder I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li>I really like this powder!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty minimalist person when it comes to makeup - lots of color or eyeshadow</li>
            <li>and it does not take much!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be looking for more e.l.f. products on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my makeup to go to work</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this, it cost $20 something dollars.</li>
            <li>, just make sure you buff it it properly</li>
            <li>this is my first translucent powder</li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim and found that I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>Both leave my face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>all 3 worsen during the hot, humid summer months.  </li>
            <li>I would say if your thinking of getting the makeup forever, why not try this first.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>If you apply it properly and dust it off correctly you won&#x27;t have an Angelia Jolie moment. :)</li>
            <li>Completely fragrance free.</li>
            <li>However, it works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It really is!</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used translucent powder.</li>
            <li>Sets my makeup really well!</li>
            <li>Love this powder and use it daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for dabbing out shine after a long day, or during mid day.</li>
            <li>and i constantly have to fix my face by blotting and putting more makeup.</li>
            <li>I tried it today and my face lasted the whole day!</li>
            <li>Yeah, you look like a ghost when first applying it, but u need to blend it out.</li>
            <li>But because I put on a layer of sunscreen everyday, it makes me even shinier, so this powder is good for covering that.</li>
            <li>Messy but looks good.</li>
            <li>Even with a brush and a strong fan, it&#x27;s hard to get a nice finish with this powder.</li>
            <li>I was worried about trying a new product because my skin is frustratingly sensitive to many types of make-up.</li>
            <li>Very nice to apply on those days when you&#x27;re feeling lazy and don&#x27;t wanna go through the whole makeup routine.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin, and even the lightest loose powders in many of the drug store brands are too dark for me.  </li>
            <li>I use mac shimmer and urban decay bronzer for contour and was hoping to finish with this loose powder but just wasn&#x27;t happy ...</li>
            <li>The HD Loose Face Powder is nice, that&#x27;s all I really have to say about it.</li>
            <li>is very large and occupies too much space in my make up box.</li>
            <li>Other then that it did a nice job setting my makeup.</li>
            <li>This is a great setting powder for cream/liquid makeup but can leave a white powder residue if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li>but honestly, I&#x27;ve never been more pleased with a product.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with pretty large pores, but this (applied with the Studio Kabuki Face Brush) makes the finish</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to remember a very light touch in application, that&#x27;s definitely the key!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for setting your makeup and keeping you shine free its not that bad for an elf products I would recommend thisits also better if you use a brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so messy, and I wish ELF would put it in a more secure container, because it really is a hassle to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The powder is very light and soft so be careful with the container, a sneeze or a drop could leave you with very little left, it&#x27;s not something you want to tote around too much but don&#x27;t worry, the container is attractive on top of the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found this hi def finishing powder because money became super tight and I could no longer justify purchasing</li>
            <li>After I am done applying all of my makeup, I use a Sigma F30 Large Powder brush to apply this powder.</li>
            <li>it was not  going to give me the full coverage as with any of my other powders, but it actually works better!</li>
            <li>Have been using it for a few years and love it!</li>
            <li>Great other than its pretty messy and can be used up quickly</li>
            <li>Love the product; I just wish there was an easier way to apply the loose powder to the pad instead of turning the makeup over and shaking it out.</li>
            <li>most loose</li>
            <li>but this loose powder is not build able and added nothing to my make regiment.</li>
            <li>I love that this loose powder from e.l.f. is translucent.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get too much on the pad them on your face if you don&#x27;t tap the excess off enough.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m new to makeup and probably not using is right)</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and soft, and stays on for long wear doing heavy activity, giving great coverage.</li>
            <li>Very sheer and fine powder.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll need a tool to remove access settlement under your eye area because for me I noticed it cakes a bit even though I&#x27;ve only begun to get fine lines.</li>
            <li>The packaging is fine, the powder is white.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of the container shape because the product is so fine...</li>
            <li>It worked fine, I only had to reapply when I was walking around a convention for a while and felt my face start to get sweaty.</li>
            <li>It does help control shine and give you that mate look, but at only 29 I feel like it accentuates any fine lines and wrinkles you may have.  </li>
            <li>I think the large issue here is that you can&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for mattifying your face, but I find that after a few hours I need to reapply and I don&#x27;t have oily skin, I still like it more than other high end products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>However, if you have a little bit of time for blending, this can add a nice shimmer for a night out.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any effect other than lightening your face (after all that work applying everything perfectly) and just looking strange overall.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, it&#x27;s so finely milled that it makes the staying power of your foundation last for about 8 to 10 hours for me</li>
            <li>I use pretty high end makeup</li>
            <li>This is my first time using high definition face powder.</li>
            <li>First time trying this or any high def powder.  </li>
            <li>It is about the same price now as the website and both places require you to buy a certain amount in order to get free</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m glad it was so cheap because it is hard to work with and too pigmented.</li>
            <li>my Hard Candy Translucent one was good, but really didn&#x27;t cut it, haha</li>
            <li>and if you are in artificial light all day, you will look great.</li>
            <li>While applying too much can make your face a bit white, a light application is all it takes to set my makeup for the day.  </li>
            <li>I mix it up with my Sheer Cover Settling powder, and it makes a Huge difference when I do it like that.</li>
            <li>After wearing this for an hour my skin became very itchy.</li>
            <li>The product really puts all my makeup together</li>
            <li>I use it under my eyes to set my concealer and it really helps to make it not crease.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work, so I continued to use it for 2 weeks, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t wear much make up</li>
            <li>When you put it on the skin, you will know if you used too much because your face will look like someone threw flour on you.</li>
            <li>Though, the downside of the plush is that it really picks up colors.</li>
            <li>It also reflects light so my skin finally got this glowing look</li>
            <li>Lightly apply the powder to your face after the application of the makeup and it will last all day.  </li>
            <li>The applicator is absolutely rubbish, however.</li>
            <li>, it is going to be much cheaper.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really want to breathe it in).  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>You really do look airbrushed.</li>
            <li>i really asked my self why did i spend all this money on mac powders if this exist</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very translucent.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Got to really rub it in your pores to get it to not look like you spilled flour on your face.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this,  </li>
            <li>Looks very ashy when applied&lt;br</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>I YouTube and this powder is very inexpensive but a lot of people like it.</li>
            <li>Plus it doesn&#x27;t cost much at all.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, You don&#x27;t need to use too much when you use it.</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that you cant really tell if its on your face</li>
            <li>and i already have very oily skin</li>
            <li>If I get tears under my eyes most powders look unnatural and blotchy when wet</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not the case with this elf high definition powder!</li>
            <li>Very lightweight</li>
            <li>but it really brings out a glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I got this on an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; &amp; it really was a steal.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>but this makes my skin really silky and matte.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare),</li>
            <li>(I almost always end up putting too much on).  </li>
            <li>This powder works but don&#x27;t expect a whole lot from it.</li>
            <li>If you use too much of this product, it will make your face look really</li>
            <li>This product arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>for a very natual look</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product on my lips to keep my lipstick in place during the day.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, its a staple in my makeup routine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a  big fan of elf products but this one is tooo light.</li>
            <li>I put it on after my foundation and it did nothing really.</li>
            <li>I tapped as much of the powder off as I could before applying</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to nor want to have to use much makeup</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and this products helps maintain that shine.</li>
            <li>It really adds texture and volume to your roots too.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and every foundation and powder I have ever used</li>
            <li>It really gives your face a glow.</li>
            <li>I really like this powder.</li>
            <li>Very powdering though when putting it on.  </li>
            <li>If I dont, it falls out absolutely everywhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also $6 on the E.L.F. website - the &amp;#34;Vixen&amp;#34; is actually &amp;#34;Shimmer&amp;#34; there - with, also, free shipping on orders over $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my face ridiculously white in the light</li>
            <li>/&gt;For beginners:&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t really need this powder if you don&#x27;t really need foundation.</li>
            <li>Didnt like it that much</li>
            <li>This stuff really does make your face seem almost blurred/photoshopped.</li>
            <li>I also like the ELF lip exfoiliator, which works really well and contains sugar granules.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, the Amazon Prime price was the same as Target with free shipping too.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I really like this product and like the makeup guru whose review I saw, I heartily recommend it.essary.  </li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a difference with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a difference when I use it really.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it much going to buy one at target</li>
            <li>i have a VERY oily face.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Probably too much for everyday (office) use, but it would be nice for going out.  </li>
            <li>Nice consistency, but makes me look too pale,</li>
            <li>This particular powder is just as good if not better than the higher end brands I&#x27;ve tried and offers a much lower price tag.</li>
            <li>Its really hot where i live</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently seen ELF High Definition Powder all over Pinterest &amp; in a few beauty blogs claiming it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>If you shake some powder into the lid, it is great to use with a stipple brush and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It successfully stops the product from billowing into the air and getting all over the place, but white powder in a plastic baggy does look a little sketchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>drying my normal skin!</li>
            <li>But with the other products I use, it seems to help control most of the oiliness that breaks through by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool for that, and it doesn&#x27;t make you all white looking even though the powder is white, however, you can very distinctly see the powder on you in pictures taken with flash.</li>
            <li>Great product from ELF, but you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li>(I use several layers of products), gives me a nice even texture and stays all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really comparable to a high priced setting powder, for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than MUFE&#x27;s high def powder but works just as well.</li>
            <li>The day after I wore this powder for the first time, I went right back to Target to buy the remaining 3 they had on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>I love high definition powder and ordered this one when my other brand was out of stock.  </li>
            <li>I am just amazed at how e.l.f. can produce such wonderful finishing powder (and other make up items) for half the price.</li>
            <li>This is way better than any other powder I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>use a large fluffy powder brush, swirl it in the container, and make sure i tap the brush handle on my wrist or the edge of the counter before applying</li>
            <li>The trick is to use a large soft brush and blend very thoroughly</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the product and it&#x27;ll make your face feel very soft after make up application</li>
            <li>This made my face look a bit dry, albeit quite smooth.</li>
            <li>I am a Black woman and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Better than some more expensive translucent powders.</li>
            <li>This powder is pretty much exactly the same thing as Makeup Forever&#x27;s HD powder but at a 1/4 of the price!</li>
            <li>It kept my skin from looking shiny during the day, which was my main goal.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my main gripe.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look too heavy and ghost-like (I have fairly tan skin) and seems to make my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li>It sets my foundation or tinted moisturizer, which is the main reason why I bought it.</li>
            <li>Was able to find on Amazon [more expensive..</li>
            <li>I can only use Alabaster foundation and most brands only come in Ivory.</li>
            <li>My skin in photos definitely has a better overall tone to it and it helps set my bronzer and blushes.</li>
            <li>It comes off quickly (for me anyway), and it is very sheer.</li>
            <li>This finishing powder gives my skin such a soft smooth look and feel.  </li>
            <li>Really like it so far!</li>
            <li>Studio High Definition</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see any high def.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this powder.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have the mac high definition powder translucent and I prefer to wear this one.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY reccomend.</li>
            <li>I havent got alot of experience w/ HD powder, but after reading alot of reviews on other powders, this one does not leave your face looking pale, it didnt break out my super sensitive skin, and I believe it was a good addition to my make-up routine.</li>
            <li>This product is inferior, the powder is not as fine, so it shows up whiter on the skin and is harder to apply, meaning it gets all over the place, on my clothes, eyebrows, countertop...  </li>
            <li>When getting it in the mail, it came in a little box that looked like I&#x27;d bought it out of a store.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love all babyliss hair care products including the blue flat iron!</li>
            <li>It DOES feel a little chalky, but since it does what I need it too, I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>I like the finish and the price especially if you compare with the higher end brands!</li>
            <li>It does have a slight &#x27;blurring&#x27; effect but heed caution: it is easy to apply too much.</li>
            <li>It always works really well as a quick dry shampoo for bangs also.</li>
            <li>However, especially considering the price, I think it&#x27;s a decent product and worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>It smells sooo good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already super super pale, so...</li>
            <li>However, I also live in a humid climate and produce oil mainly in the t-zone throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily cheeks, so I try to direct the product there.</li>
            <li>I really like this Face Powder because as soon as you put it on you can feel the face so soft  </li>
            <li>Really gives the blurry soft focus you want.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s only to prevent from having to touch up later and its so light weight that I don&#x27;t ever worry about adding to much.</li>
            <li>I have used this 1 or 2 times so far over BB cream, I have very oily and shiny skin</li>
            <li>I am not sure how it will look on darker skin, but for me the translucent powder is pretty epic, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I order it again I will transfer small amounts to another container for my daily use and then refill that container as needed to keep the full size safely tucked</li>
            <li>Messy (more so than</li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s a useful setting powder, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if for use all over the face.</li>
            <li>so I probably wont end up taking it with me on a normal day to day basis.</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep the sticker on the sifter-just poke a few holes with a needle.</li>
            <li>I think if you have normal skin or oily skin</li>
            <li>I rarely spend money on extras like this as I am in nursing school and don&#x27;t have much extra cash for trivial things like makeup.</li>
            <li>I Love ELF products, they are quality products at an unbelievable, ridiculously reasonable value.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to keep it on any longer than normal either.</li>
            <li>I love appying a little right under my eyebrows it totally opens up my eyes.</li>
            <li>the price of the Dermablend Original loose powder I have used.  </li>
            <li>Even though the power isn&#x27;t quite as finely grained as those other brands, I keep using this one.  </li>
            <li>Finally a setting powder that doesn&#x27;t make my face look dry and cakey :)</li>
            <li>However, I am absolutely amazed at how many people are purchasing this product from sites other than eyes lips face actual Web site.  </li>
            <li>Makeup can only do so much right?</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of E.L.F cosmetics and got this right when it came out</li>
            <li>looks garish on me - and the sheer provides just the right touch to soften</li>
            <li>This has an awesome long lasting effect and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have additionally mixed this with Bare Minerals original Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li>I love this loose powder and will definitely be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li>its not good but not bad, its cheap and works decent until i buy a new.</li>
            <li>They often have deals for free shipping or other deals that can make shipping a non-issue and the end price cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used this kind of powder before, so was worried this would make me look a little paler than I already am, or make my make-up look different.</li>
            <li>The price, as always with E.L.F. is very reasonable The powder is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t i also us it for my dark skin clients to set in their high light because it don&#x27;t make them look ghostly</li>
            <li>so decided to try something new when i started using this</li>
            <li>but after trying this, I am a new fan of setting powder.</li>
            <li>I do live in a humid area</li>
            <li>grate price for what it said it is and look forward to working with it in my new makeup trunk.</li>
            <li>this stuff makes your face very smooth and also fills in small pores to give you a even skin surface without caking on the concealer or foundation</li>
            <li>The packaging is a bit big and clunky to carry around, however the actual product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is very transparent, but also very pigmented at the same time, (if that makes sense).</li>
            <li>Cute little screwtop case looks chic on my makeup table too!</li>
            <li>I had been paying a much heftier price for Bare Minerals mineral veil and this works just as well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clear, so it doesn&#x27;t make it look like I have makeup caked on when I&#x27;m using this powder to set it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin...a lot of things aggravate it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for busy people like my wife, who works 18 hours days.  </li>
            <li>Very professional product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and don&#x27;t seem to have any reactions to this product.  </li>
            <li>I have a medium brown complexion and have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have medium dark skin, and this powder does NOT make my skin look overly light</li>
            <li>It makes you shine like a star, yet not excessively.</li>
            <li>Just bought one today from makeup forever and tried both work exactly the same! 😍</li>
            <li>Tricky to open, at first.</li>
            <li>If you love other expensive HD powders you&#x27;ll love this one!</li>
            <li>However, it is translucent, so I&#x27;ve been able to use it on several different people with diverse skintones and it&#x27;s worked for everyone from me, with my vampire-white skin, to my friend Melissa, who has deep chocolate brown skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, let me be honest: The container that it comes in is not good.  </li>
            <li>It erases pores and shine and it looks so natural!</li>
            <li>the first day I tried this I didn&#x27;t see the big deal.</li>
            <li>apply with a soft powder brush, not the puff that comes with it or a kabuki brush!</li>
            <li>This is the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, both products perform the exact same way.  </li>
            <li>I would swear that the MUF and ELF powders have exactly the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised that e.l.f. products work as well as they do for how inexpensive they are!  </li>
            <li>The white powder is very, very fine and creates quite the mess.</li>
            <li>My favorite loose powder for years has been Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, but because I&#x27;m on a budget, I really can&#x27;t shell out 20 bucks a month on 1 single beauty product.</li>
            <li>Looks kind of weird when first applied.  </li>
            <li>-since I live in FL I am very conscious of protecting my skin from the sun and must apply a layer of SPF-60 over my facial moisturizer and then  foundation---alot of trouble--however, my task is easier thanks to how well this powder sets my make-up</li>
            <li>It is just as good if not better than the more expensive HD powders on the market.</li>
            <li>WOW other reviews were right!</li>
            <li>This is a very inexpensive loose face powder and works very well.  </li>
            <li>The little powder puff isn&#x27;t one of those cheap ones that I always throw out.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried lightly sweeping it on with a big loose brush and buffing it in with a dense kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>The puff applicator is big and soft but I would like to get more on it instead of the little spots the container releases.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and this powder works very well with a kabuki brush or a large powder brush to buff on the face to set foundation and powder, it makes my skin look and feel silky soft</li>
            <li>I love it, only downfall is that it&#x27;s extremely messy they could of done the packaging much better, this powder is finely milled so it comes out like crazy</li>
            <li>It does go on clear and also matte.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear,</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s clear and no smell.  </li>
            <li>It has been working out so far.</li>
            <li>and this makes my face so soft and matte.</li>
            <li>I do not reccomend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The powder is white, but very sheer/translucent when on your face.  </li>
            <li>any rate, this is probably not something I would buy very often, and I may look for a similar product in a pressed form instead.  </li>
            <li>Also, I got through the product really fast, in only a couple of months, whereas pressed powder sometimes lasts for a year.</li>
            <li>Because if your going for a natural look and you go out in the sun , forget it.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>But overall, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I was worried this would look like white powder on my face, because that&#x27;s what it looks like in the container, but it really does go on translucent.</li>
            <li>I also use it for touch ups throughout the day .. 4 stars only because it does give a flashback in photos IF you use too much of it</li>
            <li>It absorbs oil and is soft to the touch when over foundation.</li>
            <li>Too light and fluffy</li>
            <li>The key is you really just need know where and how to put it.</li>
            <li>, all my old one did was make my face look cakey.</li>
            <li>It highlights my skin and makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>The puff that comes with it definitely gives you way too much product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend skipping the puff that comes with it for a soft all over face brush.  </li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and this has never made me break out.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s completely matte...</li>
            <li>It also aids in blending my contouring thus giving it a natural effect.</li>
            <li>This powder mattifies my face and makes my skin feel soft without looking cakey.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel silky soft and make my foundation look natural and blended in.</li>
            <li>only real downside I would give this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not thrilled with the given brush (for lack of a better term).</li>
            <li>covers well but is not heavy on the face.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It makes my face look soft and it feels soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used E.L.F. Products before, but I will be exploring further thanks to this powder.</li>
            <li>Wow do I like this stuff...</li>
            <li>I bought this to set my concealer under my eyes, it always left my skin with a really grainy finish.</li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>and her skin looks and feel soft.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, it may also make you appear white as a geisha girl.</li>
            <li>The ELF product contains powdered silicone and silica and causes no irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate oily skin.</li>
            <li>This powder gives the soft focus that takes away the look of lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but really good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value for the price, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, not super special.</li>
            <li>I like the packaging and the amount of product is generous, but the powder is too light and makes me look pale.  </li>
            <li>I opened to see very little loose powder in the container and unsealing it made tons of powder fly into the air even when opening carefully.</li>
            <li>A little of this product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect all day coverage if you have very oily skin (which I do), but with one or two touch ups during the day, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I have very difficult skin.. dry, oily, you name it and this ended up being a great powder for me!</li>
            <li>and I drowned my face in moisturizer right after.  </li>
            <li>Totally takes the oil off your face, actually does its job when you rub it in, but make sure you check your whole face before you put your mirror down, or your husband might think you had white powder doughnuts and didn&#x27;t get any for him.</li>
            <li>I imagine it would go on a lot better with the kabuki brush, though, and a little powder does go a long way to &amp;</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used loose powder.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with other high definition products and the finish looks really refined and professional.</li>
            <li>Actually comes with a decent powder puff thing</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed that my pores looked smaller, I hadn&#x27;t oil skin all day and, is possibly when you used it can feel as if you had applied baby powder.</li>
            <li>make sure you only use a small amount-</li>
            <li>All in all, a fabulous little powder from E.L.F!</li>
            <li>Same ingredients and performance as the high end brands.  </li>
            <li>The only real complaint I have is the powder can get everywhere if you&#x27;re not careful, but honestly with a powder you can&#x27;t really avoid that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is like a high quality mineral powder without any color (even though it is white).  </li>
            <li>I am a mess -  a really oily t-zone, large pores and the beginnings of rosacea and</li>
            <li>Not very happy right now...I barely got to enjoy this lroduct because the product was so damaged when I recieved it that there was barely any left in the container.</li>
            <li>i do wish the opening was smaller and that once you take off the lid if you aren&#x27;t super careful it will all spill out</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been using a more expensive version of this product, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the finishing touch that both sets my makeup and erases any last traces of those annoying imperfections while giving a wonderful soft focus effect.  </li>
            <li>Does cause a little bit of a white cast in flash photography but other than its a nice setting powder.</li>
            <li>I only used a little and it made my skin look smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s translucent, but it does make my face appear a little white in photos; it also makes my skin look smooth in pictures.</li>
            <li>Super long lasting, and it doesn&#x27;t make your face look white!</li>
            <li>I have grown accustomed to a certain level a qaulity from ELF but this loose powder misses the mark.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this product for several months and was using a new container every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I really prefer a big brush for powder, but since I already had one, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American, caramel complexion, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>but I only put up with the mess because its worth it!</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely awful and if the reviews are as good as most people feel about it, then I must have recieved a faulty product.  </li>
            <li>So, a little of this goes a long way, and it tends to become airborne quite easily</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very soft feeling and provides an extra finishing touch to my make up routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, and have yet to further search exactly how to apply it and use it, but I still really like it.</li>
            <li>The next morning I used it to set my mousse foundation, and WOW!</li>
            <li>And I barely have to use any!</li>
            <li>Only use a soft powder brush!</li>
            <li>My old powder would feel heavy and make my skin itch almost right away</li>
            <li>Loose Face Powder is an absolute must to try.</li>
            <li>&amp; it was only half way full.</li>
            <li>and it is extremely fine and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>This powder wears well it&#x27;s light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The milling on the powder isn&#x27;t quite up to the same standard of some of the high end brands.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this powder, especially for the low price.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to put too much on</li>
            <li>and I won it early last year!</li>
            <li>I also have bare minerals</li>
            <li>It starts to look cakey very quickly, so be careful that you&#x27;re not applying too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bare minerals mineral veil ADDICT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched back to my old powder.</li>
            <li>Helps make my makeup last longer and gives me a soft matte finish.  </li>
            <li>It blends in seamlessly and helps my makeup last all day.</li>
            <li>I use the ELF powder over Armani Luminous foundation or Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>Bare Skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a combination skin type, your pretty typical t-zone oily and mostly normal to dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li>elf Studio High Definition Loose Face Powder]]  </li>
            <li>Using this powder sparingly, I have gotten the same smooth results as I did with the more expensive brand, and feel like this may even last longer because I&#x27;m using less of the product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep the &amp;#34;filter cap&amp;#34; on this powder because it isn&#x27;t a tight enough seal and just falls out when I try to shake more powder into the lid creating a mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very lightweight, though that might be because it was hard to apply much with it falling off everywhere.</li>
            <li>I recently switched back to my Almay loose powder and realized how much better the coverage is and how much longer each container is lasting - at least twice as long.</li>
            <li>If applied over still wet foundation, it is possible to apply too much, which can make you look washed out.</li>
            <li>At $6 I figured it&#x27;s worth a shot since it wouldn&#x27;t be a big waste (which I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING).</li>
            <li>I slather on thick moisturizers in the winter and after I dusted this on my face, all I noticed was clean, healthy-looking skin.</li>
            <li>The positive review on Amazon was written by a black woman.</li>
            <li>I put it on a medium sized, fluffy powder brush and applied it to the area right above my cheek bones where I always put a highlighter.</li>
            <li>The canister is bigger than I had expected but makes it much easier to get my bigger, fluffier brush into.</li>
            <li>This product gives you very sheer barely there matte coverage.</li>
            <li>First of all, I put on spf everyday, and</li>
            <li>I only used a very small amount and mainly put it in places where my face wasn&#x27;t super dry</li>
            <li>actually did help covering up a few healing blemishes (I&#x27;d used concealer on them first).  </li>
            <li>Instead of this I use the Elf Setting Spray mist and it makes my makeup natural and last a very long time.</li>
            <li>another quality I did not care for so much as it was an odd texture..very silky but very obviously there</li>
            <li>Very high quality product for so little money.</li>
            <li>First, I am a ghost in a play and have used this to set my Snazaroo face paint (white, black, metallic grey, blue).  </li>
            <li>If you add too much you could look a little washed out</li>
            <li>I have severely dry skin in my t-zone, my cheeks are moderately dry and the rest of my face is normal.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the little powder puff thing.  </li>
            <li>In steps Amazon to offer it to me for a little more than I paid at the store but at least I was finally going to have it</li>

            <li> oh so nice!</li>
            <li> Quite nice !</li>
            <li> This powder sets it all in the most flawless finish I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> Going to give it three stars because from what I&#x27;ve experienced it really isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> Most amazing powder ever!!!</li>
            <li> This product makes you look like you have the most perfect complexion, like a photograph that has been photo-shopped.</li>
            <li> Wonderful silky texture and a huge pot of it!</li>
            <li> Loving it!</li>
            <li> Great product and I can&#x27;t wait to use more products from e.l.f.!</li>
            <li> It has light-diffusing particles that made my fine lines disappear and made my skin look perfect.  </li>
            <li> but it is so fine and sets my makeup perfectly.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my makeup flawless for hours and doesn&#x27;t settle into any fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Skin looks bright and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is a good one, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> This is not as good as the MAKE UP FOR EVER HD powder</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> At any price, this is a good cosmetic.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> This powder is every bit as good as M*A*C* at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> But after I blended, it looked good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Good option for those on a budget.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my engagement and wedding pictures and I loved how it made me look for my engagement pictures</li>
            <li> It does the strangest thing on the face and does not look good at all.  </li>
            <li> A good product compared to the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great, good amount of product, and it has great coverage, love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> it is so good</li>
            <li> My skin is on the fair side.</li>
            <li> Item was everything I wanted and correct color, feels good on face and does what it was suppose to and look like.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s good for photo shoots, (</li>
            <li> This is a good dupe for Makeup Forever&#x27;s HD powder.</li>
            <li> This is especially true if you&#x27;re going to be taking pictures with flash, because an excess of powder will show up in your photos.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product and packaging itself is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thought it would be good for a powder cover.</li>
            <li> but it was a good buy to add to my makeup collection</li>
            <li> I think that this is good for all skin complexions and types.</li>
            <li> It has good coverage and has a matte look on the skin</li>
            <li> this works surprisingly good for an Elf product..</li>
            <li> So it is a good translucent powder.</li>
            <li> and so are all fair colored powders, they all turn me orange.</li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> It is also good just by itself</li>
            <li> Good powder.</li>
            <li> Had to give it 4 stars because of the texture/ appearance it leaves given its&#x27; nature, but it is a great product and when used to give &amp;#34;high definition&amp;#34;-gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is good.</li>
            <li> but this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> Good size also so gt alot for my money.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and use the translucent color.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting a somewhat good product</li>
            <li> This powder is just as good as the (HD-MAKE UP FOREVER), BUT CHEAPER.</li>
            <li> I do still use the powder and get good use out of it.</li>
            <li> In the end, I would recommend this product if your looking for a good finishing powder on a budget.</li>
            <li> Goes on very easily and makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> Most products are $1 to $3.00 and others are a great price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got what I wanted so very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased</li>
            <li> Nice powder, good color.</li>

            <li> to fix the container and make it more spill proof!</li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say the best features first is the matte finish</li>
            <li> but I do love the puff, I kept that!</li>
            <li> Love !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;funeral home finish&amp;#34;, but I was more like can you say, &amp;#34;red carpet ready&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth finish and beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder!</li>
            <li> I love this powder!  </li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> My favorite ELF product!</li>
            <li> I love this powder!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
            <li> i would buy this again and again it is amazing ontop of your foundation its lovely must buy!</li>
            <li> Really sets your foundation!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> But this product made my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li> does amazing tricks on the skin.</li>
            <li> looks light but works great</li>
            <li> Great at minimizing shine as a light coverage over foundation.</li>
            <li> This is great to smooth out a finished face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all of the amazing reviews on MakeUpAlley.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no pigment to this powder, but the effect is amazing</li>
            <li> This powder is so amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> gives u a nice finished look</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Elf is really nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> and I liked it</li>
            <li> it does somewhat deal the makeup to a nice finish, so for me</li>
            <li> honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this unless you&#x27;ve already tried it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice powder to set concealer, I&#x27;m using this with a synthetic brush to set my make-up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the powder puff, nice product though.</li>
            <li> It works perfect for very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Photos look much better and that&#x27;s always a good thing.</li>
            <li> The pouf is a nice addition for when I am in a hurry or need to take it with me.</li>
            <li> The product arrived, and I really liked the container it came in.  </li>
            <li> I own this product</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of wearing a matte nail polish.  </li>
            <li> and this may make it a teensy bit lighter, but it does give a really nice finish.  </li>
            <li> but I think it sets my makeup nicely.</li>
            <li> and this gives me a nice, matte look and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice powder.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a nice matte finish and makes makeup stay in place.</li>
            <li> It works really well and always gives me a flawless look.</li>
            <li> Packaging is nice and price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice, too.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and leaves a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li> It sets my makeup wonderfully and really polishes off my look.  </li>
            <li> It does make a nice difference of the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> This one is really nice and helps the application go on</li>
            <li> Nice amount.. nice package.</li>
            <li> make sure you apply in front of a mirror that has good lighting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice too if you find you&#x27;ve &amp;</li>
            <li> Really highlights and creates a flawless look</li>
            <li> It minimizes my pores and creates a nice finish evening out my skin tone as well</li>
            <li> I really liked this powder and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Fairly pleased and fair price.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li> Great combination and totally worth the $6 for each item!</li>
            <li> I use this mainly when I have photo shoots because it sets my makeup and keeps my face looking flawless even after a couple hours of shooting.</li>
            <li> Instead, I use it as a finishing powder, just a light application to seal in my makeup after I&#x27;ve finished everything and, for that purpose, it is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Love how it catches the light &amp; does great when your taking pictures.</li>
            <li> Cruelty free products are great and I commend elf for being better than the rest for this.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, affordable, and does what it says.  </li>
            <li> The price is right!!!</li>
            <li> I generally trust elf to produce a great product at a great price point, and I&#x27;m definitely super happy with this.</li>
            <li> and it has a flash also in bright light</li>
            <li> To sum up, it’s the best powder I used so far</li>
            <li> This is by far the best value for translucent powders.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was amazing for prime members and I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> I had never used this kind of powder before, but love that it does not interfere with your make up, or change the color.  </li>
            <li> It does make your skin look really flawless and soft in photos though.  </li>
            <li> This gives me a soft, flawless finish.</li>
            <li> The lure of having flawless skin IS alluring, I know, but your skin is young and fresh and looks great by itself.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly to keep a matte natural finish all day 6 hours without irritation.</li>
            <li> It also leaves your skin feeling velvety smooth... almost slippery but in a good way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just blend</li>
            <li> I think its value-quality relation hits right in the target, It&#x27;s absolutely great.</li>
            <li> and it does the job very quick!</li>
            <li> Very fine powder</li>
            <li> cause this powder is very very fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fine and makes my makeup stay on all day.</li>
            <li> Powder is very fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fine</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this powder!</li>
            <li> Love, love , love this powder!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this powder!</li>
            <li> I love love love this!</li>
            <li> I love the price of ELF make up products, but what I love more is they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> I still prefer my Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, but for the price I&#x27;d say this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth</li>
            <li> I have very light skin</li>
            <li> so I already have a somewhat dewy start to my face, but spf is very important</li>
            <li> It offers a beautiful satiny finish that isn&#x27;t too powdery, but still covers nicely.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me shine free for most of the day (and that is a feat!) and sets my concealer and cream shadows and blushes.  </li>
            <li> the powder is fine and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li> If you have good skin and just need light coverage, this is fine.</li>
            <li> and it goes on so natural (I&#x27;m very fair skinned) and</li>
            <li> And it blurs my huge pores too!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite translucent powder.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and goes on clear, and sets nicely.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, so I&#x27;m not as skilled.</li>
            <li> but its ok for me.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try out finishing powder but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot for something I wasn&#x27;t even sure I would like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with a light touch over foundation and blush and the effect is quite nice.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Nice n light.fragrance free..</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> It is an ok product.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> and I love the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then press it and pause to look in a mirror to make sure I haven&#x27;t over applied.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this powder MUCH MORE than tinted powder.</li>
            <li> Kinda white, but kinda awesome moreso.</li>
            <li> I love how this sets my foundation.</li>
            <li> Still, I wanted more and went in search of another container at Target.</li>
            <li> I wish it had better packaging</li>
            <li> I love eyes</li>
            <li> Coverage is okay...</li>
            <li> I love ELF products, I tried this one</li>
            <li> Just sits on top of your skin filling any pores and lines with whiteness.</li>
            <li> I love the powder.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> if you peel the whole inside seal off, the powder has a tendency to fly all over the place.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting more from it</li>
            <li> I was really hoping i was just as pleased all the people that were leaving great reviews on this product and</li>
            <li> it made my skin look sooo smooth!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product</li>
            <li> It is OK.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> 8 more words.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> love this powder.</li>
            <li> I love - love - love these powders.</li>
            <li> (sep 2014) when sold by Amazon when compared to a seller more than a year ago, by almost three bucks.</li>
            <li> I like Elf for mostly everything I have ever purchased make up-wise from them</li>
            <li> It did nothing except make my makeup look more chunky.</li>
            <li> It sets my make up perfectly, and doesn&#x27;t seem as if I have any extra product on at all.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret this purchase, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> 2 more words.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best sheer powder I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> I really love this powder.</li>
            <li> I really love this HD powder, I use it to set my foundation</li>
            <li> I WILL BUYING MORE PRODUCTS IN YOUR STORE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> I usually love elf products but there is better powder out there.  </li>
            <li> I will let my mom use this and see if she likes it since her face is more on the oily side.  </li>
            <li> If anyone can advise something better</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> The top screws off/on.</li>
            <li> I prefer MAC&#x27;s primer powder of course, but this is an ok alternative.  </li>
            <li> I am going to see if I can find something better.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this powder lasts forever and stays all day:)</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a light dusting with my own kabuki.</li>
            <li> Ok, but too &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;...makes me look like I need oxygen</li>
            <li> and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps the vendor has another item I may b able to buy</li>
            <li> I have medium brown skin and I am able to use this, with a kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> I personally love Eyes, Lips and face.</li>
            <li> Everything feels and looks so smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok powder but dosent work wonders.</li>
            <li> just something to keep in mind :)</li>
            <li> If you are planning to get more of their products it might make sense to shop at their site rather than here.  </li>
            <li> If this is the only product you are buying and there are no deals, amazon does have the best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looking forward to buying more elf products.</li>
            <li> even watched videos and professionals (MUAs, entertainment workers) reviews to make sure I&#x27;m doing it &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This really is translucent, and is great for setting foundation and concealer.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this product, it makes your skin feel so smooth but sets foundation amazingly.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product is only for fair skinned people lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll experiment with it more and update my review.</li>
            <li> Go to the elf Studio website if this is more then $6.</li>
            <li> Love this powder.</li>
            <li> Will try it some more</li>
            <li> but this is much better then the pressed powder I used to wear.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder as a finisher.  </li>
            <li> I love how this sets my makeup.</li>
            <li> ok so you can buy this for 6.00 on the ELF website</li>
            <li> I did not have any kind of reaction from this powder so that is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and my skin feels like silk.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> and it did the job and kept my hair looking healthy-</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and my makeup tends to &#x27;melt&#x27; off most days.</li>
            <li> I apply it on top of a my liquid concealer and powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> so oil free before!</li>
            <li> Love this powder.  </li>
            <li> Love this powder.  </li>
            <li> is mostly in the container.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see a thing, so I put on some more...and some more...and some more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love e.l.f products and for me this product is a must have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try a powder brush to see if it works better.</li>
            <li> I really love that I can apply it and not have the caked on look</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it was able to set my makeup</li>
            <li> One of my favorite elf products.</li>
            <li> But, most of all...I&#x27;m not shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s translucent, it can be used by people of many skin tones.</li>
            <li> Add such a great highlight and brightness to the face!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments on my skin since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li> I chose to purchase this, hoping it would appear mostly transparent and not change the color of my liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> because it is so transparent you might be tempted to put more on than you have to-</li>
            <li> LOVE this powder.</li>
            <li> After I mist to set, it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> And while I still use it occasionally, I recently purchased two ELF HD powders on Amazon because I am truly impressed with the product.  </li>
            <li> On the ELF website, they charge $6 or $7 for shipping unless you spend more than $25 (and I didn&#x27;t need anything else)</li>
            <li> On the ELF website, they charge $6 or $7 for shipping unless you spend more than $25 (and I didn&#x27;t need anything else)</li>
            <li> It is a great, very affordable powder.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> The top twists off.</li>
            <li> I love the cverage that it gives and i love the fact that i dont have to find a color to match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> Was using more expansive brand</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice smooth appearance.  </li>
            <li> there was more</li>
            <li> I felt that if I put more than my makeup, I would break out.</li>
            <li> it comes with and PAT don&#x27;t wipe across your face, goes on much better than a brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 :)</li>
            <li> I use this as my top layer over my makeup to help &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love ELF products and do find (like most makeup experiences) that they can be a hit or miss.</li>
            <li> My mac powder cost around 30-40 bucks and this for $6 does a better job.</li>
            <li> I actually really love this powder.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> I love elf makeup.  </li>
            <li> I used a translucent powder for the first time and really enjoyed its lightweight texture and good shine control.</li>
            <li> lol highly embarrassing.</li>
            <li> It blurs nicely, has a great relationship with my skin (aka, oil control without dry patches), and really does set my makeup beautifully.  </li>
            <li> It really does work amazing!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and for a whopping four dollars, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I first tried this powder when it came as a bonus with another purchase, and I immediately loved it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty good price, it has like</li>
            <li> It blends perfectly and keeps my foundation looking matte all day long.</li>
            <li> but it certainly makes it look even more gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Powder is very good quality&lt;br /&gt;Great for stage and prosthetic makeup along with everyday use on fair skin</li>
            <li> (I have to separate that to pass the filter) where this product is originally from and it cost $6!</li>
            <li> I love the fine powder that seems to just disappear onto your skin and leave you looking like you&#x27;re in the perfect lighting all day long.</li>
            <li> ones make my skin look dry but this one is perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite fair so the white color didn&#x27;t matter, but it seems fairly transculent; if your skin is darker, for $3</li>
            <li> it gives you face a nice smooth and oily free look</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s really light, and it does a great job controlling shine and camouflaging large pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li> This invisible powder is great for getting rid of shine and leaves my skin feeling soft!  </li>
            <li> Elf is one of my top three favorite cosmetic companies, and face powder is my favorite kind of makeup to use, but I really can&#x27;t say I like this</li>
            <li> but this felt very light and smooth.</li>
            <li> it looks better with a setting spray, and its not as fine as it should be.</li>
            <li> The texture is not as fine as most department store brands and may feel a bit course upon application.</li>
            <li> Covers up for filmmaking very nicely, used in projects all over New England.</li>
            <li> Good price for large quantity</li>
            <li> Very cool looking container and design.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on me (I am very fair though)</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, would buy again, powder is nice and smooth, gives a photo ready finish, love this product, would deff buy again.</li>
            <li> From what I exlerienced it is a great product so as far as the product goes</li>
            <li> It does not seem to settle in to lines and give any sort of chalky look, but a fresh kind of smoothness.</li>
            <li> Do not use a lot, you don&#x27;t need much to get good</li>
            <li> My got the &amp;#34;Translucent&amp;#34; powder as a gift, I was really looking forward to trying it out because I had heard good things too.</li>
            <li> - I am extremely fair and if I apply too much it does make me look ghostly.</li>
            <li> But if you get the right consistency on your face, it leaves a nice matte</li>
            <li> I liked that I don’t need to worry about getting the right color because there is no color.</li>
            <li> Blends super easy!</li>
            <li> Wish it was a tad stronger, but overall good buy!</li>
            <li> So I am going to use it again, I love the Elf products and so excited to use them.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s easily blended out with some bronzing powder.</li>
            <li> i get shiny easily.</li>
            <li> easy to apply.</li>
            <li> no color was added to my face, blended well easy to use</li>
            <li> This product is so weightless and glides on so easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and has power puff inside.</li>
            <li> i jus buy after a make up tutorial,i dont like the finish,, to sparkly (for me) and the cover comes out easily..</li>
            <li> so I think its not as strong as the makeup forever hd one, but it still works and keeps my concealer from budging.</li>
            <li> It works fine just not as flawless as other powders.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a nicely packaged product and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very finely milled so the powder is super smooth and easy to apply and blend.</li>
            <li> Amazing, makes your makeup look very matte, controls oil and shine!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how it blended in everything amazingly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fine and easily applied.  </li>
            <li> The ladies&#x27; complexions range from fair to tawny to olive-toned, and it blended perfectly on them all, and my mom only applied it to in select spots, here and there, not to her entire face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I definitely recommend it to women who want to look beautiful.</li>
            <li> To be honest, at first I thought for the price</li>
            <li> The product is not only packaged beautifully but it also works as it should.</li>
            <li> I also did my best friends make up (AA as well and dark skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 and more than aware of my not so fine lines, but this stuff makes my skin look young and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and dry skin</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> and it marks fine lines instead of disguising them.</li>
            <li> The product does what is says it does, but not super impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> But now that it&#x27;s opened it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Oil control is fine, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d say if you have fine lines under the eye</li>
            <li> does nothing for fine lines or aging skin skin.anything for aging skiskin</li>
            <li> This high-definition powder has turned my skin into a finely painted image in photos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easy to apply if you use a brush.</li>
            <li> the powder is so fine</li>
            <li> Like it promises, the ELF powder doesn&#x27;t sink into fine lines.</li>
            <li> Reduces shine and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I use it under my eyes so my fine lines are not noticeable.</li>
            <li> I always hear great things about the Makeup Forever High Definition powder, but it&#x27;s too pricey for me right now, so I tried this</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take very much and goes on very easy.  </li>
            <li> Perfect over foundation and certainly does not appear white on skin!</li>
            <li> Good product a little chalky but over all a good product and price point.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of E.L.F. products - they can be hit or miss</li>
            <li> You definitely need to be sure to blend in all the powder though - otherwise you can see it under bright lights or flashes.</li>
            <li> It also it very affordable for the kind of quality.</li>
            <li> Goes on velvety smooth.</li>
            <li> Great for summer when your makeup becomes a melting pot of different colors..</li>
            <li> Then I lightly press the powder on my nose, cheeks, and forehead, then spread out with the brush.  </li>
            <li> Light and trasparent.</li>
            <li> and I have light complexion</li>
            <li> This is a light, non sparkly power that I use to set my foundation.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth like doll, didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li> makes my skin baby smooth</li>
            <li> I have tried it on and it immediately noticed how light it feels on the skin VS my drug store product.</li>
            <li> It gives the appearance of smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Plus it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m constantly hearing about how great elf products are,</li>
            <li> I have a light, olive skin tone and this does nothing for it.  </li>
            <li> Great powder especially for the money</li>
            <li> The powder is really light and feels really smooth</li>
            <li> A great purchase, especially for $6!</li>
            <li> I lightly coat my brush when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying heavily, lightly, nothing works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> It was cheap and it&#x27;s been serving it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and matte.</li>
            <li> This keeps my nose and forehead shine free all day.</li>
            <li> Worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li> I read reviews for her, and were reviewers ever justified in their rave reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li> FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and not looking oily all day.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is great</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a light weight face powder</li>
            <li> It finish my makeup in a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so cheap that I figured i mind as well.  </li>
            <li> When used with a light hand it doesn&#x27;t create a chalky finish</li>
            <li> Thank you E.L.F for making such great product.</li>
            <li> Great for diminishing facial creases!</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Light finishing powder.</li>
            <li> This HD face powder provides a smooth &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> However, you should use a light hand with it</li>
            <li> but this is just way too light.</li>
            <li> The thing is it&#x27;s TOO light.</li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> A light touch is required to keep product from settling.</li>
            <li> I do just a light dusting all over my face and then finish with bronzer.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for bringing me such a great product and it was someone else&#x27;s review here that praised it and encouraged me to buy-this</li>
            <li> Its light on the skin and never looks caked on.  </li>
            <li> It is very affordable and applies nicely.</li>
            <li> and it keep you oily free for awhile</li>
            <li> It keeps my cheaper foundation put and gives me a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> If you really don&#x27;t mind buying it from this seller, then yes, this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy it</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin looking flawless without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal for the price.  </li>
            <li> I use a brush and lightly dust to set my foundation.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a light matte diffuser over a non oil based moisturizer and a titanium dioxide sunscreen.</li>
            <li> made my face smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light - it makes my skin silky smooth for hours.  </li>
            <li> Not fully filled.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. products really impress me...such wonderful quality for such an affordable price.  </li>
            <li> For this powder any suitable brush like flat top powder brush or kabuki is a must, because it is very easy to overdo it with a puff.</li>
            <li> The price is right, though, and I like how well it blends, so I&#x27;ll be buying it again :)</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t to sure about the powder and how it would look on my skin since im light skinned, but after applying it properly it made me look great.</li>
            <li> The product gives you a more gentle look in pictures and provides a bit of shine control so its pretty nice</li>
            <li> It help to keep my makeup clean and make my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li> great setting powder, really makes your foundation look normal</li>
            <li> Application is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Most setting powders now have mineral it which is not great for stage work or even camera as the mineral reflects the light not in the most ideal way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super fine and disguises imperfections well.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t tried many higher end ones</li>
            <li> The puff is really nice and soft and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was SO excited for this product when I read the reviews.</li>
            <li> Include a small mirror, make the container drop-proof and it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> WARNING:  Not flash friendly.</li>
            <li> The powder is super fine.  </li>
            <li> It works great and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Powder is fine and soft... comes with a nice pouf, too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is well worth the low price.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it came in a pressed form, which would be more handy for touch ups.  </li>
            <li> seller is good.. item quality... not so good at least for me</li>
            <li> This is great for pale skinned beauties who don&#x27;t want the orange look of most setting powders.</li>
            <li> The price is extremely reasonable so I am holding out hope that I will eventually find the right technique to produce the amazing results others have reported.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, I like the loose powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great loose powder.</li>
            <li> This loose powder is great.  </li>
            <li> Very light, easy to apply, also leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Very useful keeps my makeup looking fresh and is very useful</li>
            <li> I wish they looked better in low light photos but its absolutely stunning in the day light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no scent, it goes on very smooth, and covers well, and it just makes your face glow and look so much</li>
            <li> This is a good price for the powder compared to many other brands, but it is even cheaper at eyeslipsface.com, where I buy all of my e.l.f.</li>
            <li> i love this product, i have acne prone skin and large pores</li>
            <li> Nothing special, doesn&#x27;t blend.  </li>
            <li> I got this for doing special make-up for halloween.</li>
            <li> The powder is a little abrasive feeling, but the container that it came in is made incredibly well.</li>
            <li> very nice powder, great soft focus, but very messy.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nice, very fine loose powder.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a GREAT setter I feel like it makes my makeup last much longer!</li>
            <li> But the risk of creating a powder cloud in your bathroom is far outweighed by the amazing performance of this product.  </li>
            <li> This powder is completely clear and leaves an amazing matte look to my face.</li>
            <li> The ELF powder sets my makeup beautifully, providing a soft focus finish that looks really natural.  </li>
            <li> This powder helps keep my makeup fresh and face shine free.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good HD powder, definitely try the ELF version!  </li>
            <li> a side note, I also used the ELF Makeup Setting Spray &amp; I found it to be just as good as Urban Decay....</li>
            <li> elf makes good cosmetics and this is no different.</li>
            <li> It seems to give full coverage even though it&#x27;s translucent.</li>
            <li> I really want to be able to find something that will set my face</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say if that&#x27;s true or not.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Not cover much but mostly oil control.</li>
            <li> this shimery shine when you take pictures u lighted up more and just dont ware to much tho..</li>
            <li> Makes my face look very even, polished &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> Really helps make your hair not look as greasy and helps it look more presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Freakishly white in container, but works for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Remember that you can always add more, but if you start off with too much</li>
            <li> The price on this product is low, so it seems like a good deal.</li>
            <li> I love this powder and it&#x27;s reasonable price-at six dollars via Amazon</li>
            <li> This powder is definitely a nice way to set your foundation and everything - leaving a clear finish.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any cracks or lines blended or filled, it&#x27;s like a very very very VERY VERY fine soft focus look, a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and covers well.nice fine powder really like the package it came in kepps</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m happy &amp; will buy again.</li>
            <li> Studio High Definition Translucent Powder is pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have sometimes added an extra bit of my regular powder over this, and the look is excellent -- makes your pores begin to disappear.</li>
            <li> I put it on after my foundation and it softens up the appearance of my face and makes my skin super velvety to the touch.</li>
            <li> I love most of their products for their affordability and relative quality</li>
            <li> super shiny &amp; makeup stayed on.</li>
            <li> Works perfect, last all day, sheer glow</li>
            <li> However the product disappears quickly during use.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be a cheaper replacement for my Make Up Forever High Definition Powder which I love</li>
            <li> My favorite translucent high definition powder.  </li>
            <li> It does on light and really does make your makeup stay in place all day!</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s important not to use too much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light complected and really knowlegable about makeup, this would not be good on any skin tone its wayyyy to white.</li>
            <li> Ive loved this HD piwder for a long time ..</li>
            <li> It does fly everywhere when you peal of the plastic and tip it upside down on the pad so beware.</li>
            <li> If I get a few grains that are too coarse to adhere to the skin properly, I use the ELF kabuki brush (another excellent buy) to buff off those bits of powder, and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> okay, I live in Las Vegas NV</li>
            <li> People should check it out they have sales ALL the time, great ones, and this product without a sale is literally half this price.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good especially for the price</li>
            <li> it for the first time today, but so far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> If you get too much, on your face it blends easily.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> than that, it keeps my makeup perfect and my pores are far less noticeable.</li>
            <li> When applied properly over my concealer/foundation with my dry beauty blender sponge dupe it does give me a flawless airbrushed face ..</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to give this powder a try since it is so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> dust lightly of concieler and all over face.. very light and def alot of product to last!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of big, so that&#x27;s one of the reasons I don&#x27;t carry it along, but honestly I don&#x27;t need more than one application in the morning on a typical day anyway.</li>
            <li> it is what I would recommend using when you apply the powder to your face, the plush really makes it to where you get the right amount on your skin and when you get too much, it&#x27;s easy to wipe away the excess without smearing the makeup underneath.</li>
            <li> Powerful and hot!</li>
            <li> This powder is great if you&#x27;re a little greasy and already have makeup on and don&#x27;t want to blot or wipe.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very liberal with my usage because it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> I was expecting to receive what I paid for in terms of how cheap it is, but it is a great product that I prefer to my more expensive designer powders.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives my face a photo ready finish that I really enjoy</li>
            <li> I really use is light</li>
            <li> Scent free, really sets makeup, have worn for 16 hr.</li>
            <li> it is translucent and really does not lighten your skin tone, unless you are wearing a foundation that is too light for you.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I lead a very health lifestyle and have a super clean diet</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use it throughout the day to keep my make up looking fresh and get rid of shine.</li>
            <li> I love the natural looking glow that all the celebs have</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the experiment.</li>
            <li> ,i honestly thought that i was guna go back to my oily skin in a matter of time</li>
            <li> While the powder itself is good and did control my oil for several hours(I am very oily in T-zone)</li>
            <li> If you get too much on your brush, you&#x27;ll get a very powdery finish which just highlights your oh so cute peach fuzz hairs on your face.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m more into the dewy, natural look</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily/combo skin, which i don&#x27;t really mind most of the time as I tend to just look dewey.</li>
            <li> My makeup holds all day and looks fresh.</li>
            <li> This one, for the price, is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sheer powder for finishing off your makeup.</li>
            <li> followed by\\&quot; E.L.F makeup mist &amp; set\\&quot;, for more natural look.</li>
            <li> I no longer believe this powder is worth the price.</li>
            <li> And like I&#x27;ve said, there&#x27;s a lot of product in the ELF container, which makes it doubly economical.  </li>
            <li> I wear a sticky blush which can get kind of gross and smudgy</li>
            <li> WORTH</li>
            <li> It sinks RIGHT into your skin!!!!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s with good skin (only very fine lines &amp; normal</li>
            <li> I think there are some good things about this product, and I&#x27;ll get to those in a minute, but the first thing I&#x27;ll say is that I think it might be better in pressed form where you can control how much you pick up a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally used the puff pad that came with it, it not only wiped some of my foundation/blush off, but it wasn&#x27;t able to blend.</li>
            <li> I have used other face powders before to set my foundation, but this one is definitely one of the best!</li>
            <li> Arrived pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it produces a finish superior to other powders I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and this makes powder right here</li>
            <li> Darned if they weren&#x27;t right on the money.</li>
            <li> right in</li>
            <li> The finishing powder is super light, leaves an awesome finish to my skin, and tones down some of my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll typically do my makeup and put a very, VERY light dusting of this on top (</li>
            <li> VERY translucent, and does exactly what it says - creates a smooth, photo-ready appearance and fills in the shadows caused by bumps and scars on less-than-flawless skin.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and looks very natural on me.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with very large pores.</li>
            <li> like this white kind a lot and will for sure buy the shimmer color next</li>
            <li> My old loose powder didn&#x27;t give me great results like this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous dupe for high end setting powders, and for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better than some of the high end high definition powders.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and has not broken out my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> WIll create a huge powder cloud if you&#x27;re not careful, but if you&#x27;re ok with a little Hiroshima for a nice face, you and me can be friends.</li>
            <li> The powder is so fine and silky smooth, if you took the entire sticker off, it would be everywhere.</li>
            <li> It comes white and very finely milled.  </li>
            <li> but it wont last you all day, its very fine powder</li>
            <li> powder is very fine and white.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s invisible, the puff doesn&#x27;t drag off my foundation, and it lasts me nearly the whole day (reapply maybe once o twice to forehead, and I have fairly oily skin!).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s meant to copy, but it&#x27;s still a good alternative if you&#x27;re looking to spend a lot less.</li>
            <li> I would probably only use this e.l.f. powder if I was completely out of my good stuff, but for the price it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it&#x27;s snow white, appears completely translucent when applied.  </li>
            <li> I use a makeup brush straight in the powder and brush off the excess; hence, it goes fast, but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Having to use less is a sign of a good quality product anyways.</li>
            <li> This is the only elf brand product I haven&#x27;t loved so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for everyday use as well as for under intense studio lights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice plain powder, My wife doesn&#x27;t find much difference in her skin as her skin is already smooth and normal .</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have to re-apply during the day, unless it&#x27;s a VERY hot day.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I like this very much.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it goes after continued usage, but for starters it&#x27;s much finer causing better blending and the color is much more natural as opposed to elf&#x27;s starch white, while retaining what looks like an ability to blend into a variety of skin colors.</li>
            <li> so it goes on your face very gently.</li>
            <li> Also very very drying.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Soft, 100% translucent, inexpensive, just as good as more expensive brands (like MUFE&#x27;s HD setting powder) for a way better price.</li>
            <li> This is very much like it&#x27;s higher priced MF cousin.</li>
            <li> Love all the elf products and this one is no different.</li>
            <li> Elf has a few good products and this is most definitely one of them</li>
            <li> My favorite at the moment, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Actually it is higher here as it costs $6 on their website (eyeslipsface.com).  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s odd is that the description says &amp;#34;masks fine lines&amp;#34; and mine look more prominent after applying this powder, especially my frown lines.  </li>
            <li> I use it to mattify my lipsticks when I wear them and they bleed out to much!</li>
            <li> (I used a Neutrogena liquid foundation first).  </li>
            <li> Love it and had it for a uear already nd still the same since i bought it.</li>
            <li> I only use this as a top coat</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I bought this because so many people said it looked white when applied (it doesn&#x27;t, though I can&#x27;t speak for people with darker skin).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about the lightest shade most cosmetic companies produce and while this didn&#x27;t make me look any paler, it still was very obvious I was wearing powder.</li>
            <li> It fell off the brush pretty often and got everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but the translucent is very white if not applied thoroughly even.</li>
            <li> Let me get my one gripe out of the way first.</li>
            <li> sure enough i was.</li>
            <li> the first couple of times I used it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is my belief that better ingredients could be used to get a similar result.</li>
            <li> If I see my makeup doesn&#x27;t look entirely together, I can count on this powder to make me look stunning.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom, who&#x27;s most recently used Translucide.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white and that, I think, gives the desired affect but it lightens up makeup maybe more than you may want.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because the ratings were so stellar</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s a dupe for higher end powders</li>
            <li> I use this after my make up application and it blends everything in finishing the look not cakey very lightweight!</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep the accompanying puff in the container when you close it, especially if you&#x27;re travelling with it!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Got this first on Amazon for $8 before I realized it was cheaper on the elf site.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t sink into my pores and make them look even larger as most powders do.</li>
            <li> [I have acne so my face is never &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;].</li>
            <li> I first started using MAC translucent powder, but when I ran out, I decided to try a less-expensive option.</li>
            <li> My skin looks luminous, feels soft and smooth, and does not break out.</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than the MAC powder I was using.</li>
            <li> I would recommend everyone to try this product out to give you that camera ready look!</li>
            <li> In pictures it looks funny, there is nothing HD about this powder.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the powder I needed.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even notice a difference when I first applied.</li>
            <li> I bought the white powder and love that it just makes my skin look matte.  </li>
            <li> This product is probably more for fairer skinned individuals which I am definitely not, maybe if you blend it well well with a powder brush it will blend</li>
            <li> I was between many different translucent face powders</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an HD finishing powder.</li>
            <li> This is the only translucent powder I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty minimalist person when it comes to makeup - lots of color or eyeshadow</li>
            <li> and it does not take much!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be looking for more e.l.f. products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my makeup to go to work</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this, it cost $20 something dollars.</li>
            <li> , just make sure you buff it it properly</li>
            <li> this is my first translucent powder</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim and found that I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> Both leave my face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> all 3 worsen during the hot, humid summer months.  </li>
            <li> I would say if your thinking of getting the makeup forever, why not try this first.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> If you apply it properly and dust it off correctly you won&#x27;t have an Angelia Jolie moment. :)</li>
            <li> Completely fragrance free.</li>
            <li> However, it works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It really is!</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used translucent powder.</li>
            <li> Sets my makeup really well!</li>
            <li> Love this powder and use it daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for dabbing out shine after a long day, or during mid day.</li>
            <li> and i constantly have to fix my face by blotting and putting more makeup.</li>
            <li> I tried it today and my face lasted the whole day!</li>
            <li> Yeah, you look like a ghost when first applying it, but u need to blend it out.</li>
            <li> But because I put on a layer of sunscreen everyday, it makes me even shinier, so this powder is good for covering that.</li>
            <li> Messy but looks good.</li>
            <li> Even with a brush and a strong fan, it&#x27;s hard to get a nice finish with this powder.</li>
            <li> I was worried about trying a new product because my skin is frustratingly sensitive to many types of make-up.</li>
            <li> Very nice to apply on those days when you&#x27;re feeling lazy and don&#x27;t wanna go through the whole makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin, and even the lightest loose powders in many of the drug store brands are too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> I use mac shimmer and urban decay bronzer for contour and was hoping to finish with this loose powder but just wasn&#x27;t happy ...</li>
            <li> The HD Loose Face Powder is nice, that&#x27;s all I really have to say about it.</li>
            <li> is very large and occupies too much space in my make up box.</li>
            <li> Other then that it did a nice job setting my makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a great setting powder for cream/liquid makeup but can leave a white powder residue if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> but honestly, I&#x27;ve never been more pleased with a product.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with pretty large pores, but this (applied with the Studio Kabuki Face Brush) makes the finish</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to remember a very light touch in application, that&#x27;s definitely the key!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for setting your makeup and keeping you shine free its not that bad for an elf products I would recommend thisits also better if you use a brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so messy, and I wish ELF would put it in a more secure container, because it really is a hassle to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The powder is very light and soft so be careful with the container, a sneeze or a drop could leave you with very little left, it&#x27;s not something you want to tote around too much but don&#x27;t worry, the container is attractive on top of the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found this hi def finishing powder because money became super tight and I could no longer justify purchasing</li>
            <li> After I am done applying all of my makeup, I use a Sigma F30 Large Powder brush to apply this powder.</li>
            <li> it was not  going to give me the full coverage as with any of my other powders, but it actually works better!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few years and love it!</li>
            <li> Great other than its pretty messy and can be used up quickly</li>
            <li> Love the product; I just wish there was an easier way to apply the loose powder to the pad instead of turning the makeup over and shaking it out.</li>
            <li> most loose</li>
            <li> but this loose powder is not build able and added nothing to my make regiment.</li>
            <li> I love that this loose powder from e.l.f. is translucent.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to get too much on the pad them on your face if you don&#x27;t tap the excess off enough.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m new to makeup and probably not using is right)</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and soft, and stays on for long wear doing heavy activity, giving great coverage.</li>
            <li> Very sheer and fine powder.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need a tool to remove access settlement under your eye area because for me I noticed it cakes a bit even though I&#x27;ve only begun to get fine lines.</li>
            <li> The packaging is fine, the powder is white.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the container shape because the product is so fine...</li>
            <li> It worked fine, I only had to reapply when I was walking around a convention for a while and felt my face start to get sweaty.</li>
            <li> It does help control shine and give you that mate look, but at only 29 I feel like it accentuates any fine lines and wrinkles you may have.  </li>
            <li> I think the large issue here is that you can&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for mattifying your face, but I find that after a few hours I need to reapply and I don&#x27;t have oily skin, I still like it more than other high end products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> However, if you have a little bit of time for blending, this can add a nice shimmer for a night out.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any effect other than lightening your face (after all that work applying everything perfectly) and just looking strange overall.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, it&#x27;s so finely milled that it makes the staying power of your foundation last for about 8 to 10 hours for me</li>
            <li> I use pretty high end makeup</li>
            <li> This is my first time using high definition face powder.</li>
            <li> First time trying this or any high def powder.  </li>
            <li> It is about the same price now as the website and both places require you to buy a certain amount in order to get free</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m glad it was so cheap because it is hard to work with and too pigmented.</li>
            <li> my Hard Candy Translucent one was good, but really didn&#x27;t cut it, haha</li>
            <li> and if you are in artificial light all day, you will look great.</li>
            <li> While applying too much can make your face a bit white, a light application is all it takes to set my makeup for the day.  </li>
            <li> I mix it up with my Sheer Cover Settling powder, and it makes a Huge difference when I do it like that.</li>
            <li> After wearing this for an hour my skin became very itchy.</li>
            <li> The product really puts all my makeup together</li>
            <li> I use it under my eyes to set my concealer and it really helps to make it not crease.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work, so I continued to use it for 2 weeks, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t wear much make up</li>
            <li> When you put it on the skin, you will know if you used too much because your face will look like someone threw flour on you.</li>
            <li> Though, the downside of the plush is that it really picks up colors.</li>
            <li> It also reflects light so my skin finally got this glowing look</li>
            <li> Lightly apply the powder to your face after the application of the makeup and it will last all day.  </li>
            <li> The applicator is absolutely rubbish, however.</li>
            <li> , it is going to be much cheaper.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t really want to breathe it in).  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> You really do look airbrushed.</li>
            <li> i really asked my self why did i spend all this money on mac powders if this exist</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very translucent.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Got to really rub it in your pores to get it to not look like you spilled flour on your face.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this,  </li>
            <li> Looks very ashy when applied&lt;br</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I YouTube and this powder is very inexpensive but a lot of people like it.</li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t cost much at all.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, You don&#x27;t need to use too much when you use it.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that you cant really tell if its on your face</li>
            <li> and i already have very oily skin</li>
            <li> If I get tears under my eyes most powders look unnatural and blotchy when wet</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not the case with this elf high definition powder!</li>
            <li> Very lightweight</li>
            <li> but it really brings out a glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.  </li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I got this on an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; &amp; it really was a steal.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> but this makes my skin really silky and matte.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare),</li>
            <li> (I almost always end up putting too much on).  </li>
            <li> This powder works but don&#x27;t expect a whole lot from it.</li>
            <li> If you use too much of this product, it will make your face look really</li>
            <li> This product arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> for a very natual look</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product on my lips to keep my lipstick in place during the day.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, its a staple in my makeup routine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a  big fan of elf products but this one is tooo light.</li>
            <li> I put it on after my foundation and it did nothing really.</li>
            <li> I tapped as much of the powder off as I could before applying</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to nor want to have to use much makeup</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this products helps maintain that shine.</li>
            <li> It really adds texture and volume to your roots too.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and every foundation and powder I have ever used</li>
            <li> It really gives your face a glow.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder.</li>
            <li> Very powdering though when putting it on.  </li>
            <li> If I dont, it falls out absolutely everywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also $6 on the E.L.F. website - the &amp;#34;Vixen&amp;#34; is actually &amp;#34;Shimmer&amp;#34; there - with, also, free shipping on orders over $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my face ridiculously white in the light</li>
            <li> /&gt;For beginners:&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t really need this powder if you don&#x27;t really need foundation.</li>
            <li> Didnt like it that much</li>
            <li> This stuff really does make your face seem almost blurred/photoshopped.</li>
            <li> I also like the ELF lip exfoiliator, which works really well and contains sugar granules.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, the Amazon Prime price was the same as Target with free shipping too.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I really like this product and like the makeup guru whose review I saw, I heartily recommend it.essary.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference when I use it really.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it much going to buy one at target</li>
            <li> i have a VERY oily face.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Probably too much for everyday (office) use, but it would be nice for going out.  </li>
            <li> Nice consistency, but makes me look too pale,</li>
            <li> This particular powder is just as good if not better than the higher end brands I&#x27;ve tried and offers a much lower price tag.</li>
            <li> Its really hot where i live</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently seen ELF High Definition Powder all over Pinterest &amp; in a few beauty blogs claiming it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> If you shake some powder into the lid, it is great to use with a stipple brush and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It successfully stops the product from billowing into the air and getting all over the place, but white powder in a plastic baggy does look a little sketchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> drying my normal skin!</li>
            <li> But with the other products I use, it seems to help control most of the oiliness that breaks through by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool for that, and it doesn&#x27;t make you all white looking even though the powder is white, however, you can very distinctly see the powder on you in pictures taken with flash.</li>
            <li> Great product from ELF, but you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> (I use several layers of products), gives me a nice even texture and stays all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really comparable to a high priced setting powder, for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than MUFE&#x27;s high def powder but works just as well.</li>
            <li> The day after I wore this powder for the first time, I went right back to Target to buy the remaining 3 they had on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> I love high definition powder and ordered this one when my other brand was out of stock.  </li>
            <li> I am just amazed at how e.l.f. can produce such wonderful finishing powder (and other make up items) for half the price.</li>
            <li> This is way better than any other powder I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> use a large fluffy powder brush, swirl it in the container, and make sure i tap the brush handle on my wrist or the edge of the counter before applying</li>
            <li> The trick is to use a large soft brush and blend very thoroughly</li>
            <li> Other than that I love the product and it&#x27;ll make your face feel very soft after make up application</li>
            <li> This made my face look a bit dry, albeit quite smooth.</li>
            <li> I am a Black woman and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Better than some more expensive translucent powders.</li>
            <li> This powder is pretty much exactly the same thing as Makeup Forever&#x27;s HD powder but at a 1/4 of the price!</li>
            <li> It kept my skin from looking shiny during the day, which was my main goal.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my main gripe.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look too heavy and ghost-like (I have fairly tan skin) and seems to make my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> It sets my foundation or tinted moisturizer, which is the main reason why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Was able to find on Amazon [more expensive..</li>
            <li> I can only use Alabaster foundation and most brands only come in Ivory.</li>
            <li> My skin in photos definitely has a better overall tone to it and it helps set my bronzer and blushes.</li>
            <li> It comes off quickly (for me anyway), and it is very sheer.</li>
            <li> This finishing powder gives my skin such a soft smooth look and feel.  </li>
            <li> Really like it so far!</li>
            <li> Studio High Definition</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any high def.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this powder.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have the mac high definition powder translucent and I prefer to wear this one.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY reccomend.</li>
            <li> I havent got alot of experience w/ HD powder, but after reading alot of reviews on other powders, this one does not leave your face looking pale, it didnt break out my super sensitive skin, and I believe it was a good addition to my make-up routine.</li>
            <li> This product is inferior, the powder is not as fine, so it shows up whiter on the skin and is harder to apply, meaning it gets all over the place, on my clothes, eyebrows, countertop...  </li>
            <li> When getting it in the mail, it came in a little box that looked like I&#x27;d bought it out of a store.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is lovely.</li>
            <li> I love all babyliss hair care products including the blue flat iron!</li>
            <li> It DOES feel a little chalky, but since it does what I need it too, I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> I like the finish and the price especially if you compare with the higher end brands!</li>
            <li> It does have a slight &#x27;blurring&#x27; effect but heed caution: it is easy to apply too much.</li>
            <li> It always works really well as a quick dry shampoo for bangs also.</li>
            <li> However, especially considering the price, I think it&#x27;s a decent product and worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> It smells sooo good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already super super pale, so...</li>
            <li> However, I also live in a humid climate and produce oil mainly in the t-zone throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily cheeks, so I try to direct the product there.</li>
            <li> I really like this Face Powder because as soon as you put it on you can feel the face so soft  </li>
            <li> Really gives the blurry soft focus you want.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only to prevent from having to touch up later and its so light weight that I don&#x27;t ever worry about adding to much.</li>
            <li> I have used this 1 or 2 times so far over BB cream, I have very oily and shiny skin</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it will look on darker skin, but for me the translucent powder is pretty epic, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I order it again I will transfer small amounts to another container for my daily use and then refill that container as needed to keep the full size safely tucked</li>
            <li> Messy (more so than</li>
            <li> I definitely think it&#x27;s a useful setting powder, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if for use all over the face.</li>
            <li> so I probably wont end up taking it with me on a normal day to day basis.</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep the sticker on the sifter-just poke a few holes with a needle.</li>
            <li> I think if you have normal skin or oily skin</li>
            <li> I rarely spend money on extras like this as I am in nursing school and don&#x27;t have much extra cash for trivial things like makeup.</li>
            <li> I Love ELF products, they are quality products at an unbelievable, ridiculously reasonable value.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to keep it on any longer than normal either.</li>
            <li> I love appying a little right under my eyebrows it totally opens up my eyes.</li>
            <li> the price of the Dermablend Original loose powder I have used.  </li>
            <li> Even though the power isn&#x27;t quite as finely grained as those other brands, I keep using this one.  </li>
            <li> Finally a setting powder that doesn&#x27;t make my face look dry and cakey :)</li>
            <li> However, I am absolutely amazed at how many people are purchasing this product from sites other than eyes lips face actual Web site.  </li>
            <li> Makeup can only do so much right?</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of E.L.F cosmetics and got this right when it came out</li>
            <li> looks garish on me - and the sheer provides just the right touch to soften</li>
            <li> This has an awesome long lasting effect and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have additionally mixed this with Bare Minerals original Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li> I love this loose powder and will definitely be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> its not good but not bad, its cheap and works decent until i buy a new.</li>
            <li> They often have deals for free shipping or other deals that can make shipping a non-issue and the end price cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this kind of powder before, so was worried this would make me look a little paler than I already am, or make my make-up look different.</li>
            <li> The price, as always with E.L.F. is very reasonable The powder is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t i also us it for my dark skin clients to set in their high light because it don&#x27;t make them look ghostly</li>
            <li> so decided to try something new when i started using this</li>
            <li> but after trying this, I am a new fan of setting powder.</li>
            <li> I do live in a humid area</li>
            <li> grate price for what it said it is and look forward to working with it in my new makeup trunk.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes your face very smooth and also fills in small pores to give you a even skin surface without caking on the concealer or foundation</li>
            <li> The packaging is a bit big and clunky to carry around, however the actual product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is very transparent, but also very pigmented at the same time, (if that makes sense).</li>
            <li> Cute little screwtop case looks chic on my makeup table too!</li>
            <li> I had been paying a much heftier price for Bare Minerals mineral veil and this works just as well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clear, so it doesn&#x27;t make it look like I have makeup caked on when I&#x27;m using this powder to set it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin...a lot of things aggravate it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for busy people like my wife, who works 18 hours days.  </li>
            <li> Very professional product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and don&#x27;t seem to have any reactions to this product.  </li>
            <li> I have a medium brown complexion and have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have medium dark skin, and this powder does NOT make my skin look overly light</li>
            <li> It makes you shine like a star, yet not excessively.</li>
            <li> Just bought one today from makeup forever and tried both work exactly the same! 😍</li>
            <li> Tricky to open, at first.</li>
            <li> If you love other expensive HD powders you&#x27;ll love this one!</li>
            <li> However, it is translucent, so I&#x27;ve been able to use it on several different people with diverse skintones and it&#x27;s worked for everyone from me, with my vampire-white skin, to my friend Melissa, who has deep chocolate brown skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, let me be honest: The container that it comes in is not good.  </li>
            <li> It erases pores and shine and it looks so natural!</li>
            <li> the first day I tried this I didn&#x27;t see the big deal.</li>
            <li> apply with a soft powder brush, not the puff that comes with it or a kabuki brush!</li>
            <li> This is the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, both products perform the exact same way.  </li>
            <li> I would swear that the MUF and ELF powders have exactly the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised that e.l.f. products work as well as they do for how inexpensive they are!  </li>
            <li> The white powder is very, very fine and creates quite the mess.</li>
            <li> My favorite loose powder for years has been Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, but because I&#x27;m on a budget, I really can&#x27;t shell out 20 bucks a month on 1 single beauty product.</li>
            <li> Looks kind of weird when first applied.  </li>
            <li> -since I live in FL I am very conscious of protecting my skin from the sun and must apply a layer of SPF-60 over my facial moisturizer and then  foundation---alot of trouble--however, my task is easier thanks to how well this powder sets my make-up</li>
            <li> It is just as good if not better than the more expensive HD powders on the market.</li>
            <li> WOW other reviews were right!</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive loose face powder and works very well.  </li>
            <li> The little powder puff isn&#x27;t one of those cheap ones that I always throw out.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried lightly sweeping it on with a big loose brush and buffing it in with a dense kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> The puff applicator is big and soft but I would like to get more on it instead of the little spots the container releases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and this powder works very well with a kabuki brush or a large powder brush to buff on the face to set foundation and powder, it makes my skin look and feel silky soft</li>
            <li> I love it, only downfall is that it&#x27;s extremely messy they could of done the packaging much better, this powder is finely milled so it comes out like crazy</li>
            <li> It does go on clear and also matte.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear,</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s clear and no smell.  </li>
            <li> It has been working out so far.</li>
            <li> and this makes my face so soft and matte.</li>
            <li> I do not reccomend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The powder is white, but very sheer/translucent when on your face.  </li>
            <li> any rate, this is probably not something I would buy very often, and I may look for a similar product in a pressed form instead.  </li>
            <li> Also, I got through the product really fast, in only a couple of months, whereas pressed powder sometimes lasts for a year.</li>
            <li> Because if your going for a natural look and you go out in the sun , forget it.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> But overall, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was worried this would look like white powder on my face, because that&#x27;s what it looks like in the container, but it really does go on translucent.</li>
            <li> I also use it for touch ups throughout the day .. 4 stars only because it does give a flashback in photos IF you use too much of it</li>
            <li> It absorbs oil and is soft to the touch when over foundation.</li>
            <li> Too light and fluffy</li>
            <li> The key is you really just need know where and how to put it.</li>
            <li> , all my old one did was make my face look cakey.</li>
            <li> It highlights my skin and makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> The puff that comes with it definitely gives you way too much product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend skipping the puff that comes with it for a soft all over face brush.  </li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and this has never made me break out.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s completely matte...</li>
            <li> It also aids in blending my contouring thus giving it a natural effect.</li>
            <li> This powder mattifies my face and makes my skin feel soft without looking cakey.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel silky soft and make my foundation look natural and blended in.</li>
            <li> only real downside I would give this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with the given brush (for lack of a better term).</li>
            <li> covers well but is not heavy on the face.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It makes my face look soft and it feels soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used E.L.F. Products before, but I will be exploring further thanks to this powder.</li>
            <li> Wow do I like this stuff...</li>
            <li> I bought this to set my concealer under my eyes, it always left my skin with a really grainy finish.</li>
            <li> Not heavy.</li>
            <li> and her skin looks and feel soft.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, it may also make you appear white as a geisha girl.</li>
            <li> The ELF product contains powdered silicone and silica and causes no irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate oily skin.</li>
            <li> This powder gives the soft focus that takes away the look of lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but really good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value for the price, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, not super special.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging and the amount of product is generous, but the powder is too light and makes me look pale.  </li>
            <li> I opened to see very little loose powder in the container and unsealing it made tons of powder fly into the air even when opening carefully.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect all day coverage if you have very oily skin (which I do), but with one or two touch ups during the day, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult skin.. dry, oily, you name it and this ended up being a great powder for me!</li>
            <li> and I drowned my face in moisturizer right after.  </li>
            <li> Totally takes the oil off your face, actually does its job when you rub it in, but make sure you check your whole face before you put your mirror down, or your husband might think you had white powder doughnuts and didn&#x27;t get any for him.</li>
            <li> I imagine it would go on a lot better with the kabuki brush, though, and a little powder does go a long way to &amp;</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used loose powder.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with other high definition products and the finish looks really refined and professional.</li>
            <li> Actually comes with a decent powder puff thing</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed that my pores looked smaller, I hadn&#x27;t oil skin all day and, is possibly when you used it can feel as if you had applied baby powder.</li>
            <li> make sure you only use a small amount-</li>
            <li> All in all, a fabulous little powder from E.L.F!</li>
            <li> Same ingredients and performance as the high end brands.  </li>
            <li> The only real complaint I have is the powder can get everywhere if you&#x27;re not careful, but honestly with a powder you can&#x27;t really avoid that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is like a high quality mineral powder without any color (even though it is white).  </li>
            <li> I am a mess -  a really oily t-zone, large pores and the beginnings of rosacea and</li>
            <li> Not very happy right now...I barely got to enjoy this lroduct because the product was so damaged when I recieved it that there was barely any left in the container.</li>
            <li> i do wish the opening was smaller and that once you take off the lid if you aren&#x27;t super careful it will all spill out</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been using a more expensive version of this product, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the finishing touch that both sets my makeup and erases any last traces of those annoying imperfections while giving a wonderful soft focus effect.  </li>
            <li> Does cause a little bit of a white cast in flash photography but other than its a nice setting powder.</li>
            <li> I only used a little and it made my skin look smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s translucent, but it does make my face appear a little white in photos; it also makes my skin look smooth in pictures.</li>
            <li> Super long lasting, and it doesn&#x27;t make your face look white!</li>
            <li> I have grown accustomed to a certain level a qaulity from ELF but this loose powder misses the mark.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this product for several months and was using a new container every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I really prefer a big brush for powder, but since I already had one, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American, caramel complexion, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> but I only put up with the mess because its worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awful and if the reviews are as good as most people feel about it, then I must have recieved a faulty product.  </li>
            <li> So, a little of this goes a long way, and it tends to become airborne quite easily</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very soft feeling and provides an extra finishing touch to my make up routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, and have yet to further search exactly how to apply it and use it, but I still really like it.</li>
            <li> The next morning I used it to set my mousse foundation, and WOW!</li>
            <li> And I barely have to use any!</li>
            <li> Only use a soft powder brush!</li>
            <li> My old powder would feel heavy and make my skin itch almost right away</li>
            <li> Loose Face Powder is an absolute must to try.</li>
            <li> &amp; it was only half way full.</li>
            <li> and it is extremely fine and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This powder wears well it&#x27;s light and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The milling on the powder isn&#x27;t quite up to the same standard of some of the high end brands.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this powder, especially for the low price.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to put too much on</li>
            <li> and I won it early last year!</li>
            <li> I also have bare minerals</li>
            <li> It starts to look cakey very quickly, so be careful that you&#x27;re not applying too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bare minerals mineral veil ADDICT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched back to my old powder.</li>
            <li> Helps make my makeup last longer and gives me a soft matte finish.  </li>
            <li> It blends in seamlessly and helps my makeup last all day.</li>
            <li> I use the ELF powder over Armani Luminous foundation or Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> Bare Skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a combination skin type, your pretty typical t-zone oily and mostly normal to dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li> elf Studio High Definition Loose Face Powder]]  </li>
            <li> Using this powder sparingly, I have gotten the same smooth results as I did with the more expensive brand, and feel like this may even last longer because I&#x27;m using less of the product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep the &amp;#34;filter cap&amp;#34; on this powder because it isn&#x27;t a tight enough seal and just falls out when I try to shake more powder into the lid creating a mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very lightweight, though that might be because it was hard to apply much with it falling off everywhere.</li>
            <li> I recently switched back to my Almay loose powder and realized how much better the coverage is and how much longer each container is lasting - at least twice as long.</li>
            <li> If applied over still wet foundation, it is possible to apply too much, which can make you look washed out.</li>
            <li> At $6 I figured it&#x27;s worth a shot since it wouldn&#x27;t be a big waste (which I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING).</li>
            <li> I slather on thick moisturizers in the winter and after I dusted this on my face, all I noticed was clean, healthy-looking skin.</li>
            <li> The positive review on Amazon was written by a black woman.</li>
            <li> I put it on a medium sized, fluffy powder brush and applied it to the area right above my cheek bones where I always put a highlighter.</li>
            <li> The canister is bigger than I had expected but makes it much easier to get my bigger, fluffier brush into.</li>
            <li> This product gives you very sheer barely there matte coverage.</li>
            <li> First of all, I put on spf everyday, and</li>
            <li> I only used a very small amount and mainly put it in places where my face wasn&#x27;t super dry</li>
            <li> actually did help covering up a few healing blemishes (I&#x27;d used concealer on them first).  </li>
            <li> Instead of this I use the Elf Setting Spray mist and it makes my makeup natural and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> another quality I did not care for so much as it was an odd texture..very silky but very obviously there</li>
            <li> Very high quality product for so little money.</li>
            <li> First, I am a ghost in a play and have used this to set my Snazaroo face paint (white, black, metallic grey, blue).  </li>
            <li> If you add too much you could look a little washed out</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin in my t-zone, my cheeks are moderately dry and the rest of my face is normal.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the little powder puff thing.  </li>
            <li> In steps Amazon to offer it to me for a little more than I paid at the store but at least I was finally going to have it</li>
            <li> Not only was THEIR shipping fast, the product costed less!</li>
            <li> difference between this and more expensive stuff is that this contains some larger flakes(very few of them) but those usually just fall off by themselves or can be easily swept</li>
            <li> I recommend applying with a large fluffy blush or a flat fan brush.</li>
            <li> it sucks all moisture right up and gives you a silky matte finish.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a large container and a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> I like the look on my skin - if you have dry skin like me, you have to be careful not to apply too much or too often, or it makes your face dry.</li>
            <li> Save yourself from having to scoop and vacuum your purchase by NOT removing the plastic film on the inside of it.</li>
            <li> I would also warn that due to the extremely fine nature of the powder, it can get a little messy if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> The puff it comes with is very soft but can potentially wipe away previously applied makeup, I recommend using a brush to apply.</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain at all though it doesn&#x27;t seem to go quite as far as the other one I use.  </li>
            <li> It did very well for me with only a sheer tinted moisturizer and it covered Or minimized the appearance of my scars without feeling heavy!</li>
            <li> #34;overdone it&amp;#34; on the blush or eye shadow - this completely smooths out the rough edges and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Left it sitting flat in my bag and</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this product is that the little plastic piece with the holes in it that sits on top of the powder can come loose if you are just throwing it around in your makeup bag</li>
            <li> The container comes with a small puff which I actually DON&#x27;T use because I find it takes too much of the product.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last all day for me, but long enough.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other definition powders this is really good and not as expensive!</li>
            <li> Great powder, adds finishing touches to makeup...but use only a small amount, if not it will make you look ashen!</li>
            <li> I really like this as a setting powder, I have to be careful with it because when I use to much I turn a little pale.</li>
            <li> Hard to travel with it, but if you keep most of the little holes in the lid closed it can be manageable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I can&#x27;t really wear this over my usual foundation.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily skin, and with this powder I noticed that I didn&#x27;t oil up like I usually do for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I did not remove the sticker but poked about ten of the holes on the sticker as I heard it makes a mess if you completely remove the sticker</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works just let ,</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about the powder is that it can be pretty messy and you have to hold the container with a delicate hand or you will make a mess and most importantly, waste product!</li>
            <li> This purchase will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It seems like this powder will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have an oily t zone and the powder doesn&#x27;t last long there.</li>
            <li> Works well, only complaint is that the container has large holes so a lot of product comes out at once.</li>
            <li> I tried this powder using it VERY sparingly and found that it makes me extremely matte, as in slightly cakey.</li>
            <li> Those that are saying it&#x27;s too pigmented or gives them a white cast they are using WAY too much product which isn&#x27;t hard to do.</li>
            <li> the high white pigment can make a person very pail and sick looking with too much.</li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way.....can cause an ashy appearance if too much is applied.</li>
            <li> and I do believe it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> And I do not have dry skin or oily, but it looked gross and not smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think with skin as dry as mine that will be possible.</li>
            <li> I typically use pricier finishing powders, but have been happily surprised at the results I see with this powder.</li>
            <li> I have fairly normal skin (a little oily in the summer and dry in the winter.)</li>
            <li> As I have bad days where I look super tired, or didn&#x27;t sleep well, and this was amazing covering up dark circles or old blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> This is a very basic loose powder.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s a plus for some people, but for me I make the color white look dark, so I definitely don&#x27;t need to look whiter!  </li>
            <li> It is a generous quantity and feels like silk on your face all day long.</li>
            <li> But, with moisturizer and lots of careful blending, it is actually a gem of a powder.</li>
            <li> Be careful, when you open it, it goes EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li> as long as I pat it on and then knock off the excess.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s minor....</li>
            <li> No matter how careful you are with it, whenever you open it powder gets EVERYWHERE.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This container is much bigger than expected, so it comes with a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I will definitely replace it when it&#x27;s empty (which by the way won&#x27;t be for a long time...</li>
            <li> I mean, this isn&#x27;t really meant for that.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a model - that&#x27;s why I wanted it), but I see no positive difference to the naked eye.</li>
            <li> I used to use Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked loose powder, which is $34 and contains even less product than the MUF.  </li>
            <li> The product does what it is meant to do, but it does make your liquid foundation cakey, so I only recommend if you only wear a little liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> As I have read in other reviews, this powder isn&#x27;t transluscent and does leave a trail of white.</li>
            <li> I think I might still use this occasionally in the summer when I need a little help mattifying my oily skin, especially considering there&#x27;s a ton of powder in this.</li>
            <li> I would suggest any one of Elf&#x27;s other translucent powders, or of course a different brand all together.</li>
            <li> The craziest thing is unlike other HD powders this one doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of other e.l.f products including their mineral primers and tinted moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> It will take me a long time to use it up!</li>
            <li> It does lighten my foundation color a little bit, but not enough to make a big difference.</li>
            <li> It keeps me matte all day long even in the summer!</li>
            <li> I tried it the same day I only used a little.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and the mail ingredient is cornstarch.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to really dry my skin out and makes it look even drier.</li>
            <li> so my face goes from dry to oily in no time.</li>
            <li> Dry skinned people shouldn&#x27;t use this unless they moisturize like they are dying.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I use a brush (ELF&#x27;s blush brush, believe it or not) and only use a SMALL amount, just to barely coat the brush, to sweep this onto my T-zone.  </li>
            <li> It looked very ashy and terrible on my face, especially around my nose, and extra blending really didn&#x27;t do much to help.</li>
            <li> On bare face, it goes on translucent, but on made-up skin it looks a little ghostly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there is a white cast left on your face.</li>
            <li> It gives your face an allover air brushed look and a little goes a long, long way!  </li>
            <li> I just received my package with ALL my orders in it, and the first thing I saw was all the bottles of glass foundation was broken .</li>
            <li> I gave this a try because I decided to drop the colored loose powder and</li>
            <li> a loose powder, ELF&#x27;s powder is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> it was so loosely on).</li>
            <li> if I use the amount I would use with another loose powder.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is the container.</li>
            <li> Seems to extend my make-up an extra two or three hours before melt down  </li>
            <li> you only need a little as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> With this, a little goes a long way and it actually helps define your face just like it&#x27;s suppose to!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s white and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> As a darkskinned Black woman, I was worried that using a white powder would cause my skin to look ashy or cakey.</li>
            <li> I am black and even though this makeup is white</li>
            <li> However, it does hold back shine for about half the day.</li>
            <li> Considering how little you need, I see this lasting a very long while.</li>
            <li> I followed the reviewer&#x27;s advice to only pull the seal back a little to control the out-pour of powder that can result in a mess and loss.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t give me creepy makeup face as long as I&#x27;m careful and use the right amount.</li>
            <li> A very light touch is all you need to simply set and soften your base.</li>
            <li> Also, if I managed to make it through the day without itching, I would have several little pimples by evening.</li>
            <li> I go tanning which made me a little nervous that the completely white powder would whiten my face, it doesn&#x27;t at all!</li>
            <li> I look a little to white in some areas</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m probably a little sweaty, but I never even thought this was possible.</li>
            <li> However, it was a total let-down, at least for my coloring (fare skin, blonde hair).</li>
            <li> I usually wind up going over my skin with a pressed powder because my makeup doesn&#x27;t last as long with this product.</li>
            <li> which I guess, is expected?</li>
            <li> It came as expected.</li>
            <li> It provides what you expect - absolutely no color, but sets the makeup for the day.</li>
            <li> I use it after my make up everyday and it makes it last 2x</li>
            <li> Be careful when opening it</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all, or as described.</li>
            <li> Came as ordered as expected and i have recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> and I opened it and closed it a bunch of times and not have had any powder come out.</li>
            <li> I also used it last night over lime green Snazaroo face paint when I was Elphaba at a Halloween party.  </li>
            <li> I am not saying to fill it to the brim till it can&#x27;t be closed; but wth???</li>
            <li> I liked this because it sets your makeup , but I hate how its all sparkly.</li>
            <li> I hate the caked up appearance I sometimes get with normal,powder this give me a nice Matt look.</li>
            <li> I have pale Irish skin</li>
            <li> Sadly the consistency wasn&#x27;t right for my face and Ues</li>
            <li> I am an African American with dark skin and it is hard for me to find powders that match my skin tone and some of the translucent (sp?)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful it may make you look a little pale.</li>
            <li> I got the translucent, and a little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> like everyone else said, a LITTLE goes A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> and I have a problem with combination skin, I normally have an extremely shiny face and with the powders I was using it made it look so fake and gross.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, or you&#x27;ll look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> I have to repeat what others have said, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little definetly goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use very little still it shows uo white and a bit</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for $3.00 when they had their 50% off sale along with a lot of other things.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I do like the product</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers too--it is NOT translucent.  </li>
            <li> I read a couple other reviews saying it made them look like a \\&quot;ghost,\\</li>
            <li> but this product was useless.i usually wear bear minerals and its similar to the mineral veil.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for Homestuck, Steven Universe, or any other cosplays that use body/face paint.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was hoping for, it&#x27;s not transparent</li>
            <li> This powder keeps me matte longer than any other.  </li>
            <li> I like that it keeps me from getting the cakey look that I often find from other powders that are made to match my foundation.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub off like some other powders.</li>
            <li> but I must still use the other type when I have to hide some imperfections</li>
            <li> Other than that, this powder sets your makeup and you have no shine.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my foundation like other tinted powders</li>
            <li> face tends to get all oily during work due to the steam tables while.serving food</li>
            <li> So then the other day I was browsing eyeslipsface .</li>
            <li> However, I wish there were smaller or fewer holes to dispense the powder onto the puff because quite a lot usually comes out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems to be a little bit lighter than Make Up Forever HD&#x27;s powder, so I recommend using as little as possible or else</li>
            <li> I am extremely oily.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the price, it is way cheaper than my other makeup.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my entire face a few times but even though its suppose to be translucent, it tends to make you look a little whiter than you would want.</li>
            <li> Just pale, no natural glow to my face or anything and</li>
            <li> Other companies package loose powders with additional caps so it won&#x27;t get messy...</li>
            <li> Buying powder online is a little unsettling, considering matching skin tones and such, so obviously buying a white powder was a little easier for me than one that is my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> BUT - it has helped me when I believe my face is just too dark or</li>
            <li> this translucent powder made me look so cakey it was unbelievable and definitely not clear</li>
            <li> I would be concerned about the effect this would have on delicate skin if used regularly</li>
            <li> dark skinned</li>
            <li> I have dark brown skin</li>
            <li> The packaging can be a tab messy, but im careful with it.</li>
            <li> I love the powder inside, but hate the packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale with pink under tone</li>
            <li> I have and will continue to recommend this powder to all other makeup lovers out there!</li>
            <li> Only takes a small amount, and I have oily skin!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really stiff, but be careful when you use a powder brush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use a setting powder because I feel like it can give my dry skin</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear any other powder or foundation etc, and this works well for minimal makeup.</li>
            <li> I won this along with a few other E.L.F products in a contest</li>
            <li> If you use loose powder you know it is messy, but you also know nothing else works like it!</li>
            <li> That helps cut down on the mess.</li>
            <li> Does the job but for darker skin, comes off slightly ashy..</li>
            <li> I went looking for this after I saw my MK lady had something like this (this was half the price)</li>
            <li> I have noticed less creasing when using this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it if you&#x27;re going to be taking a lot of pictures with flash because it has a tendency to whiten the skin and make you look slightly ghost-like.</li>
            <li> Mine&#x27;s slightly brown because I dab it over my contour.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Black woman, and</li>
            <li> &#x27;s the slightly longer version of my review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a screwtop which is odd</li>
            <li> It comes in a matte black case with a powder puff.  </li>
            <li> It even slightly reduces the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li> Not even a slight shimmer when I turned my face side to side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black</li>
            <li> because it works just as well and costs way less.  </li>
            <li> Makes a mess</li>
            <li> Dislike the mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that this effect is exacerbated if you have a dark complexion, but my skin is so pale that I haven&#x27;t had that</li>
            <li> And a stellar job with an actual makeup base.</li>
            <li> I like the look of the matte black packaging but the inside sifter is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> (btw I am being very sarcastic here); I want to will myself to be angry</li>
            <li> The packaging was a little damaged, but the product was untouched.</li>
            <li> I applied with the little pad that it comes with rather than a kabuki brush since I don&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> What a mess and a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As others have said use a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> but if you use just a little amount of it, it won&#x27;t ruin your makeup.</li>
            <li> and it seems to hold makeup a little longer on your face</li>
            <li> Now I just dab a little bit on my nose, forehead and chin and then blend it in well.</li>
            <li> Comes with a little powder puff.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I tried a little bronzer dusted over and it seemed to wipe it away.</li>
            <li> I tried using the little pad that comes with it, but I didn&#x27;t like the results at all.  </li>
            <li> It does keep everything in place and does not make my skin look cakey -- IF I use a little amount.  </li>
            <li> I thought I looked a little lighter</li>
            <li> and I do find if I don&#x27;t dust it off a little after I set my foundation</li>
            <li> Not sure why the other reviewers have an issue with both the packaging and the product</li>
            <li> so was a little worried</li>
            <li> con is I miss having a little scent on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mess with my foundation color, and isn&#x27;t heavy like wearing foundation and powder together.  </li>
            <li> A very small amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;A little dab will do ya&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finishing your makeup, this powder takes away/prevents a shiny nose/forehead.</li>
            <li> I have very pale, oily, uneven skin with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> I pour a little out on the back of my hand or in a bowl when I need it, and I keep the corner twisted and taped closed when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li> much less expensive than the other products that do the same thing...</li>
            <li> The packaging is terrible and messy so you have to learn to work with it, but the product, which I use with elfs kabuki brush, is amazing.</li>
            <li> Very matte and caked and artificial.</li>
            <li> Just a few puffs on your face</li>
            <li> This is probably a 3.5 star product for me, but I&#x27;ll round up to 4.</li>
            <li> However, when applying the powder, it&#x27;s a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your coins.</li>
            <li> so I wear it a few days during the week.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to waste a lot of product.</li>
            <li> this is dead on.</li>
            <li> In my research reviews stated that it was messy.</li>
            <li> This makes it go on heavy.</li>
            <li> I just use a really fluffy brush and it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so messy.</li>
            <li> Its extremely thin, once you get it out through the holes it falls back through them again</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t wear make up longer than a few hours - this product serves me well.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> have not had any rashes , and I&#x27;ve been use for a few weeks now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the MUFE brand.</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday.</li>
            <li> Do not sweep with brush just press it in,let it sit a few minutes,than sweep and remove excess,follow with setting spray.</li>
            <li> Use a brush, not the sponge provided, I feel like even though it&#x27;s translucent setting powder, it is too heavy and applies with a tint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy</li>
            <li> I only give this a 4 star because it&#x27;s quite messy after the seal inside has been broken.  </li>
            <li> That said, it is also a bit less pricey so in the end, I will be ordering this one again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already pale and it added a coat of a lighter color to my face.  </li>
            <li> (You can see from my profile picture that I have a pale complexion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pale person</li>
            <li> and it still was too pale.</li>
            <li> It does not make me look pale.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is pale and she was looking for something like this</li>
            <li> If anything it looks worse because my face looked very flat, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> so I was a little hesitant on using this because I&#x27;ve used &#x27;translucent&#x27; powders in the past</li>
            <li> I find that heavy makeup leaves me feeling very heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I noticed it didn&#x27;t blend well on my face no matter how little I used, always leaving me with a very pale complexion.</li>
            <li> difference :\</li>
            <li> It is difficult to open with out spilling powder everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on someone with darker skin, so proceed with caution if that describes</li>
            <li> Oh and the packaging sucks, use a toothpick to poke a few holes through the plastic instead of ripping the plastic cover off.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on there..</li>
            <li> not sure how this would work alone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another small gripe -- if you take flash photos, this powder makes your skin look whiter.  </li>
            <li> but Im not sure if this fits the cause.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if that would be an issue.</li>
            <li> 12 dollars is a bit excessive.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I would do if they stopped making this.</li>
            <li> My makeup looked just like it did that morning, when usually by that time of day</li>
            <li> My only concern was the powder is difficult to get out of the box.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s a small thing, and the powder itself is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do still get a tiny bit of shine</li>
            <li> I wish ELF made a pocket size hard-pressed powder version that is a small square/rectangle</li>
            <li> so just press a small amount onto skin with puff.</li>
            <li> I do not use foundation usually.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually $6 at Walmart</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would reorder again based on that.</li>
            <li> Big fail in design.</li>
            <li> That is disappointing - is it because a little of this product goes a long way, so \\&quot;they\\&quot; decided to send less??</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, so trying unfamiliar products out are very scary.</li>
            <li> I nave to mention I have very pale complexion</li>
            <li> So worth the price which isnt bad at all!</li>
            <li> I hate circular packaging because it&#x27;s difficult to fit into pockets and small purses.</li>
            <li> I tried it only once before I got frustrated and gave the mess away to my mom...</li>
            <li> Additionally, it was hard to even apply since it doesn&#x27;t stick to my brushes, the puff, or my face at all.</li>
            <li> it gets everywhere and is hard to use</li>
            <li> so my makeup hardly ever moves.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t look dull or have a film at all.</li>
            <li> at least I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> It was translucent at least.  </li>
            <li> The container sucks.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t make my foundation look cakey or thick.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> my face hasn&#x27;t been shiny the past three days I have been using it!</li>
            <li> Even with a very small amount, my makeup looks caked.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you seriously can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> The biggest difference I notice is that the powder is heavier; some of this may be because I&#x27;m also using a less expensive brush than I do with my MAKE UP FOR EVER powder.</li>
            <li> I bought this translucent powder from Elf because it was less expensive than the department store brands as well as Mary Kay products.  </li>
            <li> I seriously do.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s white, it goes on white and looks awful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a plush velvety powder puff with a ribbon strap for fingers, in a square, beveled looking black box that looks to me like an expensive ring box.  </li>
            <li> which was weird looking for me because I&#x27;m tan/mixed race (part black).</li>
            <li> This powder SERIOUSLY has minimized the &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; of my make up</li>
            <li> Not only are you starting out, but often times you have horrible hygiene.</li>
            <li> it makes me look unwell) to give a subtle finished appearance.</li>
            <li> but it does not good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Not a good product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t breathe to hard around this stuff!  </li>
            <li> So to have spent the money on something as disappointing is really frustrating.</li>
            <li> This powder not only looks chalky when applied, but it dries out my face like crazy!  </li>
            <li> the packaging sucks!</li>
            <li> This may be an issue for people that carry their makeup on them I guess, since any powder like this will be tough to keep from coming out</li>
            <li> The packing is a bit unnecessarily bulky, though.</li>
            <li> Foundation was all over everything in my package, AND EVERY BOTTLE WAS BROKEN.</li>
            <li> I was tired of messing everything with my face.</li>
            <li> Annoyed, I use my finger to feel if it is even being applied..</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the ELF powder is sheer and adds no color to my base makeup.  </li>
            <li> The powder puff is a little awkward (who uses a powder puff??), so the packaging part is not perfect.  </li>
            <li> I may be using this product incorrectly, but I see absolutely no benefits to applying it over my base make-up.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and hate wearing any thing other than eyeliner and mascara....</li>
            <li> At least you can save some money on a comparative product!!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t add any weird orange color to your face.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> sadly I can&#x27;t find a place in Alaska that sells them.</li>
            <li> The line, e.l.f., is a difficult brand to be a fan of.</li>
            <li> Well, it would be difficult.</li>
            <li> and i know ill keep on buying,it was alot cheaper when i purchased it on amazon so ill</li>
            <li> I bought this powder after trying qvc cosmetics and department store makeup that was terribly cakes and gross looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff</li>
            <li> I use this powder alongside my expensive face makeup.</li>
            <li> Feels like an expensive brand</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> Even expensive brands like Lancôme and Dior.</li>
            <li> drawbacks: it makes my face feel sort of weird</li>
            <li> Smells weird.</li>
            <li> Crazy looking.</li>
            <li> but this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The package is terrible and whenever the container is opened a lot of the product is wasted and falls out of the container on to your hands and floor.</li>
            <li> but it dried out my skin HORRIBLY.  </li>
            <li> I had to wipe it off because it was driving me crazy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy that anyone would pay 13.00 for this product plus additional shipping charges.  </li>
            <li> I tend to use my brush and not the puff that came with it just because I don&#x27;t want to dirty it.</li>
            <li> I tried and it was just getting dirty from my make up.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s usually a crazy day</li>
            <li> Just crazy.</li>
            <li> and I was always afraid that it would give me the &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> (I have to use it up, it was expensive!).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not all bad.</li>
            <li> but I avoid flash photos anyways as they tend to look bad no matter who or what the focus is</li>
            <li> but it broke my skin out so bad.</li>
            <li> I have really bad oily skin.</li>
            <li> and I was shocked.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> so I may be slightly disappointed</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed after all the glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li> Annoying, but I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> I hate paying shipping for something I can get around the corner, ya know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate how you always get those lines or dips after you apply your face powder.</li>
            <li> and i hate that</li>
            <li> Tinted powder changes the color of my base makeup somewhat, which I don&#x27;t always want.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when this came in the mail.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed  with this product.</li>
            <li> The packaging for this item was terrible!</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it just because of the terrible packaging.</li>
            <li> It makes me look sallow and AWFUL in pictures.  </li>
            <li> You can see the powder sitting on your face and it looks terrible.</li>
            <li> The packaging is horrible.</li>
            <li> downside is that the container is terrible (as has been mentioned before); there&#x27;s no way to neatly transport this thing anywhere and the powder gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> a nasty cakey look now matter how I use it</li>
            <li> Awful.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it wasn&#x27;t terrible, but not buying it again.</li>
            <li> At six dollars you can&#x27;t go wrong!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite translucent powder. It stands up well to the name brands and you can&#x27;t be the price.</li>
            <li> Love this powder! Blends super easy! Does not make me break out either!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this kind of powder before, so was worried this would make me look a little paler than I already am, or make my make-up look different. Anyway, it doesn&#x27;t do that at all! This is a great product, and goes on clear, and sets nicely. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Me facino la suavidad y lo bonita q se ve el rostro cuando los usa</li>
            <li> Love the product; I just wish there was an easier way to apply the loose powder to the pad instead of turning the makeup over and shaking it out. I feel like I&#x27;m losing a lot, but, then again, it&#x27;s lose powder.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it not to look like flour, even with a brush.</li>
            <li> I use this as an added highlighter and It works just the way I want it too. It makes your skin very soft feeling and provides an extra finishing touch to my make up routine. It also it very affordable for the kind of quality.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this powder!</li>
            <li> Great product to give that airbrushed look to makeup</li>
            <li> Love all the elf products and this one is no different.</li>
            <li> This is a great setting powder for cream/liquid makeup but can leave a white powder residue if you aren&#x27;t careful. This is a great product and is well worth the low price. Elf has a few good products and this is most definitely one of them</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of E.L.F. products - they can be hit or miss but this is a good one, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  It is a generous quantity and feels like silk on your face all day long.</li>
            <li> Pretty good especially for the price</li>
            <li> Really great setting powder. My favorite at the moment, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this as a setting powder, I have to be careful with it because when I use to much I turn a little pale. But that&#x27;s easily blended out with some bronzing powder. For the price, you seriously can&#x27;t beat it. It&#x27;s really comparable to a high priced setting powder, for 1/4 the price. Amazing. Goes on velvety smooth. The only reason I&#x27;m giving four stars instead of five is because of the container, if it gets shaken up because of your purse or bag, when you open it, powder goes EVERYWHERE. Annoying, but I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> Other companies package loose powders with additional caps so it won&#x27;t get messy... Not this powder... I tried it only once before I got frustrated and gave the mess away to my mom... Its okay if u don&#x27;t mind sparkly powder all over the place, not just on your face lol</li>
            <li> Great for the price, I like the loose powder. Completes any look. Great for summer when your makeup becomes a melting pot of different colors.. Yuk</li>
            <li> This may work well for others but buyer be warned, it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I have fairly normal skin (a little oily in the summer and dry in the winter.) but overall no problems. After wearing this for an hour my skin became very itchy. It seems as though it just rests on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;, not even to foundation. Also, if I managed to make it through the day without itching, I would have several little pimples by evening. This is not at all what I was hoping for. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency, but makes me look too pale, and I&#x27;m already super super pale, so...</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter,</li>
            <li> gives u a nice finished look</li>
            <li> Great setting powder!</li>
            <li> This is not as good as the MAKE UP FOR EVER HD powder it&#x27;s meant to copy, but it&#x27;s still a good alternative if you&#x27;re looking to spend a lot less. The biggest difference I notice is that the powder is heavier; some of this may be because I&#x27;m also using a less expensive brush than I do with my MAKE UP FOR EVER powder.</li>
            <li> I like this very much. I put it over my BB cream to help keep it from sliding off my face.  It&#x27;s translucent so it doesn&#x27;t add any weird orange color to your face.</li>
            <li> Does the job but for darker skin, comes off slightly ashy.. which I guess, is expected?</li>
            <li> You can wear this even with no makeup on for a matte look. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the packaging/container is very large and occupies too much space in my make up box.</li>
            <li> It works fine but I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, so I&#x27;m not as skilled. but its ok for me.</li>
            <li> It came as expected. The only thing I do not like is when I take pictures and it has a flash also in bright light I look white, like ghost white.</li>
            <li> Great for setting your makeup. Doesn&#x27;t leave white wash. Prevents creating of creases Under your eyes. Better than some more expensive translucent powders.</li>
            <li> As a darkskinned Black woman, I was worried that using a white powder would cause my skin to look ashy or cakey. This powder, however, is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this powder to set my foundation, to reduce shine during the day, and also to set my gel eyeliner. I have medium dark skin, and this powder does NOT make my skin look overly light, it doesn&#x27;t make my foundation look cakey or thick.</li>
            <li> Very light, easy to apply, also leaves your skin feeling very soft. I love it!</li>
            <li> The product is chalky and does not blend into the skin, leaving the face skin looking like a layer of white dust fell all over it. Not translucent; comes out white. I just recently bought Larenim Mineral Silk Light-Medium:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000FL4424 B000FL4424]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wore it for the first time today, but so far I&#x27;m loving it. We&#x27;ll see how it goes after continued usage, but for starters it&#x27;s much finer causing better blending and the color is much more natural as opposed to elf&#x27;s starch white, while retaining what looks like an ability to blend into a variety of skin colors.</li>
            <li> The product really puts all my makeup together</li>
            <li> I love this powder! I got the translucent, and a little does go a long way.  I have always wanted to try out finishing powder but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot for something I wasn&#x27;t even sure I would like.  Lo and behold, elf finishing powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a large fluffy powder brush, swirl it in the container, and make sure i tap the brush handle on my wrist or the edge of the counter before applying so I don&#x27;t look cakey or like there has been a powder overload.  Then I lightly press the powder on my nose, cheeks, and forehead, then spread out with the brush.  I love how t-zone shine is eliminated!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I use it under my eyes to set my concealer and it really helps to make it not crease.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected! Too powdery and it marks fine lines instead of disguising them.</li>
            <li> I went looking for this after I saw my MK lady had something like this (this was half the price) It works great, all day on my oily t-zone!</li>
            <li> The product does what is says it does, but not super impressed with the results. I have use this before and i dont feel like it works the same</li>
            <li> Colorless powder that gives you a matte finish.</li>
            <li> i do wish the opening was smaller and that once you take off the lid if you aren&#x27;t super careful it will all spill out</li>
            <li> Light and trasparent. Good product</li>
            <li> Arrived as described. The packaging was a little damaged, but the product was untouched. I have very oily cheeks, so I try to direct the product there. It has been working out so far.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. Studio High Definition Loose Face Powder is an absolute must to try. I&#x27;ve used it with a light touch over foundation and blush and the effect is quite nice. It does not seem to settle in to lines and give any sort of chalky look, but a fresh kind of smoothness. At any price, this is a good cosmetic. I have sometimes added an extra bit of my regular powder over this, and the look is excellent -- makes your pores begin to disappear. It&#x27;s important to remember a very light touch in application, that&#x27;s definitely the key!</li>
            <li> I worked great to set my Halloween paint</li>
            <li> Bought the translucent one, I have a oily T-Zone and this helps.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat user. I love this product. Most setting powders now have mineral it which is not great for stage work or even camera as the mineral reflects the light not in the most ideal way. So this HD powder has come to rescue. Excellent for what it is and the price is great! I use ELF&amp;#34;s Kabuki brush to apply it. Great combination and totally worth the $6 for each item!</li>
            <li> Hides shine and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This powder is pretty much exactly the same thing as Makeup Forever&#x27;s HD powder but at a 1/4 of the price! I highly recommend this product! I am a Makeup Artist and use this on a lot of photo shoots, works great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference. Is this best with liquid foundation? Because I tried it with powder and I don&#x27;t see any high def. difference :\</li>
            <li> looks like white chalk on me and I have light complexion</li>
            <li> This is very good for the price.  Actually it is higher here as it costs $6 on their website (eyeslipsface.com).  They are always having a sale.  I purchased this for $3.00 when they had their 50% off sale along with a lot of other things.  It does what it is made to do.  If you shake some powder into the lid, it is great to use with a stipple brush and a little goes a long way.  It is great for setting liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought the white and yellow powder to try both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product just didn&#x27;t work for me. Over my foundation it made my skin look flakey. And I do not have dry skin or oily, but it looked gross and not smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, this product may work on someone else, I just didn&#x27;t like how it worked on me.</li>
            <li> Go to the actual website where it&#x27;s only about $3&lt;br /&gt;EyesLipsFace.Com You won&#x27;t regret it! this stuff works so great!</li>
            <li> The packaging is a bit big and clunky to carry around, however the actual product is fantastic. It&#x27;s very finely milled so the powder is super smooth and easy to apply and blend. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The packaging for this item was terrible! Not only was the box it came in opened but the plastic the powder comes out of looks like it had been opened too &amp; it was only half way full. Other than that I do like the product but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it just because of the terrible packaging.</li>
            <li> it works well and keeps me from getting shiny for about 4 hours. i get shiny easily.</li>
            <li> Good product no effect color , no lines also make the makeup stay longer</li>
            <li> This made my face look a bit dry, albeit quite smooth. I applied with the little pad that it comes with rather than a kabuki brush since I don&#x27;t have one. I imagine it would go on a lot better with the kabuki brush, though, and a little powder does go a long way to &amp;#34;smooth out&amp;#34; facial topography.</li>
            <li> Great product at a very good price</li>
            <li> Did not work well for me. Did not do anything to keep my face matte. Did not like it.</li>
            <li> This is a light, non sparkly power that I use to set my foundation. I&#x27;ve found that I only need to use it once through the day. If you tend to have oily skin, you might need to apply it twice a day though.</li>
            <li> Really sets your foundation!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really like it so far! Makes my skin feel so smooth like doll, didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. I still prefer my Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, but for the price I&#x27;d say this is an excellent product. A word of Caution-my lid was stuck on, my husband had to get pliers to open it! But now that it&#x27;s opened it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Nice n light.fragrance free..doesnt trigger my excema;).it makes my skin baby smooth and i would recommend this powder for all skin types</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price! It can be used with or without face make up. I have oily skin and this makes my face so soft and matte. It&#x27;s a GREAT setter I feel like it makes my makeup last much longer!</li>
            <li> I have very difficult skin.. dry, oily, you name it and this ended up being a great powder for me! My only critique is the container. It is difficult to open with out spilling powder everywhere. So I open it once and put it in a container easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. I&#x27;m not sure why but it seems to really dry my skin out and makes it look even drier.</li>
            <li> Great product! !! I used it to set my concealer.... perfection.</li>
            <li> i love this product, i have acne prone skin and large pores so my face goes from dry to oily in no time. This powder helps keep my makeup fresh and face shine free. i love it.</li>
            <li> One of the best powders I&#x27;ve used, in comparsion to Mac, Nars, Revlon, etc my #1 powder!</li>
            <li> Great product, gets the setting job done. I have noticed less creasing when using this product. I will 100% repurchase and recommend this to people.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I put it on after my foundation and it softens up the appearance of my face and makes my skin super velvety to the touch. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin all white or anything which is what I worried would happen so that&#x27;s another plus :) great price, too! I love ELF :D</li>
            <li> The product does what it is meant to do, but it does make your liquid foundation cakey, so I only recommend if you only wear a little liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I did what it was supposed to do and looked very nice. However, it made me break out like I never have before. I lead a very health lifestyle and have a super clean diet so the amount of pimples that I got around my mouth and on my forehead was something that&#x27;s never happened. I do not reccomend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is an ok product. Probably will not reorder.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to give this powder a try since it is so reasonably priced.  I like the packaging and the amount of product is generous, but the powder is too light and makes me look pale.  I also notice white spots if I don&#x27;t rub it into my skin.  What&#x27;s odd is that the description says &amp;#34;masks fine lines&amp;#34; and mine look more prominent after applying this powder, especially my frown lines.  I really wanted this to work, so I continued to use it for 2 weeks, but it&#x27;s not for me. Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li> I should start by saying that I have NOT gotten to truly test this product. I have tried it on and it immediately noticed how light it feels on the skin VS my drug store product. My old powder would feel heavy and make my skin itch almost right away but this felt very light and smooth. It gives the appearance of smooth skin. I have very sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t wear much make up and this is going to be a great addition to my BB cream.</li>
            <li> WOW other reviews were right! This powder is every bit as good as M*A*C* at a fraction of the cost.  It sinks RIGHT into your skin!!!! So glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> The HD Loose Face Powder is nice, that&#x27;s all I really have to say about it. When getting it in the mail, it came in a little box that looked like I&#x27;d bought it out of a store.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is lovely. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it if you&#x27;re going to be taking a lot of pictures with flash because it has a tendency to whiten the skin and make you look slightly ghost-like. When you put it on the skin, you will know if you used too much because your face will look like someone threw flour on you. But if you get the right consistency on your face, it leaves a nice matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;The plush that comes with it is what I would recommend using when you apply the powder to your face, the plush really makes it to where you get the right amount on your skin and when you get too much, it&#x27;s easy to wipe away the excess without smearing the makeup underneath. Though, the downside of the plush is that it really picks up colors. Mine&#x27;s slightly brown because I dab it over my contour.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend the powder. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and for a whopping four dollars, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I used a translucent powder for the first time and really enjoyed its lightweight texture and good shine control. It also reflects light so my skin finally got this glowing look I was trying to get. I liked that I don’t need to worry about getting the right color because there is no color. To sum up, it’s the best powder I used so far and I love the price.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Don’t freak out about the white color of the powder, it’ll adjust to your skin tone once you applied it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get this powder. The grains don&#x27;t even stick to the brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Very sheer and fine powder. You get a descent amount as well. The price can&#x27;t be beat. Elf is really nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about.  This powder not only looks chalky when applied, but it dries out my face like crazy!  Even with a very small amount, my makeup looks caked.  I agree with other reviewers too--it is NOT translucent.  Will never use this again.  Good thing it was only $6.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good HD powder, definitely try the ELF version!  The price is right!!! I have been using it for about 4 years now and it&#x27;s definitely a holy grail product for me.  I recommend applying with a large fluffy blush or a flat fan brush.</li>
            <li> I use this as a finishing product, and I can&#x27;t go without it!  Sets my makeup perfectly, and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a ghost!  One of the best products from e.l.f.</li>
            <li> Just a few puffs on your face and you are good to go. Super long lasting, and it doesn&#x27;t make your face look white! I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation!</li>
            <li> I bought this translucent powder from Elf because it was less expensive than the department store brands as well as Mary Kay products.  It provides what you expect - absolutely no color, but sets the makeup for the day. Lightly apply the powder to your face after the application of the makeup and it will last all day.  I have oily skin, so I get a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; without the powder.  This powder is wonderful!</li>
            <li> My favorite loose powder for years has been Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, but because I&#x27;m on a budget, I really can&#x27;t shell out 20 bucks a month on 1 single beauty product. I go through a lot of it because I wash my face &amp; redo my makeup sometimes twice a day.  I&#x27;ve recently seen ELF High Definition Powder all over Pinterest &amp; in a few beauty blogs claiming it&#x27;s a great product so, I decided to try.  Well, I am definitely impressed.  The powder is white, but very sheer/translucent when on your face.  It offers a beautiful satiny finish that isn&#x27;t too powdery, but still covers nicely.  It will even out your skin tone, but you won&#x27;t look &#x27;made up&#x27;. It also has great staying power.  The day after I wore this powder for the first time, I went right back to Target to buy the remaining 3 they had on the shelf.  This stuff is only $6 &amp; I promise you get a lot of bang for your buck. (I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s with good skin (only very fine lines &amp; normal skin.)&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I also used the ELF Makeup Setting Spray &amp; I found it to be just as good as Urban Decay....&amp; it&#x27;s only 3 bucks!</li>
            <li> GREATEST POWDER EVER. The applicator is absolutely rubbish, however. Besides that, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Good product a little chalky but over all a good product and price point.</li>
            <li> I use it to mattify my lipsticks when I wear them and they bleed out to much! Also perfect for oily skin!</li>
            <li> I seriously do. I&#x27;m a Black woman, and like everyone else said, a LITTLE goes A LONG WAY. Before finishing with [[ASIN:B00620T44K e.l.f. Mist And Set]], I take the poof, slide the excess off, then apply to my cheeks, forehead and chin. I then press it and pause to look in a mirror to make sure I haven&#x27;t over applied. I LOVE this powder MUCH MORE than tinted powder. Ladies, this is where it&#x27;s at, trust me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah...I bought mine from the company&#x27;s website. You should too because when they have promo codes (when don&#x27;t they?), it is going to be much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Kinda white, but kinda awesome moreso. Lots cheaper than the big name brands, and does just as well. WIll create a huge powder cloud if you&#x27;re not careful, but if you&#x27;re ok with a little Hiroshima for a nice face, you and me can be friends.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS POWDER! I&#x27;m a POC (African American Woman) with a deep brown complexion and this powder is perfect for me! A little really goes a long way and I keep from getting greasy all day. The only thing I dislike about the powder is that it can be pretty messy and you have to hold the container with a delicate hand or you will make a mess and most importantly, waste product!</li>
            <li> Great setting powder for the price!</li>
            <li> So, a little of this goes a long way, and it tends to become airborne quite easily (I don&#x27;t really want to breathe it in).  I think there are some good things about this product, and I&#x27;ll get to those in a minute, but the first thing I&#x27;ll say is that I think it might be better in pressed form where you can control how much you pick up a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does add a noticeable shimmer.  Probably too much for everyday (office) use, but it would be nice for going out.  I applied it with a brush instead of the puff that comes with it, but then I had to do a lot of blending with my fingers (I used a Neutrogena liquid foundation first).  Before I blended, I looked like a ghost.  I&#x27;m already pale and it added a coat of a lighter color to my face.  But after I blended, it looked good on my skin.  (You can see from my profile picture that I have a pale complexion.  I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on someone with darker skin, so proceed with caution if that describes you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually did help covering up a few healing blemishes (I&#x27;d used concealer on them first).  I don&#x27;t have any plans to be photographed by an HD camera, but I do think it helped conceal the imperfections.  It also blended well with a creamy blush and highlighter, so that&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this is probably not something I would buy very often, and I may look for a similar product in a pressed form instead.  However, if you have a little bit of time for blending, this can add a nice shimmer for a night out.  This is probably a 3.5 star product for me, but I&#x27;ll round up to 4.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Powerful and hot! I have extremely thick hair and it does the job very quick! Love it and had it for a uear already nd still the same since i bought it. I love all babyliss hair care products including the blue flat iron! This blowdryer is used in my salon! So worth the price which isnt bad at all!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, and have yet to further search exactly how to apply it and use it, but I still really like it. It gives my skin a sort of smoothing, softening coat so to say.</li>
            <li> This is a great dupe of a well-known HD powder. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> met my expectations.  comparable to makeup4ever translucent powder</li>
            <li> I love this powder! I had been paying a much heftier price for Bare Minerals mineral veil and this works just as well! For a fraction of the price! Once you are done with ALL your makeup, this is the last step. I use my own brush and just buff it all over my face, it evens out blush and contouring to make you look flawless! You really do look airbrushed. I go tanning which made me a little nervous that the completely white powder would whiten my face, it doesn&#x27;t at all! I read a couple other reviews saying it made them look like a \\&quot;ghost,\\&quot; I can&#x27;t imagine it doing that unless you literally just dabbed it on your face and didn&#x27;t blend? I&#x27;m very liberal with my usage because it&#x27;s so cheap and I don&#x27;t mind re-ordering. Anyways, I am here buying this a second time and figured I&#x27;d stop by and put my two cents in.</li>
            <li> let me just say this is the cheapest translucent powder i ever brought and the best 1 i ever had. i have the mac but i lost it a couple of days ago so decided to try something new when i started using this i really asked my self why did i spend all this money on mac powders if this exist -___- . and  let me say i have oily skin and this makes powder right here does the job</li>
            <li> This powder is great! I use it after my make up everyday and it makes it last 2x longer.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use banana powder but for the price and quality this is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;It is very translucent. I apply it with a big powder brush.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used loose powder. It kept my skin from looking shiny during the day, which was my main goal. However, when applying the powder, it&#x27;s a bit messy. I always find powder on the counter afterwards. That&#x27;s my main gripe. Also, I got through the product really fast, in only a couple of months, whereas pressed powder sometimes lasts for a year.</li>
            <li> okay, I live in Las Vegas NV and I have a problem with combination skin, I normally have an extremely shiny face and with the powders I was using it made it look so fake and gross. I got this and the elf kabuki brush and it goes on so natural (I&#x27;m very fair skinned) and my face hasn&#x27;t been shiny the past three days I have been using it! I am not sure how it will look on darker skin, but for me the translucent powder is pretty epic, I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have very sensitive skin...a lot of things aggravate it. But this product made my skin look amazing. I used this product before a photo shoot and in the pictures, my skin had the perfect peaches and cream look. I have pale Irish skin but this product brought my skin back to life. Great product and I can&#x27;t wait to use more products from e.l.f.!</li>
            <li> Be careful when opening it or else you&#x27;ll get powder everywhere! Save yourself from having to scoop and vacuum your purchase by NOT removing the plastic film on the inside of it. Otherwise, this is a great powder for any skin type. Mine is oily and this helps to keep oil at bay and leave my T-Zone on the matte side.</li>
            <li> This powder gets everywhere and it makes my face look like a kabuki dancer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The BOMB! Hmmmm......I wonder if I can use it for imperfections on the rest of me! Voila! Size 4 here I come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, for 6 bucks, it works as well as the 30 dollar stuff. It is a bit drying though so some moisturizer is a must beforehand....</li>
            <li> Amazing, makes your makeup look very matte, controls oil and shine!</li>
            <li> I use this on my lipstick to create a mac look and it works wonders I know you can also apply it all over face too.</li>
            <li> The milling on the powder isn&#x27;t quite up to the same standard of some of the high end brands.  Even though the power isn&#x27;t quite as finely grained as those other brands, I keep using this one.  Why?  PRICE.  This is by far the best value for translucent powders.  If I get a few grains that are too coarse to adhere to the skin properly, I use the ELF kabuki brush (another excellent buy) to buff off those bits of powder, and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> This powder sets my makeup perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have to re-apply during the day, unless it&#x27;s a VERY hot day.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it keeps my makeup perfect and my pores are far less noticeable. Plus it feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> not all that ..thought I give it a try bc of the review I am not picky but this product was useless.i usually wear bear minerals and its similar to the mineral veil. I wanted use it since I am learning how to contour my make up. didn&#x27;t see a difference when applied no shimmer, no coverage...almost purposeless.. I use mac shimmer and urban decay bronzer for contour and was hoping to finish with this loose powder but just wasn&#x27;t happy ...but hey for $3 cant complain at least I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Try this. Its smoothing, feels great. Have a fan brush to remove excess.</li>
            <li> I liked this because it sets your makeup , but I hate how its all sparkly. Because if your going for a natural look and you go out in the sun , forget it. Other then that it did a nice job setting my makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m constantly hearing about how great elf products are, sadly I can&#x27;t find a place in Alaska that sells them. this stuff makes your face very smooth and also fills in small pores to give you a even skin surface without caking on the concealer or foundation and it&#x27;s very light. It does fly everywhere when you peal of the plastic and tip it upside down on the pad so beware.</li>
            <li> much less expensive than the other products that do the same thing... it works well. you only need a little as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way.....can cause an ashy appearance if too much is applied.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the size of the powder. I was expecting it to be a lot smaller for the price. This is an excellent inexpensive powder that does not make your make up look caked on. It&#x27;s very smooth and I love it! This purchase will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product.  I was expecting to receive what I paid for in terms of how cheap it is, but it is a great product that I prefer to my more expensive designer powders.  I would definitely purchase this product again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> haha I put this powder on and immediately though of mimes.  White face McGee.  Got to really rub it in your pores to get it to not look like you spilled flour on your face.  Totally takes the oil off your face, actually does its job when you rub it in, but make sure you check your whole face before you put your mirror down, or your husband might think you had white powder doughnuts and didn&#x27;t get any for him.</li>
            <li> does amazing tricks on the skin. looks light but works great and if you are in artificial light all day, you will look great. Flawless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great loose powder. I hate the caked up appearance I sometimes get with normal,powder this give me a nice Matt look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. It does what it&#x27;s described to do. I use it throughout the day to keep my make up looking fresh and get rid of shine. I&#x27;ll definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> My HG powder. Why buy anything else? I love how this sets my foundation. It does have a slight &#x27;blurring&#x27; effect but heed caution: it is easy to apply too much. You&#x27;ll have a white cast and that wont photograph well. For that reason I only recommend it for oily skins. Oil control is fine, nothing to write home about. Oh and the packaging sucks, use a toothpick to poke a few holes through the plastic instead of ripping the plastic cover off.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best translucent powder you can buy, but I promise you It will mattefy your skin. Dry skinned people shouldn&#x27;t use this unless they moisturize like they are dying. It does go on clear and also matte. Shipping was amazing for prime members and I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I was not as impressed with this powder as some reviewers were.  I have a light, olive skin tone and this does nothing for it.  Some reviewers mentioned that it made them look airbrushed or softer but it actually does the opposite for me.  It makes me look sallow and AWFUL in pictures.  I wore this to my sisters engagement party and was MORTIFIED when I saw the pics.</li>
            <li> Soft, 100% translucent, inexpensive, just as good as more expensive brands (like MUFE&#x27;s HD setting powder) for a way better price. The packing is a bit unnecessarily bulky, though.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon after all of the Target stores around me stopped carrying it. The line, e.l.f., is a difficult brand to be a fan of. I love most of their products for their affordability and relative quality but it seems that no two stores carry the same options. I used this powder, bought at Target, for two months before I dropped it on the floor and it exploded everywhere. The white powder is very, very fine and creates quite the mess. Still, I wanted more and went in search of another container at Target. After checking three targets and an Ulta, I couldn&#x27;t find this powder. In steps Amazon to offer it to me for a little more than I paid at the store but at least I was finally going to have it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item arrived intact and I was happy once again. Until another fateful accident. I can&#x27;t keep the &amp;#34;filter cap&amp;#34; on this powder because it isn&#x27;t a tight enough seal and just falls out when I try to shake more powder into the lid creating a mess. Sooooo this time, my cat decided to sniff it and sneezed the biggest sneeze he has ever sneezed. He blew the powder everywhere and contaminated the rest of it. What a mess and a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t bought this again since then but I do think about it often. I wish it had better packaging so sneezes, drops and the like wouldn&#x27;t be the death of it. Perhaps if I order it again I will transfer small amounts to another container for my daily use and then refill that container as needed to keep the full size safely tucked away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please tell e.l.f. to fix the container and make it more spill proof!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this,  It makes all the difference. I dust it on with a brush (instead of the powder puff included)</li>
            <li> I love the natural looking glow that all the celebs have and I figured I would give this a try to see if it works. It is so lightweight and blends perfectly. It makes you shine like a star, yet not excessively. I just love it! I use it as a *finishing touch* highlighter. Works great for a great price. e.l.f is so underrated as great as quality of their products are.</li>
            <li> I only use this as a top coat when I cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;It gives my face a photo ready finish that I really enjoy</li>
            <li> I love high definition powder and ordered this one when my other brand was out of stock.  Can&#x27;t complain at all though it doesn&#x27;t seem to go quite as far as the other one I use.  That said, it is also a bit less pricey so in the end, I will be ordering this one again!</li>
            <li> very cheap, very good quality, just what i was looking for! I love eyes lips face products because of their quality and affordability!</li>
            <li> Good option for those on a budget.  I use it to set makeup in oil prone areas only.  As with all HD powders, will cause camera flashback.</li>
            <li> Very nice to apply on those days when you&#x27;re feeling lazy and don&#x27;t wanna go through the whole makeup routine. I just apply moisturizer and then this and go. Coverage is okay...I mean, this isn&#x27;t really meant for that. But it is terrific at taking away that oily sheen and giving your skin an all-day-long matte finish. Skin looks bright and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though...I don&#x27;t know why, but I can&#x27;t really wear this over my usual foundation. On bare face, it goes on translucent, but on made-up skin it looks a little ghostly. Not sure what&#x27;s going on there.. But overall, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great powder especially for the money</li>
            <li> I love ELF products, I tried this one and I liked it I&#x27;ll say the best features first is the matte finish if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, it&#x27;s not intended to give you a dewy complexion it&#x27;s meant to give you the porcelain doll finish it does somewhat deal the makeup to a nice finish, so for me it&#x27;s something In your make up process you do last after your shadow, after your blush and concealer ect but I&#x27;d say if you have fine lines under the eye you&#x27;ll need a tool to remove access settlement under your eye area because for me I noticed it cakes a bit even though I&#x27;ve only begun to get fine lines. Other than that I love the product and it&#x27;ll make your face feel very soft after make up application</li>
            <li> Definitely not for women of color. The powder is really light and feels really smooth but it does not good on my skin. I would suggest a Ben nye powder!! Don&#x27;t waste your coins.</li>
            <li> As I have read in other reviews, this powder isn&#x27;t transluscent and does leave a trail of white. BUT - it has helped me when I believe my face is just too dark or too bronze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, several times, it ends up turning flakey and there is just a lot of flakes or dustballs (?) on my face and I end up having to take a fan brush and swipe it off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ended up throwing it away but I do love the puff, I kept that!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my engagement and wedding pictures and I loved how it made me look for my engagement pictures so I wear it a few days during the week. It does on light and really does make your makeup stay in place all day! A great purchase, especially for $6!</li>
            <li> I had already read several reviews on several sites before deciding on this powder. The price, as always with E.L.F. is very reasonable The powder is exactly what I expected. It&#x27;s a HD powder that is formulated to well on HD cameras. But, with moisturizer and lots of careful blending, it is actually a gem of a powder. Cute little screwtop case looks chic on my makeup table too!</li>
            <li> Just sits on top of your skin filling any pores and lines with whiteness. Even with a brush and a strong fan, it&#x27;s hard to get a nice finish with this powder. Into the garbage it goes!</li>
            <li> I love the powder. As others have said use a little bit at a time. I lightly coat my brush when I use it. However I do not like the packaging. Whenever I open it, I can never seem to do it carefully enough to not get powder all over the corners and edges of this container....but I end up just using my brush to pick it up. Just wish I didn&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Perfect over foundation and certainly does not appear white on skin! Great for my oily complexion...</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awful and if the reviews are as good as most people feel about it, then I must have recieved a faulty product.  It does the strangest thing on the face and does not look good at all.  It&#x27;s like trying to put construction materials that get sanded off onto your face. I CAN&#x27;T EVEN USE IT.</li>
            <li> I was worried this would look like white powder on my face, because that&#x27;s what it looks like in the container, but it really does go on translucent. It&#x27;s perfect for eliminating shine &amp; keeping makeup where it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Elf is one of my top three favorite cosmetic companies, and face powder is my favorite kind of makeup to use, but I really can&#x27;t say I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the short version of my review.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good price for large quantity&lt;br /&gt;- Actually comes with a decent powder puff thing&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight and not cakey&lt;br /&gt;- Great for oily skin/mattifying&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Looks very ashy when applied&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t stick to brush, puff, or skin&lt;br /&gt;- Messy (more so than most loose powders)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the slightly longer version of my review.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I bought this because so many people said it looked white when applied (it doesn&#x27;t, though I can&#x27;t speak for people with darker skin). It was for a costume, but I figured I could continue using it as a translucent powder afterward. Well, it would be difficult. I&#x27;m about the lightest shade most cosmetic companies produce and while this didn&#x27;t make me look any paler, it still was very obvious I was wearing powder. It looked very ashy and terrible on my face, especially around my nose, and extra blending really didn&#x27;t do much to help. Additionally, it was hard to even apply since it doesn&#x27;t stick to my brushes, the puff, or my face at all. It fell off the brush pretty often and got everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not all bad. I think I might still use this occasionally in the summer when I need a little help mattifying my oily skin, especially considering there&#x27;s a ton of powder in this. It&#x27;s also very lightweight, though that might be because it was hard to apply much with it falling off everywhere. I almost can&#x27;t even feel that I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this unless you&#x27;ve already tried it. I would suggest any one of Elf&#x27;s other translucent powders, or of course a different brand all together.</li>
            <li> Ive loved this HD piwder for a long time .. When applied properly over my concealer/foundation with my dry beauty blender sponge dupe it does give me a flawless airbrushed face .. I also use it for touch ups throughout the day .. 4 stars only because it does give a flashback in photos IF you use too much of it</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. I have a very oily skin, and with this powder I noticed that I didn&#x27;t oil up like I usually do for about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Crazy looking. I&#x27;ve tried applying heavily, lightly, nothing works. You can see the powder sitting on your face and it looks terrible. It doesn&#x27;t have any effect other than lightening your face (after all that work applying everything perfectly) and just looking strange overall.</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT THIS FOR A PHOTO SHOOT AND THIS WORKED PERFECT. I WILL BUY AGAIN. GREAT PRODUCT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but the container could use some work...the lid screws on a bit &amp;#34;wonky&amp;#34; and if you peel the whole inside seal off, the powder has a tendency to fly all over the place. The price is right, though, and I like how well it blends, so I&#x27;ll be buying it again :)</li>
            <li> I like it. You have to be careful not to put too much on and you will have a white tint.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Best powder I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s invisible, the puff doesn&#x27;t drag off my foundation, and it lasts me nearly the whole day (reapply maybe once o twice to forehead, and I have fairly oily skin!). Moreover I dont feel it on my face, and it never causes my skin to irritate. When I do reapply it, it NEVER CAKES. This stuff, for this price is just....ugh, a life saver. I ordered it twice already, and I have every intention of ordering it again and again, without a second glance at the more advertised expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this product blends perfectly with my complexion luv it</li>
            <li> Great service and product</li>
            <li> Bought this set my makeup. It was cheap and it&#x27;s been serving it&#x27;s purpose well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but the translucent is very white if not applied thoroughly even.</li>
            <li> Selected that it causes irritation in error... I use this mainly when I have photo shoots because it sets my makeup and keeps my face looking flawless even after a couple hours of shooting. I have been trying different brands to set my foundation but this is 1 of the best ones I have used.</li>
            <li> quality powder. easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant surprise! I YouTube and this powder is very inexpensive but a lot of people like it. I thought Id try it because summers coming up and I don&#x27;t want to have a sweat hog looking face. So I used this and my face wasnt super shiny &amp; makeup stayed on. I&#x27;m happy w this product.</li>
            <li> Nice powder to set concealer, I&#x27;m using this with a synthetic brush to set my make-up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the powder puff, nice product though. I recommend it for Homestuck, Steven Universe, or any other cosplays that use body/face paint.</li>
            <li> A good product compared to the price</li>
            <li> Let me get my one gripe out of the way first. The packaging is horrible. Turning the cap causes product to pour everywhere and billow into the air. Powder gets stuck on the corner edges of the package and there&#x27;s no stopping it from going EVERYWHERE whenever you put on the lid or take it off. Therefore, I have transferred mine to a baggy with a corner trimmed off one side (very tiny hole). I pour a little out on the back of my hand or in a bowl when I need it, and I keep the corner twisted and taped closed when I&#x27;m not using it. It successfully stops the product from billowing into the air and getting all over the place, but white powder in a plastic baggy does look a little sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder goes on beautifully over foundation, cream blusher, highligher, cream contour, even eyeshadow. It is translucent. It absorbs oil and is soft to the touch when over foundation. If applied over still wet foundation, it is possible to apply too much, which can make you look washed out. It&#x27;s setting powder, not powder foundation. It&#x27;s a fabulous dupe for high end setting powders, and for a very reasonable price. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Packing was excellent. Tamper proof tape was on box. Arrived before estimated arrival time. It&#x27;s absorbs all oils and gives you a radiant glow. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Be careful, when you open it, it goes EVERYWHERE</li>
            <li> elf makes good cosmetics and this is no different.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive powder is comparable to high-end powders in the sixty-dollar range.  It comes white and very finely milled.  I applied it with a powder brush (just a $10 powder brush from Target, the one with the white handle), not the velour pad that came with it.  It has light-diffusing particles that made my fine lines disappear and made my skin look perfect.  And no sparkles.  For $3 I&#x27;m sold.  I&#x27;m quite fair so the white color didn&#x27;t matter, but it seems fairly transculent; if your skin is darker, for $3 it&#x27;s worth the experiment.</li>
            <li> Nope, nope, nope. Disappointed. Makes a mess and although it says fluorescent, it makes me look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> This powder is great over foundation.  It works perfect for very oily skin.  I use it in the morning and reapply if I need to at night. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love this product !! I would definitely repurchase this ! Great for every skin color &amp;&amp; every skin type. I love it !!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was hoping for, it&#x27;s not transparent but if you use just a little amount of it, it won&#x27;t ruin your makeup.</li>
            <li> Provides the perfect coverage for a powder!</li>
            <li> Goes on light and matte. Evens out your blush and contouring. Great finisher before the finishing spray step. Love this.</li>
            <li> Great at minimizing shine as a light coverage over foundation.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, would buy again, powder is nice and smooth, gives a photo ready finish, love this product, would deff buy again.</li>
            <li> If you use loose powder you know it is messy, but you also know nothing else works like it! This particular powder is just as good if not better than the higher end brands I&#x27;ve tried and offers a much lower price tag. The craziest thing is unlike other HD powders this one doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast! It sets make up perfectly and even blurs out pores! It is one of my beauty must haves!</li>
            <li> The packaging is terrible and messy so you have to learn to work with it, but the product, which I use with elfs kabuki brush, is amazing. Will definitely repurchase. I use this as a setting powder and I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t get that oily throughout the day or night.</li>
            <li> I order this routinely, and wish it was on one of the Amazon automatic shippments. I don&#x27;t wear liquid foundation anymore. After moisturizing I apply this face powder just to take away the shine. I bought the Elf applicator brush as well and it is a great combination.</li>
            <li> Very fine powder and because it is translucent, you don&#x27;t have to worry about matching your foundation. Makes your pours look smaller and makeup is refined. A great product!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. I&#x27;m prone to oily shine in my t-Zone. This keeps my nose and forehead shine free all day. Great for the price. Works just as well as the Smashbox version.</li>
            <li> It is wearing powder without looking like you are. It smooths out makeup lines gives a great finish to my makeup. Plus it doesn&#x27;t cost much at all.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all, or as described. It&#x27;s not translucent, it&#x27;s white, it goes on white and looks awful.</li>
            <li> This is really great for the price. .. I was skeptical but really good keeps my face Matt too... makes my make up flawless</li>
            <li> I really like this Face Powder because as soon as you put it on you can feel the face so soft  and also it helps to have the make up on for a longer time.</li>
            <li> While applying too much can make your face a bit white, a light application is all it takes to set my makeup for the day.  Very easy to apply, affordable, and does what it says.  Will buy again when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> And a stellar job with an actual makeup base. Photos look much better and that&#x27;s always a good thing. I don&#x27;t use it often so if it causes any problems I have yet to notice.</li>
            <li> Love ! Just bought one today from makeup forever and tried both work exactly the same! 😍</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff... I think I was expecting more from it so I may be slightly disappointed but it could also just be my self esteem issues... Makeup can only do so much right? Recommend.</li>
            <li> Love, love , love this powder! I was worried that it would make my face a ghost but it is so fine and sets my makeup perfectly.  I did not remove the sticker but poked about ten of the holes on the sticker as I heard it makes a mess if you completely remove the sticker and I believe it.  The powder is so fine and silky smooth, if you took the entire sticker off, it would be everywhere. I tap my brush and swirl then apply to my face and it give me an airbrushed look.  I definitely recommend this powder!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I won this along with a few other E.L.F products in a contest and I always use this on my face. Like others have said, You don&#x27;t need to use too much when you use it. I still have a ton left and I won it early last year! Defiantly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that you cant really tell if its on your face but i do notice a difference when taking pictures and it seems to hold makeup a little longer on your face but it wont last you all day, its very fine powder so it goes on your face very gently. The product gives you a more gentle look in pictures and provides a bit of shine control so its pretty nice</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when this came in the mail. I opened to see very little loose powder in the container and unsealing it made tons of powder fly into the air even when opening carefully.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of other e.l.f products including their mineral primers and tinted moisturizers.  I was hoping this would be a cheaper replacement for my Make Up Forever High Definition Powder which I love but it costs $$$$.  This product is inferior, the powder is not as fine, so it shows up whiter on the skin and is harder to apply, meaning it gets all over the place, on my clothes, eyebrows, countertop...  I used it once and went back to my Make Up Forever.  I would probably only use this e.l.f. powder if I was completely out of my good stuff, but for the price it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it.</li>
            <li> Very good! It help to keep my makeup clean and make my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li> Takes away the shine without causing streaks.</li>
            <li> works ok&lt;br /&gt;very nine price&lt;br /&gt;nothing I would purchase again</li>
            <li> I purchased this product not knowing what to expect from it.I was really hoping i was just as pleased all the people that were leaving great reviews on this product and sure enough i was.I used this the next day when going to school and the moment i brushed it on it made my skin look sooo smooth! I was so surprised at how it blended in everything amazingly! Its really hot where i live and i walk around a very big campus and i already have very oily skin,i honestly thought that i was guna go back to my oily skin in a matter of time but surprisingly that didnt happen! I love love love this product and i know ill keep on buying,it was alot cheaper when i purchased it on amazon so ill probably try to look for it in stores.Its a definite must have!</li>
            <li> I bought this powder after trying qvc cosmetics and department store makeup that was terribly cakes and gross looking. I love love LOVE this powder! I hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up! It seems to give full coverage even though it&#x27;s translucent. If it rains and this powder is on my face it absolutely magically looks perfect still. I am sing this forever! If I get tears under my eyes most powders look unnatural and blotchy when wet but that&#x27;s not the case with this elf high definition powder!</li>
            <li> Same ingredients and performance as the high end brands.  The canister is bigger than I had expected but makes it much easier to get my bigger, fluffier brush into. The pouf is a nice addition for when I am in a hurry or need to take it with me. Keeps me shine free for most of the day (and that is a feat!) and sets my concealer and cream shadows and blushes.  You do get a lot for your money. Besides, MUFE HD powder costs under 25cents each to manufacture, so why pay close to $50 for it?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like using the puff to apply. Tried with a brush. It is OK. I was hoping that there would be a more&lt;br /&gt;iridescent - shimmer look.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is easy to apply and looks very natural on me. And arrived in the time it said that it would.</li>
            <li> no color was added to my face, blended well easy to use&lt;br /&gt;why 8 more words. I do not understand</li>
            <li> I only give this a 4 star because it&#x27;s quite messy after the seal inside has been broken.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d give 5.  Great product.  Dislike the mess.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed that my pores looked smaller, I hadn&#x27;t oil skin all day and, is possibly when you used it can feel as if you had applied baby powder. The color was perfect for me I&#x27;m pale with pink under tone</li>
            <li> Oily face over here, and this is one of those products that I can&#x27;t go without!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I absolutely love it. I put it over my Clinque foundation and powder and I feel like it helps my makeup stay on longer. A little bit goes a long way and I did end up looking like I had flour on my face the first couple of times I used it. Now I just dab a little bit on my nose, forehead and chin and then blend it in well. And of course, you can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> love this powder. great to use a a finishing powder or just as a shine control powder. i think it even lasts all day.</li>
            <li> like applying powder to your face…and rubs off…won&#x27;t be buying it again...</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and I love it!</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, makes my skin feel so smooth! Worth the money for sure. Very cool looking container and design.</li>
            <li> While the powder itself is good and did control my oil for several hours(I am very oily in T-zone) the packaging sucks! Left it sitting flat in my bag and upon opening it was a powder explosion ! I do not like that. Elf needs to fix their packaging for this powder.</li>
            <li> I love - love - love these powders. I do simple make up but it really brings out a glow to my skin.  I wish they looked better in low light photos but its absolutely stunning in the day light.  It feels like silk when I use a kabuki brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheaper now (sep 2014) when sold by Amazon when compared to a seller more than a year ago, by almost three bucks. It is about the same price now as the website and both places require you to buy a certain amount in order to get free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;2. Comes with a little powder puff.&lt;br /&gt;3. 4.4 out of 5 rating by over 1000 customers on the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;1. Ingredients as listed on the website:&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Silica, Tin Oxide, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Sodium Dehydroacetate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May Contain: Mica, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), Manganese Violet (CI 77742), Red 40 Lake (CI 16035), Yellow 5 Lake (CI 19140)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my belief that better ingredients could be used to get a similar result.</li>
            <li> I like Elf for mostly everything I have ever purchased make up-wise from them but this was a disappointment. It did nothing except make my makeup look more chunky.</li>
            <li> This powder keeps me matte longer than any other.  I have tried others but I have come back to this one.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on me (I am very fair though) as long as I pat it on and then knock off the excess.  It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.  I  can&#x27;t compare it to MUFE as I have never tried their hd powder, but I can say that with this I feel no need to try MUFE.</li>
            <li> Buying powder online is a little unsettling, considering matching skin tones and such, so obviously buying a white powder was a little easier for me than one that is my skin tone.  The product arrived, and I really liked the container it came in.  This product is so weightless and glides on so easily.  It sets my make up perfectly, and doesn&#x27;t seem as if I have any extra product on at all.  I like that it keeps me from getting the cakey look that I often find from other powders that are made to match my foundation.  This keeps my makeup flawless for hours and doesn&#x27;t settle into any fine lines.  I can&#x27;t believe the price considering the quality of this product.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> This leaves a white cast that definitely shows in photos. I wouldn&#x27;t use over entire face, only just for setting my undereye concealer. It does give you an HD look effect when applying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff</li>
            <li> Nothing special, doesn&#x27;t blend.  Made me look like a ghost.  Will not buy again.  Gave away to Goodwill. 2 more words.</li>
            <li> This finishing HD powder goes on my skin flawlessly. If I see my makeup doesn&#x27;t look entirely together, I can count on this powder to make me look stunning.</li>
            <li> Too light and fluffy it gets everywhere and is hard to use</li>
            <li> I use this powder alongside my expensive face makeup. It&#x27;s the best sheer powder I&#x27;ve found yet. Even the pouf that comes with it works perfectly. I&#x27;ve repurchased 4 times because I&#x27;m so happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t look too heavy and ghost-like (I have fairly tan skin) and seems to make my makeup last longer. I really love this powder.</li>
            <li> I really love this HD powder, I use it to set my foundation and it&#x27;s great, good amount of product, and it has great coverage, love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom, who&#x27;s most recently used Translucide.  I read reviews for her, and were reviewers ever justified in their rave reviews of this product.  The consensus of opinion of mom, sis, and niece is that this is the best powder EVER, with the finest consistency.  Surprisingly it&#x27;s snow white, appears completely translucent when applied.  The ladies&#x27; complexions range from fair to tawny to olive-toned, and it blended perfectly on them all, and my mom only applied it to in select spots, here and there, not to her entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a plush velvety powder puff with a ribbon strap for fingers, in a square, beveled looking black box that looks to me like an expensive ring box.  Unanimous verdict: FANTASTIC. (BTW, my mother wrestled to pry off the lid, it UNSCREWS, should you have the same tendency.)</li>
            <li> SO PERFECT! THANKS I WILL BUYING MORE PRODUCTS IN YOUR STORE</li>
            <li> Be prepared to waste a lot of product. The package is terrible and whenever the container is opened a lot of the product is wasted and falls out of the container on to your hands and floor.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the best powder I&#x27;ve tried.  I saw it listed in beauty mag feed as an inexpensive trade off for a $90 powder.  Darned if they weren&#x27;t right on the money. I look poreless which is a feat.  It&#x27;s a screwtop which is odd &amp; you&#x27;ll want to use your own brush for best distribution.  I got this on an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; &amp; it really was a steal.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m used to setting my make-up with a mist but this powder works well too it isn&#x27;t i also us it for my dark skin clients to set in their high light because it don&#x27;t make them look ghostly</li>
            <li> I had never used this kind of powder before, but love that it does not interfere with your make up, or change the color.  Very lightweight.  It will take me a long time to use it up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay.  I usually love elf products but there is better powder out there.  It works fine just not as flawless as other powders.</li>
            <li> I just bought this HD powder at Target after I  read some of the interviews on Amazon. It really does work amazing! A little goes a long way. I only used a little and it made my skin look smooth and radiant. Would definitely buy again in the future!!</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin in my t-zone, my cheeks are moderately dry and the rest of my face is normal.  However, I couldn&#x27;t stand having this powder on any part of my face for longer than an hour.  I only used a very small amount and mainly put it in places where my face wasn&#x27;t super dry but it dried out my skin HORRIBLY.  I had to wipe it off because it was driving me crazy and I drowned my face in moisturizer right after.  Do not buy this if you have dry skin.  It was translucent at least.  I will let my mom use this and see if she likes it since her face is more on the oily side.  I really want to be able to find something that will set my face but I don&#x27;t think with skin as dry as mine that will be possible.</li>
            <li> This is great to smooth out a finished face. One drawback and it&#x27;s minor....It&#x27;s white and that, I think, gives the desired affect but it lightens up makeup maybe more than you may want. If you are going for a flawless porcelain face this is dead on. Maybe mixing a skin tone powder would help. I tried a little bronzer dusted over and it seemed to wipe it away. If anyone can advise something better I&#x27;m all ears.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my skin smooth and not looking oily all day. Don&#x27;t use the sponge pad thing that comes with this product cause it&#x27;ll just scratch off your foundation cause it&#x27;s really stiff, but be careful when you use a powder brush cause this powder is very very fine. If you get too much on your brush, you&#x27;ll get a very powdery finish which just highlights your oh so cute peach fuzz hairs on your face.</li>
            <li> this translucent powder made me look so cakey it was unbelievable and definitely not clear</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive loose face powder and works very well.  It&#x27;s white, but does not leave a white cast on the skin.  I&#x27;ve repurchased this product.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t to sure about the powder and how it would look on my skin since im light skinned, but after applying it properly it made me look great. The key is you really just need know where and how to put it. Overall this product is great and I definitely recommend it to women who want to look beautiful.</li>
            <li> it is so good I really use is light I love it</li>
            <li> Tricky to open, at first. The top screws off/on.</li>
            <li> I prefer MAC&#x27;s primer powder of course, but this is an ok alternative.  I am going to see if I can find something better.  This is definitely not something I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally getting the hang of face powder.  this face powder is what you use to set your entire face at the end.  It does a great job.  I like the packaging and how well it was sealed.  Feels like an expensive brand but it wasn&#x27;t.  not sure how this would work alone.  I sued it with the &amp;#34;Studio Kabuki face brush&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love love love this! This is way better than any other powder I&#x27;ve used! I gave this a try because I decided to drop the colored loose powder and my Hard Candy Translucent one was good, but really didn&#x27;t cut it, haha :) So I went to Target and got this ELF powder for only $6. The next morning I used it to set my mousse foundation, and WOW! My face looked so even, everything was perfect. My old loose powder didn&#x27;t give me great results like this, all my old one did was make my face look cakey. With this, a little goes a long way and it actually helps define your face just like it&#x27;s suppose to! I will forever use this!</li>
            <li> My skin is on the fair side. The positive review on Amazon was written by a black woman. I didn&#x27;t know how it would work for my coloring, but took a chance. I have ordered it three times. I do not use it with the puff provided. I use a makeup brush straight in the powder and brush off the excess; hence, it goes fast, but it&#x27;s cheap. It is truly neutral and almost invisible. It doesn&#x27;t last all day for me, but long enough. It sets my foundation or tinted moisturizer, which is the main reason why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this powder lasts forever and stays all day:) I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not the best powder I have ever had. Not anything I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like to use a brush with this and the container allows me to easier pull out the insert. It wears incredibly well.  I do have to reapply but I attribute this to my oily skin.</li>
            <li> It highlights my skin and makes my skin soft It&#x27;s a very good finishing powder!</li>
            <li> I use pretty high end makeup so my makeup hardly ever moves. But it does add a lil sumthin sumthin to my face. So overall me likey!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Those that are saying it&#x27;s too pigmented or gives them a white cast they are using WAY too much product which isn&#x27;t hard to do. I prefer to use a light dusting with my own kabuki. The puff that comes with it definitely gives you way too much product. If you love other expensive HD powders you&#x27;ll love this one!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed  with this product.</li>
            <li> Not a good product it&#x27;s like putting baby powder on your face and it doesn&#x27;t even blend in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for mattifying your face, but I find that after a few hours I need to reapply and I don&#x27;t have oily skin, I still like it more than other high end products I&#x27;ve tried. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a light weight face powder and this is it.  Goes on well and evens texture.</li>
            <li> I decided I would not reorder this product although it does have such a very low rating by EWG for chemicals. It is, too, white for me and washed out my tan. In my research reviews stated that it was messy. I followed the reviewer&#x27;s advice to only pull the seal back a little to control the out-pour of powder that can result in a mess and loss.</li>
            <li> this stuff is supposed to be comparable to Makeup Forever&#x27;s HD powder and I&#x27;ve never tried that but this makes my skin really silky and matte. if you have oily skin, definitely get this. it sucks all moisture right up and gives you a silky matte finish. a little goes a long way, or you&#x27;ll look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> Nice powder, good color. Came as ordered as expected and i have recommended to friends. Will buy again in future.</li>
            <li> very nice powder, great soft focus, but very messy.  The packaging leaks powder everywhere (when you shake it to sift the powder through the screen), which is why I gave it 4 stars.  Would buy again as it is a great price.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought. Easy to use and has power puff inside. It finish my makeup in a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> Ok, but too &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;...makes me look like I need oxygen</li>
            <li> I first tried this powder when it came as a bonus with another purchase, and I immediately loved it. This is hands-down the best finishing powder I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s super fine and disguises imperfections well. Although it&#x27;s white in color, it doesn&#x27;t look white or washed out when it&#x27;s on. It doesn&#x27;t rub off like some other powders. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I own this product and I really love it.  However, I am absolutely amazed at how many people are purchasing this product from sites other than eyes lips face actual Web site.  People should check it out they have sales ALL the time, great ones, and this product without a sale is literally half this price.  It&#x27;s crazy that anyone would pay 13.00 for this product plus additional shipping charges.  Before you buy any ELF product, you should view their Web site.  Most products are $1 to $3.00 and others are a great price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s white and a little goes a long way.  If you add too much you could look a little washed out but it does work great!</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> Works well, only complaint is that the container has large holes so a lot of product comes out at once. This makes it go on heavy. I just use a really fluffy brush and it works.</li>
            <li> I biennium use Makeup Forever HD but ran out...I bought this as an alternative. Sadly the consistency wasn&#x27;t right for my face and Ues I use very little still it shows uo white and a bit grainy.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return it but I ordered it through a third party and taking 15% from the cost isn&#x27;t my idea of satisfaction. Please understand the return policy from third party vendors.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the vendor has another item I may b able to buy</li>
            <li> This powder is amazing! To be honest, at first I thought for the price it was not  going to give me the full coverage as with any of my other powders, but it actually works better! And I didn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;funeral home finish&amp;#34;, but I was more like can you say, &amp;#34;red carpet ready&amp;#34;! Great product.  I definitely recommend trying it for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Item was everything I wanted and correct color, feels good on face and does what it was suppose to and look like.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown skin and I am able to use this, with a kabuki brush.  I tried using the little pad that comes with it, but I didn&#x27;t like the results at all.  It felt caked on...or something, and seeing my foundation being transferred from my face to the pad irritated me for some reason. Irrational?  Probably.  With the brush, it does a great job fighting the shine on my face.  It kind of reminds me of wearing a matte nail polish.  It DOES feel a little chalky, but since it does what I need it too, I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because the ratings were so stellar and it&#x27;s so cheap that I figured i mind as well.  I love it.  I have very light skin and this may make it a teensy bit lighter, but it does give a really nice finish.  If you get too much, on your face it blends easily.  I also have bare minerals and i prefer elf. The only bummer is that if i have a highlighter like becca or benefit hi beam on then this sort of obscures it.</li>
            <li> Great, efficient translucent powder. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.  I like the packaging too.  Cannot believe how affordable this is.</li>
            <li> When used with a light hand it doesn&#x27;t create a chalky finish but I&#x27;m also not blown away.  I don&#x27;t feel like it produces a finish superior to other powders I&#x27;ve used. So far I&#x27;ve tried lightly sweeping it on with a big loose brush and buffing it in with a dense kabuki brush. The price is extremely reasonable so I am holding out hope that I will eventually find the right technique to produce the amazing results others have reported.</li>
            <li> I love it, It&#x27;s great! It leaves your face absolutely flawless. It leaves a smooth finish and beautiful glow. I personally love Eyes, Lips and face. This has an awesome long lasting effect and a little goes a long way. My skin looks absolutely incredible. I would definitely stick with this product. Thank you E.L.F for making such great product.</li>
            <li> I have grown accustomed to a certain level a qaulity from ELF but this loose powder misses the mark.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on very long and the mail ingredient is cornstarch.  If I had known that before I bought this I would not have.  This item did not work well for me.  Admittedly I have oily skin but this loose powder is not build able and added nothing to my make regiment.</li>
            <li> I like to wear makeup and I&#x27;d been wanting to try a setting powder like this for awhile. I always hear great things about the Makeup Forever High Definition powder, but it&#x27;s too pricey for me right now, so I tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the product. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34; as what I&#x27;ve heard about the Makeup Forever brand (which I haven&#x27;t tried, so I can&#x27;t really compare), but I think it sets my makeup nicely. Definitely worth the price. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not the best powder I&#x27;ve ever tried, but not the worst, either.  It starts to look cakey very quickly, so be careful that you&#x27;re not applying too much (I almost always end up putting too much on).  However, it is translucent, so I&#x27;ve been able to use it on several different people with diverse skintones and it&#x27;s worked for everyone from me, with my vampire-white skin, to my friend Melissa, who has deep chocolate brown skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! Everything feels and looks so smooth!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with very large pores. I buff this stuff onto my face after applying my regular colored powder and fills in all the nooks, crannies, and leftover pores. I can definitely tell a difference after applying. Great dupe for MUFE HD Microfinish Powder, can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This powder works but don&#x27;t expect a whole lot from it. It&#x27;s an ok powder but dosent work wonders. Arrived pretty quickly</li>
            <li> This product truly makes my face look like porcelain! I have oily skin with pretty large pores, but this (applied with the Studio Kabuki Face Brush) makes the finish oh so nice! Do note, when I use this product and am photographed with a flash, I look like a vampire... just something to keep in mind :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is the finishing touch that both sets my makeup and erases any last traces of those annoying imperfections while giving a wonderful soft focus effect.  To answer some questions I had before I received this item...  It does not have a shimmer to it and it is extremely fine and a little bit goes a long way.  I would recommend skipping the puff that comes with it for a soft all over face brush.  I would also warn that due to the extremely fine nature of the powder, it can get a little messy if you are not careful.  Don&#x27;t breathe to hard around this stuff!  But the risk of creating a powder cloud in your bathroom is far outweighed by the amazing performance of this product.  E.L.F. has it listed as six dollars on their website.  If you are planning to get more of their products it might make sense to shop at their site rather than here.  They often have deals for free shipping or other deals that can make shipping a non-issue and the end price cheaper.  If this is the only product you are buying and there are no deals, amazon does have the best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> For the record, I bought this in store, where it&#x27;s cheaper ($3.00).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me be honest: The container that it comes in is not good.  No matter how careful you are with it, whenever you open it powder gets EVERYWHERE.  It&#x27;s so messy, and I wish ELF would put it in a more secure container, because it really is a hassle to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, onward to the review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a loose powder, ELF&#x27;s powder is one of my favorites.  I believe it&#x27;s a dupe for higher end powders, I haven&#x27;t tried many higher end ones so I can&#x27;t say if that&#x27;s true or not.  The container comes with a small puff which I actually DON&#x27;T use because I find it takes too much of the product.  If you use too much of this product, it will make your face look really cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder is very fine and white.  I use a brush (ELF&#x27;s blush brush, believe it or not) and only use a SMALL amount, just to barely coat the brush, to sweep this onto my T-zone.  This powder works well at making any areas matte, so I like to sweep it on my nose, forehead, chin, etc.  I also use it to keep my concealer and foundation into place, so under my eyes it goes.  It does keep everything in place and does not make my skin look cakey -- IF I use a little amount.  Do not use a lot, you don&#x27;t need much to get good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little side note, I also use this to soak up any sweat on my face if I&#x27;m outside during the heat.  Works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another small gripe -- if you take flash photos, this powder makes your skin look whiter.  Perhaps that&#x27;s a plus for some people, but for me I make the color white look dark, so I definitely don&#x27;t need to look whiter!  It does make your skin look really flawless and soft in photos though.  I love how it makes my skin look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Great product from ELF, but you only need a small amount.  The container sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bare minerals mineral veil ADDICT but this is a wonderful substitute. I will be using this instead from now on. The price is wonderful and it makes my face look flawless. LOOOVEEE!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Looking forward to buying more elf products.</li>
            <li> I use this after my make up application and it blends everything in finishing the look not cakey very lightweight!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get... I don&#x27;t know how this is enhancing or &amp;#34;fixing&amp;#34; anything. My got the &amp;#34;Translucent&amp;#34; powder as a gift, I was really looking forward to trying it out because I had heard good things too. I originally used the puff pad that came with it, it not only wiped some of my foundation/blush off, but it wasn&#x27;t able to blend. I was left with white smears on my face even after I thought I blended it all, they showed up under my eyes and under my nose later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I tried taking my time and using a blush or what looks like kabuki brush. It blended this time but I couldn&#x27;t see what the fuss was about. It says &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; look, I didn&#x27;t see a glow or warming effect. I thought I looked a little lighter which was weird looking for me because I&#x27;m tan/mixed race (part black). I couldn&#x27;t see how someone any darker than me would want to wear this either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even watched videos and professionals (MUAs, entertainment workers) reviews to make sure I&#x27;m doing it &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t see any cracks or lines blended or filled, it&#x27;s like a very very very VERY VERY fine soft focus look, a matte finish. I already use a matte foundation so maybe that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t see a difference. If anything it looks worse because my face looked very flat, if that makes sense. Very matte and caked and artificial. Maybe it&#x27;s good for photo shoots, (I hope so, I&#x27;m a model - that&#x27;s why I wanted it), but I see no positive difference to the naked eye.</li>
            <li> Quite nice ! Really gives the blurry soft focus you want. Doesn&#x27;t stay all day but it&#x27;s quite good, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a translucent powder and this one is it. I tend to use my brush and not the puff that came with it just because I don&#x27;t want to dirty it. But it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> takes practice. Works best as a highlighter. does nothing for fine lines or aging skin skin.anything for aging skiskin</li>
            <li> This product arrived very promptly. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it isn&#x27;t that translucent of a powder. It leaves a white powdery film on my skin. Not a big fan of the product but I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this powder, but I may have been using it incorrectly. I noticed it didn&#x27;t blend well on my face no matter how little I used, always leaving me with a very pale complexion. I definitely think it&#x27;s a useful setting powder, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if for use all over the face.</li>
            <li> for a very natual look</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder! Great for diminishing facial creases!</li>
            <li> Having said excellent, I want to also say, I have nothing else to compare it to. This is my first time using high definition face powder. I use it in combination with other high definition products and the finish looks really refined and professional.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of vitiligo spots on my skin so I get to use a multitude of products on my face.  This powder sets it all in the most flawless finish I have ever seen.  My skin looks absolutely incredible!!  I have to repeat what others have said, a little goes a long way.  I use the puff but that&#x27;s just a personal preference.  I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman and this powder does not work well in pictures, it gives a ghostly cast. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is a good dupe for Makeup Forever&#x27;s HD powder. I have oily, sensitive skin and this gives me a nice, matte look and doesn&#x27;t break me out. It helps my make-up last a bit longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that the container is terrible (as has been mentioned before); there&#x27;s no way to neatly transport this thing anywhere and the powder gets everywhere. It&#x27;s translucent, but it does make my face appear a little white in photos; it also makes my skin look smooth in pictures. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice powder.  It comes in a matte black case with a powder puff.  This really is translucent, and is great for setting foundation and concealer.  This keeps the concealer from creasing under my eyes all day.  I already bought another backup one for when I run out!  This is a good price for the powder compared to many other brands, but it is even cheaper at eyeslipsface.com, where I buy all of my e.l.f. cosmetics, now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I love this powder!  I would highly recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this powder to set my makeup for a while now and it works really well. It&#x27;s a great dupe for MUFE HD Microfinish powder. I love that it&#x27;s really light, and it does a great job controlling shine and camouflaging large pores and fine lines. That being said, it&#x27;s important not to use too much! Otherwise it gives off a white cast. This is especially true if you&#x27;re going to be taking pictures with flash, because an excess of powder will show up in your photos. I&#x27;ve heard that this effect is exacerbated if you have a dark complexion, but my skin is so pale that I haven&#x27;t had that experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for me is the packaging. Make sure you keep the accompanying puff in the container when you close it, especially if you&#x27;re travelling with it! Otherwise the powder gets everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I really recommend this product. At this price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I just received my package with ALL my orders in it, and the first thing I saw was all the bottles of glass foundation was broken . Foundation was all over everything in my package, AND EVERY BOTTLE WAS BROKEN. I CAN&#x27;T USE ANY OF THEM. Or ANYTHING ELSE IN MY ORDER. I am so DISSAPOINTED AND DISPLEASED.</li>
            <li> This powder makes my skin look so finished and good!</li>
            <li> Scent free, really sets makeup, have worn for 16 hr. day and skin still looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I was tired of messing everything with my face. this powder gave me the solution. In addition, it covers all the oil on my face. but I must still use the other type when I have to hide some imperfections</li>
            <li> Love love love this product, it makes your skin feel so smooth but sets foundation amazingly. I got it in sheer &amp; I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this powder. It does a great job covering up but at the same time it adds a vibrance. It goes on white, but it covers up enough of the redness of my skin. It stays on, too!</li>
            <li> This powder is so lightweight. It doesn&#x27;t cake on my face (I use several layers of products), gives me a nice even texture and stays all day long. My husband complimented me on my skin after using this. And I barely have to use any! Won&#x27;t clog my pores or change my face color. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It erases pores and shine and it looks so natural! I wont use another powder</li>
            <li> Light finishing powder. Works great.</li>
            <li> I use this as a finishing powder after applying my liquid foundation to mattify it and set it in place since I didn&#x27;t like the gel-like feeling of my liquid foundation after applying it. It does lighten my foundation color a little bit, but not enough to make a big difference. I like that the list of ingredients is pretty small and none of them seem too toxic.</li>
            <li> I really like this product on my lips to keep my lipstick in place during the day. I also like it as a face powder to set my foundation.</li>
            <li> This HD face powder provides a smooth &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; all day, no &amp;#34;caking&amp;#34; or shine.  Highly recommend for busy people like my wife, who works 18 hours days.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice it&#x27;s purpose. The quality of the product and packaging itself is good. Didn&#x27;t do nothing for me though.</li>
            <li> Going to give it three stars because from what I&#x27;ve experienced it really isn&#x27;t good. (I&#x27;m new to makeup and probably not using is right) The only reason I bought this is because I thought it was essential to have a setting powder in your makeup kit. Instead of this I use the Elf Setting Spray mist and it makes my makeup natural and last a very long time. I guess I&#x27;m more into the dewy, natural look so this stuff isn&#x27;t for me. I wear the shade cream Carmel in Clinique beyond perfecting. Maybe this product is only for fair skinned people lol. The fact that it&#x27;s white makes me scared to apply it to my skin color. I&#x27;ll experiment with it more and update my review.</li>
            <li> Love it! I think it&#x27;s better than NYX and cheaper, too!</li>
            <li> This is great for pale skinned beauties who don&#x27;t want the orange look of most setting powders. Leaves a nice matte finish and makes makeup stay in place. I spritz my face with a setting powder if I want a dewy look. Can&#x27;t beat the price, it works like MUFE translucent for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Does cause a little bit of a white cast in flash photography but other than its a nice setting powder.</li>
            <li> Go to the elf Studio website if this is more then $6. Got this first on Amazon for $8 before I realized it was cheaper on the elf site. Other than that, this powder sets your makeup and you have no shine. I am black and even though this makeup is white it is translucent and really does not lighten your skin tone, unless you are wearing a foundation that is too light for you. I know there is a generic version of what is sold at Sephora for over $25 but it works for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, it&#x27;s so finely milled that it makes the staying power of your foundation last for about 8 to 10 hours for me anyway and if I need my makeup to last longer including my eyeshadow I just dust this on again and ta da. I also have sensitive skin and this has never made me break out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and I do find if I don&#x27;t dust it off a little after I set my foundation I look a little to white in some areas so I sometimes have to add just a tad bit of bronzer or I spray on a setting spray to make it blend. I like to set it well but that&#x27;s only to prevent from having to touch up later and its so light weight that I don&#x27;t ever worry about adding to much. It works really well and always gives me a flawless look. I highly recommend this, its a staple in my makeup routine!</li>
            <li> I have all three versions of this powder (translucent, corrective yellow and shimmer). It&#x27;s great! It leaves your face looking absolutely flawless! However, you should use a light hand with it and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a setting powder - I am extremely fair and if I apply too much it does make me look ghostly. Instead, I use it as a finishing powder, just a light application to seal in my makeup after I&#x27;ve finished everything and, for that purpose, it is absolutely AMAZING! I will repurchase this over and over again, although one container lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a  big fan of elf products but this one is tooo light. I&#x27;m a pale person but this is just way too light. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s supposed to do either. I put it on after my foundation and it did nothing really. I tapped as much of the powder off as I could before applying and it still was too pale. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong but I just don&#x27;t get this.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it would be good for a powder cover. Not cover much but mostly oil control. I&#x27;m not oily but the foundation is. The thing is it&#x27;s TOO light. I can&#x27;t use it. If anyone knows how to actually use this,, maybe I&#x27;m just makeup challenged, I just don&#x27;t get it. I&#x27;ll stick to my covergirl powder for now.</li>
            <li> Very nice finishing powder, stays on all day! Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> I may be using this product incorrectly, but I see absolutely no benefits to applying it over my base make-up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so messy. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, I&#x27;d rather put on my foundation without setting just because of this product. I think I&#x27;ll pay for something a bit more expensive next time. Not that great for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing it was a dupe for more expensive brands, and I definitely believe it. It&#x27;s very fine and makes my makeup stay on all day. However, it&#x27;s completely matte...I do wish it had some light-reflecting properties. Nonetheless, I will definitely replace it when it&#x27;s empty (which by the way won&#x27;t be for a long time...it&#x27;s a large container and a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> Love this powder. Didn&#x27;t sink into my pores and make them look even larger as most powders do. I use this to take the shine away from my makeup and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a combination skin type, your pretty typical t-zone oily and mostly normal to dry everywhere else. I tried this powder using it VERY sparingly and found that it makes me extremely matte, as in slightly cakey. It did not give me the finished look I was after. I would use this in the areas where I would get oily throughout the day but that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> Every time I go to the store, this powder is always sold out. Was able to find on Amazon [more expensive.. thus 4 stars]. Powder is very fine. I purchased it in translucent as a finisher/to set over my makeup. Works well. I blend/swirl it on and does make it somewhat airbrushed looking [I have acne so my face is never &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;]. The packaging can be a tab messy, but im careful with it. I think if I had it in my purse and it was on its side and moving, a lot of the power would end up coming out... so I probably wont end up taking it with me on a normal day to day basis. Will purchase again [maybe in the vixen color], but hopefully at Target since its cheaper [its $3 there!]</li>
            <li> I first started using MAC translucent powder, but when I ran out, I decided to try a less-expensive option. That&#x27;s when I found this powder on Amazon. I was worried about trying a new product because my skin is frustratingly sensitive to many types of make-up. This powder does not disappoint. My skin looks luminous, feels soft and smooth, and does not break out. I actually like it better than the MAC powder I was using. If you&#x27;ve been using a more expensive version of this product, I definitely think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> First time trying this or any high def powder.  I use it as a finishing powder.  Does minimize pores on chin and around nose, keeps makeup in place.  Has a white finish so may be a problem with darker skin tones, I&#x27;m a light/medium.  Would definitely recommend and will purchase again. Maybe mix this with my mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> I have used this 1 or 2 times so far over BB cream, I have very oily and shiny skin so I was hoping this would set my BB cream but Im not sure if this fits the cause. Will try it some more but it was a good buy to add to my makeup collection</li>
            <li> Not sure why the other reviewers have an issue with both the packaging and the product but this is much better then the pressed powder I used to wear. I got the white. The product has a screw cap and I opened it and closed it a bunch of times and not have had any powder come out. This may be an issue for people that carry their makeup on them I guess, since any powder like this will be tough to keep from coming out but if you leave this upright you should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not make my face sparkly. It does not make my face look caked. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I have anything on my face. It does not make me look pale. I have not taken a flash photo but I avoid flash photos anyways as they tend to look bad no matter who or what the focus is so I&#x27;m not sure if that would be an issue. I think the large issue here is that you can&#x27;t use too much. I don&#x27;t need to nor want to have to use much makeup so this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update if any of this ends up changing but I think I&#x27;ll be very happy and I do believe it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder as a finisher.  First of all, I put on spf everyday, and so I already have a somewhat dewy start to my face, but spf is very important so don&#x27;t skip that!  However, I also live in a humid climate and produce oil mainly in the t-zone throughout the day.  This powder SERIOUSLY has minimized the &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; of my make up and I only use in the morning before I head out for the day.  It&#x27;s kind of big, so that&#x27;s one of the reasons I don&#x27;t carry it along, but honestly I don&#x27;t need more than one application in the morning on a typical day anyway.</li>
            <li> So i bought this here, it&#x27;s pretty good price, it has like this shimery shine when you take pictures u lighted up more and just dont ware to much tho..</li>
            <li> I am a Black woman and I love this product. It is truly translucent. I did not order it online. 12 dollars is a bit excessive. Go to Target and buy it for 3 bucks. OR just go to ELF.com and order it there. I think that this is good for all skin complexions and types.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.  I will buy again and feel no need to upgrade to a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> VERY translucent, and does exactly what it says - creates a smooth, photo-ready appearance and fills in the shadows caused by bumps and scars on less-than-flawless skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this sets my makeup. Makes my face look very even, polished &amp; smooth! Love how it catches the light &amp; does great when your taking pictures. Got what I wanted so very pleased.</li>
            <li> ok so you can buy this for 6.00 on the ELF website</li>
            <li> its not good but not bad, its cheap and works decent until i buy a new. it looks better with a setting spray, and its not as fine as it should be.</li>
            <li> The product is not only packaged beautifully but it also works as it should. I have very oily skin and this products helps maintain that shine. I also have very sensitive skin, so trying unfamiliar products out are very scary. I did not have any kind of reaction from this powder so that is a huge plus. I would recommend everyone to try this product out to give you that camera ready look!</li>
            <li> excelent product. the shipping speed was awesome. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I like that it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my foundation like other tinted powders tend to do.  You definitely need to be sure to blend in all the powder though - otherwise you can see it under bright lights or flashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 and more than aware of my not so fine lines, but this stuff makes my skin look young and beautiful. It also aids in blending my contouring thus giving it a natural effect. I love this stuff and my skin feels like silk. Not sure what I would do if they stopped making this.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of E.L.F cosmetics and got this right when it came out and I really love it. I don&#x27;t usually use a setting powder because I feel like it can give my dry skin a nasty cakey look now matter how I use it but after trying this, I am a new fan of setting powder. This gives me a soft, flawless finish. I don&#x27;t know about it helping my foundation last longer because I use the Revlon Whipped foundation and that lasts all day on me but it certainly makes it look even more gorgeous. I like the look of the matte black packaging but the inside sifter is a bit messy. Make sure you keep the sticker on the sifter-just poke a few holes with a needle. That helps cut down on the mess. The puff is really nice and soft and is easy to clean. It always works really well as a quick dry shampoo for bangs also. I ran out of dry shampoo so I decided to try this and it did the job and kept my hair looking healthy-it didn&#x27;t look dull or have a film at all. It really adds texture and volume to your roots too. All in all, a fabulous little powder from E.L.F!</li>
            <li> Best mattifying powder I&#x27;ve ever used. And it blurs my huge pores too! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily/combo skin, which i don&#x27;t really mind most of the time as I tend to just look dewey. But because I put on a layer of sunscreen everyday, it makes me even shinier, so this powder is good for covering that. For me it doesn&#x27;t last all day, maybe just a couple hours before I have to reapply or use blotting tissues.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this does NOT create an issue. It leaves a smooth finish. I am a nurse and my makeup tends to &#x27;melt&#x27; off most days. This helps my makeup last longer. I use an oil-free moisturizer, mineral foundation and then this. Works great!</li>
            <li> I dont know why this gets a lot of 5 stars. The packaging is fine, the powder is white. In pictures it looks funny, there is nothing HD about this powder. I&#x27;m light complected and really knowlegable about makeup, this would not be good on any skin tone its wayyyy to white. After placing it on your face you have to brush it off and even then it looks like there is a white filter all over. I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this for two different things.  First, I am a ghost in a play and have used this to set my Snazaroo face paint (white, black, metallic grey, blue).  I also used it last night over lime green Snazaroo face paint when I was Elphaba at a Halloween party.  This is exactly the powder I needed.  It truly disappears even over a darkish color.  It seems like this powder will last a long time.  The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the little powder puff thing.  I really prefer a big brush for powder, but since I already had one, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> Provides airbrushed finish. A light touch is required to keep product from settling. There is just the faintest shimmer, which may or not be desireable. Packaging is nice and price is unbeatable. I would be concerned about the effect this would have on delicate skin if used regularly</li>
            <li> I like this product ... I like the finish and the price especially if you compare with the higher end brands!</li>
            <li> This powder mattifies my face and makes my skin feel soft without looking cakey. It even slightly reduces the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading all of the amazing reviews on MakeUpAlley. I got it at Target for $6, which can&#x27;t be beat. I hate paying shipping for something I can get around the corner, ya know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the first day I tried this I didn&#x27;t see the big deal. I couldn&#x27;t even notice a difference when I first applied. And then about 7 hours later I was at work and went into the restroom and saw myself in the mirror...and I was shocked. My makeup looked just like it did that morning, when usually by that time of day I have a washed out, red cheek effect happening. I have been using it every day since for a week and I am still impressed. My makeup holds all day and looks fresh. I apply it on top of a my liquid concealer and powder foundation. I do just a light dusting all over my face and then finish with bronzer. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and soft, and stays on for long wear doing heavy activity, giving great coverage. Will be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> Most amazing powder ever!!! I have very oily skin and every foundation and powder I have ever used has always caked an hour after putting it on. Even expensive brands like Lancôme and Dior. This didn&#x27;t! Lasted all day while cooking thanksgiving dinner and I have never seen my face so oil free before! I am so amazed with this powder! I am getting it for my clients, mom, sister in law, and every woman I know this Xmas cuz it is just that great!! And omg the price can&#x27;t be beat! Sephora has an HD powder like this that is 30$ a jar and it sucked E.L.F. Powder kicked it&#x27;s butt. Thank you Amazon for bringing me such a great product and it was someone else&#x27;s review here that praised it and encouraged me to buy-this I encourage others to buy it. I am also a licensed cosmetologist and make up artist so I have one recommendation in this products use- apply with a soft powder brush, not the puff that comes with it or a kabuki brush! Only use a soft powder brush! one last thing this powder minimizes all kinds of imperfections- from acne scars to crows feet when used over a foundation or bb/ cc foundation. It did very well for me with only a sheer tinted moisturizer and it covered Or minimized the appearance of my scars without feeling heavy! It melts into the skin and truly feels weightless!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this powder.  I have oily skin and hate wearing any thing other than eyeliner and mascara.... no issue with this powder.  Its light on the skin and never looks caked on.  I bought the white powder and love that it just makes my skin look matte.  great product.</li>
            <li> Get this instead of the pricy stuff! It&#x27;s awesome! Love it!</li>
            <li> This high-definition powder has turned my skin into a finely painted image in photos. Before I suffered from reflective skin (shiny skin syndrome is what I nicknamed it) and my images had to be doctored so my forehead did not look like a mirror. Now I do not have to worry about that. Flash or no flash, this helps my skin look flawless!</li>
            <li> Very high quality product for so little money.Its on par witth the big name brands but for a fraction of the price.Goes on smooth and covers well.nice fine powder really like the package it came in kepps everything nea.</li>
            <li> Love this! It really gives your face a glow. Must have</li>
            <li> This product is probably more for fairer skinned individuals which I am definitely not, maybe if you blend it well well with a powder brush it will blend but, when I went to take pictures I looked like a crack whore or something..lol highly embarrassing.</li>
            <li> My face always feels &amp;#34;painted&amp;#34; after applying my liquid foundation but putting this on after it works wonders! It makes my face feel silky soft and make my foundation look natural and blended in. I was between many different translucent face powders and I&#x27;m glad I got this one! My only concern was the powder is difficult to get out of the box. Its extremely thin, once you get it out through the holes it falls back through them again and if you put it in the cap the powder goes everywhere when trying to pit in back in the box. But besides the container the product works GREAT!</li>
            <li> This powder does an excellent job of creating a matte look and locking in my concealer. My only complaint is that there is a white cast left on your face. For the price, I&#x27;m over the moon about this product. I&#x27;ve repurchased it three times.</li>
            <li> I love the price of ELF make up products, but what I love more is they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> This powder is great. Much cheaper than MUFE&#x27;s high def powder but works just as well. Get it in translucent- the white color blends right in so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the color matching your face. Translucent will work for anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an HD finishing powder. I think that the product seems to work well. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this. It has good coverage and has a matte look on the skin but it broke my skin out so bad. I have sensitive/acne prone skin and this made my skin freak out. the powder is fine and has a nice texture. I think if you have normal skin or oily skin this would work well for you.</li>
            <li> Love this powder.  It blurs nicely, has a great relationship with my skin (aka, oil control without dry patches), and really does set my makeup beautifully.  The powder puff is a little awkward (who uses a powder puff??), so the packaging part is not perfect.  But that&#x27;s a small thing, and the powder itself is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Peta says ELF is cruelty-free.  DIG IT!</li>
            <li> I really like this powder. It help set your make up. It&#x27;s light and easy to apply if you use a brush.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan. This hasn&#x27;t done anything but add cake to my face</li>
            <li> This is the only translucent powder I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one. It is very affordable and applies nicely. I even sometimes forget to tap off the excess from my brush and it doesn&#x27;t make my face look white or cakey. I don&#x27;t use the powder puff that comes with it, though. The packaging is nice, too.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  Very powdering though when putting it on.  Messy but looks good.</li>
            <li> great setting powder, really makes your foundation look normal</li>
            <li> Works perfect, last all day, sheer glow</li>
            <li> this works surprisingly good for an Elf product.. WORKS on all complexions. I&#x27;m African American, caramel complexion, and it works really well. I also did my best friends make up (AA as well and dark skin complexion - like deep mocha) and she looked beautiful! this is great!! (:</li>
            <li> Great other than its pretty messy and can be used up quickly</li>
            <li> I really like this powder! I have used other face powders before to set my foundation, but this one is definitely one of the best! I also use it on days where I do not wear foundation, just to help with oiliness. Another use for it that is great is in your hair. I have color treated hair so I try not to wash it for several days if possible. The downside to that is that your hair tends to look greasy. I take my kabuki brush and pat it into my scalp and then blend it into my hair a bit by brushing the powder through with a bristle brush. Really helps make your hair not look as greasy and helps it look more presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real downside I would give this product is mostly in the container. If you take out the pouf, the powder gets EVERYWHERE. Even into the threads on the side of the lid. Also, I notice that my brush tends to pick up a lot of it, so I have to tap quite a bit when I apply it. If I dont, it falls out absolutely everywhere.</li>
            <li> So it is a good translucent powder. Makeup Forever HD got too expensive for me, but that one is still my favorite. This one, for the price, is definitely worth it. I do live in a humid area so I think its not as strong as the makeup forever hd one, but it still works and keeps my concealer from budging. Wish it was a tad stronger, but overall good buy!</li>
            <li> it works great it gives you face a nice smooth and oily free look and it keep you oily free for awhile</li>
            <li> This loose powder is great.  It goes on nice, very fine loose powder.  It lasts all day and leaves a nice matte finish.  I highly recommend this powder.  Very professional product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with the given brush (for lack of a better term). I tried and it was just getting dirty from my make up. If you&#x27;re not careful it may make you look a little pale.</li>
            <li> First off, this is a nicely packaged product and it&#x27;s easy to use. The only real complaint I have is the powder can get everywhere if you&#x27;re not careful, but honestly with a powder you can&#x27;t really avoid that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dark skinned and it doesn&#x27;t give me creepy makeup face as long as I&#x27;m careful and use the right amount. A little of this product goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect all day coverage if you have very oily skin (which I do), but with one or two touch ups during the day, you&#x27;ll be fine. Since I don&#x27;t wear make up longer than a few hours - this product serves me well.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints and I would order again.</li>
            <li> this is a great product! I hate how you always get those lines or dips after you apply your face powder. This helps avoid it!</li>
            <li> Very nice powder.....covers well but is not heavy on the face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought mine at target&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face look soft and it feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;My face tends to get all oily during work due to the steam tables while.serving food and i hate that but this powder helps with that problem. I love it.</li>
            <li> Freakishly white in container, but works for my fair skin. Cruelty free products are great and I commend elf for being better than the rest for this. I am not a big fan of the container shape because the product is so fine... Cost is exceptional!</li>
            <li> I am just amazed at how e.l.f. can produce such wonderful finishing powder (and other make up items) for half the price. I think it&#x27;s even better than the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Honestly the best powder I&#x27;ve ever used. And to quote my sister when she used it &amp;#34;OMG it&#x27;s like magic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was SO excited for this product when I read the reviews. However, it was a total let-down, at least for my coloring (fare skin, blonde hair). I put it on a medium sized, fluffy powder brush and applied it to the area right above my cheek bones where I always put a highlighter. Couldn&#x27;t see a thing, so I put on some more...and some more...and some more. Annoyed, I use my finger to feel if it is even being applied..it is. I can feel it on my face (another quality I did not care for so much as it was an odd texture..very silky but very obviously there...I feel like it would fall off it was so loosely on). With several coats after several minutes, I still could see nothing. Not even a slight shimmer when I turned my face side to side. Very disappointed :( I rarely spend money on extras like this as I am in nursing school and don&#x27;t have much extra cash for trivial things like makeup. So to have spent the money on something as disappointing is really frustrating.</li>
            <li> Application is quick and easy. There&#x27;s no pigment to this powder, but the effect is amazing--it&#x27;s like it just blends out any blemishes or imperfections so all you see is me. I use it over a CC cream foundation and the combination is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice plain powder, My wife doesn&#x27;t find much difference in her skin as her skin is already smooth and normal .</li>
            <li> This is a nice sheer powder for finishing off your makeup. I&#x27;m a pretty minimalist person when it comes to makeup - lots of color or eyeshadow looks garish on me - and the sheer provides just the right touch to soften everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: you should NOT apply this as you would regular tinted powder. A very light touch is all you need to simply set and soften your base. Remember that you can always add more, but if you start off with too much it&#x27;s going to make you look ghostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is very good. Considering how little you need, I see this lasting a very long while. It&#x27;s also $6 on the E.L.F. website - the &amp;#34;Vixen&amp;#34; is actually &amp;#34;Shimmer&amp;#34; there - with, also, free shipping on orders over $35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Silica, Tin Oxide, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Sodium Dehydroacetate&lt;br /&gt;May Contain: Mica, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), Manganese Violet (CI 77742), Red 40 Lake (CI 16035), Yellow 5 Lake (CI 19140)</li>
            <li> Makes my face ridiculously white in the light</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! An excellent addition to your make up kit. I haven&#x27;t used E.L.F. Products before, but I will be exploring further thanks to this powder.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so was a little worried if I&#x27;d end up with a rash.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any rashes , and I&#x27;ve been use for a few weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent, it goes on very smooth, and covers well, and it just makes your face glow and look so much younger.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had many compliments. As I have bad days where I look super tired, or didn&#x27;t sleep well, and this was amazing covering up dark circles or old blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;Only con is I miss having a little scent on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I do love this !!!!</li>
            <li> Wow do I like this stuff...the powder is so fine and it does not take much!  It sets my makeup wonderfully and really polishes off my look.  e.l.f. products really impress me...such wonderful quality for such an affordable price.  I will definitely be looking for more e.l.f. products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the MUFE brand. This is the exact same thing. ELF makes some excellent dupes.</li>
            <li> After I am done applying all of my makeup, I use a Sigma F30 Large Powder brush to apply this powder. It does make a nice difference of the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> Work the way it should and keeps my makeup from melting off my face.</li>
            <li> I love e.l.f products and for me this product is a must have. It keeps my cheaper foundation put and gives me a smooth finish. I cant afford the best foundations so im always putting powder on as the day goes by to cover my disappearing foundation but since i got this my foundation stays put and I don&#x27;t use colored powder anymore. The puff applicator is big and soft but I would like to get more on it instead of the little spots the container releases. I&#x27;m going to try a powder brush to see if it works better. I have very pale, oily, uneven skin with pink undertones. I can only use Alabaster foundation and most brands only come in Ivory. It is too yellow on me and so are all fair colored powders, they all turn me orange. I really love that I can apply it and not have the caked on look and it just lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it was able to set my makeup but my face seems to look chubbier in photos. Also, I have an oily t zone and the powder doesn&#x27;t last long there.</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday. It is just as good if not better than the more expensive HD powders on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this to set my concealer under my eyes, it always left my skin with a really grainy finish.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite elf products. It keeps me matte all day long even in the summer! I have and will continue to recommend this powder to all other makeup lovers out there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BB cream user. I find that heavy makeup leaves me feeling very heavy and greasy. I apply this after an inexpensive Loreal BB cream. It&#x27;s not overly noticeable but it does minimize pores that aren&#x27;t often covered by bb creams. My skin in photos definitely has a better overall tone to it and it helps set my bronzer and blushes. You can&#x27;t feel it at all. The puff it comes with is very soft but can potentially wipe away previously applied makeup, I recommend using a brush to apply. The powder is very light and soft so be careful with the container, a sneeze or a drop could leave you with very little left, it&#x27;s not something you want to tote around too much but don&#x27;t worry, the container is attractive on top of the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This stuff in awesome!  I work 12 hour shifts and I don&#x27;t exactly &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my makeup to go to work but I don&#x27;t want to look like a shiny hag by noon...so judging by the awesome reviews of this product and knowing I needed a good finishing powder, I bought it. At $6 I figured it&#x27;s worth a shot since it wouldn&#x27;t be a big waste (which I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING). This powder is completely clear and leaves an amazing matte look to my face. Not heavy. Doesn&#x27;t sit in creases. But, most of all...I&#x27;m not shiny. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do still get a tiny bit of shine but it&#x27;s usually a crazy day so I&#x27;m probably a little sweaty, but I never even thought this was possible. My pores are almost gone when I use this. Just crazy. I highly recommend this powder, especially for the low price. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> grate price for what it said it is and look forward to working with it in my new makeup trunk.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help with oil control which is what I was hoping for. However, it does hold back shine for about half the day. My skin isn&#x27;t overly oily so it&#x27;s a bit of a letdown when shine shines through at mid-afternoon. It&#x27;s very fine so it&#x27;s easy to get too much on the pad them on your face if you don&#x27;t tap the excess off enough. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll but it again but I will use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this, it cost $20 something dollars. Then as I was about to checkout, Amazon said that the buyer I selected this from had ran out of this product. So then the other day I was browsing eyeslipsface . com (I have to separate that to pass the filter) where this product is originally from and it cost $6! Not only was THEIR shipping fast, the product costed less! If you really don&#x27;t mind buying it from this seller, then yes, this is an amazing product. It keep your foundation/concealer in place all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For beginners:&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t really need this powder if you don&#x27;t really need foundation. Not only are you starting out, but often times you have horrible hygiene. The lure of having flawless skin IS alluring, I know, but your skin is young and fresh and looks great by itself. Keep that in mind as you shop. I great alternative is BB Creams which do not require powder.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a great value. I got the translucent which is a white powder so it may not work well for those with darker skin. The packaging is excellent. However, I wish there were smaller or fewer holes to dispense the powder onto the puff because quite a lot usually comes out. I wish ELF made a pocket size hard-pressed powder version that is a small square/rectangle so I can bring one everywhere. I hate circular packaging because it&#x27;s difficult to fit into pockets and small purses. Include a small mirror, make the container drop-proof and it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have no probs with it, just make sure you buff it it properly and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> this is my first translucent powder but I enjoy it it&#x27;s good for setting your makeup and keeping you shine free its not that bad for an elf products I would recommend thisits also better if you use a brush not the makeup at that comes with  it</li>
            <li> This product gives you very sheer barely there matte coverage.I use this to set my foundation and concealer.It is also good just by itself followed by\\&quot; E.L.F makeup mist &amp; set\\&quot;, for more natural look.I nave to mention I have very pale complexion so I can see how it might look ashy on people with darker skin tone.&lt;br /&gt; For this powder any suitable brush like flat top powder brush or kabuki is a must, because it is very easy to overdo it with a puff. Do not sweep with brush just press it in,let it sit a few minutes,than sweep and remove excess,follow with setting spray.I find that keeping puff in a box even if I do not use it helps to keep powder from spilling out and getting all over.&lt;br /&gt;Only difference between this and more expensive stuff is that this contains some larger flakes(very few of them) but those usually just fall off by themselves or can be easily swept off.&lt;br /&gt;I like this white kind a lot and will for sure buy the shimmer color next</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect! My girlfriend is pale and she was looking for something like this and we are really happy with this purchase, it goes perfectly on her and her skin looks and feel soft.</li>
            <li> I Love ELF products, they are quality products at an unbelievable, ridiculously reasonable value. This product makes you look like you have the most perfect complexion, like a photograph that has been photo-shopped. I love the fine powder that seems to just disappear onto your skin and leave you looking like you&#x27;re in the perfect lighting all day long. I just Love it!</li>
            <li> The price on this product is low, so it seems like a good deal. However the product disappears quickly during use. I switched to this product for several months and was using a new container every 3-4 weeks. I recently switched back to my Almay loose powder and realized how much better the coverage is and how much longer each container is lasting - at least twice as long. I no longer believe this powder is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great setting powder. I ordered the translucent which is white so just press a small amount onto skin with puff. I have additionally mixed this with Bare Minerals original Mineral Veil. they are identical in texture. Won&#x27;t be ordering the more expensive brand ever again. thank you</li>
            <li> This is a very basic loose powder. Because it&#x27;s translucent, it can be used by people of many skin tones. My complexion is medium brown and I had no problem setting my foundation with it. The texture is not as fine as most department store brands and may feel a bit course upon application. Also, I found that after a couple of hours, I needed to reapply it. However, especially considering the price, I think it&#x27;s a decent product and worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim and found that I really like this product!  I typically use pricier finishing powders, but have been happily surprised at the results I see with this powder.</li>
            <li> Use a brush, not the sponge provided, I feel like even though it&#x27;s translucent setting powder, it is too heavy and applies with a tint. For the price though, I guess I can handle it.</li>
            <li> I use it as finishing powder over my mineral make up &amp; it&#x27;s perfect amount of transparency &amp; &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; in the sun The only down side is the container. It kinda just goes everywhere. Other than that I&#x27;m happy &amp; will buy again.</li>
            <li> Finally a setting powder that doesn&#x27;t make my face look dry and cakey :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to apply over white face paint. It worked fine, I only had to reapply when I was walking around a convention for a while and felt my face start to get sweaty.</li>
            <li> Didnt like it that much</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> This powder is supposed to be translucent, and yet it looked like I had ground up chalk and patted it all over my face. I&#x27;ve switched back to my old powder.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder!  Add such a great highlight and brightness to the face!  Doesn&#x27;t take very much and goes on very easy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really does make your face seem almost blurred/photoshopped. It&#x27;s cool for that, and it doesn&#x27;t make you all white looking even though the powder is white, however, you can very distinctly see the powder on you in pictures taken with flash.</li>
            <li> This Is a great powder. I&#x27;m African American and this powder works very well with a kabuki brush or a large powder brush to buff on the face to set foundation and powder, it makes my skin look and feel silky soft my makeup looks absolutely flawless, who needs to spend alot of money on makeup Forever hd powder when you have this great product! I love it, only downfall is that it&#x27;s extremely messy they could of done the packaging much better, this powder is finely milled so it comes out like crazy but I only put up with the mess because its worth it!</li>
            <li> This powder is so amazing. I&#x27;ve never received so many compliments on my skin since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way so don&#x27;t overdo it. It&#x27;s a great product to finish off your foundation. Keeps your skin looking flawless without being too heavy. The little powder puff isn&#x27;t one of those cheap ones that I always throw out. This one is really nice and helps the application go on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t lose with this powder!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It is definitely a makeup bag must-have!! Wonderful silky texture and a huge pot of it!</li>
            <li> Always apart of my makeup kit.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t mess with my foundation color, and isn&#x27;t heavy like wearing foundation and powder together.  Very happy with it</li>
            <li> Awful.  Really disappointed after all the glowing reviews.  Could not wait to try it.  Even when applied sparingly gives a ghostly white appearance to your face.  Also very very drying.</li>
            <li> This powder is great if you&#x27;re a little greasy and already have makeup on and don&#x27;t want to blot or wipe. Also definitely lends a sort of coverage too though for any unevenness. I usually don&#x27;t wear any other powder or foundation etc, and this works well for minimal makeup.</li>
            <li> love it. couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin, and even the lightest loose powders in many of the drug store brands are too dark for me.  I chose to purchase this, hoping it would appear mostly transparent and not change the color of my liquid foundation.  In that regard, this product is a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawbacks: it makes my face feel sort of weird if I use the amount I would use with another loose powder.  Definitely use sparingly and try to blend well.  If you use too much, it may also make you appear white as a geisha girl.</li>
            <li> Nice amount.. nice package. Good powder.</li>
            <li> -And I got it! It is very transparent, but also very pigmented at the same time, (if that makes sense). Because of those qualities you end up with a not-to-shabby highlighting powder, great for contouring your face- complementing any bronzing and low-lights.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you only use a small amount- the high white pigment can make a person very pail and sick looking with too much. Having to use less is a sign of a good quality product anyways. Also- because it is so transparent you might be tempted to put more on than you have to- make sure you apply in front of a mirror that has good lighting. The powder is a little abrasive feeling, but the container that it came in is made incredibly well. I wish that it had a powder locking piece the way bare-minerals products have. Had to give it 4 stars because of the texture/ appearance it leaves given its&#x27; nature, but it is a great product and when used to give &amp;#34;high definition&amp;#34;-gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always use this but when I do I get compliments!  It gives your face an allover air brushed look and a little goes a long, long way!  Fantastic deal for the price.  I have very sensitive skin and don&#x27;t seem to have any reactions to this product.  I&#x27;ll typically do my makeup and put a very, VERY light dusting of this on top (but before mascara and finishing spray). It&#x27;s nice too if you find you&#x27;ve &amp;#34;overdone it&amp;#34; on the blush or eye shadow - this completely smooths out the rough edges and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> For the price, it wasn&#x27;t terrible, but not buying it again.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found this hi def finishing powder because money became super tight and I could no longer justify purchasing Make Up Forever&#x27;s HD powder in my circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this powder. It&#x27;s seems to be a little bit lighter than Make Up Forever HD&#x27;s powder, so I recommend using as little as possible or else you could end up looking like a ghost. Using this powder sparingly, I have gotten the same smooth results as I did with the more expensive brand, and feel like this may even last longer because I&#x27;m using less of the product. This was a great purchase, and another gold star for e.l.f. products. Yay!</li>
            <li> Looks kind of weird when first applied.  I use a brush and lightly dust to set my foundation.  After I mist to set, it&#x27;s okay.  Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> Awesome finishing powder at a great price.  Helps make my makeup last longer and gives me a soft matte finish.  Powder is fine and soft... comes with a nice pouf, too. I generally trust elf to produce a great product at a great price point, and I&#x27;m definitely super happy with this. Will buy it again.  WARNING:  Not flash friendly.</li>
            <li> Does nothing for me&lt;br /&gt;Only drying my normal skin!</li>
            <li> I have a medium brown complexion and have very sensitive acne prone skin. I am extremely oily. I use this as a light matte diffuser over a non oil based moisturizer and a titanium dioxide sunscreen. I do not use foundation usually. It works perfectly to keep a matte natural finish all day 6 hours without irritation. The trick is to use a large soft brush and blend very thoroughly so there is no \\&quot;ghost effect\\&quot;. As others have stated it works great to set your makeup just blend it thoroughly into your hairline.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Really highlights and creates a flawless look</li>
            <li> Very useful keeps my makeup looking fresh and is very useful</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It sets makeup and makes pores appear smaller!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I think it&#x27;s better than some of the high end high definition powders.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004DIXYUI elf Studio High Definition Loose Face Powder]]  I love this powder and it&#x27;s reasonable price-at six dollars via Amazon it is one fourth the price of the Dermablend Original loose powder I have used.  I have very fair and dry skin-since I live in FL I am very conscious of protecting my skin from the sun and must apply a layer of SPF-60 over my facial moisturizer and then  foundation---alot of trouble--however, my task is easier thanks to how well this powder sets my make-up--it wears well all day--even in the summer heat.  Though it is white, it does not change the color of my foundation nor settle into lines.  I highly recommend it.  At six dollars you can&#x27;t go wrong!!!!!</li>
            <li> I discovered this powder on YouTube when it was compared to Make Up Forever&#x27;s HD powder.  The makeup guru in the video recommended the ELF powder over the MUF and I heartily agree. The MUF powder is $35 or so whereas the ELF brand contains the same amount of product and costs $6!!.  In my opinion, both products perform the exact same way.  I like the fact that the ELF powder is sheer and adds no color to my base makeup.  It blends in seamlessly and helps my makeup last all day. The ELF product contains powdered silicone and silica and causes no irritation to my sensitive skin. I use an oil control toner, a matte sunscreen and a mattifying primer, which helps to control shine. The ELF powder sets my makeup beautifully, providing a soft focus finish that looks really natural.  I only wish that it came in a pressed form, which would be more handy for touch ups.  I used to use Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked loose powder, which is $34 and contains even less product than the MUF.  The UD powder is tinted however.  And while I still use it occasionally, I recently purchased two ELF HD powders on Amazon because I am truly impressed with the product.  And like I&#x27;ve said, there&#x27;s a lot of product in the ELF container, which makes it doubly economical.  I would swear that the MUF and ELF powders have exactly the same ingredients.  Both leave my face soft and smooth.  I use the ELF powder over Armani Luminous foundation or Bare Minerals Bare Skin and it provides a flawless finish.  Tinted powder changes the color of my base makeup somewhat, which I don&#x27;t always want.  I only use the remaining UD powder when I&#x27;m going out at night (I have to use it up, it was expensive!).  I also use the ELF setting spray, which I like a lot. Like it promises, the ELF powder doesn&#x27;t sink into fine lines. It isn&#x27;t quite a matte finish, however.  But with the other products I use, it seems to help control most of the oiliness that breaks through by the end of the day.  I can always use blotting papers if necessary.  I keep some of the powder in my makeup bag for touch ups.  I also like the ELF lip exfoiliator, which works really well and contains sugar granules.  I purchased the ELF powder on Amazon because my local Target was out of stock.  Thankfully, the Amazon Prime price was the same as Target with free shipping too.  On the ELF website, they charge $6 or $7 for shipping unless you spend more than $25 (and I didn&#x27;t need anything else) so Amazon had the best price.  All in all, I really like this product and like the makeup guru whose review I saw, I heartily recommend it.essary.  I keep some of the powder in my makeup bag for touch ups.

            <li> Ups:&lt;br /&gt;- This container is much bigger than expected, so it comes with a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;- The powder sets your makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downs:&lt;br /&gt;- The powder makes your face look dusty&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s messy</li>
            <li> This powder wears well it&#x27;s light and a little goes a long way. You&#x27;ll always be picture perfect wearing this anytime you take pictures. I love appying a little right under my eyebrows it totally opens up my eyes. Very pleased</li>
            <li> in loveeeee. i would buy this again and again it is amazing ontop of your foundation its lovely must buy!</li>
            <li> Compared to the other definition powders this is really good and not as expensive!</li>
            <li> I am a mess -  a really oily t-zone, large pores and the beginnings of rosacea and all 3 worsen during the hot, humid summer months.  The finishing powder is super light, leaves an awesome finish to my skin, and tones down some of my dark spots. It is like a high quality mineral powder without any color (even though it is white).  A very small amount goes a long way and I prefer to apply it with a kabuki rather than the puff that is included. Seems to extend my make-up an extra two or three hours before melt down  - I can make it from 8am to 3pm during the winter months and sometimes longer!  I like the way it does not settle in the not-so-fine-lines and creases on my face as well as that it does not change the color of my makeup or turn orange by the end of the day.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the look on my skin - if you have dry skin like me, you have to be careful not to apply too much or too often, or it makes your face dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a difference with this product. My makeup looks the same with or with out it.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to keep it on any longer than normal either.</li>
            <li> I have the Makeup forever HD Powder. I thought that I would purchase this because I had heard this was an alternative to makeup forever&#x27;s brand. I would have to say that I agree. I haven&#x27;t found a difference between the two products except for the price! I would say if your thinking of getting the makeup forever, why not try this first. At least you can save some money on a comparative product!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the price, it is way cheaper than my other makeup. It&#x27;s a good value for the price, don&#x27;t get me wrong. If you have good skin and just need light coverage, this is fine. It comes off quickly (for me anyway), and it is very sheer. I usually wind up going over my skin with a pressed powder because my makeup doesn&#x27;t last as long with this product. This is the only elf brand product I haven&#x27;t loved so far.</li>
            <li> i jus buy after a make up tutorial,i dont like the finish,, to sparkly (for me) and the cover comes out easily..i dont like that after the $$ i spend, still not use..&lt;br /&gt;delivery was fast. seller is good.. item quality... not so good at least for me</li>
            <li> made my face smooth but i broke out in red dots the next day, and it doesnt quite set my makeup, just kindof makes it waterproof</li>
            <li> this is great whether i put it on over foundation or just over concealer.  It minimizes my pores and creates a nice finish evening out my skin tone as well</li>
            <li> Works great to help set makeup</li>
            <li> Covers up for filmmaking very nicely, used in projects all over New England.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Reduces shine and fine lines. My makeup lasts longer. Hard to travel with it, but if you keep most of the little holes in the lid closed it can be manageable.</li>
            <li> I really liked this powder and you can&#x27;t beat the price. It&#x27;s very clear, so it doesn&#x27;t make it look like I have makeup caked on when I&#x27;m using this powder to set it.</li>
            <li> The e.l.f. Studio High Definition Translucent Powder is pretty amazing.  It gives you a softened look without making you appear ghostly.  It is very light weight and has not broken out my sensitive skin.  You don&#x27;t have to reapply it but you almost went to it feels so great.  The only complaint I have about this product is that the little plastic piece with the holes in it that sits on top of the powder can come loose if you are just throwing it around in your makeup bag and then the next time you open it powder goes everywhere.  It is a great, very affordable powder.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. It&#x27;s usually $6 at Walmart but they&#x27;ve not had it there in forever. Now if you google the Walmart website it&#x27;s way overpriced. This stuff is great for everyday use as well as for under intense studio lights. Looks great. If you apply it properly and dust it off correctly you won&#x27;t have an Angelia Jolie moment. :)</li>
            <li> I havent got alot of experience w/ HD powder, but after reading alot of reviews on other powders, this one does not leave your face looking pale, it didnt break out my super sensitive skin, and I believe it was a good addition to my make-up routine.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;A little dab will do ya&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finishing your makeup, this powder takes away/prevents a shiny nose/forehead. It also leaves your skin feeling velvety smooth... almost slippery but in a good way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just blend well so you don&#x27;t look like you got pegged with powdered sugar</li>
            <li> Manufacturer should include instructions on opening case. The top twists off. Quality product.</li>
            <li> this product is for any make up lover. I love the cverage that it gives and i love the fact that i dont have to find a color to match my skin tone. I am an African American with dark skin and it is hard for me to find powders that match my skin tone and some of the translucent (sp?) ones make my skin look dry but this one is perfect!</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is good. I used it to set my Revlon Colour Stay - Caramel 400 (oily/combination) and my skin looked flawless but I noticed that I could see the bottom of the container simply by leaning it a bit!! That is disappointing - is it because a little of this product goes a long way, so \\&quot;they\\&quot; decided to send less?? (btw I am being very sarcastic here); I want to will myself to be angry but I can&#x27;t cause I like the product. I am not saying to fill it to the brim till it can&#x27;t be closed; but wth??? Not sure if I would reorder again based on that.</li>
            <li> My favorite ELF product!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  The powder is super fine.  It&#x27;s so light - it makes my skin silky smooth for hours.  Completely fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that e.l.f. products work as well as they do for how inexpensive they are!  This invisible powder is great for getting rid of shine and leaves my skin feeling soft!  The container is a bit big for a powder but it fits in my personal cosmetic bag! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference when I use it really.  I was expecting a mat powder that would blend with my skin tone.  It fades in and I don&#x27;t see a difference before and after at all.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few years and love it! Was using more expansive brand but this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but would not advise for pictures. It look ashy in photographs.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice smooth appearance.  Doesn&#x27;t appear chalky or white on my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells weird. Not fully filled. Eh. Haven&#x27;t tried it much going to buy one at target see how that goes.</li>
            <li> Not very happy right now...I barely got to enjoy this lroduct because the product was so damaged when I recieved it that there was barely any left in the container. From what I exlerienced it is a great product so as far as the product goes I give it 4 stars. Works great with elf mist to help set it.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and this powder leaves it looking even whiter. I&amp;#34;m glad it was so cheap because it is hard to work with and too pigmented.</li>
            <li> It does help control shine and give you that mate look, but at only 29 I feel like it accentuates any fine lines and wrinkles you may have.  Not a feature I look for in make-up.</li>
            <li> I love the powder inside, but hate the packaging. It constantly spills everywhere. Big fail in design. However, it works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This powder is fantastic!!! It really is! This thing makes such a difference you will  find yourself wondering why you did not know about it earlier. I am !</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOOOOVE this stuff. This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used translucent powder. I have dark brown skin and I was always afraid that it would give me the &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; look. It blends perfectly and keeps my foundation looking matte all day long. I use this with the Skindinavia oil controls spray and I&#x27;m good to go all day! Great for oily skin control.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, silky powder at a GREAT price!  It&#x27;s so fine and easily applied.  Only takes a small amount, and I have oily skin!  I love this loose powder and will definitely be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate oily skin. An hour later my skin is oily once again, but it does work.</li>
            <li> This powder gives the soft focus that takes away the look of lines and wrinkles. I use it with a brush instead of the pad.</li>
            <li> Powder is very good quality&lt;br /&gt;Great for stage and prosthetic makeup along with everyday use on fair skin&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was more</li>
            <li> I have really bad oily skin. I felt that if I put more than my makeup, I would break out. I&#x27;m black so I was a little hesitant on using this because I&#x27;ve used &#x27;translucent&#x27; powders in the past and they didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job. Just pale, no natural glow to my face or anything and the shine would still come through midday! This really changed the game, you don&#x27;t need much. Use the puff it comes with and PAT don&#x27;t wipe across your face, goes on much better than a brush.</li>
            <li> Fairly pleased and fair price. Good size also so gt alot for my money.</li>
            <li> Sets my makeup really well! I wear a sticky blush which can get kind of gross and smudgy but this powder does a great job of keeping it in place. I love this powder!</li>
            <li> Love this powder and use it daily. I feel that it brightens my face and provides great coverage. I have fair skin and use the translucent color.</li>
            <li> Awesome, long-lasting product for the price.  It gives me a translucent veil over my make-up to absorb oil all day.  I also use it to keep my under-eye concealer for creasing.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about this powder and I was expecting a somewhat good product but honestly, I&#x27;ve never been more pleased with a product. I think its value-quality relation hits right in the target, It&#x27;s absolutely great. I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 :)</li>
            <li> Goes on very easily and makes my skin look and feel great. I use this as my top layer over my makeup to help &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it. It works great and lasts for a long time. I will definitely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> Great powder, adds finishing touches to makeup...but use only a small amount, if not it will make you look ashen!</li>
            <li> I am a man who shaves his head. I don&#x27;t like the mid-day shine that my head. I use this product for a matte look, and it truly does last through the 8-9 workday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend and will be buying again once this runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 6/23/2015&lt;br /&gt;I found this at Wal-Mart for $6. Goodluck!</li>
            <li> This powder is just as good as the (HD-MAKE UP FOREVER), BUT CHEAPER. From now on, I&#x27;m planning to use this powder, and for the price? It&#x27;s SOOOOO  WORTH IT.  I mix it up with my Sheer Cover Settling powder, and it makes a Huge difference when I do it like that. I have oily skin, so, when I do mix it, my face looks great all day, without, being SHINY. GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> This powder is definitely a nice way to set your foundation and everything - leaving a clear finish. I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I apply this powder on my face to set my foundation and make it appear fresher longer.  I used to use the Make Up For Ever HD microfinish powder, but I&#x27;ve switched to e.l.f. because it works just as well and costs way less.  Although this powder is white, and my skin is medium with yellow undertones (I&#x27;m predominantly Asian and part Irish), the powder does NOT make my face look white.  It is, as its name indicates, translucent when applied.</li>
            <li> I have the mac high definition powder translucent and I prefer to wear this one. I love ELF products and do find (like most makeup experiences) that they can be a hit or miss. This was definitely one of those hits! My mac powder cost around 30-40 bucks and this for $6 does a better job. I am happy!</li>
            <li> I love that this loose powder from e.l.f. is translucent. I wear a luminous mousse foundation and I use this as a finishing touch. It sets my makeup well without changing the tone/shade. I like it very much. It smells sooo good and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s also great for dabbing out shine after a long day, or during mid day. E.l.f. continues to impress!</li>
            <li> I actually really love this powder. And price is just perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, not super special. I got this for doing special make-up for halloween. It did the job</li>
            <li> i have a VERY oily face. After i wash my face, 20 minutes later it gets oily, so when i wear makeup that happens and makes me look shiny and i constantly have to fix my face by blotting and putting more makeup. I tried it today and my face lasted the whole day! Not shiny at all. Yeah, you look like a ghost when first applying it, but u need to blend it out. I HIGHLY reccomend. I will be purchasing more soon. A little definetly goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is very much like it&#x27;s higher priced MF cousin. It blends in like a dream (unlike Clinique&#x27;s &amp;#34;transparent&amp;#34; version, which is so yellowy tan it makes me look unwell) to give a subtle finished appearance. I slather on thick moisturizers in the winter and after I dusted this on my face, all I noticed was clean, healthy-looking skin. Couldn&#x27;t be happier about the price, either.</li>
            <li> I love elf makeup.  This finishing powder gives my skin such a soft smooth look and feel.  I use it daily. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> My favorite translucent high definition powder.  This is one of those perfect inexpensive beauty finds that I&#x27;ll use for years to come.</li>
            <li> My package came Monday 11, 2013. I tried it the same day I only used a little.  Not sure if it really works just let , but it&#x27;s clear and no smell.  So I am going to use it again, I love the Elf products and so excited to use them. Update soon. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have to admit it does its job. I do still use the powder and get good use out of it. I use it under my eyes so my fine lines are not noticeable. I tried it on my entire face a few times but even though its suppose to be translucent, it tends to make you look a little whiter than you would want. Next time i buy a translucent powder Im going to go with a tinted one. Also if you use this product I would recommend using a finishing spray, because it doesnt give you that dewy finish like a tinted one would. In the end, I would recommend this product if your looking for a good finishing powder on a budget.</li>
            <li> this is def a dupe for Makeup forever HD powder.. dust lightly of concieler and all over face.. very light and def alot of product to last!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than it looks in the pic and comes with a sponge. Loving it!</li>
            <li> Love it, sturdy, easy, delicious!!!</li>
            <li> I think that it doesn&#x27;t have enough powder 😕</li>
