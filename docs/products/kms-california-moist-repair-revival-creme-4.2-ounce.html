            <li> It&#x27;s a good alternative if you want something less expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and creates flakes when dried in hair.</li>
            <li> He ran out of the cr√®me a little while back and started using another product which immediately brought his dandruff back.  </li>
            <li> i use about a dime size of thisrub it through my hair and let air dry .I</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using KMS California Moist Repair Revival Cr√®me for a few years.</li>
            <li> so I always stock up and buy a few at a time when I find or order it.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling awful and the scent  was way to obnoxious.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing. My hair was dry,brittle and over processed. Thanks to this my hair is slowly returning to its beautiful healthy look.</li>
            <li> This product tames my curly hair.  I first learned about it when my hair stylist used it after cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is what we wanted.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! But I wish it gives me more for this price.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but this arrived a bit separated and a different color and texture than the one I bought at the salon.  Lots of shaking to get it to mix again helped a bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using KMS California Moist Repair Revival Cr√®me for a few years. My stylist turned me on to it originally. I have very long and fine straight hair that tangles easily that is also a huge pain to detangle efficiently and gently after a hair wash. This product is the best at lubricating my hair to easily accomplish this task - and I&#x27;ve tried 20+ products over 30 some years. It also keep my split-end prone hair in very good repair between cuts. It&#x27;s not an easy product to find, nor does it come in a size larger than 4.2 oz. so I always stock up and buy a few at a time when I find or order it.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and I received it faster than expected. The price was 30% less than what I pay at the salon for the same product/size. I have tried to substitute other products and nothing can come close to how well this works. My advice? Stock up!</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I love KMS and I think that it works better for my hear than other products I have tries (even more expensive products).&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves my hair smooth and soft to the touch plus tames the frizz!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for wave normal to dry hair to give it that shine!</li>
            <li> This product is especially great for color treated hair as it moisturizers  and  detangles your hair.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and its the best.</li>
            <li> This cream is clear as opposed to the white cream that I&#x27;m used to.  I thought KMS may have changed the formula but I stopped in a retail store today and found a bottle of the white cream so that wasn&#x27;t it.  I don&#x27;t understand why there is a difference but this one doesn&#x27;t work as well.  In this case, it wasn&#x27;t worth the dollars I saved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and creates flakes when dried in hair. I was looking for the white cream leave in.</li>
            <li> wonderful product, I got introduced to it thru my hair stylist, she used it after she finished blow drying my hair to calm down the fly aways, and it is so light yet so effective you don&#x27;t feel like u put anything on your hair! not greasy. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product.&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser is temperamental and when it comes off a lot of product is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;Turn the top, don&#x27;t pull it up as I have.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is great for putting light moisture in  without weighing hair down.&lt;br /&gt;Germany did it again!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was recommended to me by my hair stylist who I&#x27;ve been going to for a decade. Absolutely love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Use this all the time. It keeps my hair in place and the frizz is under control. Smells great and not much is required.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the rest of the KMS California brand. My hair has never felt better - no joke.  This product literally came within 2 days and I even live in Alaska!! Awesome and thank you! :-)</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fabulous.  It protects my hair from the effects of daily shampooing and blow drying but does not weigh it down like some products I have used.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite hair products</li>
            <li> Ya conoc√≠a el producto.... y decid√≠ comprarlo aqu√≠ por el precio.&lt;br /&gt;Lo recibes perfectamente empacado.&lt;br /&gt;Se usa con el cabello h√∫medo, antes de secarlo.</li>
            <li> work well but again the price versus the am ount is not really worth it. I find that tresseme&#x27;s leave in conditioner works just as well for about $10.00 less.</li>
            <li> This is a light weight cream not greasy and little fragrance.A huge plus for moisture without the weight.Points for conditioning and shine too.I tried the moist repair leave in conditioner thinking it would be more light weight but it left my hair feeling awful and the scent  was way to obnoxious.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my husband had difficulty with dandruff while using other products.  Since he started using this about 8 years ago, he has not had any problems since. He uses it with the Moist Repair Shampoo and the Moist Repair Conditioner.  He ran out of the cr√®me a little while back and started using another product which immediately brought his dandruff back.  When he returned to this product, the dandruff went away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Kerastase products fan but my hair stylist uses this brand and suggested I try it. It&#x27;s a good alternative if you want something less expensive. I alternate now.</li>
            <li> Already reordered more...</li>
            <li> This is not the same formula as the one I had a year and a half ago. It makes my hair feel a bit greasy</li>

            <li> hands down the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s light and it smooths my frizz and flyaways</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my hair. I highly recommend this if you want smooth shiny hair. I have very fine hair and it helps me brush through when wet very easily. Love it!</li>
