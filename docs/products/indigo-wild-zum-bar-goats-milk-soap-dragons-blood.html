            <li>Great scent.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell that great at all.</li>
            <li>They make many!!</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing!  </li>
            <li>You and your house will smell good, and so there you save a bundle by not using perfume, room sprays and drawer sachets.  </li>
            <li>However, it smells really good, and it comes with the Zum Rub as well.  </li>
            <li>We purchased this on a whim when trying to find a good moisturizing bar soap.  </li>
            <li>It lathers good with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but makes my skin kind of oily.</li>
            <li>Good quality that doesn&#x27;t melt.</li>
            <li>This smells so good, and makes your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless,  I&#x27;m planning on buying more!</li>
            <li>Love this soap!</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent and is very good for dry skin and scaly skin.</li>
            <li>I love Zum bars, they smell heavenly, are good for your skin and you can even wash your hair with them.  </li>
            <li>Leaves you squeeky clean and smelling great.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but the scent is stronger and abit more..</li>
            <li>Zum Bars are worth the price and make great gifts.  </li>
            <li>Zuma soap is the best I have e Dr used, however, this particular crag, Dragon&#x27;s Blood, is rather strong for me.</li>
            <li>Spicy then most Dragon Blood scents.  </li>
            <li>For me, the cost is more of a bother then</li>
            <li>My favorite is still their Cedar scented Goats Milk Soap so now I have to buy both.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a more musky, almost incense-y scent.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this soap and I love smelling him after the shower.  </li>
            <li>I also love their Almond scented bars as well.</li>
            <li>I love the color and smell of the Dragon&#x27;s Blood soap.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>It would be better for a man.</li>
            <li>I love my zum soaps.</li>
            <li>It is so potently scented that when I put a bar in the bathroom, we can smell it in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>The more than $7.65 price for a 3 oz.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>I love the Zum products and the Dragon&#x27;s Blood us my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>Zum Bars are pretty much the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Very attractive appearance of product, long life and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant smell and give you a clean fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>I loved this one so much that I bought more of them.  </li>
            <li>The soap makes you feel clean and leaves no film but does leave a nice light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I think the Indigo Wild people have mastered the art of beautiful and special soaps.  </li>
            <li>Love this musky yet clean scent.  </li>
            <li>If you like the strong scent of Patchouli this bar&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li>This soap is a family favorite, though we do go through it too quickly.  </li>
            <li>It also lasted all day which I really dont see from most soaps, its usually a strong overwhelming scent that disappears in 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and give a great lather, but it didn&#x27;t last for one week, which isn&#x27;t enough for the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I knew we had success when my husband told me it has made his skin feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product, but beware of imitations.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I love Zum products, this soap smells great.</li>
            <li>Instead, a very fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li>This soap was shipped in a padded envelope and the edges are beat up and one corner significantly dented.</li>
            <li>Dragon&#x27;s Blood smells sweet and musky.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>After a shower the house smells fresh and clean, too.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be mosturizing in the bath and isn&#x27;t melting away to quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so mild I can use it on my grandson.</li>
            <li>Lathers well although the lather seems to dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love Indigo Wild products &amp; this new Dragon&#x27;s Blood is nothing less than great!</li>
            <li>love ALL indigo wild products</li>
            <li>The smell alone is worth having it sit out.</li>
            <li>Rinses nicely and though it doesn&#x27;t seem especially moisturizing, it&#x27;s also not stripping nor does it leave a film.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is really light after a wash, just barely there but noticable without being overwhelmingly strong like some soaps can be.  </li>
            <li>Dragon&#x27;s Blood is not a very pretty or appealing title, but it smells great and this soap lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>all I enjoy this soap but as of now I dont know if i&#x27;d switch to it as my main soap because of the price.  </li>
            <li>But it does have a nice vibrant label around the soap so if you just move it to a different bag it be fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it in my sock drawer until then ;)</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it after reading the reviews too!</li>
            <li>Gentle soap, I&#x27;m truly a convert now!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff and AMAZON for SUCH an amazingly fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Warm, ambery, and a little spicy.</li>
            <li>If I notice a huge difference in my skin and the bar last awhile</li>
            <li>They have changed the formula and it now is very drying and smells off</li>
            <li>The plastic bag mine came in was really cloudy and dingy looking, not what you&#x27;d wanna</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasing aroma that&#x27;s not overpowering &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell like one of those too flowery soaps.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and trouble-free.  </li>
            <li>The soap came earlier than promised, was well packaged and has a fabulous scent.  </li>
            <li>Thanks folks for your excellence.&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this at all</li>
            <li>The goat&#x27;s milk formula is gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>The scents are strong, but I mean that in a real complimentary way.  </li>
            <li>I was excited enough to consider giving them as gifts for others.  </li>
            <li>When I got mine it stunk to high heaven, and it was nothing like dragons blood.  </li>
            <li>I call them high quality.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the packaging, palm oil is high on the ingredient list, goat&#x27;s milk is lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bar makes Zum Bars a luxury item, but they are high quality.</li>
            <li>Sometimes like like Dragon&#x27;s Blood, and other times, something not so strong.</li>
            <li>I have tried several products to remove the stains without much success.  </li>
            <li>She said it made her skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>Some might consider it a little masculine-smelling, but I&#x27;m female and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Indigo Wild:</li>
            <li>The soap has ridges when you start using it, but it becomes smooth after a few mohths of use.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product above all soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have problem hair or sensitive skin get Goats Milk soap from ZUM and DEFINITELY order from amazon</li>

            <li> Indigo Wild:</li>
            <li> The soap has ridges when you start using it, but it becomes smooth after a few mohths of use.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product above all soaps.&lt;br</li>

            <li> So far I havent noticed any changes in my skin but its only been a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, for anyone trying to visualize the size, think about a inch shorter then a regular bar of Irish Spring and a third less of the thickness of it.  </li>
            <li> There are other dragons blood soaps, but only one ZUM BAR Dragons Blood.</li>
            <li> and it has cleared up my dry skin</li>
            <li> Only draw back in my opinion is that the bar of soap is small.</li>
            <li> This does not smell anything remotely like Dragon&#x27;s Blood.  </li>
            <li> When the soap arrived it was a lot smaller than pictured, only about 1/2 inch thick.  </li>
            <li> Use it sparingly as a little soap does go a long way.</li>
            <li> My guess their stored in with the other scents, so dont get too freaked by that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little spicy and invigorating.</li>
            <li> and my skin isn&#x27;t dried out and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they stain our white washcloths.</li>
            <li> After using, you can smell the soap throughout the house for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> Some companies make poor imitation scents or wimpy, weak, disappearing scents.  </li>
            <li> Awful for women.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They have changed the formula and it now is very drying and smells off</li>
            <li> love ALL indigo wild products</li>
            <li> Smells nice but the scent is stronger and abit more.. Spicy then most Dragon Blood scents.  Also, let it sit for a day or two before you decide to use it.  When I got mine it stunk to high heaven, and it was nothing like dragons blood.  In fact it was a mixture of scents.  My guess their stored in with the other scents, so dont get too freaked by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if your gifting this, get it something else to put it in!  The plastic bag mine came in was really cloudy and dingy looking, not what you&#x27;d wanna gift it in.  But it does have a nice vibrant label around the soap so if you just move it to a different bag it be fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for anyone trying to visualize the size, think about a inch shorter then a regular bar of Irish Spring and a third less of the thickness of it.  Its maybe 2/3 the amount of a regular bar.  I personally went back and forth on if I wanted to spend 7 bucks on one bar of soap when I was trying to determine if it was a decent size or half the size of the dollar soap I buy.  I finally decided to try it when I was buying Christmas gifts and had a $10 gift card anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is really light after a wash, just barely there but noticable without being overwhelmingly strong like some soaps can be.  It also lasted all day which I really dont see from most soaps, its usually a strong overwhelming scent that disappears in 2 hours.  So far I havent noticed any changes in my skin but its only been a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I enjoy this soap but as of now I dont know if i&#x27;d switch to it as my main soap because of the price.  If I notice a huge difference in my skin and the bar last awhile then I might consider it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps anyone on the fence on it.  If you got the money to splurg then I recommend trying one of the scents.  For me, the cost is more of a bother then the soap itself (as well as the $35+ to get it since its a addon!)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She loves the smell. After using, you can smell the soap throughout the house for at least an hour. She said it made her skin feel very soft. Only draw back in my opinion is that the bar of soap is small. Nevertheless,  I&#x27;m planning on buying more!</li>
            <li> I love Indigo Wild products &amp; this new Dragon&#x27;s Blood is nothing less than great! It has a very pleasing aroma that&#x27;s not overpowering &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell like one of those too flowery soaps. My favorite is still their Cedar scented Goats Milk Soap so now I have to buy both.</li>
            <li> Smells great and give a great lather, but it didn&#x27;t last for one week, which isn&#x27;t enough for the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love Zum bars, they smell heavenly, are good for your skin and you can even wash your hair with them.  After a shower the house smells fresh and clean, too.  I store them in clothing drawers and my clothes smell wonderful.  Zum Bars are worth the price and make great gifts.  You and your house will smell good, and so there you save a bundle by not using perfume, room sprays and drawer sachets.  Shipping was fast and trouble-free.  [[ASIN:B005T306QG Indigo Wild: Zum Bar Goat&#x27;s Milk Soap, Dragon&#x27;s Blood 3 oz]]</li>
            <li> This smells so good, and makes your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a more musky, almost incense-y scent. Instead, a very fresh and clean smell. Cannot wait to try it out! I&#x27;m keeping it in my sock drawer until then ;)</li>
            <li> They should not market it as being 48 ounces when, in reality, it is 3 ounces. Don&#x27;t think you are getting the steal of the century when you open the box and find one tiny bar of soap! On the other hand, I love Zum products, this soap smells great.</li>
            <li> The soap came earlier than promised, was well packaged and has a fabulous scent.  It seems to be mosturizing in the bath and isn&#x27;t melting away to quickly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and is very good for dry skin and scaly skin. Only soap my husband (a chemotherapy patient) will use.</li>
            <li> When the soap arrived it was a lot smaller than pictured, only about 1/2 inch thick.  However, it smells really good, and it comes with the Zum Rub as well.  I have yet to use it, but I&#x27;m looking forward to it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Dragon&#x27;s Blood is not a very pretty or appealing title, but it smells great and this soap lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap and I love smelling him after the shower.  Try all of their products.  They make many!!</li>
            <li> Zum Bars are pretty much the best on the market. I also love their Almond scented bars as well. My tastes tend to change periodically. Sometimes like like Dragon&#x27;s Blood, and other times, something not so strong.</li>
            <li> We purchased this on a whim when trying to find a good moisturizing bar soap.  This soap is amazing!  I knew we had success when my husband told me it has made his skin feel so much better.  This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I love the color and smell of the Dragon&#x27;s Blood soap. Leaves you squeeky clean and smelling great. It lathers good with a wash cloth. I</li>
            <li> I have sent off for a variety of scents in the Zum Bar goat soap.  I didn&#x27;t just like them. I was excited enough to consider giving them as gifts for others.  The coloration is very attractive. The soap has ridges when you start using it, but it becomes smooth after a few mohths of use.  I call them high quality.  The scents are strong, but I mean that in a real complimentary way.  Some companies make poor imitation scents or wimpy, weak, disappearing scents.  I think the Indigo Wild people have mastered the art of beautiful and special soaps.  Very attractive appearance of product, long life and effectiveness. This time I will try some lip balms.  Thanks folks for your excellence.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Birgerson&lt;br /&gt;Sumter. SC</li>
            <li> I loved this one so much that I bought more of them.  It are great and feel wonderful on your skin</li>
            <li> 3oz bar not 48oz like it says in product description</li>
            <li> It smells great, but makes my skin kind of oily.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the smell of this at all and I have had to throw it out because my husband kept complaining that it was stinking up the bathroom. I really wanted to like it after reading the reviews too!</li>
            <li> i picked a bar of this up at a store several months back and it has cleared up my dry skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so mild I can use it on my grandson. This is a fabulous product, but beware of imitations. There are other dragons blood soaps, but only one ZUM BAR Dragons Blood.</li>
            <li> I received a set of these soaps for xmas. I cannot recommend them at all.  They contain something called mineral pigments that stained my washclothes.  I have tried several products to remove the stains without much success.  Also containing palm oil concerns me.  Once you get the packaging, palm oil is high on the ingredient list, goat&#x27;s milk is lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, soaps should not stain anything.</li>
            <li> I really like this product above all soaps.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant smell and give you a clean fresh feeling.  It goes excellent with the Dragon Blood oil.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  The smell alone is worth having it sit out.</li>
            <li> Love this musky yet clean scent.  Lathers well although the lather seems to dissipate quickly.  I like what goats milk does for my skin.  Clears up any roughness, where my bath and body works products don&#x27;t.  Gentle soap, I&#x27;m truly a convert now!</li>
            <li> If you have problem hair or sensitive skin get Goats Milk soap from ZUM and DEFINITELY order from amazon I&#x27;ve been using goats milk soap for over a year now and my skin isn&#x27;t dried out and my hair feels tons cleaner gawd I LOVE this stuff and AMAZON for SUCH an amazingly fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This soap is a family favorite, though we do go through it too quickly.  Use it sparingly as a little soap does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Yummy scent, musky and spicy, almost like a man&#x27;s cologne. Even unwrapped in the bathroom it is scenting the room with a great smell. Haven&#x27;t unwrapped yet, can&#x27;t vouch for its staying power, but can compliment the scent. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Iam in luv with all zum products</li>
            <li> This does not smell anything remotely like Dragon&#x27;s Blood.  Dragon&#x27;s Blood smells sweet and musky.&lt;br /&gt;This soap smells like Cedar, Myrrh, Copal, and Benzoin.  Awful for women.  It would be better for a man.</li>
            <li> Great scent.  I love my zum soaps. Quality product as always.&lt;br /&gt;Lathered well moisturizing soap.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This just smells awesome. Some might consider it a little masculine-smelling, but I&#x27;m female and I absolutely love it. Warm, ambery, and a little spicy. Rinses nicely and though it doesn&#x27;t seem especially moisturizing, it&#x27;s also not stripping nor does it leave a film. This and the cedar-scented Zum Bar soaps are my favorites.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever found. It is so potently scented that when I put a bar in the bathroom, we can smell it in the bedroom. The goat&#x27;s milk formula is gentle on my skin. The colors are beautiful, too. Unfortunately, they stain our white washcloths. The more than $7.65 price for a 3 oz. bar makes Zum Bars a luxury item, but they are high quality. They make wonderful gifts.</li>
            <li> If you like the strong scent of Patchouli this bar&#x27;s for you. Didn&#x27;t think it was going to overpower but it did.&lt;br /&gt;Good lather.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece of soap.  Good quality that doesn&#x27;t melt.</li>
            <li> This soap was shipped in a padded envelope and the edges are beat up and one corner significantly dented. This was to be a birthday gift so I have no time to resolve this issue, return or exchange (although I&#x27;d be hesitant to exchange without worry about the next bar being damaged too).  Be warned, especially if this is a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ZUM soaps (not purchased through Amazon) so I know what they look like. I will not order again here.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell that great at all.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. A little spicy and invigorating. Makes you want to do Marilyn Monroe impressions.</li>
            <li> Zuma soap is the best I have e Dr used, however, this particular crag, Dragon&#x27;s Blood, is rather strong for me. It smells like men&#x27;s cologne but it makes my bathroom smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love the Zum products and the Dragon&#x27;s Blood us my favorite scent.  The soap makes you feel clean and leaves no film but does leave a nice light fragrance.</li>
