            <li>This wig set is the best!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect gift for any hannah montana lover!</li>
            <li>The earrings are excellent but, as stated before, are for pierced ears, so you may not want to buy this tote if your daughter&#x27;s ears aren&#x27;t pierced.  </li>
            <li>but the headset was great!</li>
            <li>Great buy for a great item!</li>
            <li>Delivered on time , best price i could get , good condition.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found this.</li>
            <li>In any event, my daughter is THRILLED with it, and it&#x27;s perfect for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>The wig is really good, not one of those fall apart ones.</li>
            <li>She loved the contents and had to put them all on immediately.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughter loved it.  </li>
            <li>Everything in the bag is made with good quality.</li>
            <li>My neice LOVED this.</li>
            <li>They love it!  </li>
            <li>It was clearly the best gift she received this Christmas!</li>
            <li>I loved the price and needed it for free shipping of another item.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun for her and a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color of the wig was very authentic, but it tangles easily and comes out when you comb it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t  believe how much she loved this item!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great BDay gift.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughters love Hannah Montana and I purchased this one to see if it met my standards for toys for them.</li>
            <li>Most dress up kits come with clip-ons</li>
            <li>I paid much more money, but I am now guaranteed my daughter can be \\&quot;Hannah Montana\\&quot; for Halloween.</li>
            <li>I looked on Amazon and this seller had more than the wig.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this set is excellent for younger girls.  </li>
            <li>If you can find a better quality wig elsewhere, I&#x27;d buy it instead.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was as described and she enjoyed it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute and, especially for the price, great quality.</li>
            <li>The glasses are pretty good for the price.  </li>
            <li>and I thought my 2 granddaughters, who love Hannah Montana, would enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>Gets tangled and ratty looking very quick.</li>
            <li>we were constantly told how beautiful our \\&quot;daughter\\&quot; was.</li>
            <li>My daughters are huge Hannah Montana fans.  </li>
            <li>I have canceled my order because it will now not be available until the END of NOVEMBER.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Only mildly recommended.</li>
            <li>The bag the kit came in was clear plastic, very cheap looking - and nothing with Hannah Montana on it.</li>
            <li>Good for Halloween but not much after that as the wig does not keep well.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the accessories are worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>still-we&#x27;ll laugh @</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and I was not disappointed on what I received.</li>
            <li>It was an actual Disney product but not only did I get the wig but a tote with extras for a great price.  </li>
            <li>This particular tote, which is nothing more than a clear plastic bag with purple trim, comes with purple sunglasses, pierced hoop earrings, a headset mic and a blond/purple wig.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is make sure the kid has pierced ears because the earrings are not clip on.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it for all Hannah fans.</li>
            <li>The girl I bought it for is 8 and a real HM fan.</li>
            <li>Between the wig and the head set she really feels like her.</li>
            <li>the wig was better than i expected for the price, as were the headset and sunglasses.</li>
            <li>my only complaint was that the wig&#x27;s adjustment clip broke off &amp; so it wasn&#x27;t as secure as i would have liked.</li>
            <li>I cannot review the actual product, but you might want to know that many people have had problems actually getting this wig shipped to them.  </li>
            <li>but I will be buying 3 more in different colors in the near future.</li>
            <li>The inside has the same binding a real wig would have.</li>
            <li>i ordered this set for my 10 yr old son.</li>
            <li>The wig was an atrocity, becoming tangled, unruly and hard to brush.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter via Ebay Express and it shipped direct from Amazon exactly in the time frame the seller said it would, though I was a little surprised to see it come from Amazon, where the price is a little bit different than what I paid.  </li>

            <li> The wig drops hair like a molting dog, the earrings are pierced, (making them unusable by nonpierced girls), and the sunglasses arrived with one bow in the bottom of the package because it was missing a nut and a screw.  </li>

            <li> My daughters are huge Hannah Montana fans.  I bought this for them to wear at the concert, but they ended up switching their halloween costumes and both decided to be Hannah.  I would certainly recommend it for all Hannah fans.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t  believe how much she loved this item! As soon as she put it on she thought she was Hannah! The wig is really good, not one of those fall apart ones. The inside has the same binding a real wig would have. It actually stays on her head.The girl I bought it for is 8 and a real HM fan. Between the wig and the head set she really feels like her. I&#x27;m so happy I found this. It was clearly the best gift she received this Christmas!</li>
            <li> The color of the wig was very authentic, but it tangles easily and comes out when you comb it.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time , best price i could get , good condition.  thank you</li>
            <li> This item was on sale and I thought my 2 granddaughters, who love Hannah Montana, would enjoy it.  They did!  Great buy for a great item!</li>
            <li> My daughter was star struck, actually saw gleams in her eyes when she opened this one for Christmas...unfortunately the hair piece gets tangled very quickly.  For kids, it sort of hard to keep them untangled, any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I purchased this tote bag with HM accessories for my grand-daughter, who is a big HM fan!!  She loved the contents and had to put them all on immediately.  Thanks for a great BDay gift.  Rita</li>
            <li> My granddaughters love Hannah Montana and I purchased this one to see if it met my standards for toys for them. The wig is adjustable but the sunglasses have glitter too far down around the lenses and it can  irritate the granddaughter who I got it for has pierced ears but my other three don&#x27;t so I&#x27;m going to have to  purchase clipons for them and dispose of the other peirced earrings but I will be buying 3 more in different colors in the near future.</li>
            <li> Good for Halloween but not much after that as the wig does not keep well.  Gets tangled and ratty looking very quick.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this was because the picture showed a microphone. If you buy the purple one it comes with a headset rather than the microphone. Also the description says earrings - they are for pierced ears. Most dress up kits come with clip-ons so anyone can use them. The bag the kit came in was clear plastic, very cheap looking - and nothing with Hannah Montana on it. I was very disappointed and sent it back!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter via Ebay Express and it shipped direct from Amazon exactly in the time frame the seller said it would, though I was a little surprised to see it come from Amazon, where the price is a little bit different than what I paid.  In any event, my daughter is THRILLED with it, and it&#x27;s perfect for Halloween.  It&#x27;s very cute and, especially for the price, great quality.</li>
            <li> I seen a similar wig at Target and Walmart for $9.99 and up, that&#x27;s just for the wig alone.  For the price I opted for this option.  Bought 2, one for my neice and one for my daughter.  They love it!  Well made items.</li>
            <li> What a ripoff!  The wig drops hair like a molting dog, the earrings are pierced, (making them unusable by nonpierced girls), and the sunglasses arrived with one bow in the bottom of the package because it was missing a nut and a screw.  I DO NOT recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I also ordered this wig back on August 10th.  My date was moved several times and I even was promised by Amazon that I would receive this wig sometime the week of October 8th.  Customer Service even made up a story about how they had one reserved for me from some \\&quot;vendor\\&quot; somwhere.  Needless to say I got an email from Amazon the very next day saying I would get the wig in November and I never got the wig. I got the run-around every time I called.  I found the wig at a store locally and bought a bunch of \\&quot;Hannah\\&quot; accessories.  I paid much more money, but I am now guaranteed my daughter can be \\&quot;Hannah Montana\\&quot; for Halloween.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter because Hannah Montana is the thing for Christmas for little girls. It was hard to get in stores.  I looked on Amazon and this seller had more than the wig.  It arrived fast and I was not disappointed on what I received. It was an actual Disney product but not only did I get the wig but a tote with extras for a great price.  My granddaughter loved it.  I would recommend this product and seller without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I cannot review the actual product, but you might want to know that many people have had problems actually getting this wig shipped to them.  I am still waiting.  If you are looking to have it by Halloween, you may want to look elsewhere.  Edited: I have canceled my order because it will now not be available until the END of NOVEMBER.  That&#x27;s too late for any of us wanting to purchase it for Halloween.</li>
            <li> This wig set is the best! I bought it for my niece who just LOVES hannah montana and she immediatley put it on along with everthing else in the bag and wouldnt take it off! My sister called me that night to tell me my niece was wearing it to bed!  Everything in the bag is made with good quality. The only thing is make sure the kid has pierced ears because the earrings are not clip on.  This is the perfect gift for any hannah montana lover!</li>
            <li> If your daughter is crazy about Hannah Montana like mine is, then you have probably already purchased or will shortly be purchasing a tote like this.  This particular tote, which is nothing more than a clear plastic bag with purple trim, comes with purple sunglasses, pierced hoop earrings, a headset mic and a blond/purple wig.  After receiving this for Christmas, my daughter immediately tried it all on.  The wig was an atrocity, becoming tangled, unruly and hard to brush.  The glasses are pretty good for the price.  The earrings are excellent but, as stated before, are for pierced ears, so you may not want to buy this tote if your daughter&#x27;s ears aren&#x27;t pierced.  The headset is sturdy and my daughter loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this set is excellent for younger girls.  The wig is the only drawback.  If you can find a better quality wig elsewhere, I&#x27;d buy it instead.  The rest of the accessories are worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only mildly recommended.</li>
            <li> My neice LOVED this. She&#x27;s a BIG Hannah Montana fan. I loved the price and needed it for free shipping of another item. I haven&#x27;t seen it yet... but there are pictures.</li>
            <li> i ordered this set for my 10 yr old son. it was used to dress up as hannah montana on halloween. we saw sets of wig &amp; costume, but the outfits looked so flimsy &amp; the reviews were bad. after seeing some of the reviews for this, i called amazon because the biggest complaint was timely arrival. i was assured it was in stock &amp; shippable &amp; did receive it in a few days. the wig was better than i expected for the price, as were the headset and sunglasses. we put it together w/borrowed clothes &amp; he was a big hit. we were constantly told how beautiful our \\&quot;daughter\\&quot; was. my only complaint was that the wig&#x27;s adjustment clip broke off &amp; so it wasn&#x27;t as secure as i would have liked. still-we&#x27;ll laugh @ the pictures for years to come!!</li>
            <li> Kids like the product - wig got a little messy after awhile combing didn&#x27;t really work on it but the headset was great!</li>
            <li> Lots of fun for her and a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was as described and she enjoyed it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
