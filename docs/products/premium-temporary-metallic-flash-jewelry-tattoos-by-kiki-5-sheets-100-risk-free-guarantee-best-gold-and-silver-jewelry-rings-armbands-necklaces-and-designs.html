            <li>We used these as one of the activities at the local high school post prom party and they were an absolute hit!!</li>
            <li>I gave the rest away to a cute little girl</li>
            <li>Clean and dry the area where you&#x27;re going to place the tattoos&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other metallic tattoos and they have been too light for my darker skin.  </li>
            <li>but.. WoW!</li>
            <li>Definitely a recommended item;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product overall, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Additionally, we have more than enough left over for a second and maybe even third trip.</li>
            <li>One of these nights I am going to doll up and go wild with the tattoos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These temporary tattoos were easy to apply- just add a little water!</li>
            <li>Flash Tattoos are a hot trend that look like they are going to be around for a long time!</li>
            <li>Also, my Hot Jewels I got from W-mart held up a long time, almost two weeks!</li>
            <li>But the Glitz with the five packages of same tattoos and the extra package was a real bargain!  </li>
            <li>Apparently, metallic flash tattoo jewelry is in!</li>
            <li>Really vibrant and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for high quality, long lasting metallic tattoos then these are for you!</li>
            <li>Gently remove the white paper from your skin, and let the tattoo dry in the open air for 2 min</li>
            <li>These are really fun for adults who wanna have the childlike fun of temporary tattoos with the look of flashy jewelry.</li>
            <li>If you get tired of the temp tattoo before it naturals wears off it is really easy to remove it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if the holding pouch did not stink so badly.</li>
            <li> For those of you with a darker complexion you can go crazy with all these designs!  </li>
            <li> but the smell is very bad.</li>

            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get past the moth ball smell and threw them in the trash</li>
            <li> I ordered the love set. And the name is fitting because I love it. They are beautiful patterns and I love the Metallic shimmer.</li>
            <li> Pleased!  I see smell complaints, but we opened, set out,  went to school/work,  came home happy.  These are fun to use.  More will be purchased as gifts, with many asking us to share.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> Pretty designs. Great for vacation!</li>
            <li> My grandkids thought Grandma got a tattoo.  These look great.  What a fun item to have.</li>
            <li> they stayed on for days!! ... love this item and will be buying again when I run out</li>
            <li> Flash Tattoos are a hot trend that look like they are going to be around for a long time! This is such a great deal, 5 sheets for $15. My kids love them, my friends and I love them, the quality is great!</li>
            <li> These are fun!  Good quality.  Not necessarily for serious tattoo lovers. Also impressed by quick delivery.  Bought them for myself, but my daughter confiscated them.  Apparently, metallic flash tattoo jewelry is in!</li>
            <li> These are great and I absolutely love them! They are super easy to apply and they look perfect. I love how many different sheets and variety of tattoos you have to pick from. Just pick the tattoo you want cut around it remove the plastic and use a wet sponge to apply the tattoo. It comes out amazingly and I love the shine to them. They don&#x27;t peel or flake off like other tattoos do they last a bit longer but are easy to remove with rubbing alcohol. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful designs and easy to remove</li>
            <li> Love the temporary tattoos. My husband has always wanted me to get a real tattoo, but these will do fine.</li>
            <li> These tattoos are so cool looking! I get a bunch of compliments every time I wear them. I haven&#x27;t had them last more than a day, but they are awesome while they&#x27;re on!</li>
            <li> Temporary Tattoos by Kiki are the best! They are so easy to use and last! A great gift for all your friends, or as a fun little treat for yourself.  With the spring and summer season coming up a must have!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and extremely cute designs. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This pack came in a neatly packaged black cardboard. There a five sheets of metallic tattoo jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;My sister always wanted to get a tattoo. But, she couldn&#x27;t because my parents won&#x27;t allow her to get one. But, these she can put on at any time and remove later on without any discomfort or side effects.&lt;br /&gt;Take the tattoo that you want to apply and hold it against your skin. Use a damp cloth and rub it gently over the tattoo for a few minutes. Let it sit for a couple of seconds and slowly peel the paper off. Voila, you have amazing looking metallic tattoo without any pain and needles.&lt;br /&gt;I have received so many compliments on these. My friends loved them and bought their own as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided without any obligations.</li>
            <li> What can I say..... These tattoos are beautiful &amp; fun.....&lt;br /&gt;Give them a try!</li>
            <li> FLASH TATTOOS by KIKI are the BEST! They are so much fun and so easy to use. Just rub them with water. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! They are perfect for the beach, a night on the town, or just hanging around enjoying the southern California lifestyle. This is my new go-to gift for all of my sun-loving friends! Love them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible, for a moment I thought they were not sold anymore!! They still exist! I used the \\&quot;Temporary Metallic Flash Tattoos by Kiki\\&quot; for my daughter as she loved them after that she got them applied at a birthday party. As parent I love the quality and how easily can be removed! If you like to have metallic flash tattoos that are not permanent and can be removed easily well, just hit the \\&quot;Add to cart\\&quot; and buy it.    However, after two months I ordered them just today as I finally found them, if the quality will be different I&#x27;ll update this review as soon as I&#x27;ll get them in my hand..    Update: I got them! There are more design than last time, they tried to deliver it also on Sunday! Sadly I was not there but.. WoW!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these but the smell of them was unbearable. They have such a strong chemical odor - they smell a lot like moth balls. I put one on my son and it applied super easily and looked good. However I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using something that smells so chemically on my children.</li>
            <li> Loved the tattoos!  Perfect for going out, parties, events and the summer season coming up!</li>
            <li> These are so much fun. They are so easy to apply and last you all day. They come in 5 sheets of many different designs that look beautiful when they&#x27;re on. They can be used in so many different ways and in so many different places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put them on all you have to do is cut out the design you want, place it on your skin and use a damp cloth to press the tattoo for about 30 seconds. Just make sure to put them on a part of your skin that&#x27;s very smooth. Otherwise you&#x27;ll see wrinkles in the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product overall, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These are pretty cute! Great for summer, my kids definitely love them. THere are quite a few tattoos in here and a pretty good variety. They last longer if you make sure to exfoliate your skin before applying. Overall, I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find these Temporary Tattoos by Kiki! There are so many different styles in one package. These gorgeous designs can be worn anywhere and will compliment and add a little sugar and spice to any outfit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the temporary tattoos arrived in a sturdy package.My tattoos were in perfect shape and ready to apply.  I applied one right away because I couldn&#x27;t wait! These temporary tattoos were easy to apply- just add a little water! I used a little bit of baby oil and they come off with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten a lot of compliments on my temporary tattoos. I have a few friends who already placed orders for this stylish product! A definite must have!</li>
            <li> I love the variety and design of these. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, (I&#x27;m still working on getting a tan so they look good on me) but I&#x27;m looking forward to when I do.</li>
            <li> We used these as one of the activities at the local high school post prom party and they were an absolute hit!! Very pleased with the product!!</li>
            <li> These are a fun way to dress up any outfit.</li>
            <li> Had so much fun with these tattoos! My kids have been dying to get their hands on them but first I had to use them for a photo shoot!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased these for my daughter, but after trying them for myself I absolutely loves these metallic tattoos. Not only do the last a long time, but they also look beautiful. I put one of the bracelet tattoos on my wrist and it was so shiny and beautiful. I received so many compliments on my jewelry tattoo. These tattoo are great for any age. I put one on my daughters shoulder and it stayed on for almost 2 weeks and still looked beautiful when we scrubbed it off. These are great! I purchased these during a promotion and the views I have expressed are completely my own.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Fun and pretty!</li>
            <li> Great to have a fun afternoon with kids</li>
            <li> Loved them! Depending on where I put them, some of them lasted over a week. I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great</li>
            <li> My daughter loves using these. Plenty of designs and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  So much fun.  My girls love them.</li>
            <li> Luv these!!! Gave them to my daughter for Valentines day and she has been obsessed ever since. They came super fast also. Definitely a recommended item;)</li>
            <li> im obsessed with these tattoos! They are so trendy right now and are the perfect accessory to any outfit&lt;br /&gt;They go on easy and stay on for a long time! Great for any occasion! So happy to have been given this product to be able to test its quality</li>
            <li> This tattoos are super cute and the colors are amazing I love how they look and how shiny they are I never had one like this, first time getting them and I really like them. They are easy to use just cut the part you want  put it in the area you want it make sure is clean and dry and when you place it just put a wet towel on top of it and wallah. You ready to go :). They last long too</li>
            <li> I received these tattoos as a promotion for review and evaluation and I love them!! There are so many tattoos included on the four sheets, there are endless possibilities for creating a unique design. They were very easy to cut and apply. Once you place the tattoo face down on your skin it will not  slide around easily so make sure you have it where you want it. Mine all transferred perfectly and were very shiny and vibrant. I put them on the inside of my arm (i used about seven of them) and they stayed on for about two days. I think these are so much fun and make perfect gifts. I am very happy with these and love using them!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:d84da60bef556a571adafef819fc7573]] I love these, so easy to use and look great on, and watch how easy they are to use.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lots of nice designs.</li>
            <li> These work as described and look just as shiny on your skin. They are beautiful!</li>
            <li> Fantastic and were quite the crowd pleasers</li>
            <li> These tattoos are gorgeous.  I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if the holding pouch did not stink so badly. My friend ordered these too and said the same thing. They are really durable.  Just through the black pouch ASAP once received, and air out. The smell dissipates quickly once the pouch is gone.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time and very easy to apply.  No &#x27;funky&#x27; smell with mine when opened. Tatto stayed on well.</li>
            <li> In my 3rd purchase, fun stuff!</li>
            <li> These shipped quickly, are super cute and fun.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remember how they did.  But the Glitz with the five packages of same tattoos and the extra package was a real bargain!  Also, my Hot Jewels I got from W-mart held up a long time, almost two weeks!</li>
            <li> Love thes. Originally bought as a gift but they are so cool that I thought I had to keep it for myself and daughter.</li>
            <li> Fun  , cool and got lots of compliments</li>
            <li> Beautiful. My daughter and her friend had a blast with these. Really vibrant and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;There are 5 sheets and so many to choose from&lt;br /&gt;They are totally eye catching and last way longer than most of our temp tats&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.I cannot get enough of these and I think we will buying more before the month ends. The kids and I are obsessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean and dry the area where you&#x27;re going to place the tattoos&lt;br /&gt;2. Remove the plastic transparent layer and place tattoo face down on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. Take a little cloth / sponge, soak it in water, and then wet with it the tattoo that is placed on your skin 4 (I simply take the kid to the sink and wet it with my fingers).&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply a little pressure and count to 30&lt;br /&gt;5. Gently remove the white paper from your skin, and let the tattoo dry in the open air for 2 min</li>
            <li> The tattoos worked well but they stink. Literally. After I opened the package I let mine sit out in the garage for a good week to let the smell dissipate.</li>
            <li> These are the best!  My daughter and her friends are in love with these and so easy to remove!  Great party pleasers.  Make sure you buy enough for the whole group!</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m a girl that likes to keep up with current fashion trends I jumped at the opportunity to test and review these Metallic tattoos.  I&#x27;ve tried other metallic tattoos and they have been too light for my darker skin.  These are perfect!  They are very easy to apply and very, very long lasting!  They come nicely packaged in a heavy duty envelope so they don&#x27;t bend.  There are 5 different sheets so lots of options.  If you&#x27;re looking for high quality, long lasting metallic tattoos then these are for you!</li>
            <li> My niece loves her bling. Priceless.</li>

            <li> I bought these for silly fun - they hit the mark.</li>
            <li> These are easy to apply, and stay on for AGES -- a week! I put one on my arm, and my daughter has them on her hands and ankles, and they&#x27;ve all held up well. Some of them are very subtle, and great designs for younger and older wearers (at least, I think a mama can get away with wearing them. :) )  Great quantity and diversity for the price, too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic tattoos!  My daughter and I are loving these!  So much great variety, crazy easy to apply and will last a while with all the great options.  They look great on the skin!  New favorite tatts!</li>

            <li> Nice Item, stands up to perspiration.</li>
            <li> These will make great Easter gifts for my daughters as well as using on our Easter eggs!</li>
            <li> These are really fun for adults who wanna have the childlike fun of temporary tattoos with the look of flashy jewelry. The smell is off putting but they do mention it and how to help rid the smell. I really enjoy them and so do my daughters.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. Crazy fast delivery. Make sure you read the instructions &amp; care email they send you. Love em!</li>
            <li> I had heard things hear and there about metallic tattoos. Having so many tattoos myself I just never really took the time to seek out temporary tattoo sheets. It was really cool when I actually came across these. The tattoos got here quickly and were really easy to put on. They are really bright and don&#x27;t flake like the temp tattoos I used to wear from the bubble gum wrappers. If you get tired of the temp tattoo before it naturals wears off it is really easy to remove it. Very cool product and so many design option. I adore the silver and gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sent by Upshot Demand</li>
            <li> Super fun! I love these to spice up an outfit without the commitment of a real tattoo!</li>
            <li> Ordered these specifically for my two daughters (aged 8 and 9).  So on their behalf these are awesome!  As soon as they came they each picked out a necklace, bracelet, and ring to put on immediately.  They are fairly long-lasting and have held up well through multiple baths.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> Work Great! I have had a star on my shoulder for over a week now. I gave the rest away to a cute little girl and she loves them! Now we have to convince her not to put them ALL OVER her body right before church!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful but I had a reaction when I put one on...but I did put them on my phone...lol</li>
            <li> It is fun and easy to use. great!</li>
            <li> I bought these for three of my grand daughters aged 17, 13 and 6. They absolutely love them and had no problem putting them on. They look great!</li>
            <li> These are so fun and easy to use. Not just for girls either- the boys love to wear them as cool armbands in the summer especially in Hawaii!</li>
            <li> Amazing and beautiful product! Goes on easy and easy to remove. I&#x27;m going to Hawaii next week and can&#x27;t wait to wear this to show it off on my tan skin!</li>
            <li> Metallic Flash Tattoos by Kiki - Thank you for making such an awesome product!  I was looking online for something fun to take away with four 50+ year old girls for a get-away weekend.  The packaging and product exceeded my expectations -- the quality of the product and the style of designs appealed to all of us.  They were easy to apply, lasted a long time and did not look like a  temporary tattoo.  The selection included was quite extensive and each of us found something we enjoyed wearing.  Additionally, we have more than enough left over for a second and maybe even third trip.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of temporary tattoos.  I was impressed with the packaging, definitely would make for a great gift!  We had a lot of fun trying some of the tattoos.  I did notice that the black tattoos showed up way better on a fair skin.  For those of you with a darker complexion you can go crazy with all these designs!  So fun!  I bought these at a discount just so I could review them.  One of these nights I am going to doll up and go wild with the tattoos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review</li>
            <li> These are awesome not to mention the price is amazing I love glitter and love to shine this is defenatly an attention grabber have gotten so many complements when wearing these</li>
            <li> The metallic tattoos are great. I love how easy they are to use, all you have to do is cut out the design you want and place it in the desired area. It&#x27;s best if you use a wet cloth that can absorb the water. You can appliance in many areas like your back, your wrist, your neck, the bottom of your legs, shoulder and many other areas. You just dab the area and in seconds you can remove the top paper and it comes off. It looks really nice contrasted against your skin. I love it. I was sent these for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> A great purchase, arrived on time - super selection, very pleased.  Look forward to more great finds from this vendor!</li>
            <li> Really cool and stylish! Great for a fun night out with the girls or a fun day at the beach! A great way to add jewelry without having to actually wear it!</li>
            <li> all the fun of having a tat without the pain</li>
            <li> Very cute and easy to apply. Hot for summer!!</li>
            <li> These are amazingly great quality. Look like real jewelry. The package smells so toss it!!</li>
            <li> This is a large set! I really like these! They stick well and a very pretty! You can use them for lots of things, not just body jewelry. I used some on easter eggs ;) I am excited to have them for the summer, too!</li>
