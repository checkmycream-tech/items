            <li>So happy to find it!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>I found this setter to be perfect in treating me to a perfect style.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>y hair will keep a curl great if I use an iron.</li>
            <li>They heat up fairly (10ish min)</li>
            <li>This kit was nice, well made and shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Rollers are ok....</li>
            <li>This hair setter is fantastic!</li>
            <li>If you are going to sell a product in this day and age you had better be taking care of the customer.  </li>
            <li>I loved these curlers when I first got them ; however, they do not have an on/off switch.</li>
            <li>I returned for a full refund... but eww!</li>
            <li>The curlers do get nice and hot, but the clips are junk and they cannot hold your hair.</li>
            <li>Piece of crap&lt;br /&gt;Roller clips are cheap and don&#x27;t hold rollers</li>
            <li>Otherwise the rollers seem to heat quickly and rolled easily.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they could add on a compartment that snapped shut where unused roller clips could live.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wake up, heat up the rollers and then let them cool, all within a 30 minute time frame.  </li>
            <li>All bets are off as to our receiving a full refund as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GWM</li>
            <li>quickly &amp; case is compact.</li>
            <li>The lid however, didn&#x27;t seem to fit on the product - after opening it the first time, I can&#x27;t get it to fully close.</li>
            <li>I will probably return to using the old-fashioned U-shaped pins that I&#x27;ve always used with hot rollers.</li>
            <li>After 10+ years my hot rollers broke.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t count on two things:  first, the picture shows the metal clips, which are preferable since they hold and don&#x27;t leave marks.  </li>
            <li>I have medium-length fine straight hair: I need only hair body and some curl and sheen to my hair (I cannot use hairspray).</li>
            <li>I was pretty sure that nothing was going to Beas good as my old ones, but isn&#x27;t out to find some much needed wide rollers to help tame my frizzy/curly hair in the mornings.</li>
            <li>The clips don&#x27;t hold very well either, seemed like when they got clipped on the heat</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t really curl my hair as much as I like it</li>
            <li>So for the first few days they were ok.</li>
            <li>Today we received an e-mail from Remington stating that the review was not up to their high quality standards and it would not be published.  </li>
            <li>I do not know how hot they actually get, but if you leave them plugged in for too long, you will hear a cracking sound coming from somewhere within the unit or curlers.</li>
            <li>had they just simply replied to our e-mail and made things right.  </li>
            <li>My set came with plastic clips that are supposed to secure the roller but which actually mess up the whole process because they leave dents.  </li>
            <li>But after returning this set and buying a new set at the store.</li>
            <li>It not only is small enough to fit into your suitcase but the heat emitted from the unit provides a quality \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; to hair and also more body (believe it or not).</li>
            <li>First off this isn&#x27;t about the above product per say</li>
            <li>It showed the exact same colors as her set</li>
            <li>(I have been using the same curlers for 10 years and just decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;) because they didn&#x27;t ever get hot enough.</li>
            <li>the clips melted on the first use, and were not tight enough to keep the curlers in.</li>
            <li>the smallest that arrived were larger then the large ones in her two sets of heat curlers.  </li>
            <li>I should have spent a little more money and gotten what I really wanted.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, if you leave them plugged in for too long, the curlers get too hot and their plastic edges start to melt.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>My old rollers have met their match (and have been exceeded in some ways).</li>
            <li>Like hot rollers from years ago, the wax in the core melts, heating the roller, retaining heat for a long time.  </li>
            <li>When I wear my hair natural, I have to spend 20 minutes with the hair dryer and diffuser</li>
            <li>They do get hot, very hot, but it takes at least 20 minutes for them to get that way.  </li>
            <li>These rollers do exactly what they claim, and I do have less of a frizziness issue on normal humidity days.</li>
            <li>And in case you are wondering we sent the extra large clips back for a refund and within the 30 days they allow.  </li>
            <li>After attempting to roll my hair and placing a clip on it, the hair and curler fell out.&lt;br /&gt;Clips were much too loose and wouldn&#x27;t work with rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Returned</li>
            <li>I guess just because they are large/jumbo does not necessarily mean they are ment for long hair.</li>
            <li>These they fall within an hour to bare waves.</li>
            <li>I like the shape of the curl that the curlers make--much smoother than other brands I have used--but they do get very hot and can burn your fingers and dry out your hair; so I let them heat up and then pull the plug while I use them so that they stop getting hotter.  </li>

            <li> and they didn&#x27;t hold the heat long enough to curl anything</li>

            <li> My daughter has long thick hair</li>
            <li> these clips just don&#x27;t seem to hold the rollers tightly.</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> only thing I would change is that the clips are not able to be stored in the case, I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to lose them when they&#x27;re not in use.</li>
            <li> The curlers are too hard and the clips are awkward to use, alot bigger in size than it appears in the photo.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that can be made to curl by using a brush, and these would not curl my hair!</li>
            <li> So-------------buyer beware if you purchase from Remington and have trouble their customer service stinks.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the provided clips to hold in the rollers.</li>
            <li> basically said that their customer service was terrible and mentioned the fact that they had not even bothered to reply to a simple pair of e-mails.  </li>
            <li> Understanding that this set was a &amp;#34;reconditioned&amp;#34; set I thought that maybe is was just a bad set.  </li>
            <li> I had to go to work with my hair coated in wax, which immidiately hardened and flaked, so it was in an ugly ponytail.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>
            <li> This products is horrible.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Overall terrible product</li>
            <li> The curlers ate horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible.</li>

            <li> Then these are the curlers for you! I loved these curlers when I first got them ; however, they do not have an on/off switch. Therefore, if you leave them plugged in for too long, the curlers get too hot and their plastic edges start to melt.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t find this out until you remove them from your hair and find hardened plastic glued to your hair! What a mess!</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the curl that the curlers make--much smoother than other brands I have used--but they do get very hot and can burn your fingers and dry out your hair; so I let them heat up and then pull the plug while I use them so that they stop getting hotter.  It does not seem to have a thermostat.  I do not know how hot they actually get, but if you leave them plugged in for too long, you will hear a cracking sound coming from somewhere within the unit or curlers. I have two sets and both do the same thing.</li>
            <li> Understanding that this set was a &amp;#34;reconditioned&amp;#34; set I thought that maybe is was just a bad set.  But after returning this set and buying a new set at the store. Still had the same results.  These roller did not get hot enough and the clips are pointless.</li>
            <li> These hair rollers will roll into your hair, and then roll out of it. I am guessing that&#x27;s why they named it that, because it definitely does not curl. I have thick curly hair that can be made to curl by using a brush, and these would not curl my hair! lol</li>
            <li> I was looking for larger rollers for long hair. I am not impressed with the provided clips to hold in the rollers. I tried different amounts of hair and rolled in different directions - these clips just don&#x27;t seem to hold the rollers tightly. I will probably return to using the old-fashioned U-shaped pins that I&#x27;ve always used with hot rollers. Otherwise the rollers seem to heat quickly and rolled easily. The lid however, didn&#x27;t seem to fit on the product - after opening it the first time, I can&#x27;t get it to fully close.</li>
            <li> This products is horrible.  Especially if you have very long or very thick hair. The curlers do get nice and hot, but the clips are junk and they cannot hold your hair.</li>
            <li> After attempting to roll my hair and placing a clip on it, the hair and curler fell out.&lt;br /&gt;Clips were much too loose and wouldn&#x27;t work with rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Returned it</li>
            <li> Was trying to purchase this item for a long time; discontinued by the company. So happy to find it! Perfect.</li>
            <li> After 10+ years my hot rollers broke. I was pretty sure that nothing was going to Beas good as my old ones, but isn&#x27;t out to find some much needed wide rollers to help tame my frizzy/curly hair in the mornings. My old rollers have met their match (and have been exceeded in some ways). These rollers do exactly what they claim, and I do have less of a frizziness issue on normal humidity days. I also like the improved clips to hold the rollers in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is that the clips are not able to be stored in the case, I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to lose them when they&#x27;re not in use. It would be nice if they could add on a compartment that snapped shut where unused roller clips could live.</li>
            <li> Rollers are ok.... They heat up fairly (10ish min) quickly &amp; case is compact. My daughter has long thick hair and they didn&#x27;t hold the heat long enough to curl anything but her ends. The clips don&#x27;t hold very well either, seemed like when they got clipped on the heat may have loosened them some &amp; the roller fell out. I guess just because they are large/jumbo does not necessarily mean they are ment for long hair. We have ordered Remmington model H9000 to try, hopefully we can achieve the look we&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li> I purchased this specifically for the &#x27;wax core&#x27; technology.  Like hot rollers from years ago, the wax in the core melts, heating the roller, retaining heat for a long time.  I used these twice, and the second time the WAX LEAKED ALL OVER MY HAIR!!  I had to go to work with my hair coated in wax, which immidiately hardened and flaked, so it was in an ugly ponytail.  Took me FOREVER to get the wax out.  I tried returning it, only to be told my &#x27;return window&#x27; expired a day ago.  There is no option to contact the seller.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this set because I have long, wavy hair and sometimes I want a smoother look.  When I wear my hair natural, I have to spend 20 minutes with the hair dryer and diffuser and it&#x27;s a pain.  I wanted to wake up, heat up the rollers and then let them cool, all within a 30 minute time frame.  I didn&#x27;t count on two things:  first, the picture shows the metal clips, which are preferable since they hold and don&#x27;t leave marks.  My set came with plastic clips that are supposed to secure the roller but which actually mess up the whole process because they leave dents.  I knew this and that&#x27;s why I ordered a set that showed the metal clips.  Second, they take forever to heat up and I don&#x27;t have time to wait.  They do get hot, very hot, but it takes at least 20 minutes for them to get that way.  Too long.  I tried using the plastic clips but, just like I supposed, they leave dents and you can&#x27;t place the roller the way you want because the plastic clips are inadequate at holding them in the desired position.  I&#x27;ll be sending this set back to Amazon.  Get a different set.  I should have spent a little more money and gotten what I really wanted.  Shame on me.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap&lt;br /&gt;Roller clips are cheap and don&#x27;t hold rollers&lt;br /&gt;Rollers don&#x27;t sit correctly on heating elements&lt;br /&gt;Overall terrible product</li>
            <li> The curlers ate horrible. Not only were they refurbished(really?) the clips melted on the first use, and were not tight enough to keep the curlers in. Horrible, horrible.</li>
            <li> This hair setter is fantastic! It not only is small enough to fit into your suitcase but the heat emitted from the unit provides a quality \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; to hair and also more body (believe it or not). I have medium-length fine straight hair: I need only hair body and some curl and sheen to my hair (I cannot use hairspray). I found this setter to be perfect in treating me to a perfect style.</li>
            <li> The curlers do not heat up enough.  The clips are flimsy and fall out.  There is no on off switch.  Would not buy these again. I purchased them and shipped them overseas to my travel destination and if I had the resources would have shipped them back.</li>
            <li> First off this isn&#x27;t about the above product per say but it is about Remington Model KF 201 which are smaller heat rollers.  My wife wanted extra clips for her set of KF201&#x27;s so I Googled Remington heat rod clips and their site came up.  It showed the exact same colors as her set so we ordered three sets because she has two sets of these heat rollers, one for home and one for travel.  What arrived was the same color but the smallest that arrived were larger then the large ones in her two sets of heat curlers.  Soooooo I e-mailed Remington, waited about 10 days, no reply so I e-mailed again, waited 10 days and still no reply.  Then yesterday of all things we received an e-mail from Remington wanting a product review on the clips.  So we wrote them a review as they requested and basically said that their customer service was terrible and mentioned the fact that they had not even bothered to reply to a simple pair of e-mails.  Today we received an e-mail from Remington stating that the review was not up to their high quality standards and it would not be published.  The nerve of them, ask for a review, didn&#x27;t like what it said so they refused to put it out there.  So-------------buyer beware if you purchase from Remington and have trouble their customer service stinks.  Frankly we will never purchase another product with their name on it and I hope others will follow suit.  If you are going to sell a product in this day and age you had better be taking care of the customer.  All of this would have been avoided had they just simply replied to our e-mail and made things right.  And in case you are wondering we sent the extra large clips back for a refund and within the 30 days they allow.  All bets are off as to our receiving a full refund as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GWM</li>
            <li> So for the first few days they were ok. They didn&#x27;t really curl my hair as much as I like it (I have been using the same curlers for 10 years and just decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;) because they didn&#x27;t ever get hot enough. Then I noticed some gross stuff in my hair one day and the rollers were actually DECOMPOSING and leaving residue behind. I returned for a full refund... but eww!</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair</li>
            <li> This kit was nice, well made and shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;But it did nothing for my hair. I tried them in every different way, with hairspray, keeping them in until they cooled completely, with wet hair, dry hair, damp hair, drying my hair while wearing them. y hair will keep a curl great if I use an iron. These they fall within an hour to bare waves. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> The curlers are too hard and the clips are awkward to use, alot bigger in size than it appears in the photo.</li>
