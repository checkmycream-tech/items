            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I had to order more, and go out to a store to buy applicator, would have been nice to know this up front.</li>
            <li>This is a great product...very gentle for your hair</li>
            <li>When I say better</li>
            <li>Not harsh, good color tone, use it exclusively and the price is fair.</li>
            <li>Naturtint was ok, but the color seemed to fade rather dramatically after a couple of weeks, and</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;It was very gentle on my hair, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re covering up grey and are reapplying, I&#x27;ve found that applying it to the roots for 20 mins, then all over for another 20 mins is the perfect time.</li>
            <li>STRONG WARNING!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expected it to leave my hair shiny and not damaged, but the softness is incredible, the color very pretty and covers my gray better than anything else I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>No bad odor, easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I loved it, I am allergic to fragrance and finally I found a good product, very soft on your hair.</li>
            <li>No amonia and color stays true for longer than 30 days.</li>
            <li>This covers gray better, and you don&#x27;t have to use the whole box at once</li>
            <li>It actually looked kind of nice in and of itself, but it did make me look a lot older, so I started coloring it a couple of years ago with Naturtint after an unimpressive test with premixed henna</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that going a shade or two lighter than normal might be best, since my usual 6N was darker in this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, after two weeks of shampooing, my hair is looking more my natural color.  </li>
            <li>This is a good choice for those of us who prefer products that are a bit kinder to nature and the little animals, and it&#x27;s gentle to skin and easy to use.eference.</li>

            <li>However, I switched right away to 7N and as time goes on</li>
            <li>You get the right color without ruining your hair.</li>
            <li>The color is natural, and the product is really easy on your hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>you should order &amp;#34;Blonde&amp;#34; be fully aware the color you will get will be BROWN-dark brown.</li>
            <li>I really wish it came with a mixing bottle though!</li>
            <li>The color seemed to last just as long as far as I can tell, and it sure felt and looked a lot better.  </li>
            <li>The color seemed to last just as long as far as I can tell, and it sure felt and looked a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this color for some 9 years and they are safest on the market and cover gray really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d try a gentle product this time.</li>
            <li>I bought 7N (light blonde) and used it for 20 minutes rather than the recommended 40.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ll try that again when I&#x27;m ready to taper off of coloring altogether).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much longer between colorings, too.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cover much as I was hoping, which is a shame because I really wanted it to work, since it&#x27;s natural :</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The gray hairs are still slightly twinkly through the color compared to the non-grays, which worried me at first, but the color still hangs in there well, and it seems more natural than a monochromatic mass of clearly dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally have my hair colored in a salon-thought</li>
            <li>I started using Herbatint when I got pregnant and didn&#x27;t want to use any rough chemicals.</li>
            <li>The N range is recommended for covering gray hair, and I try to choose one step lighter than my natural color, somewhere between my old brown and the new grays.  </li>
            <li>I mean longer, more complete gray coverage that doesn&#x27;t give out before the new growth shows.  </li>
            <li>The product did not work very well for me dispite following directions.  </li>
            <li>My natural hair is curly med-dark brown with a lot of premature gray.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am cheap and impatient with beauty regimens, and Herbatint fits both my budget and my annoyance threshold.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am cheap and impatient with beauty regimens, and Herbatint fits both my budget and my annoyance threshold.  </li>
            <li>I spent the next week washing my hair with dishwashing liquid, different shampoos and even bought a semi-permanent light blonde to lighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>The color covers my gray much longer than any other product I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I am able to leave this on for about 40 minutes, enough to hit the grays, without it irritating my skin or making me feel woozy.  </li>
            <li>Since the goal for graying hair is to hit the roots as much as possible, I found this difficult and tedious with my curly mop and just bought my own mixing squirt bottle, which works much better for me.  </li>

            <li> others have said, these colors run dark; the first shade I chose (6N) was much darker than expected, and unfortunately the areas of my hair that were previously colored with Naturtint really sucked in the dark dye, with a couple of small darker patches still evident months later.  </li>

            <li> This is a great product. I do wish it had been clear that if you use a &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; base, &amp;#34;G&amp;#34;, you need to also buy a similiar color in the &amp;#34;N&amp;#34; line, mix them to make the product cover &amp;#34;lots of gray&amp;#34;. I also did not understand that I needed to buy a &amp;#34;color brush&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;None of this affected the quality of the product, or the wonderful response time, etc. of the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just my feedback. I had to order more, and go out to a store to buy applicator, would have been nice to know this up front.</li>
            <li> This herbal hair coloring is amazing! I expected it to leave my hair shiny and not damaged, but the softness is incredible, the color very pretty and covers my gray better than anything else I&#x27;ve used for years. When I say better I mean longer, more complete gray coverage that doesn&#x27;t give out before the new growth shows.  My hair is very short, and whatever of this you don&#x27;t mix for instant use you can save so I get at least a touch-up from the same bottle. I&#x27;ve found that going a shade or two lighter than normal might be best, since my usual 6N was darker in this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the easiest home coloring product I&#x27;ve used in years, and it&#x27;ll be the last.</li>
            <li> The product did not work very well for me dispite following directions.  Maybe I need to go to a professiona!!</li>
            <li> Best hair color ever! Is not permanent but I swear, I have had about 20 shampoos since my last one, and still impecable.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use but doesn&#x27;t cover gray well or at least not mine very well especially the sideburns.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have ammonia, which is probalby why it doesn&#x27;t cover the gray well.</li>
            <li> This product is great. No offensive chemicals to breathe. I leave on about 10 minutes longer than instructions state.&lt;br /&gt;I mix the 7n and 7d 50/50 for great gray coverage and perfect color.</li>
            <li> I have allergies.  This is a product that I can use with confidence.</li>
            <li> I like that I am not putting all the harsh chemicals on my hair as other dyes.  But it does come out very dark.</li>
            <li> I have been using this color for some 9 years and they are safest on the market and cover gray really well. No amonia and color stays true for longer than 30 days.</li>
            <li> Best hair dye ever!  Wish I had found it years ago - leaves my hair shiny!  My mother mentioned my hair several times !</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cover much as I was hoping, which is a shame because I really wanted it to work, since it&#x27;s natural :(&lt;br /&gt;It was very gentle on my hair, which is a good thing. It left the hair feeling healthy, but the color coverage was disappointing.</li>
            <li> STRONG WARNING!&lt;br /&gt;If you should order &amp;#34;Blonde&amp;#34; be fully aware the color you will get will be BROWN-dark brown. I normally have my hair colored in a salon-thought I&#x27;d try a gentle product this time. No bad odor, easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Just was NOT blonde as box indicated.</li>
            <li> Before Herbatint, my hair was strawberry blonde w/gray.  I bought 7N (light blonde) and used it for 20 minutes rather than the recommended 40.  It was at that point that the skin at my hairline started burning.  When I looked in the mirror, my hair was a very deep brown.  When I dried my hair, it was so dark.  I spent the next week washing my hair with dishwashing liquid, different shampoos and even bought a semi-permanent light blonde to lighten my hair.  Now, after two weeks of shampooing, my hair is looking more my natural color.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.  If I could give it a rating of a minus star, I would.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best hair color in the world.  The color is natural, and the product is really easy on your hair and scalp.  Do yourself a favor and do it yourself.  Your hair will thank you.  Tip: use a lighter color than you think you will need.</li>

            <li> My natural hair is curly med-dark brown with a lot of premature gray.  It actually looked kind of nice in and of itself, but it did make me look a lot older, so I started coloring it a couple of years ago with Naturtint after an unimpressive test with premixed henna (I&#x27;ll try that again when I&#x27;m ready to taper off of coloring altogether).  Naturtint was ok, but the color seemed to fade rather dramatically after a couple of weeks, and leaving it on long enough to cover the gray would often make me feel dizzy and nauseous.  So I decided to try Herbatint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, these colors run dark; the first shade I chose (6N) was much darker than expected, and unfortunately the areas of my hair that were previously colored with Naturtint really sucked in the dark dye, with a couple of small darker patches still evident months later.  However, I switched right away to 7N and as time goes on I&#x27;m really liking the color. I might try 8N this summer. The N range is recommended for covering gray hair, and I try to choose one step lighter than my natural color, somewhere between my old brown and the new grays.  This seems to be a good rule of thumb for me.  I am able to leave this on for about 40 minutes, enough to hit the grays, without it irritating my skin or making me feel woozy.  The gray hairs are still slightly twinkly through the color compared to the non-grays, which worried me at first, but the color still hangs in there well, and it seems more natural than a monochromatic mass of clearly dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Naturtint, Herbatint does not come with a mixing bottle and recommends mixing in a non-reactive dish and applying with a brush. Since the goal for graying hair is to hit the roots as much as possible, I found this difficult and tedious with my curly mop and just bought my own mixing squirt bottle, which works much better for me.  The color and developer bottles each contain 60ml of liquid.  My hair is about shoulder-length and thirsty, for reference. I usually measure out 15ml of each into a small container for a touch up application (entire hairline, all around natural part) for which I do use a small plastic container and brush, and the remaining product is enough to mix in the squirt bottle for a &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; application.  I do one or the other about every 18-21 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like least about this line is the companion shampoo and conditioner, which they encourage you to use after treatment to help the color set.  These leave my hair looking and feeling like straw.  The last time I colored, I did use their shampoo packet but broke down and used a coconut deep conditioning pack instead of the Herbatint &amp;#34;Royal Creme&amp;#34;.  The color seemed to last just as long as far as I can tell, and it sure felt and looked a lot better.  If it didn&#x27;t make my already fragile hair so dry, I would use the companion conditioner, since it&#x27;s designed to work together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am cheap and impatient with beauty regimens, and Herbatint fits both my budget and my annoyance threshold.  This is a good choice for those of us who prefer products that are a bit kinder to nature and the little animals, and it&#x27;s gentle to skin and easy to use.eference.

            <li> The color covers my gray much longer than any other product I have purchased. I really wish it came with a mixing bottle though!</li>
            <li> I started using Herbatint when I got pregnant and didn&#x27;t want to use any rough chemicals. This hair dye is amazing! I have been using it for three years already. You get the right color without ruining your hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It&#x27;s about $15/box at my local store, so this is a steal.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of grey hair for my age, so I wanted dye that wasn&#x27;t loaded with a ton of chemicals, since I use it about once/month.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have ammonia, so it&#x27;s not as harsh &amp; no strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re covering up grey and are reapplying, I&#x27;ve found that applying it to the roots for 20 mins, then all over for another 20 mins is the perfect time.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I will never go back to regular haircolor again! This covers gray better, and you don&#x27;t have to use the whole box at once if you don&#x27;t need to. It&#x27;s much longer between colorings, too. You do need to buy about three shades lighter than you want your hair, because colors run dark. My hair is auburn, and I have to buy the &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; shade to achieve that result.</li>
            <li> THIS COLOR DOES NOT MAKE MY SCALP ITCH OR BURN LIKE SOME OTHERS  I LIKE THAT IT IS SAFER TO USE AND THE ODOR IS NOT STRONG  THE COLOR IS GOOD AS WELL  IT DOES TAKE A GOOD AMOUNT OF CONDITIONER BUT THE HAIR SPRINGS BACK</li>
            <li> I loved it, I am allergic to fragrance and finally I found a good product, very soft on your hair.</li>
