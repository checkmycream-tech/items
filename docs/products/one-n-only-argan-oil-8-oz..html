            <li> Great for face and hair</li>
            <li> The best detangler and anti- frizz product I&#x27;ve found for my curly long hair. I use it every day when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Ist is not pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of this product. It softens my natural hair and smells great! However; I&#x27;m a but weiry after reading the ingredients and finding it contains mineral oil. I also tried rubbing it into my hands and found it left a sticky film so I&#x27;m sure it does the same on my hair. Debating on switching to something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for several years. Works well on my hair. Use a little every morning!!</li>
            <li> Gr8 product, price could be a little less. The speed of shipment was below average from this company. This is an excellent product , that will soon be discontinued. The company that makes very expensive Morocan Oil , is trying to corner the market. By getting rid of the smaller less expensive, brands that work just as well, if not better...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It really tames my dry, curly hair.  It smells WONDERFUL!  I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how fantastic my hair smells and looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Beauty used to carry this, but it&#x27;s gotten crazy expensive there.  This was not only exactly what I wanted, but at a really good price and I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house!  Just a word of caution, it only takes a little bit in your hair, otherwise your hair will look and feel oily.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel not only soft but very moisturized without feeling sticky or oily. Just take a quarter -size in your palms rub them together and spread it evenly in your hair.</li>
            <li> If you have frizzy and/or dry hair this oil treatment is made for YOU.  A little application for a long way for your hair and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily or feel heavy.  Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Love this Argan Oil.  Smells nice.  A little goes a long way.  Glad I purchased this.  I put a drop in my palm and mix with my hand lotion.  Makes the skin feel so good.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this total body oil from head to toe use</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves my hair silky smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It makes your hair feel nice and soft. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item and I plan to purchase more bottles at least 1 bottle a month. It smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this on my dry hair works wonderfuly</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. Great price for the size.</li>
            <li> I got a sample with a new flat iron. It is great stuff!</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd bottle...use it everywhere...my face and skin...and hair!! thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moraccan Oil for 6 years now. I decided to try this product after given a tiny sample. I must say that I love this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have course hair thats naturally curly but I get it chemically relaxed and dyed. I use Agadir shampoo &amp; conditioner. After towel blotting, I spray Its A 10, then use a smoothing cream (No inhibition-purple bottle) and then this oil.  I then blow dry my hair in sections &amp; then use a straightening flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not apply this or anything once my hair is dry. That is the mistake most people do. Always apply to damp hair. My hair after its done is nice &amp; soft. I&#x27;m always told that my hair is always shiny &amp; healthy looking which makes me laugh on the inside. If only people saw what my hair looks like after blow drying lol. Will definitely reorder when its time.</li>
            <li> The delivery was promt and I LOVE this product, it makes my hair so soft!!!! I just wish they would have sent me tracking information before it was shipped.</li>
            <li> Excellent for hair and skin. I am 50 , and  I have used  oil on my skin for years. As a result ,I am happy to say that I have no wrinkles!</li>
            <li> My hair lives and breathes for this oil!! I am on my third bottle. I began using it a while ago, mostly because I love the smell, but hadn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair until other people kept complementing me. My hair was actually healthier, more even with less fly aways, and had a nice non-greasy shine to it. Unfortunately, after I ran out it slowly began to break again. I tried the Moroccan oil instead. I didn&#x27;t like it. When my hair was dry, I would apply it but could still hear how dry my hair was (sounds kind of like hay). So I bought the argan oil again and poof! Back to beautiful hair! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I&#x27;m never going to stop using THIS oil (and I&#x27;m very critical of the products I put in my hair)!</li>
            <li> Smells good.  I used on hair and body and it seems to moisturize well.</li>
            <li> Product is great for dry hair. Item was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This oil is the best one for your hair i love is so so so much is for any hair you will love is</li>
