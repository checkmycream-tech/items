            <li>While the formula of this mascara is great, I&#x27;m no fan of the wand.  </li>

            <li>I am still debating which one I like more between this and Benifit&#x27;s, but either way, it&#x27;s one of the best mascara&#x27;s out their and a great buy.</li>
            <li>I could wave a magic (mascara) wand and have the perfect waterproof mascara, my wish would go like this:  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a Great Lash girl but read some good reviews about this and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, it looks great when applied.</li>
            <li>It gave me nice volume!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mascara for a year now and still loving it!</li>
            <li>The LashBlast Fusion mascara is a wonderful makeup product that I would strongly recommend to anyone.an</li>
            <li>The LashBlast Fusion mascara is a wonderful makeup product that I would strongly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is really good.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to compare it to something that may be a superior product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share of mascara searching...</li>
            <li>I wasnt blown away by the volume, and I would have liked this in waterproof, but al in all, for the price it was great.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and I will use up this tube...</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>does a good job of thickening and lengthening lashes.</li>
            <li>Over all this was good product.  </li>
            <li>The brush on this mascara is good for separating lashes and avoiding the clumping that occurs when you want to apply layers.</li>
            <li>and I got it for a good deal on here when purchased.</li>
            <li>I have been using this formula since it came out and for a good reason -</li>
            <li>This mascara provides good coverage and mimimal clumping.  </li>
            <li>It has good staying</li>
            <li>It almost is as good as  department store brand mascaras.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly and coats my lashes perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the packaging (I dislike fat tubes), but this is good</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for a good quality mascara for a good price that doesnt clump your lashes together-</li>
            <li>the size fooled me it works really good not clumby</li>
            <li>Good quality for an item around $7.</li>
            <li>Good value</li>
            <li>but it works good and does what its supposed to do (:</li>
            <li>I have loved this product for years.  </li>
            <li>Good mascara for the price.  </li>
            <li>This, coupled with Maybelline Great Lash as a first coat, gives you the best lashes EVER!</li>
            <li>Great product easy to use and looks great on.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with it.</li>
            <li>Goes on great and stays on. : )</li>
            <li>and she was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love the brush on the wand, and this mascara is really great for creating fuller lashes.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with Covergirl and their products</li>
            <li>Works great, mostly.  </li>
            <li>What I love best about it is the fact it washes off so easy.</li>
            <li>Truly beautiful easy breezy cover girl.</li>
            <li>but if you prefer a natural look I would not be the best at judging if you&#x27;d be happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Perfecto, love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I love LashBlastFusion!</li>
            <li>love all of the covergirl mascaras!</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this mascara and would certainly recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>The silicone wand is amazing for separating lashes.</li>
            <li>It separates lashes nicely.    </li>
            <li>I tried this Mascara, LashBlast Fusion in the purple tub and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>and it separates the lashes nicely to give a fullness.</li>
            <li>The brush kind of clumps the mascara on it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline Great Lash mascara for many, many years, and I&#x27;m going to stick with that.</li>
            <li>The applicator is nice and the mascara itself when on nicely.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is nice</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this mascara until something better comes along, as the price and quality are both good.</li>
            <li>what kind of mascara I use.</li>
            <li>It is just as great as the original, but with just a touch better lengthening skills!  </li>
            <li>but I really liked it.</li>
            <li>and it seems to do a nice job of distributing and separating the lashes.</li>
            <li>Better than Maybelline Great Lash, slightly better (on the no smudging part) than Loreal.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I liked this mascara.</li>
            <li>great product!, delivered fast.</li>
            <li>I simply love this mascara, easy to use and always reliable for beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>this mascara I experienced no flaking, no smudges it goes on clean and stays where you put it.</li>
            <li>Very cheap and does better than the ones $20+ that I have tried!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as good as waterproof, but it&#x27;s better than most.</li>
            <li>One good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t smudge and it seems to come off easily when I wash my face.</li>
            <li>Pros were that it didn&#x27;t flake or clump, added a good amount of volume, and comes in a cute tube (purple is my favorite color).</li>
            <li>is very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>The handle is very easy to maneuver and there was no clumping on the brush.  </li>
            <li>They look longer, thicker, and more voluminous, which I love!</li>
            <li>Overall a great Product and easy to use and works Great!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara, it works amazing..</li>
            <li>is a perfect mascara for someone looking to make their eyelashes look fuller and longer, but still natural looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super effective!</li>
            <li>I do believe this mascara is a great alternative to higher end mascara</li>
            <li>so my eyelashes are very light.</li>
            <li>The brush pulls out very smooth and didn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>While this gives me more length, my eyelashes aren&#x27;t plentiful</li>
            <li>whether I want more volume or more length as to which mascara</li>
            <li>The brush has so many bristles that it really does a great job of separating the lashes and avoiding clumps.</li>
            <li>My 3 favorite mascaras:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mascara is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This formula thickens and lengthens more than most mascaras.</li>
            <li>A second coat makes it look just perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>This mascara does in one coat what many take 3 coats to do.    </li>
            <li>I was able to use it with my contacts in with no irritation to my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love cosmetics</li>
            <li>This mascara was just ok, all in all</li>
            <li>This worked okay for me and was one of the better brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>it just sweeps every hair on the eyelash and of no clumps or heavyness and it comes in diff shades too so a must buy ,,, love it</li>
            <li>I have tried &#x27;many&#x27; mascara&#x27;s that claim to build lashes without clumps, when I saw a review in Allure mag about the Cover Girl brand in the PURPLE TUBE..</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>This mascara was just ok for me.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t look much better.    </li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara to give me more volume.</li>
            <li>What more to say?</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now buying two more tubs</li>
            <li>things about this mascara, it works, and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I probably will not purchase again though, because I prefer something that is going to volumize better.</li>
            <li>To return the tube of mascara would end up costing me more money, so I will just cut my loss and move on.  </li>
            <li>now this is perfect for someone who likes to wear just a tiny bit of mascara</li>
            <li>if i was able to return it after trying it i would.</li>
            <li>I use my favorite comb-</li>
            <li>It would be in my top 5 choices.</li>
            <li>Most mascaras are this way.</li>
            <li>I went through dozens of mascaras and this is the most legit.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s better than clinique and lancome.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all - while I love</li>
            <li>The LashBlast in the orange tube worked better than this did.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite drug store mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup junkie, and I love this mascara...if this isn&#x27;t doing it for your lashes</li>
            <li>(Mrs. Brcik&#x27;s review) I love this product</li>

            <li>I know for a fact they sell CoverGirl at almost all drug stores, Targets, WalMarts, grocery stores, and much more.    </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Was I sleeping better?  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it&#x27;s my go to product.</li>
            <li>Love it anyway.</li>
            <li>The product is just okay.</li>
            <li>I love cover girl mascara.</li>
            <li>Sometimes $20 or more for one tube.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>What more could you want.</li>
            <li>Favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I purchased it after reading many reviews and watching the videos.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did otherwise</li>
            <li>And I love it because of the brush.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Its not my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>There are so many choices with mascaras now that it all depends on what you need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like DiorShow but is so much more affordable</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok by me.</li>
            <li>This product is one I&#x27;ve been buying for a while, i love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the overall look and feel.</li>
            <li>Its okay.</li>
            <li>Though I still love my [[ASIN:B004AZZ0QK</li>
            <li>This also seems to hold longer and is almost weightless even with three or more layers on.</li>
            <li>i would repurchase it for sure</li>
            <li>Stays on pretty good most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I spent many years and many dollars trying to find the best mascara out there.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to get good coverage on most of my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to run or smear much at all and washes off nicely with warm water &amp; soap.</li>
            <li>Worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li>This is a very good overall mascara.</li>
            <li>I used the mascara for a couple of weeks before writing the review, so I could be sure to give an accurate overview of it.</li>
            <li>and it goes on amazingly get this stuff worth it</li>
            <li>This did give volume, it went on smooth and without too many clumps and for me it stayed on all day.</li>
            <li>The brush is really good, and the formula really doesn&#x27;t flake or clump at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s right!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>I love the original lash blast, it&#x27;s my go-to mascara.</li>
            <li>i got to try it as a sample many good things being a Buzzagent .. get free stuff to try as soon as new products hit the market ..</li>
            <li>I like an easy wand for easy application.  </li>
            <li>I have found that it washes off easily with just a washrag and water.  </li>
            <li>and this comes off easily.</li>
            <li>I bought the \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot; one, but it rubs off so easily it&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not have flaking and the mascara washes of easily.  </li>
            <li>Stays put but is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>LashBlast stays on my lashes all day without smearing and comes off easily  without abuse to your eyes.</li>
            <li>The LashBlast Fusion mascara is inexpensive and easily found in stores or online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mascara is not waterproof, so it comes off eyelashes easily with eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>Although it is easily removed, it stays on lashes well throughout the day without flaking or smudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply</li>
            <li>It does not clump,  provides length,  and is easily removed.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply and it stays put all day.</li>
            <li>It lengthens and is build-able, doesn&#x27;t clump, easily washable and separates lashes well.</li>
            <li>Never clumpy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Comes of easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I really liked the (Orange) Covergirl lashblast, so when I saw this at Costco in a 5 pack and saw the pretty purple body I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love mascara, but refuse to spend $20 or more on &#x27;good&#x27; mascara, especially since they expire supposedly within 3 months of opening.</li>
            <li>It is many times better than the first 2 Covergirl mascaras I tried.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li>of all, it comes OFF smooth and easy without greasy makeup</li>
            <li>When I first tried this mascara I was impressed by the fuller bristles and larger applicator brush.  </li>
            <li>like to try new things but will not stray from this mascara again!!!!!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a mascara that makes your eyes look huge, doesn&#x27;t clump, comes off easily, and is cheap...</li>
            <li>I deducted a star for price; I&#x27;d like to see it a little cheaper but aside from that, the product itself is wonderful.</li>
            <li>My friends noticed my lashes were longer &amp; thicker on the first day I wore this! :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but I have a huge \\&quot;smudge\\&quot; problem (perhaps its my eye cream I use).  </li>
            <li>Only downside for me is the huge clunky container, but its nothing compared to having great lashes.  </li>
            <li>I was given a free sample of Covergirl&#x27;s Lash Blast Fusion Mascara for being a Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>As a BzzAgent, I received a free sample of CoverGirl&#x27;s LashBlast Fusion in order to try it out.  </li>
            <li>but i would just like to get my item at once hassle free from now on.</li>
            <li>i found this one too light for my taste...</li>
            <li>The mascara corrected the issue of the light color, but it started to flake at the ends about 3 hours into wearing.</li>
            <li>It extended and filled in my lashes without clumps.</li>
            <li>The pictures are available under the picture of the product as additional views.</li>
            <li>Therefore, when you go to apply the mascara onto your lashes, it will go on smoothly onto your lashes without clumping.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it look great</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth with no clumping.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product as a BuzzAgent</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on smoothly without any clumping.  </li>
            <li>It really does make my lashes look fuller because it coats them so nice and evenly.  </li>
            <li>I received this mascara for free from a promotional campaign.</li>
            <li>I had to add some water to make it smooth again.  </li>
            <li>I saw this mascara offered at a fantastic price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It seems to just add color to my lashes since they are light.  </li>
            <li>lately!&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent this product for free to review for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re real but don&#x27;t want to justify spending that kind of craziness on mascara all the time</li>
            <li>This formula is light but provides coverage that look dense.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about this except that is a good mascara, works well, and is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy and quick to apply.</li>
            <li>found it went on pretty smoothly although you had to watch out to make sure it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Pretty good if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive alternative to the high end!</li>
            <li>formula is long-lasting for a non-waterproof, and does not wear off throughout the day, yet can be removed very easily when you&#x27;re ready.</li>
            <li>I bought them for my freinds and aunts, who love them very much.</li>
            <li>I finally found CoverGirl Lash Blast and was super happy with it and used it for 1-2 years.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it was a nice staple to add to your kaboodle! :)</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY mascaras since I first began wearing make up; always with a goal to get thicker, longer lashes (without having to go with falsies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>If your looking for a mascara that really extends the eyelashes out then your better off trying another kind of mascara, personally Lancome Hynose Drama does the job pretty good</li>
            <li>With the results I got with this particular mascara, I can see it easily becoming my favorite go-to mascara.</li>
            <li>The mascara easily lasted over 11 hours and still looked fresh.</li>
            <li>mascara brush comes out of the tube cleanly and without clumps and bumps.  </li>
            <li>It darkens, separates, and thickens enough that it looks like my own lashes, but better.</li>
            <li>but nothing special.</li>
            <li>This is amazing when you first use it but after a while it dries out really fast so just put a drop or two in there and mix it around.</li>
            <li>They even give my lashes a nice natural curl.</li>
            <li>I just tried CoverGirl&#x27;s newest mascara called LashBlast Fusion and my overall reaction is that it is good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told before that I look better without lots of makeup, and working in construction there isn&#x27;t much use for it.  </li>
            <li>I received a full size tube of LashBlastFusion from Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li>you did have to make sure not to get too much mascara on the wand</li>
            <li>i have ok type of eyelashes and this one worked real well</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge and it adds both volume and length in a full and well defined lash.  </li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of failures.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>This mascara is true to the cover girl brand.</li>
            <li>keeps the mascara fresh and bacteria free.  </li>
            <li>It makes all your individual lashes thicker and separates them to look good.</li>
            <li>In any case, I have a drawer full of high-end mascara samples</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything that special about it other than it was a GREAT value.</li>
            <li>At best this product adds a little color to your lashes, but it certainly does not add the volume it claims to.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub off easily and it is pretty flexible.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice sized tube that is very easy to grip and hold onto, and I much prefer the bulk of it to the smaller wands.</li>
            <li>I love Cover Girl mascara, so I was excited to try out this new version.  </li>
            <li>My Girls love their new CoverGirl Mascara and they are the experts, Trust me!  </li>
            <li>but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>and I think this tube is pretty cute and pretty large and easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it went on pretty smoothly</li>
            <li>Even though the mascara (formula) is SUPERB for volumizing/lengthening, the brush is not good for skimpy lashes.  </li>
            <li>I currently use LashBlast Fusion mascara by CoverGirl, and I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>It did not affect my use of contact lenses, and caused no unpleasant reactions with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>I will try a new brand of mascara (still haven&#x27;t found one I absolutely love even after trying lash stiletto</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and you really feel it do its thing as you apply it.</li>
            <li>Finally, on last go-over with the eyelash comb and perfect looking, long lashes are there in all their glory.</li>
            <li>Cover Girl Lash Blast Fusion is a mascara that doesn&#x27;t easily clump and is VERY waterproof.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this mascara is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s their first ever volume + length mascara, and trust me it works!</li>
            <li>but now that I have I will buy in the future for sure!</li>
            <li>The first time i actually used this product it was gifted to me by my sis and since that day I fell in love</li>
            <li>However, I plan on using this mascara for everyday wear, I do think it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
            <li>Leaves me with great lashes, opening up my eyes a little bit as well.</li>
            <li>The brush is able to get all of your lashes, top and bottom and the formula stays on for a very very long time (if you wanted you could sleep in it!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the LashBlast Volume because it keeps my naturally straight eyelashes curled, so I decided to try out this mascara that promises volume &amp; length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a mascara yet that does, because of how thin the ends of my lashes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because the color is great, and the volume is great, but the flakiness was a big issue for me.</li>
            <li>Great everyday mascara.</li>
            <li>Then I will apply the mascara, and the brush my eyelashes again to keep them nicely seperated, then apply a second coat of mascara.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect product for my thin lashes.</li>
            <li>It stays in place and is also useful as a touch up filler.</li>
            <li>For a more natural look, just apply one coat onto your lashes.  </li>
            <li>It is rarely on sale in stores.  </li>
            <li>Without mascara, my lashes are kind of regular, probably on the skimpy side, but these make me look like I have falsies on.  </li>
            <li>It holds curl, does not smudge, you are getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>The regular Lash Blast (orange bottle) is far more effective.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is amazing and love it in both the Very Black and Brown</li>
            <li>and they are becoming my new favorites.</li>
            <li>More than many other cosmetic products</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast too!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly though and holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and does seem to produce nice black lashes, but it seems to separate the lashes, too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump as much as the original.</li>
            <li>Once I put it on, my lashes straighten out right away.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com has a $3 coupon right now, so why not try it?</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure of the wand--as my friend said, it kind of looks like a porcupine!  </li>
            <li>I have used this mascara for the past two weeks and have been incredibly happy.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample, and even though I normally don&#x27;t like mascara, I decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>This mascara alone does a pretty good job, but using other masacaras combined can give me the look I want</li>
            <li>I have honestly been looking a very long time for a mascara like this.  </li>
            <li>Give me the consistency of regular (non-waterproof) Maybelline Great Lash with the staying power of Blinc tubes and the skinny brush of Shiseido Lasting Lift Mascara.  </li>
            <li>I noticed right away the difference it made, my lashes appeared longer and more obvious.  </li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable so that will add to the value.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply very much at all.</li>
            <li>it makes my eyelashes look longer and thicker and doesn&#x27;t flake off through the day all at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>me first disclose that I received this particular tube of mascara as a full sized sample because I am a member of a website called Bzzagent</li>
            <li>the secret is the brush very good quality</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The way I apply this product is to first use an eyelash comb to seperate my eyeslashes (curling them first if so inclined).</li>
            <li>Overall LashBlastFusion is an OK mascara, but not one that I would specifically recommend or buy after trying it now.</li>
            <li>This mascara, while not 100% smudge-proof, is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I&#x27;ve really gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>If you say no and mine aren&#x27;t either, why are the applicators for most mascara&#x27;s, including this one, getting bigger?</li>
            <li>[I actually bent my brush to help curl my eyelashes without a curler, and it works better than buying a brush already bent.</li>
            <li>I love the way the mascara goes on initially.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different brands of mascara.</li>
            <li>First of all, the brush is too fat</li>
            <li>It really makes my eyes pop!</li>
            <li>I first thought that the many short bristles would actually create more clumps on my lashes when I received the sample but the first time I used this I found out that is not at all the case.</li>
            <li>it is pretty</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve learned of higher quality mascaras.</li>
            <li>, you can get great coverage of each lash without it looking too thick or gaudy.</li>
            <li>When I showed my dad, he thought my eyelashes were real!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get any clumps when I use it and it separates my lashes pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have simply never found anything better.</li>
            <li>I used to use Chanel and found this is better at elongating and thickening the lashes for a quarter to a third of the price.</li>
            <li>First off I found the mascara too be clumpy.</li>
            <li>but I always recommend curling lashes first, regardless of the brand, as it adds that additional punch.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara for my short lashes...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not...</li>
            <li>Absolutely waterproof!</li>
            <li>Clings to my lashes so well and really lengthens them!</li>
            <li>Still not comparable to some of my favorites such as Lancome and Shiseido brand (those brands are 4 times more also).</li>
            <li>It holds curl pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thanks CoverGirl for another dependable mascara!</li>
            <li>;) )</li>
            <li>This is a personal favorite \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; mascara of mine, because it both thickens and lengthens lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara makes your lashes look pretty without all of the \\&quot;dramatics\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Real! Mascara]](See Review)</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>It is a good mascara for everyday wear</li>
            <li>I think it is a good mascara for everyday wear......</li>
            <li>CoverGirl&#x27;s new mascara that gives a blast of volume and incredible length for dramatic lashes with full length volume.</li>
            <li>When this Fusion came out I bought some and am pleasantly surprised by the length, but I feel as if they sacrificed the volume that the original had.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to buy a new mascara and thought it would be super convenient with Amazon Prime to buy one.</li>
            <li>You can actually feel an almost stretchy feel to it as it grabs the first coat, and stretches on a second coat, giving a really full, long lash effect that is just beautiful.</li>
            <li>She likes it, Not that much pricy especially compare with some famous brands</li>
            <li>Really would prefer a more simpler tube and a smaller brush.</li>
            <li>Some of its positive qualities are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a mascara fiend and have bought pretty much every brand out there -</li>
            <li>When you first remove the product from its case, simply unscrew the cap from the top of the tube, place the mascara brush into the tube, and begin to use your new mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally worth trying if you are looking for a new mascara.</li>
            <li>The regular (not waterproof version) stays put and does not give you raccoon eyes by the end of the day and is easily removed.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself combes nicely leaving my eyelashes spread out without so much black ink on them.</li>
            <li>I found it to be on the dry side, and took too many coats to make the difference that I look for when wearing mascara.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake, and has nice full, thick coverage, which is what I look for in a mascara.</li>
            <li>and I will certainly continue to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also looks natural which is great for everyday but not so great if you want a really dramatic look.</li>
            <li>My sister gave me Lash Blast mascara (in the purple tube) and it surely makes my lashes look very defined, long, and plump!</li>
            <li>Yields a midnight black long beautiful lash.</li>
            <li>definitely makes my lashes look longer and fuller; lasts all day, but washes off easily when I&#x27;m ready for it to.</li>
            <li>Some people might not like the size of the wand because it is large, but I got used to it really fast, and grew to really like it.  </li>
            <li>It really helps separate and define your lashes without clumping.</li>
            <li>I really like this CoverGirl LashBlastFusion mascara.</li>
            <li>However, I was dissapointed that it didn&#x27;t &#x27;pump&#x27; my lashes out as much as I wanted them to.</li>
            <li>This mascara didn&#x27;t make my lashes much longer, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Lash Blast Fusion in Very Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>I like this version (in the purple tube) a little better than the original LashBlast (in the orange tube).&lt;br /&gt;LashBlasFusion wand/brush seems to have a little more bristles on the brush than the orange tube variety.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this mascara, but it was just too anemic looking.</li>
            <li>and it applies without much clumping.</li>
            <li>I tried the color \\&quot;very black\\</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not that much of a problem.</li>
            <li>Before I go into too much detail</li>
            <li>Even with more than 2 coats, my eyelashes don&#x27;t look gloppy and gross, they look like natural eyelashes just with a curl to it, as mine are stick straight.</li>
            <li>The problem is that the mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on very well, and I have problems with it flaking off throughout the day.</li>
            <li>However, on most days there was minimal flaking.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look soo much longer and thicker..</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>you have straight lashes that you need to curl, don&#x27;t bother with this.</li>
            <li>There were ZERO clumps and there was a very noticeable improvement in my lashes.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF REALLY</li>
            <li>if it does I have my answer about how really trustworthy the reviews are here and will go shop somewhere else.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of this mascara.</li>
            <li>I use one coat and it really covers every lash and doesn&#x27;t clump or look caked on.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really lengthen them though.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about my mascara.</li>
            <li>As for really noticing any lengthing or thickening, though, I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not feel that this really lived up to its promises (my opinion).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the applicator</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t clump much, didn&#x27;t smudge, but didn&#x27;t provide much lengthening definition.</li>
            <li>So when I saw it at much cheaper price..</li>
            <li>I chose the \\&quot;very black\\&quot; color</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very flattering</li>
            <li>so this to me is a real bonus.</li>
            <li>There was no clumping, and it really added thickness and length to my lashes.</li>
            <li>I prefer a lengthening mascara though, and this doesn&#x27;t do much in that department.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look so much fuller and longer.</li>
            <li>This is even better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered the secret to really great lashes:</li>
            <li>Seperates lashes very well.</li>
            <li>i really like this mascara</li>
            <li>I do not like it that much.  </li>
            <li>Wish the double packs were available here on Amazon</li>
            <li>Cover Girl really holds to its advertising.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed if it does much for volumizing</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara-third time buying it</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real</li>
            <li>does seem to give a bit more volume but not much plus as a Makeup artist student</li>
            <li>After using it for a few weeks I really liked it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me, but I thought it was pretty average and good enough if you don&#x27;t want tons of volume and length.</li>
            <li>I tried this only because I read such rave reviews and because my sister also said she liked it.  </li>
            <li>The color is rich and black - very black is a great descriptor because that is what I like</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this mascara, given my loyalty to the original orange LashBlast and CoverGirl products in general.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other people&#x27;s favorites, many drugstore and so-called premier brands that cost three times as much.</li>
            <li>The product states that both are provided but other mascaras that I use provide much more volume.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is better than any other mascara I have ever tried, all the others like to clump up and look like spider legs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Better than the other one which my wife already used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please Note: I am heavy handed with mascara and prefer the bold look vs a more natural look...</li>
            <li>But when I want a more toned down look on my eyelashes that works really well, this it the one.</li>
            <li>It has a huge super-volumizing brush and a new buildable fiber-stretch lengthening formula that work together to thicken and extend the look of individual lashes.    </li>
            <li>First, I love the &#x27;Very Black&#x27; color of it</li>
            <li>Nothing stood out to make it better than your average mascara.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why others liked it.</li>
            <li>I might be willing to retry it in the hopes that maybe it was just that one, but so far I am unimpressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not looking for a whole new set of lashes, but thicker and darker ones.</li>
            <li>I had doubts when I saw the unusual brush, but this is definitely my new mascara.</li>
            <li>I like it quite a bit, better than my previous mascara.  </li>
            <li>the color the mascara i bought was the darkest black they offered, it takes so many layers for it to look like i even put any of it on.</li>
            <li>I prefer to spend less time on mascara than putting three or more coats on in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is definitely grab, apply quick, and go.</li>
            <li>Also after several uses the tube top left globs of mascara on the wand</li>
            <li>I would love this mascara if only the applicator was a tad bit smaller.</li>
            <li>I use 2 coats, mainly out of habit.  </li>
            <li>but it worked well as a second application over my current favorite mascara.      </li>
            <li>It actually made it easier because it&#x27;s so big and has so many bristles (I guess that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called?)</li>
            <li>Brings volume to my lashes like never before, will totally be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>I would not buy  this particular Cover-girl mascara again.</li>
            <li>The main thing I like about it is that is doesn&#x27;t give me spider eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Again, though, with mascara in particular - your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent drug store brand mascara that I use in between buying my favorite more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>As the aging process is setting in more and more I find that this product still makes my lashes look thick and long.  </li>
            <li>although mostly high end brands.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this mascara only had mild, mild clumping that was easily brushed out, and none of the other pitfalls.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a little more.</li>
            <li>The black color is great and the mascara does add length and (less so, but still does) volume.  </li>
            <li>I got used to that big bad brush eventually and can honestly say that it is a good mascara.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I get an almost natural look without so much clumping.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and really like it</li>
            <li>but I decided to give drugstore a try, and I was honestly surprised that I like this one as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I have long, full lashes</li>
            <li>(forgot the exact brand), bare minerals, toofaced mascara, etc).</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just because you can see each lash, but they seem to have a long and full appearance.</li>
            <li>for the thickness, it did make my lashes about twice their normal size.</li>
            <li>I have naturally long, full eyelashes</li>
            <li>It is not waterproof which is what I normally favor</li>
            <li>My lashes look nice and thick.</li>
            <li>And...I love the idea of getting volume and length in a single mascara (which many claim to do but few actually can).    </li>
            <li>It came off easily with my regular facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Asian with longer eyelashes than most other Asians but this mascara did absolutely nothing for me.     </li>
            <li>they look so full and long!</li>
            <li>The LashBlast Fusion mascara is perfect for casual daytime makeup and also for a more dramatic evening look.  </li>
            <li>Normally my eyes are very sensitive to mascara, but this formula never irritates at all.</li>
            <li>Very Black 860, 1 Tube]] is drier than most new tubes of mascara I purchase.</li>
            <li>It feels like \\&quot;new advanced\\&quot; technology.</li>
            <li>([...]) that sends me new products to test out in return for my unbiased opinions.</li>
            <li>The new [[ASIN:B0039UTO5A</li>
            <li>I figured i would try a new type of mascara</li>
            <li>i got it it was brand new</li>
            <li>I live in an area where allergies abound and my eyes have a tendency to water.  </li>
            <li>I take issue with those that seem to dry out quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is great because my lashes are thin and short, this made a noticeable change!</li>
            <li>However the MAIN PROBLEM I have with this product is that the arms on the brush are just too soft to either grab my lashes or to remove clumps.</li>
            <li>is you like the very natural look.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using it again during the work day - certainly adds more pizzazz as we get to look a little more tired during the day.  </li>
            <li>But what really does it for me is the fact that it barely smudges.</li>
            <li>found that the tube was pretty big and semi unwieldly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5-stars is that it has a straight brush and a curved brush to curl would take it up to 5-stars!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively durable too, standing up to hot weather.</li>
            <li>CoverGirl LashBlast Fusion is the first mascara to actually give me VOLUME!!</li>
            <li>I would say it is the second best drugstore brand I have ever purchased, first being Max Factor Stretch &amp; Separate- which has been discontinued in the states :(  </li>
            <li>Not sure what I was expecting for most mascaras claim to add volume and length.</li>
            <li>Makes them look longer and 3 times fuller while still looking natural!</li>
            <li>Secondly I do not think it added any length, tho I do feel my lashes are fuller with this mascara then most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Check out a Target or drugstore near you!</li>
            <li>The staying power is pretty solid.</li>
            <li>I also felt it didn&#x27;t glide down my lashes smoothly, so some lashes would stick together.</li>
            <li>It takes a little more time, but combing the the lashes between coats and after the final coat will really make a huge difference in the final outcome and is well worth the small amount of effort.</li>
            <li>I do agree that the tube size is wide, but at least we get more of the product and our money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>only warning is that the commercials make the product sound like your eyelashes will look much more dramatic than they end up looking.  </li>
            <li>only warning is that the commercials make the product sound like your eyelashes will look much more dramatic than they end up looking.  </li>
            <li>This works well and even leaves enough money in your wallet to buy some eyeliner to complete the whole look!</li>
            <li>The mascara didn&#x27;t make your lashes clump or look messy, I actually think that the lengthening and voluminizing that the mascara did actually created a super dramatic and awesome look with your eyes.    </li>
            <li>Fusion mascara has several positive qualities.  </li>
            <li>but i guess gotta have its purpose, the thing is so much mascara accumulates at the end when you take the brush out you need to be careful not to create a mess, overall its fine good not great, gives you a simple, quick look rather than anything else.</li>
            <li>The second coat is what really makes the difference.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised with this LashBlastFusion Mascara.</li>
            <li>[so far], but the price difference puts in a lot of persuasion for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is very fat and doesn&#x27;t hold much actual mascara.</li>
            <li>I really like the product overall</li>
            <li>But anyways, it makes my lashes so long and gives them so much volume!</li>
            <li>I really hope this isn&#x27;t one of those products that is on the shelves for 6 months then mysteriously disappears.</li>
            <li>This made my lashes look longer and fuller without too much smear, but it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Guess I will stick to my old brand when this is used up.</li>
            <li>When the mascara dries, your eyelashes will still feel and look soft.  </li>
            <li>I like mascara to look natural but gives some volume and length.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t much clumsier with the bigger brush.</li>
            <li>However, I have sensitive eyes, and I found the smallest spec that comes off in my eye causes burning and irritation.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend for someone with sensitive eyes or an allergy sufferer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybelline has always been my favorite brand; I&#x27;ve actually never liked Cover Girl.  </li>
            <li>As far as adding length or volume, forget about it.  </li>
            <li>make up if you are trying to get the natural look.</li>
            <li>Since I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Lashes are full, dark, and no clumps or access product all over my eyes.</li>
            <li>It gives your lashes a full long look without looking clumpy and tacky like a teenage girl incapable of applying mascara.</li>
            <li>And, what I appreciate most is that at the end of a long workout, it doesn&#x27;t smear in my eyes or run down my face when I&#x27;m sweaty.</li>
            <li>The mascara has a light feel, not heavy or stiff on the lash.  </li>
            <li>Also, although I do not use the waterproof formulation (I find that this tends to dry out and pull out my lashes) it does stay on pretty well.</li>
            <li>I like a true black in color.  </li>
            <li>Not the most dramatic look from a mascara that i have gotten and does not lengthen my lashes as much as others i have tried.</li>
            <li>separating , volume , length , super black and looks so natural but build-able .</li>
            <li>This worked wonderfully to quickly and cleanly give me long and thick lashes.  </li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by this new mascara and would definitely purchase over my old standby.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally spend much money for it and at my local retail store I can find this brand for around eight dollars.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever tried to get long lashes but got frustrated by the clumps then this mascara is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this particular mascara several times now.  </li>
            <li>I have long eyelashes that tend to get clumpy with certain brands.</li>
            <li>brush also has tons of thin spiky &#x27;bristles&#x27;, spaced perfectly, allowing for great separation and coverage of each individual lash, and avoiding the *horribly tacky* look of clumped</li>
            <li>I was curious about the brush on this mascara - very different from any brush I had used before but it worked adequately.</li>
            <li>eyes are huge, so I have to do at least 4 swipes to get 2 coats across my eyelashes if I use the whole wand, but I only use about 3/4 of it</li>
            <li>I have naturally long lashes, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like it adds much length to them.</li>
            <li>It burns my eyes sometimes don&#x27;t know way I been using all brands of mascaras and never had this trouble before and my eye lashes don&#x27;t really look that long or full with it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it often, but it is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have naturally long eyelashes, but this mascara makes them SUPER LONG!</li>
            <li>I use an extremely moisturizing under eye cream that breaks down most mascaras.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry out fast</li>
            <li>I really like that it only takes one or two coats to make my lashes look fuller and more dramatic.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not high-drama, and I doubt anyone will think you&#x27;re wearing false eyelashes, but it&#x27;s great for everyday.</li>
            <li>Its very natural looking before multiple coats.</li>
            <li>Either way you aren&#x27;t going to get the dramatically dark and pretty look that you see in the commercials for this.</li>
            <li>I think it simply enhances what I like about my natural eyelashes</li>
            <li>but i have natural blonde hair</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s just pretty average.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer a cleaner, natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I personally prefer a cleaner, natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is way too big of a wand, my eyes are sensitive to the product as well.</li>
            <li>I love the long thick lashes it gives me.</li>
            <li>I prefer a little softer black or a dark brown for daytime, but this is a good color for evenings.</li>
            <li>they are priced low enough that I can use a new tube</li>
            <li>Just as good as expensive brand that I no longer need to buy!</li>
            <li>The big brush was a surprise and scary at first, but once I tried it realized it was easy to get close enough to the eye to evenly coat each lash.</li>
            <li>So for the price, I would definately recommend this mascara, just for the fact that it hardly smudges, which is a huge factor for me personally.</li>
            <li>While it says \\&quot;very black\\&quot; it isn&#x27;t so dark that it&#x27;s apparent you&#x27;re wearing</li>
            <li>The big fat brush doesn&#x27;t really help; in fact, it seems to make it harder to get into the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also found the mascara a little sticky..., thought this can happen with the first couple of applications</li>
            <li>first off the brush hurts my eye lids when i try to get the mascara to the roots of the eyelashes because it is plastic with plastic little \\&quot;spikes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>(My natural eyelashes are long, but blond at the tips making them appear shorter.)</li>
            <li>Lots of people complain about the size of the brush, but the thick wand and brush are sturdy and thus allow you to swipe the product on your lashes without the brush going all &#x27;floppy&#x27; on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinner wands and their thinner brushes tend to move around too much, so you don&#x27;t get a steady swoop.</li>
            <li>After you have applied it a lot, it is decent, but don&#x27;t expect extremely noticeable lashes.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m Asian, my eyelashes are short and barely visible but this mascara brings out my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It only took a few strokes and my lashes went from short and sweet to long, thick and hot!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the mess until I look in the mirror in the car.</li>
            <li>I do have naturally long lashes, but when I wear this mascara I am consistently asked if I am wearing false lashes (which to me is a positive).</li>
            <li>This new CoverGirl mascara is too dry to smear everywhere, but it&#x27;s also too dry to apply in a noticeable amount.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As for the mascara that the applicator and I applied, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> While the formula of this mascara is great, I&#x27;m no fan of the wand.  </li>
            <li> I think if you are happy with what you are using I wouldn&#x27;t switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>

            <li> All together it was very nice</li>
            <li> The color is also very nice.</li>
            <li> I am still debating which one I like more between this and Benifit&#x27;s, but either way, it&#x27;s one of the best mascara&#x27;s out their and a great buy.</li>
            <li> I could wave a magic (mascara) wand and have the perfect waterproof mascara, my wish would go like this:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a Great Lash girl but read some good reviews about this and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, it looks great when applied.</li>
            <li> It gave me nice volume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for a year now and still loving it!</li>
            <li> The LashBlast Fusion mascara is a wonderful makeup product that I would strongly recommend to anyone.an</li>
            <li> The LashBlast Fusion mascara is a wonderful makeup product that I would strongly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is really good.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to compare it to something that may be a superior product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share of mascara searching...</li>
            <li> I wasnt blown away by the volume, and I would have liked this in waterproof, but al in all, for the price it was great.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I will use up this tube...</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> does a good job of thickening and lengthening lashes.</li>
            <li> Over all this was good product.  </li>
            <li> The brush on this mascara is good for separating lashes and avoiding the clumping that occurs when you want to apply layers.</li>
            <li> and I got it for a good deal on here when purchased.</li>
            <li> I have been using this formula since it came out and for a good reason -</li>
            <li> This mascara provides good coverage and mimimal clumping.  </li>
            <li> It has good staying</li>
            <li> It almost is as good as  department store brand mascaras.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smoothly and coats my lashes perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the packaging (I dislike fat tubes), but this is good</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for a good quality mascara for a good price that doesnt clump your lashes together-</li>
            <li> the size fooled me it works really good not clumby</li>
            <li> Good quality for an item around $7.</li>
            <li> Good value</li>
            <li> but it works good and does what its supposed to do (:</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for years.  </li>
            <li> Good mascara for the price.  </li>
            <li> This, coupled with Maybelline Great Lash as a first coat, gives you the best lashes EVER!</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use and looks great on.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Goes on great and stays on. : )</li>
            <li> and she was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love the brush on the wand, and this mascara is really great for creating fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Covergirl and their products</li>
            <li> Works great, mostly.  </li>
            <li> What I love best about it is the fact it washes off so easy.</li>
            <li> Truly beautiful easy breezy cover girl.</li>
            <li> but if you prefer a natural look I would not be the best at judging if you&#x27;d be happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Perfecto, love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>

            <li> I was so excited for this product since it had so many wonderful reviews and provided both volume AND length.</li>
            <li> First time out of the tube, my lashes look perfect!  </li>
            <li> This stuff works magic!</li>

            <li> I love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I love LashBlastFusion!</li>
            <li> love all of the covergirl mascaras!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this mascara and would certainly recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> The silicone wand is amazing for separating lashes.</li>
            <li> It separates lashes nicely.    </li>
            <li> I tried this Mascara, LashBlast Fusion in the purple tub and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> and it separates the lashes nicely to give a fullness.</li>
            <li> The brush kind of clumps the mascara on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline Great Lash mascara for many, many years, and I&#x27;m going to stick with that.</li>
            <li> The applicator is nice and the mascara itself when on nicely.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is nice</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this mascara until something better comes along, as the price and quality are both good.</li>
            <li> what kind of mascara I use.</li>
            <li> It is just as great as the original, but with just a touch better lengthening skills!  </li>
            <li> but I really liked it.</li>
            <li> and it seems to do a nice job of distributing and separating the lashes.</li>
            <li> Better than Maybelline Great Lash, slightly better (on the no smudging part) than Loreal.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I liked this mascara.</li>
            <li> great product!, delivered fast.</li>
            <li> I simply love this mascara, easy to use and always reliable for beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li> this mascara I experienced no flaking, no smudges it goes on clean and stays where you put it.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and does better than the ones $20+ that I have tried!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as good as waterproof, but it&#x27;s better than most.</li>
            <li> One good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t smudge and it seems to come off easily when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> Pros were that it didn&#x27;t flake or clump, added a good amount of volume, and comes in a cute tube (purple is my favorite color).</li>
            <li> is very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> The handle is very easy to maneuver and there was no clumping on the brush.  </li>
            <li> They look longer, thicker, and more voluminous, which I love!</li>
            <li> Overall a great Product and easy to use and works Great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara, it works amazing..</li>
            <li> is a perfect mascara for someone looking to make their eyelashes look fuller and longer, but still natural looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super effective!</li>
            <li> I do believe this mascara is a great alternative to higher end mascara</li>
            <li> so my eyelashes are very light.</li>
            <li> The brush pulls out very smooth and didn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li> While this gives me more length, my eyelashes aren&#x27;t plentiful</li>
            <li> whether I want more volume or more length as to which mascara</li>
            <li> The brush has so many bristles that it really does a great job of separating the lashes and avoiding clumps.</li>
            <li> My 3 favorite mascaras:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mascara is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This formula thickens and lengthens more than most mascaras.</li>
            <li> A second coat makes it look just perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> This mascara does in one coat what many take 3 coats to do.    </li>
            <li> I was able to use it with my contacts in with no irritation to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I love cosmetics</li>
            <li> This mascara was just ok, all in all</li>
            <li> This worked okay for me and was one of the better brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> it just sweeps every hair on the eyelash and of no clumps or heavyness and it comes in diff shades too so a must buy ,,, love it</li>
            <li> I have tried &#x27;many&#x27; mascara&#x27;s that claim to build lashes without clumps, when I saw a review in Allure mag about the Cover Girl brand in the PURPLE TUBE..</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> This mascara was just ok for me.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t look much better.    </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara to give me more volume.</li>
            <li> What more to say?</li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now buying two more tubs</li>
            <li> things about this mascara, it works, and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I probably will not purchase again though, because I prefer something that is going to volumize better.</li>
            <li> To return the tube of mascara would end up costing me more money, so I will just cut my loss and move on.  </li>
            <li> now this is perfect for someone who likes to wear just a tiny bit of mascara</li>
            <li> if i was able to return it after trying it i would.</li>
            <li> I use my favorite comb-</li>
            <li> It would be in my top 5 choices.</li>
            <li> Most mascaras are this way.</li>
            <li> I went through dozens of mascaras and this is the most legit.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s better than clinique and lancome.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all - while I love</li>
            <li> The LashBlast in the orange tube worked better than this did.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite drug store mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup junkie, and I love this mascara...if this isn&#x27;t doing it for your lashes</li>

            <li> I love this mascara, it&#x27;s my go to product.</li>
            <li> Love it anyway.</li>
            <li> The product is just okay.</li>
            <li> I love cover girl mascara.</li>
            <li> Sometimes $20 or more for one tube.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> What more could you want.</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I purchased it after reading many reviews and watching the videos.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I did otherwise</li>
            <li> And I love it because of the brush.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Its not my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> There are so many choices with mascaras now that it all depends on what you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like DiorShow but is so much more affordable</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok by me.</li>
            <li> This product is one I&#x27;ve been buying for a while, i love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the overall look and feel.</li>
            <li> Its okay.</li>
            <li> Though I still love my [[ASIN:B004AZZ0QK</li>
            <li> This also seems to hold longer and is almost weightless even with three or more layers on.</li>
            <li> i would repurchase it for sure</li>
            <li> Stays on pretty good most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I spent many years and many dollars trying to find the best mascara out there.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to get good coverage on most of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to run or smear much at all and washes off nicely with warm water &amp; soap.</li>
            <li> Worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li> This is a very good overall mascara.</li>
            <li> I used the mascara for a couple of weeks before writing the review, so I could be sure to give an accurate overview of it.</li>
            <li> and it goes on amazingly get this stuff worth it</li>
            <li> This did give volume, it went on smooth and without too many clumps and for me it stayed on all day.</li>
            <li> The brush is really good, and the formula really doesn&#x27;t flake or clump at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s right!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> I love the original lash blast, it&#x27;s my go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> i got to try it as a sample many good things being a Buzzagent .. get free stuff to try as soon as new products hit the market ..</li>
            <li> I like an easy wand for easy application.  </li>
            <li> I have found that it washes off easily with just a washrag and water.  </li>
            <li> and this comes off easily.</li>
            <li> I bought the \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot; one, but it rubs off so easily it&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not have flaking and the mascara washes of easily.  </li>
            <li> Stays put but is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to take off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> LashBlast stays on my lashes all day without smearing and comes off easily  without abuse to your eyes.</li>
            <li> The LashBlast Fusion mascara is inexpensive and easily found in stores or online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mascara is not waterproof, so it comes off eyelashes easily with eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> Although it is easily removed, it stays on lashes well throughout the day without flaking or smudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply</li>
            <li> It does not clump,  provides length,  and is easily removed.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to apply and it stays put all day.</li>
            <li> It lengthens and is build-able, doesn&#x27;t clump, easily washable and separates lashes well.</li>
            <li> Never clumpy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Comes of easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I really liked the (Orange) Covergirl lashblast, so when I saw this at Costco in a 5 pack and saw the pretty purple body I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love mascara, but refuse to spend $20 or more on &#x27;good&#x27; mascara, especially since they expire supposedly within 3 months of opening.</li>
            <li> It is many times better than the first 2 Covergirl mascaras I tried.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li> of all, it comes OFF smooth and easy without greasy makeup</li>
            <li> When I first tried this mascara I was impressed by the fuller bristles and larger applicator brush.  </li>
            <li> like to try new things but will not stray from this mascara again!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a mascara that makes your eyes look huge, doesn&#x27;t clump, comes off easily, and is cheap...</li>
            <li> I deducted a star for price; I&#x27;d like to see it a little cheaper but aside from that, the product itself is wonderful.</li>
            <li> My friends noticed my lashes were longer &amp; thicker on the first day I wore this! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I have a huge \\&quot;smudge\\&quot; problem (perhaps its my eye cream I use).  </li>
            <li> Only downside for me is the huge clunky container, but its nothing compared to having great lashes.  </li>
            <li> I was given a free sample of Covergirl&#x27;s Lash Blast Fusion Mascara for being a Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I received a free sample of CoverGirl&#x27;s LashBlast Fusion in order to try it out.  </li>
            <li> but i would just like to get my item at once hassle free from now on.</li>
            <li> i found this one too light for my taste...</li>
            <li> The mascara corrected the issue of the light color, but it started to flake at the ends about 3 hours into wearing.</li>
            <li> It extended and filled in my lashes without clumps.</li>
            <li> The pictures are available under the picture of the product as additional views.</li>
            <li> Therefore, when you go to apply the mascara onto your lashes, it will go on smoothly onto your lashes without clumping.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it look great</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth with no clumping.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product as a BuzzAgent</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on smoothly without any clumping.  </li>
            <li> It really does make my lashes look fuller because it coats them so nice and evenly.  </li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free from a promotional campaign.</li>
            <li> I had to add some water to make it smooth again.  </li>
            <li> I saw this mascara offered at a fantastic price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It seems to just add color to my lashes since they are light.  </li>
            <li> lately!&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent this product for free to review for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re real but don&#x27;t want to justify spending that kind of craziness on mascara all the time</li>
            <li> This formula is light but provides coverage that look dense.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this except that is a good mascara, works well, and is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy and quick to apply.</li>
            <li> found it went on pretty smoothly although you had to watch out to make sure it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Pretty good if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive alternative to the high end!</li>
            <li> formula is long-lasting for a non-waterproof, and does not wear off throughout the day, yet can be removed very easily when you&#x27;re ready.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my freinds and aunts, who love them very much.</li>
            <li> I finally found CoverGirl Lash Blast and was super happy with it and used it for 1-2 years.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it was a nice staple to add to your kaboodle! :)</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY mascaras since I first began wearing make up; always with a goal to get thicker, longer lashes (without having to go with falsies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> If your looking for a mascara that really extends the eyelashes out then your better off trying another kind of mascara, personally Lancome Hynose Drama does the job pretty good</li>
            <li> With the results I got with this particular mascara, I can see it easily becoming my favorite go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara easily lasted over 11 hours and still looked fresh.</li>
            <li> mascara brush comes out of the tube cleanly and without clumps and bumps.  </li>
            <li> It darkens, separates, and thickens enough that it looks like my own lashes, but better.</li>
            <li> but nothing special.</li>
            <li> This is amazing when you first use it but after a while it dries out really fast so just put a drop or two in there and mix it around.</li>
            <li> They even give my lashes a nice natural curl.</li>
            <li> I just tried CoverGirl&#x27;s newest mascara called LashBlast Fusion and my overall reaction is that it is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told before that I look better without lots of makeup, and working in construction there isn&#x27;t much use for it.  </li>
            <li> I received a full size tube of LashBlastFusion from Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li> you did have to make sure not to get too much mascara on the wand</li>
            <li> i have ok type of eyelashes and this one worked real well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge and it adds both volume and length in a full and well defined lash.  </li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of failures.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> This mascara is true to the cover girl brand.</li>
            <li> keeps the mascara fresh and bacteria free.  </li>
            <li> It makes all your individual lashes thicker and separates them to look good.</li>
            <li> In any case, I have a drawer full of high-end mascara samples</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything that special about it other than it was a GREAT value.</li>
            <li> At best this product adds a little color to your lashes, but it certainly does not add the volume it claims to.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub off easily and it is pretty flexible.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice sized tube that is very easy to grip and hold onto, and I much prefer the bulk of it to the smaller wands.</li>
            <li> I love Cover Girl mascara, so I was excited to try out this new version.  </li>
            <li> My Girls love their new CoverGirl Mascara and they are the experts, Trust me!  </li>
            <li> but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> and I think this tube is pretty cute and pretty large and easy to hold onto.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it went on pretty smoothly</li>
            <li> Even though the mascara (formula) is SUPERB for volumizing/lengthening, the brush is not good for skimpy lashes.  </li>
            <li> I currently use LashBlast Fusion mascara by CoverGirl, and I am very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> It did not affect my use of contact lenses, and caused no unpleasant reactions with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I will try a new brand of mascara (still haven&#x27;t found one I absolutely love even after trying lash stiletto</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, and you really feel it do its thing as you apply it.</li>
            <li> Finally, on last go-over with the eyelash comb and perfect looking, long lashes are there in all their glory.</li>
            <li> Cover Girl Lash Blast Fusion is a mascara that doesn&#x27;t easily clump and is VERY waterproof.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this mascara is pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s their first ever volume + length mascara, and trust me it works!</li>
            <li> but now that I have I will buy in the future for sure!</li>
            <li> The first time i actually used this product it was gifted to me by my sis and since that day I fell in love</li>
            <li> However, I plan on using this mascara for everyday wear, I do think it&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
            <li> Leaves me with great lashes, opening up my eyes a little bit as well.</li>
            <li> The brush is able to get all of your lashes, top and bottom and the formula stays on for a very very long time (if you wanted you could sleep in it!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the LashBlast Volume because it keeps my naturally straight eyelashes curled, so I decided to try out this mascara that promises volume &amp; length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a mascara yet that does, because of how thin the ends of my lashes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because the color is great, and the volume is great, but the flakiness was a big issue for me.</li>
            <li> Great everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> Then I will apply the mascara, and the brush my eyelashes again to keep them nicely seperated, then apply a second coat of mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect product for my thin lashes.</li>
            <li> It stays in place and is also useful as a touch up filler.</li>
            <li> For a more natural look, just apply one coat onto your lashes.  </li>
            <li> It is rarely on sale in stores.  </li>
            <li> Without mascara, my lashes are kind of regular, probably on the skimpy side, but these make me look like I have falsies on.  </li>
            <li> It holds curl, does not smudge, you are getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> The regular Lash Blast (orange bottle) is far more effective.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is amazing and love it in both the Very Black and Brown</li>
            <li> and they are becoming my new favorites.</li>
            <li> More than many other cosmetic products</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast too!</li>
            <li> It dries quickly though and holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and does seem to produce nice black lashes, but it seems to separate the lashes, too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump as much as the original.</li>
            <li> Once I put it on, my lashes straighten out right away.</li>
            <li> Amazon.com has a $3 coupon right now, so why not try it?</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure of the wand--as my friend said, it kind of looks like a porcupine!  </li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for the past two weeks and have been incredibly happy.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample, and even though I normally don&#x27;t like mascara, I decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> This mascara alone does a pretty good job, but using other masacaras combined can give me the look I want</li>
            <li> I have honestly been looking a very long time for a mascara like this.  </li>
            <li> Give me the consistency of regular (non-waterproof) Maybelline Great Lash with the staying power of Blinc tubes and the skinny brush of Shiseido Lasting Lift Mascara.  </li>
            <li> I noticed right away the difference it made, my lashes appeared longer and more obvious.  </li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable so that will add to the value.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply very much at all.</li>
            <li> it makes my eyelashes look longer and thicker and doesn&#x27;t flake off through the day all at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> me first disclose that I received this particular tube of mascara as a full sized sample because I am a member of a website called Bzzagent</li>
            <li> the secret is the brush very good quality</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> The way I apply this product is to first use an eyelash comb to seperate my eyeslashes (curling them first if so inclined).</li>
            <li> Overall LashBlastFusion is an OK mascara, but not one that I would specifically recommend or buy after trying it now.</li>
            <li> This mascara, while not 100% smudge-proof, is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I&#x27;ve really gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> If you say no and mine aren&#x27;t either, why are the applicators for most mascara&#x27;s, including this one, getting bigger?</li>
            <li> [I actually bent my brush to help curl my eyelashes without a curler, and it works better than buying a brush already bent.</li>
            <li> I love the way the mascara goes on initially.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different brands of mascara.</li>
            <li> First of all, the brush is too fat</li>
            <li> It really makes my eyes pop!</li>
            <li> I first thought that the many short bristles would actually create more clumps on my lashes when I received the sample but the first time I used this I found out that is not at all the case.</li>
            <li> it is pretty</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve learned of higher quality mascaras.</li>
            <li> , you can get great coverage of each lash without it looking too thick or gaudy.</li>
            <li> When I showed my dad, he thought my eyelashes were real!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any clumps when I use it and it separates my lashes pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have simply never found anything better.</li>
            <li> I used to use Chanel and found this is better at elongating and thickening the lashes for a quarter to a third of the price.</li>
            <li> First off I found the mascara too be clumpy.</li>
            <li> but I always recommend curling lashes first, regardless of the brand, as it adds that additional punch.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara for my short lashes...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not...</li>
            <li> Absolutely waterproof!</li>
            <li> Clings to my lashes so well and really lengthens them!</li>
            <li> Still not comparable to some of my favorites such as Lancome and Shiseido brand (those brands are 4 times more also).</li>
            <li> It holds curl pretty well.</li>
            <li> Thanks CoverGirl for another dependable mascara!</li>
            <li> ;) )</li>
            <li> This is a personal favorite \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; mascara of mine, because it both thickens and lengthens lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes your lashes look pretty without all of the \\&quot;dramatics\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Real! Mascara]](See Review)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li> It is a good mascara for everyday wear</li>
            <li> I think it is a good mascara for everyday wear......</li>
            <li> CoverGirl&#x27;s new mascara that gives a blast of volume and incredible length for dramatic lashes with full length volume.</li>
            <li> When this Fusion came out I bought some and am pleasantly surprised by the length, but I feel as if they sacrificed the volume that the original had.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to buy a new mascara and thought it would be super convenient with Amazon Prime to buy one.</li>
            <li> You can actually feel an almost stretchy feel to it as it grabs the first coat, and stretches on a second coat, giving a really full, long lash effect that is just beautiful.</li>
            <li> She likes it, Not that much pricy especially compare with some famous brands</li>
            <li> Really would prefer a more simpler tube and a smaller brush.</li>
            <li> Some of its positive qualities are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a mascara fiend and have bought pretty much every brand out there -</li>
            <li> When you first remove the product from its case, simply unscrew the cap from the top of the tube, place the mascara brush into the tube, and begin to use your new mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally worth trying if you are looking for a new mascara.</li>
            <li> The regular (not waterproof version) stays put and does not give you raccoon eyes by the end of the day and is easily removed.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself combes nicely leaving my eyelashes spread out without so much black ink on them.</li>
            <li> I found it to be on the dry side, and took too many coats to make the difference that I look for when wearing mascara.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake, and has nice full, thick coverage, which is what I look for in a mascara.</li>
            <li> and I will certainly continue to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also looks natural which is great for everyday but not so great if you want a really dramatic look.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me Lash Blast mascara (in the purple tube) and it surely makes my lashes look very defined, long, and plump!</li>
            <li> Yields a midnight black long beautiful lash.</li>
            <li> definitely makes my lashes look longer and fuller; lasts all day, but washes off easily when I&#x27;m ready for it to.</li>
            <li> Some people might not like the size of the wand because it is large, but I got used to it really fast, and grew to really like it.  </li>
            <li> It really helps separate and define your lashes without clumping.</li>
            <li> I really like this CoverGirl LashBlastFusion mascara.</li>
            <li> However, I was dissapointed that it didn&#x27;t &#x27;pump&#x27; my lashes out as much as I wanted them to.</li>
            <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t make my lashes much longer, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Lash Blast Fusion in Very Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> I like this version (in the purple tube) a little better than the original LashBlast (in the orange tube).&lt;br /&gt;LashBlasFusion wand/brush seems to have a little more bristles on the brush than the orange tube variety.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mascara, but it was just too anemic looking.</li>
            <li> and it applies without much clumping.</li>
            <li> I tried the color \\&quot;very black\\</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Before I go into too much detail</li>
            <li> Even with more than 2 coats, my eyelashes don&#x27;t look gloppy and gross, they look like natural eyelashes just with a curl to it, as mine are stick straight.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on very well, and I have problems with it flaking off throughout the day.</li>
            <li> However, on most days there was minimal flaking.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look soo much longer and thicker..</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> you have straight lashes that you need to curl, don&#x27;t bother with this.</li>
            <li> There were ZERO clumps and there was a very noticeable improvement in my lashes.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF REALLY</li>
            <li> if it does I have my answer about how really trustworthy the reviews are here and will go shop somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of this mascara.</li>
            <li> I use one coat and it really covers every lash and doesn&#x27;t clump or look caked on.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really lengthen them though.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I am very picky about my mascara.</li>
            <li> As for really noticing any lengthing or thickening, though, I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not feel that this really lived up to its promises (my opinion).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the applicator</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clump much, didn&#x27;t smudge, but didn&#x27;t provide much lengthening definition.</li>
            <li> So when I saw it at much cheaper price..</li>
            <li> I chose the \\&quot;very black\\&quot; color</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very flattering</li>
            <li> so this to me is a real bonus.</li>
            <li> There was no clumping, and it really added thickness and length to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I prefer a lengthening mascara though, and this doesn&#x27;t do much in that department.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look so much fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> This is even better than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered the secret to really great lashes:</li>
            <li> Seperates lashes very well.</li>
            <li> i really like this mascara</li>
            <li> I do not like it that much.  </li>
            <li> Wish the double packs were available here on Amazon</li>
            <li> Cover Girl really holds to its advertising.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed if it does much for volumizing</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara-third time buying it</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real</li>
            <li> does seem to give a bit more volume but not much plus as a Makeup artist student</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks I really liked it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me, but I thought it was pretty average and good enough if you don&#x27;t want tons of volume and length.</li>
            <li> I tried this only because I read such rave reviews and because my sister also said she liked it.  </li>
            <li> The color is rich and black - very black is a great descriptor because that is what I like</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara, given my loyalty to the original orange LashBlast and CoverGirl products in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other people&#x27;s favorites, many drugstore and so-called premier brands that cost three times as much.</li>
            <li> The product states that both are provided but other mascaras that I use provide much more volume.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is better than any other mascara I have ever tried, all the others like to clump up and look like spider legs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Better than the other one which my wife already used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please Note: I am heavy handed with mascara and prefer the bold look vs a more natural look...</li>
            <li> But when I want a more toned down look on my eyelashes that works really well, this it the one.</li>
            <li> It has a huge super-volumizing brush and a new buildable fiber-stretch lengthening formula that work together to thicken and extend the look of individual lashes.    </li>
            <li> First, I love the &#x27;Very Black&#x27; color of it</li>
            <li> Nothing stood out to make it better than your average mascara.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why others liked it.</li>
            <li> I might be willing to retry it in the hopes that maybe it was just that one, but so far I am unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not looking for a whole new set of lashes, but thicker and darker ones.</li>
            <li> I had doubts when I saw the unusual brush, but this is definitely my new mascara.</li>
            <li> I like it quite a bit, better than my previous mascara.  </li>
            <li> the color the mascara i bought was the darkest black they offered, it takes so many layers for it to look like i even put any of it on.</li>
            <li> I prefer to spend less time on mascara than putting three or more coats on in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is definitely grab, apply quick, and go.</li>
            <li> Also after several uses the tube top left globs of mascara on the wand</li>
            <li> I would love this mascara if only the applicator was a tad bit smaller.</li>
            <li> I use 2 coats, mainly out of habit.  </li>
            <li> but it worked well as a second application over my current favorite mascara.      </li>
            <li> It actually made it easier because it&#x27;s so big and has so many bristles (I guess that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called?)</li>
            <li> Brings volume to my lashes like never before, will totally be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> I would not buy  this particular Cover-girl mascara again.</li>
            <li> The main thing I like about it is that is doesn&#x27;t give me spider eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Again, though, with mascara in particular - your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent drug store brand mascara that I use in between buying my favorite more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> As the aging process is setting in more and more I find that this product still makes my lashes look thick and long.  </li>
            <li> although mostly high end brands.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, this mascara only had mild, mild clumping that was easily brushed out, and none of the other pitfalls.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little more.</li>
            <li> The black color is great and the mascara does add length and (less so, but still does) volume.  </li>
            <li> I got used to that big bad brush eventually and can honestly say that it is a good mascara.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I get an almost natural look without so much clumping.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and really like it</li>
            <li> but I decided to give drugstore a try, and I was honestly surprised that I like this one as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I have long, full lashes</li>
            <li> (forgot the exact brand), bare minerals, toofaced mascara, etc).</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just because you can see each lash, but they seem to have a long and full appearance.</li>
            <li> for the thickness, it did make my lashes about twice their normal size.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long, full eyelashes</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof which is what I normally favor</li>
            <li> My lashes look nice and thick.</li>
            <li> And...I love the idea of getting volume and length in a single mascara (which many claim to do but few actually can).    </li>
            <li> It came off easily with my regular facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian with longer eyelashes than most other Asians but this mascara did absolutely nothing for me.     </li>
            <li> they look so full and long!</li>
            <li> The LashBlast Fusion mascara is perfect for casual daytime makeup and also for a more dramatic evening look.  </li>
            <li> Normally my eyes are very sensitive to mascara, but this formula never irritates at all.</li>
            <li> Very Black 860, 1 Tube]] is drier than most new tubes of mascara I purchase.</li>
            <li> It feels like \\&quot;new advanced\\&quot; technology.</li>
            <li> ([...]) that sends me new products to test out in return for my unbiased opinions.</li>
            <li> The new [[ASIN:B0039UTO5A</li>
            <li> I figured i would try a new type of mascara</li>
            <li> i got it it was brand new</li>
            <li> I live in an area where allergies abound and my eyes have a tendency to water.  </li>
            <li> I take issue with those that seem to dry out quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is great because my lashes are thin and short, this made a noticeable change!</li>
            <li> However the MAIN PROBLEM I have with this product is that the arms on the brush are just too soft to either grab my lashes or to remove clumps.</li>
            <li> is you like the very natural look.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using it again during the work day - certainly adds more pizzazz as we get to look a little more tired during the day.  </li>
            <li> But what really does it for me is the fact that it barely smudges.</li>
            <li> found that the tube was pretty big and semi unwieldly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5-stars is that it has a straight brush and a curved brush to curl would take it up to 5-stars!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively durable too, standing up to hot weather.</li>
            <li> CoverGirl LashBlast Fusion is the first mascara to actually give me VOLUME!!</li>
            <li> I would say it is the second best drugstore brand I have ever purchased, first being Max Factor Stretch &amp; Separate- which has been discontinued in the states :(  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I was expecting for most mascaras claim to add volume and length.</li>
            <li> Makes them look longer and 3 times fuller while still looking natural!</li>
            <li> Secondly I do not think it added any length, tho I do feel my lashes are fuller with this mascara then most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Check out a Target or drugstore near you!</li>
            <li> The staying power is pretty solid.</li>
            <li> I also felt it didn&#x27;t glide down my lashes smoothly, so some lashes would stick together.</li>
            <li> It takes a little more time, but combing the the lashes between coats and after the final coat will really make a huge difference in the final outcome and is well worth the small amount of effort.</li>
            <li> I do agree that the tube size is wide, but at least we get more of the product and our money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> only warning is that the commercials make the product sound like your eyelashes will look much more dramatic than they end up looking.  </li>
            <li> only warning is that the commercials make the product sound like your eyelashes will look much more dramatic than they end up looking.  </li>
            <li> This works well and even leaves enough money in your wallet to buy some eyeliner to complete the whole look!</li>
            <li> The mascara didn&#x27;t make your lashes clump or look messy, I actually think that the lengthening and voluminizing that the mascara did actually created a super dramatic and awesome look with your eyes.    </li>
            <li> Fusion mascara has several positive qualities.  </li>
            <li> but i guess gotta have its purpose, the thing is so much mascara accumulates at the end when you take the brush out you need to be careful not to create a mess, overall its fine good not great, gives you a simple, quick look rather than anything else.</li>
            <li> The second coat is what really makes the difference.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised with this LashBlastFusion Mascara.</li>
            <li> [so far], but the price difference puts in a lot of persuasion for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is very fat and doesn&#x27;t hold much actual mascara.</li>
            <li> I really like the product overall</li>
            <li> But anyways, it makes my lashes so long and gives them so much volume!</li>
            <li> I really hope this isn&#x27;t one of those products that is on the shelves for 6 months then mysteriously disappears.</li>
            <li> This made my lashes look longer and fuller without too much smear, but it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Guess I will stick to my old brand when this is used up.</li>
            <li> When the mascara dries, your eyelashes will still feel and look soft.  </li>
            <li> I like mascara to look natural but gives some volume and length.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t much clumsier with the bigger brush.</li>
            <li> However, I have sensitive eyes, and I found the smallest spec that comes off in my eye causes burning and irritation.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend for someone with sensitive eyes or an allergy sufferer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybelline has always been my favorite brand; I&#x27;ve actually never liked Cover Girl.  </li>
            <li> As far as adding length or volume, forget about it.  </li>
            <li> make up if you are trying to get the natural look.</li>
            <li> Since I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Lashes are full, dark, and no clumps or access product all over my eyes.</li>
            <li> It gives your lashes a full long look without looking clumpy and tacky like a teenage girl incapable of applying mascara.</li>
            <li> And, what I appreciate most is that at the end of a long workout, it doesn&#x27;t smear in my eyes or run down my face when I&#x27;m sweaty.</li>
            <li> The mascara has a light feel, not heavy or stiff on the lash.  </li>
            <li> Also, although I do not use the waterproof formulation (I find that this tends to dry out and pull out my lashes) it does stay on pretty well.</li>
            <li> I like a true black in color.  </li>
            <li> Not the most dramatic look from a mascara that i have gotten and does not lengthen my lashes as much as others i have tried.</li>
            <li> separating , volume , length , super black and looks so natural but build-able .</li>
            <li> This worked wonderfully to quickly and cleanly give me long and thick lashes.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this new mascara and would definitely purchase over my old standby.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally spend much money for it and at my local retail store I can find this brand for around eight dollars.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever tried to get long lashes but got frustrated by the clumps then this mascara is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this particular mascara several times now.  </li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes that tend to get clumpy with certain brands.</li>
            <li> brush also has tons of thin spiky &#x27;bristles&#x27;, spaced perfectly, allowing for great separation and coverage of each individual lash, and avoiding the *horribly tacky* look of clumped</li>
            <li> I was curious about the brush on this mascara - very different from any brush I had used before but it worked adequately.</li>
            <li> eyes are huge, so I have to do at least 4 swipes to get 2 coats across my eyelashes if I use the whole wand, but I only use about 3/4 of it</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like it adds much length to them.</li>
            <li> It burns my eyes sometimes don&#x27;t know way I been using all brands of mascaras and never had this trouble before and my eye lashes don&#x27;t really look that long or full with it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often, but it is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long eyelashes, but this mascara makes them SUPER LONG!</li>
            <li> I use an extremely moisturizing under eye cream that breaks down most mascaras.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry out fast</li>
            <li> I really like that it only takes one or two coats to make my lashes look fuller and more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not high-drama, and I doubt anyone will think you&#x27;re wearing false eyelashes, but it&#x27;s great for everyday.</li>
            <li> Its very natural looking before multiple coats.</li>
            <li> Either way you aren&#x27;t going to get the dramatically dark and pretty look that you see in the commercials for this.</li>
            <li> I think it simply enhances what I like about my natural eyelashes</li>
            <li> but i have natural blonde hair</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s just pretty average.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer a cleaner, natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I personally prefer a cleaner, natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is way too big of a wand, my eyes are sensitive to the product as well.</li>
            <li> I love the long thick lashes it gives me.</li>
            <li> I prefer a little softer black or a dark brown for daytime, but this is a good color for evenings.</li>
            <li> they are priced low enough that I can use a new tube</li>
            <li> Just as good as expensive brand that I no longer need to buy!</li>
            <li> The big brush was a surprise and scary at first, but once I tried it realized it was easy to get close enough to the eye to evenly coat each lash.</li>
            <li> So for the price, I would definately recommend this mascara, just for the fact that it hardly smudges, which is a huge factor for me personally.</li>
            <li> While it says \\&quot;very black\\&quot; it isn&#x27;t so dark that it&#x27;s apparent you&#x27;re wearing</li>
            <li> The big fat brush doesn&#x27;t really help; in fact, it seems to make it harder to get into the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also found the mascara a little sticky..., thought this can happen with the first couple of applications</li>
            <li> first off the brush hurts my eye lids when i try to get the mascara to the roots of the eyelashes because it is plastic with plastic little \\&quot;spikes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> (My natural eyelashes are long, but blond at the tips making them appear shorter.)</li>
            <li> Lots of people complain about the size of the brush, but the thick wand and brush are sturdy and thus allow you to swipe the product on your lashes without the brush going all &#x27;floppy&#x27; on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinner wands and their thinner brushes tend to move around too much, so you don&#x27;t get a steady swoop.</li>
            <li> After you have applied it a lot, it is decent, but don&#x27;t expect extremely noticeable lashes.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m Asian, my eyelashes are short and barely visible but this mascara brings out my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It only took a few strokes and my lashes went from short and sweet to long, thick and hot!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the mess until I look in the mirror in the car.</li>
            <li> I do have naturally long lashes, but when I wear this mascara I am consistently asked if I am wearing false lashes (which to me is a positive).</li>
            <li> This new CoverGirl mascara is too dry to smear everywhere, but it&#x27;s also too dry to apply in a noticeable amount.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive, does not smudge or flake, comes off easily with makeup remover, does not clump, adds volume and length to each individual lash, and works well for a casual or more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li> It is inexpensive, does not smudge or flake, comes off easily with makeup remover, does not clump, adds volume and length to each individual lash, and works well for a casual or more dramatic look.  </li>
            <li> I did expect a intense look seeing as they advertised a false lash look appeal, but really thats not what was provided.</li>
            <li> FRESH Covergirl mascaras (in the big thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;The long black lashes really make my eyes pop and add a lot of beauty to my face.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how \\&quot;different\\&quot; this masacara is from any other that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but this mascara does lengthen them to the point where it does look like I have long lashes.......just not frighteningly long.  </li>
            <li> One coat is very natural looking (for me) and two (which is what I usually wear) is a bit more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> The effect on your eyelashes are so huge and dramatic...</li>
            <li> I have long, thin and light colored lashes.</li>
            <li> I usually use CoverGirl LashBlash Length or Maybelline brand, but this CoverGirl LashBlast Fusion is the only one that makes a really noticeable difference and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I have very short, thin lashes and only about 15% of mascaras I have tried are even adequate.  </li>
            <li> , it got deleted, I complained about it getting deleted as I dont think that is very ethical of Amazon</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands even high end department store mascaras and always come back to the same pink and green tube.  </li>
            <li> this mascara... has a flat end on the brush</li>
            <li> Thick enough but not messy with a natural look and feel to it.</li>
            <li> i will stick to getting it from local stores instead of online because what i received was a dried out clumpy mascara that feels old.</li>
            <li> what false eyelashes!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the waterproof version recently for a trip to Hawaii and works equally as well as the regular and really is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Might experiment with some other brands next time, but if those disapoint, this will definitley be what I come back to.</li>
            <li> Unlike other mascaras I have used, this mascara adds volume to each individual eyelash instead of clumping several lashes together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The formula was flakey and hard to build on and didn&#x27;t do much for my lashes.</li>
            <li> While my favorite brand was YSL, spending over $20 on mascara was crazy and my wallet was not liking it.</li>
            <li> and I always use a mascara to make my lashes which are naturally long and curly look plumper and longer.  </li>
            <li> Even with a few coats of the product, your makeup will look natural and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even with a few coats of the product, your makeup will look natural and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all summer long g.</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes look long</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time without flaking.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have long lashes</li>
            <li> it gives me long defined lashes.</li>
            <li> I like a natural look that enhances my eyes, but not a huge smuge of chunky lashes.</li>
            <li> and I was anxious to try this new mascara.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes a time or two with new mascara for me to get my lashes to look like this.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the Lash Blast Fusion to go on very chunky at all like other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one other mascara that tops this</li>
            <li> I have average lashes (not long, &amp; not stubby) and this volumizes, thickens and lengthens.</li>
            <li> This mascara is my second choice to Bobbi Brown lash glamour extreme.</li>
            <li> Did not feel like it has the same quality as other covergirl products.</li>
            <li> I have used much more expensive brands of mascara, but I won&#x27;t anymore!</li>
            <li> all that I can say is that it&#x27;s about the same as any other mascara that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Goes on very dark, a few coats will really lift and separate your eye lashes.</li>
            <li> --they are long and can be dramatic with the right tool.  </li>
            <li> The LashBlast Fusion mascara will not leave your eyelashes looking crunchy and dry like some of its competing brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have time to dry out and get flaky.</li>
            <li> and I believe it doesn&#x27;t dry out as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is only one of the few that actually lengthens and volumizes my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use that one everyday since its too much mascara for me to wear everyday.</li>
            <li> I have very thin lashes, and this product really helped to give me full, thick lashes - without clumping.</li>
            <li> Cover Girl&#x27;s mascara&#x27;s this one did not live up to the marketing.  </li>
            <li> This never feels heavy or stiff on my eyes, and sometimes with just one coat it doesn&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sensitive to make-up however, so I&#x27;m not sure this would be an issue with anyone else.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get it dark enough.</li>
            <li> I usual don&#x27;t use mascara because it doesn&#x27;t give me the affect that I want however I was surprised by LashBlastFusion.  </li>
            <li> Also, mascaras usually begin to clump after several uses, and this one clumps on the brush constantly and then leaves the clumps on your lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Depending on your expectations, you may be disappointed with that performance, but it&#x27;s enough for me most of the time</li>
            <li> Cons were that it takes several coats to get a lot of volume and decent length, it doesn&#x27;t increase length that much, the tube is a bit on the bulky side, and the wand is a little awkward to handle and apply.</li>
            <li> I am not a happy camper right now...money down the drain.  </li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad though. :)</li>
            <li> I should warn you; I&#x27;m not much of a makeup girl.  </li>
            <li> Not really into the Tammay Faye</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on mascara.  </li>
            <li> ...when they get wet, they just fall off under your eyes.</li>
            <li> Not much length at all</li>
            <li> so careful around rain or tears.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark lashes anyway, so it doesn&#x27;t take a miracle product to make them stand out -</li>
            <li> Each one was dried out or really too thick.</li>
            <li> I mean, I am asian and my eyelashes are quite short, but this mascara didn&#x27;t remedy the problem at all.</li>
            <li> However, I keep coming back to this CoverGirl LashFusion in Very Black.</li>
            <li> I usually have a few small clumps when I first apply, but not with this applicator.  </li>
            <li> My only frustration is that it goes on a little bit moist and sometimes ruins eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t seem extremely long, maybe just a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl LashBlast for the past several years but never felt like I was getting length too.  </li>
            <li> Factor 2000 Calorie Extreme Lash Plumper Mascara in Extreme Blackout&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel like it made my eye lashes darker or longer looking like other mascaras do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because the bottom is so small and the middle</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, even the pricey ones, and I always get panda eyes by the end of the day (you know that shadow you get).  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be wasting my money on any other mascara...</li>
            <li> I usually find that a need several coats to get the look I like.  </li>
            <li> look that a lot of other mascaras cause.     </li>
            <li> I would, after trying a couple of other brands</li>
            <li> Also, I did not find it made my eyelashes any longer or thicker than other mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, but I am not sure whether it is the brush or the actual mascara that makes the difference.</li>
            <li> It only takes one coat to cover them which is a change for me because I usually have to do two coats in order to get coverage.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was hoping for something different from my ordinary mascara brush.  </li>
            <li> This also does not have a pungent smell like some other mascaras I have tried.</li>
            <li> so wide - 9 times out of 10 when you put it down, it falls over.</li>
            <li> , so you have to be very careful that it doesn&#x27;t clump on your lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the actual mascara being sort of thin or the spiky wand not depositing enough on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I received the replacement and had the same issues, clumpy old mascara that gives you the two eyelashes look and looks and feels wrong.</li>
            <li> However, I only use this as a base and use about 2 or 3 other mascaras to give my eyelashes the full volumized effect.</li>
            <li> What I needed was a mascara that would color my lashes, root to tip, without flaking off and leaving dark smudges underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> it was an average mascara based on the pros and cons below.  </li>
            <li> I have never liked Cover Girl products, so I don&#x27;t know why I thought this mascara would be any different.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be an average mascara</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I will have a small speck on my cheek that has flaked off of my lashes, but I do tend to put quite a few coats on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump but isnt that dark</li>
            <li> Also because the cap is unevenly shaped, as I was holding it to apply the mascara, I had difficulty with it slipping out of my hand.</li>
            <li> am a faithful Maybelline pink and green tube user.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I have to admit I hate the packaging.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heat causing a mascara to drip down my face.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I had was the brush is a little bulky, making it hard to apply to the smaller lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Once tried and I think, that I will not use any other mascara!</li>
            <li> Unlike other mascaras, you can apply a few coats to add volume, and your lashes will still not clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Faced Lash Injection in Pitch Black</li>
            <li> quickly so no worries about it messing up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This mascara stays on all day without leaving black marks under my eyes and gives me plenty of volume without flaking.  </li>
            <li> I have posted pictures of the brush versus a typical brush as well as how it looks on my eyes - showing one with and one without.  </li>
            <li> but they also have black, black brown, and brown.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself sometimes gives off a slight glue-like smell just as I am using it</li>
            <li> It does not causes black circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I do notice that at the end of the day, it does start to break off and leave black pieces on my face though.</li>
            <li> Since I am now a senior citizen, my mascara is usually a mess.</li>
            <li> My lashes look longer and fuller when I use this product, and I don&#x27;t end up with spiky eyelashes or dark circles after just a few hours.</li>
            <li> little black dots under my eyes</li>
            <li> This mascara was just like every other mascara I have used and on top of that it irritated my eyes very badly.</li>
            <li> I have three little boys</li>
            <li> so my opinion may be a little biased.</li>
            <li> A little watery for my liking but work with it</li>
            <li> The one part I did not like was that since the end is blunt there was no fine tip for me to use to get those little lashes on the end.  </li>
            <li> This mascara really emphasizes them without looking artificial.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any clumps or weird mascara running</li>
            <li> I like this product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> but now that I have used it a few times I do like it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this mascara, and after reading the 1-star reviews, all I can theorize is the poor women received a defective tube, or their individual chemical and lash</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara everyday, so when I do, I sometimes forget I have it on and will rub my eye.</li>
            <li> Mine was dried up as well.  </li>
            <li> you too may receive a tube of mascara that is \\&quot;All Dried Up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you, that after using these for a few weeks this is my holy grail when it comes to mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara comes in a small, dark purple tube, and it is packaged in a plastic and paper case.  </li>
            <li> To achieve this look, apply a few coats of mascara onto your lashes.  </li>
            <li> apply a few coats to add volume, and your lashes will still not clump.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I bought the waterproof and it was a waste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months and it does the job.</li>
            <li> The orange, green, and purple tube mascaras are great.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I have thin, wispy eyelashes that are lighter than my dark brown hair but unnaturally long.  </li>
            <li> My mom saw me last week after I applied Lash Blast, and she said, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot;, and thought I may be wearing false lashes.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look so long and thick!</li>
            <li> Bought this mascara in very black</li>
            <li> The very black color also makes them look longer.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the color in very black</li>
            <li> I had a coupon so decided to try this in the very black.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blessed with long lashes - but they aren&#x27;t very thick.</li>
            <li> Most of the mascaras I have are awful with smudging, and sometimes I forget I&#x27;m even wearing mascara and accidently rub at my eye and not realize my lower lids are all black...</li>
            <li> The Very Black is dark enough, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is very dramatic.</li>
            <li> Very little clumping</li>
            <li> This is very builable without getting ugly.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give long or big lashes and runs bad.</li>
            <li> The orange container of this brand is much better, I bought this one and absolutely hate it!</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five is that I&#x27;ve never tried the expensive mascaras</li>
            <li> It blows the lousy mascaras I&#x27;ve been buying in the past for around the same price out of the water.</li>
            <li> past experience</li>
            <li> has failed and only lengthened my lashes.</li>
            <li> Well, now I need search no more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any problems with it running under my eyes, which has been an issue for me with mascaras in the past.  </li>
            <li> Because that&#x27;s what usually happens to me.    </li>
            <li> it dosent gets messy!</li>
            <li> Seriously, stop messing around with pricy designer brands and bow down to lash blast fusion!</li>
            <li> but they are very pale.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is black, very thick, and it is not waterproof.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wand is so fat, it is hard to get mascara on the corner eyelashes without getting it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It looked like I hardly put any on</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slightly hard to get the ends of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> When I apply it in the morning, I hit the side of my nose on each side of my face at least once.  </li>
            <li> Some common pitfulls include clumping, smearing, and burning in the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clumsy with mascara as it is</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes thick without getting clumpy.</li>
            <li> I had read some poor reviews regarding this mascara being dried up when opened, but I hoped that was just a fluke.  </li>
            <li> Goes on too thick and makes your lashes stick together.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I was worried about the size of the tube making the brush difficult to handle, but I didn&#x27;t have an issue with it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy another one though!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have time to mess with makeup products that are to time consuming or difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to remove at night</li>
            <li> It took a little bit of time to get used to the weird brush</li>
            <li> It takes at least three coats to look like there&#x27;s anything on the lashes at all, and after all that, it&#x27;s still not great.</li>
            <li> They look thick, although I wouldn&#x27;t call them &#x27;dramatic&#x27; like the ad says.</li>
            <li> I would neither recommend this mascara nor steer people away from CoverGirl&#x27;s Lash Blast Fusion but do not buy this if you are planning for long, thick luxurious lashes as you will sadly be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I always hated the fact that a particular mascara either lengthened my lashes or they plumped my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something dramatic, but it looks very ordinary when applied.</li>
            <li> how sloppily I apply it.</li>
            <li> is as this one is terrible as far as over the counter mascaras go.</li>
            <li> hair make-up merely didn&#x27;t react well to the ingredients (or maybe some reviewers didn&#x27;t swipe excess mascara off the brush before application).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a mascara that works so well, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive \\&quot;designer\\&quot; mascaras to drugstore mascaras.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the lengthening nor thickening that it provided.  </li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t miss a lash and have to go back to it and then crap!</li>
            <li> (much to my poor husband&#x27;s dismay!)</li>
            <li> Sadly, they were not fulfilled.</li>
            <li> I found it to be too bulky, which made putting on my mascara difficult and awkward.  </li>
            <li> This one though was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have had people comment on how real my false eyelashes look.....</li>
            <li> People sometimes ask me if they are fake!</li>
            <li> However I am definitely disappointed in this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It flakes like mad!</li>
            <li> but I hate looking like a racoon.</li>
            <li> For that price, I wasn&#x27;t outraged at the flaking issue, but I won&#x27;t be buying the mascara again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I have the worst time finding a mascara that doesn&#x27;t leave smudge marks below my eyes, even with some waterproof tubes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this máscara for a while and i adore it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two years and have it set up on auto delivery. It really helps separate and define your lashes without clumping. It makes my lashes look so long and thick! It&#x27;s also easy and quick to apply. I have three little boys so I don&#x27;t have time to mess with makeup products that are to time consuming or difficult to use. This is definitely grab, apply quick, and go.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is amazing when you first use it but after a while it dries out really fast so just put a drop or two in there and mix it around.</li>
            <li> I really like this CoverGirl LashBlastFusion mascara. It comes in a nice sized tube that is very easy to grip and hold onto, and I much prefer the bulk of it to the smaller wands. The mascara itself is really good. It goes on easily, and you really feel it do its thing as you apply it. The way I apply this product is to first use an eyelash comb to seperate my eyeslashes (curling them first if so inclined). Then I will apply the mascara, and the brush my eyelashes again to keep them nicely seperated, then apply a second coat of mascara. The second coat is what really makes the difference. You can actually feel an almost stretchy feel to it as it grabs the first coat, and stretches on a second coat, giving a really full, long lash effect that is just beautiful. Finally, on last go-over with the eyelash comb and perfect looking, long lashes are there in all their glory. It takes a little more time, but combing the the lashes between coats and after the final coat will really make a huge difference in the final outcome and is well worth the small amount of effort. With the results I got with this particular mascara, I can see it easily becoming my favorite go-to mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used CoverGirl LashBlast for the past several years but never felt like I was getting length too.  When this Fusion came out I bought some and am pleasantly surprised by the length, but I feel as if they sacrificed the volume that the original had.  While this gives me more length, my eyelashes aren&#x27;t plentiful so I miss the volume that I used to have with LashBlast.  I&#x27;ve not made up my mind yet whether I want more volume or more length as to which mascara I buy next.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the brush on this mascara - very different from any brush I had used before but it worked adequately. However, I was dissapointed that it didn&#x27;t &#x27;pump&#x27; my lashes out as much as I wanted them to. I also found the mascara a little sticky..., thought this can happen with the first couple of applications so it may improve. The price isn&#x27;t bad though. :)</li>
            <li> I like a natural look that enhances my eyes, but not a huge smuge of chunky lashes. I was really surprised at how \\&quot;different\\&quot; this masacara is from any other that I&#x27;ve tried. I got a sample of the product as a Bzz agent. The brush has so many bristles that it really does a great job of separating the lashes and avoiding clumps. It feels like \\&quot;new advanced\\&quot; technology. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample of Covergirl&#x27;s Lash Blast Fusion Mascara for being a Bzz Agent. I used the mascara for a couple of weeks before writing the review, so I could be sure to give an accurate overview of it. After using it for a few weeks I really liked it. It made my lashes thick without getting clumpy. I also swam with it on and it didn&#x27;t smudge onto my face. I have short eyelashes and I am always trying to make my lashes longer. This mascara didn&#x27;t make my lashes much longer, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars. Other than that it was a nice staple to add to your kaboodle! :)</li>
            <li> The orange container of this brand is much better, I bought this one and absolutely hate it! It flakes like mad! If I forget and don&#x27;t wash it off at night I will wake up with just blood shot eye&#x27;s in the morning. It&#x27;s awful. I do not recommend it, obviously. Ick.</li>
            <li> My 3 favorite mascaras:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max Factor 2000 Calorie Extreme Lash Plumper Mascara in Extreme Blackout&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CoverGirl Lash Blast Fusion in Very Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too Faced Lash Injection in Pitch Black</li>
            <li> I really liked the (Orange) Covergirl lashblast, so when I saw this at Costco in a 5 pack and saw the pretty purple body I bought it. What a waste of money. Each one was dried out or really too thick. clumped on and each lasted only a couple of days before I tossed it out.</li>
            <li> This mascara is definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I have naturally long eyelashes, but this mascara makes them SUPER LONG! They even give my lashes a nice natural curl. Perfecto, love this product!</li>
            <li> I like this version (in the purple tube) a little better than the original LashBlast (in the orange tube).&lt;br /&gt;LashBlasFusion wand/brush seems to have a little more bristles on the brush than the orange tube variety. It doesn&#x27;t clump as much as the original. The Very Black is dark enough, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is very dramatic. I am a mascara fiend and have bought pretty much every brand out there - although mostly high end brands. Overall LashBlastFusion is an OK mascara, but not one that I would specifically recommend or buy after trying it now.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mascara, but it was just too anemic looking. I have long, full lashes but they are very pale. What I needed was a mascara that would color my lashes, root to tip, without flaking off and leaving dark smudges underneath my eyes. This mascara stayed in place, but left my lashes looking only so, so. I don&#x27;t know if it was the actual mascara being sort of thin or the spiky wand not depositing enough on my lashes. Either way you aren&#x27;t going to get the dramatically dark and pretty look that you see in the commercials for this.</li>
            <li> This formula thickens and lengthens more than most mascaras. It separates lashes nicely.    The wand is so fat, it is hard to get mascara on the corner eyelashes without getting it on your skin.  Also after several uses the tube top left globs of mascara on the wand and I have to remove some of the product before using.    I prefer a smaller brush that tappers at the end for easier application.  I would buy this mascara again if the tube and brush were improved.</li>
            <li> I love mascara, but refuse to spend $20 or more on &#x27;good&#x27; mascara, especially since they expire supposedly within 3 months of opening. I was very pleasantly surprised with this LashBlastFusion Mascara. First, I love the &#x27;Very Black&#x27; color of it and it applies without much clumping. But what really does it for me is the fact that it barely smudges. Most of the mascaras I have are awful with smudging, and sometimes I forget I&#x27;m even wearing mascara and accidently rub at my eye and not realize my lower lids are all black...This mascara, while not 100% smudge-proof, is pretty darn close. So for the price, I would definately recommend this mascara, just for the fact that it hardly smudges, which is a huge factor for me personally.</li>
            <li> I just tried CoverGirl&#x27;s newest mascara called LashBlast Fusion and my overall reaction is that it is good. It&#x27;s not the best mascara I have ever tried but it is one of CoverGirl&#x27;s best mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first disclose that I received this particular tube of mascara as a full sized sample because I am a member of a website called Bzzagent ([...]) that sends me new products to test out in return for my unbiased opinions. I tried the color \\&quot;very black\\&quot; it comes in a purple tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this mascara I experienced no flaking, no smudges it goes on clean and stays where you put it. A second coat makes it look just perfect. I got used to that big bad brush eventually and can honestly say that it is a good mascara. It&#x27;s not my favorite mascara but it will do. It is many times better than the first 2 Covergirl mascaras I tried. It&#x27;s a little difficult to remove at night but it&#x27;s not that much of a problem. It is a good mascara for everyday wear and I would definitely recommend Covergirl LashBlast Fusion.</li>
            <li> I have to say...I can be picky with mascara.  I don&#x27;t like clumping.  I don&#x27;t like heat causing a mascara to drip down my face.  I take issue with those that seem to dry out quickly.  I like an easy wand for easy application.  I like a true black in color.  And...I love the idea of getting volume and length in a single mascara (which many claim to do but few actually can).    I have used this mascara for the past two weeks and have been incredibly happy.  The wand is the best of all drugstore mascaras I have ever tried.  I have had no issues with clumping and the shape of of the wand is very easy to handle.  The black color is great and the mascara does add length and (less so, but still does) volume.  This mascara does in one coat what many take 3 coats to do.    I was very happy with this mascara and would certainly recommend it to others.  I deducted a star for price; I&#x27;d like to see it a little cheaper but aside from that, the product itself is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Before I go into too much detail I should warn you; I&#x27;m not much of a makeup girl.  I&#x27;ve been told before that I look better without lots of makeup, and working in construction there isn&#x27;t much use for it.  On the weekends I like to glam it up a bit and I always use a mascara to make my lashes which are naturally long and curly look plumper and longer.  This mascara has done the trick for me every time I use it.  I really like that it only takes one or two coats to make my lashes look fuller and more dramatic.  Since I don&#x27;t wear lots of makeup I don&#x27;t generally spend much money for it and at my local retail store I can find this brand for around eight dollars.  So far I haven&#x27;t had any clumps or weird mascara running and I feel like I&#x27;ve really gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about it giving me raccoon eyes halfway through my evening.  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five is that I&#x27;ve never tried the expensive mascaras and I don&#x27;t want to compare it to something that may be a superior product.  It blows the lousy mascaras I&#x27;ve been buying in the past for around the same price out of the water.</li>
            <li> If you say no and mine aren&#x27;t either, why are the applicators for most mascara&#x27;s, including this one, getting bigger? As for the mascara that the applicator and I applied, it&#x27;s great.  Stayed on well throughout the day, even took a nap, and there were no flakes or smudges.  I would love this mascara if only the applicator was a tad bit smaller. When I apply it in the morning, I hit the side of my nose on each side of my face at least once.  Every woman knows that mascara doesn&#x27;t just wipe off, it smears.</li>
            <li> The new [[ASIN:B0039UTO5A CoverGirl LashBlastFusion Mascara Very Black 860, 1 Tube]] is drier than most new tubes of mascara I purchase. As a result I don&#x27;t smear it all over my eyes. Since I am now a senior citizen, my mascara is usually a mess. I don&#x27;t really see the mess until I look in the mirror in the car. This new CoverGirl mascara is too dry to smear everywhere, but it&#x27;s also too dry to apply in a noticeable amount. I was expecting something dramatic, but it looks very ordinary when applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share of mascara searching... There&#x27;s only one other mascara that tops this [so far], but the price difference puts in a lot of persuasion for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes are huge, so I have to do at least 4 swipes to get 2 coats across my eyelashes if I use the whole wand, but I only use about 3/4 of it so it&#x27;s a little more. Even with more than 2 coats, my eyelashes don&#x27;t look gloppy and gross, they look like natural eyelashes just with a curl to it, as mine are stick straight. [I actually bent my brush to help curl my eyelashes without a curler, and it works better than buying a brush already bent. Just saying.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. Maybe it&#x27;s not for everyone, but in my experience it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent, I received a free sample of CoverGirl&#x27;s LashBlast Fusion in order to try it out.  While the formula of this mascara is great, I&#x27;m no fan of the wand.  I found it to be too bulky, which made putting on my mascara difficult and awkward.  I&#x27;ll stick with CoverGirl&#x27;s LashExact mascara, instead.</li>
            <li> I tried this Mascara, LashBlast Fusion in the purple tub and really liked it.  I was able to use it with my contacts in with no irritation to my eyes.  It never smudges and it does increase the volume and lenght of my lashes.  I got the sample from from My [...] account, a word of mouth site. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love the way the mascara goes on initially. It doesn&#x27;t clump, and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes spiky. They look thick, although I wouldn&#x27;t call them &#x27;dramatic&#x27; like the ad says. The problem is that the mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on very well, and I have problems with it flaking off throughout the day. After reading other reviews, I was worried about the size of the tube making the brush difficult to handle, but I didn&#x27;t have an issue with it. I bought this at Amazon using the &#x27;Subscribe and Save&#x27; option, so the mascara was only around $6.00. For that price, I wasn&#x27;t outraged at the flaking issue, but I won&#x27;t be buying the mascara again.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of CoverGirl&#x27;s LashBlast Fusion Mascara from [...], and I could not be happier!!    I have very thin lashes, and this product really helped to give me full, thick lashes - without clumping. It also helps to lengthen you lashes!    I did experience a bit of flaking on days that I suffered from allergies. However, on most days there was minimal flaking.    I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to lengthen and/or volumize their lashes!</li>
            <li> I like this product for everyday use. It wears well and does show results. I wasnt blown away by the volume, and I would have liked this in waterproof, but al in all, for the price it was great.</li>
            <li> I received a full size tube of LashBlastFusion from Bzz Agent.  I love cosmetics and I was anxious to try this new mascara.  I have thin, wispy eyelashes that are lighter than my dark brown hair but unnaturally long.  Without mascara, you have to look closely to see them.  I was a little unsure of the wand--as my friend said, it kind of looks like a porcupine!  I like it quite a bit, better than my previous mascara.  I use 2 coats, mainly out of habit.  It adds color and dimension to my eyelashes without clumping them together.  I think it simply enhances what I like about my natural eyelashes--they are long and can be dramatic with the right tool.  This mascara really emphasizes them without looking artificial.  I have found that it washes off easily with just a washrag and water.  I do not like to pull and tug to get makeup off and this comes off easily.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different brands of mascara. This is the best brand that I have found. Very little clumping and it separates the lashes nicely to give a fullness. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This mascara was just ok, all in all it was an average mascara based on the pros and cons below.  Nothing stood out to make it better than your average mascara.  I think if you are happy with what you are using I wouldn&#x27;t switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the tube was pretty big and semi unwieldly.&lt;br /&gt;Although it went on pretty smoothly you did have to make sure not to get too much mascara on the wand so it wouldn&#x27;t clump.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel like it made my eye lashes darker or longer looking like other mascaras do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;I found it went on pretty smoothly although you had to watch out to make sure it didn&#x27;t clump.&lt;br /&gt;I did like that it didn&#x27;t smear at all during the day even when I rubbed my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;dried quickly so no worries about it messing up.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed an eyelash curler with it.</li>
            <li> I have never liked Cover Girl products, so I don&#x27;t know why I thought this mascara would be any different.  First of all, the brush is too fat and you get mascara all over your eyelids.  Secondly, the mascara does not lengthen or volumize - unless you consider clumps volume, and third, it flakes off as the day progresses.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could wave a magic (mascara) wand and have the perfect waterproof mascara, my wish would go like this:  Give me the consistency of regular (non-waterproof) Maybelline Great Lash with the staying power of Blinc tubes and the skinny brush of Shiseido Lasting Lift Mascara.  Oh, and keep it under $10 please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed and discouraged by this product.  Not sure why others liked it.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit of time to get used to the weird brush but now that I have used it a few times I do like it. I have long, thin and light colored lashes. This did give volume, it went on smooth and without too many clumps and for me it stayed on all day. It also looks natural which is great for everyday but not so great if you want a really dramatic look. I also noticed that it doesn&#x27;t add a lot of length. This is a good product and I will use up this tube...Not sure if I will buy another one though! I think it depends on your lashes. Everyone is different. This worked okay for me and was one of the better brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me Lash Blast mascara (in the purple tube) and it surely makes my lashes look very defined, long, and plump! I have average lashes (not long, &amp; not stubby) and this volumizes, thickens and lengthens. My mom saw me last week after I applied Lash Blast, and she said, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot;, and thought I may be wearing false lashes.  I would recommend this mascara, and after reading the 1-star reviews, all I can theorize is the poor women received a defective tube, or their individual chemical and lash hair make-up merely didn&#x27;t react well to the ingredients (or maybe some reviewers didn&#x27;t swipe excess mascara off the brush before application). I do agree that the tube size is wide, but at least we get more of the product and our money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> This mascara does wonders for my lashes. They look longer, thicker, and more voluminous, which I love! I am so happy with it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara, it works amazing..its the only mascara i use now i have been using it since it came out! I love it! My eyelashes look soo much longer and thicker..It really makes my eyes pop! I love this mascara and i recommend this to my friends and family...and im recomending it to you! I love this mascara! &lt;33 will definately keep buying!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. Not saying it&#x27;s perfect (yet to find said perfect mascara), but definitely really good. Lasts probably about a month (stretching it, but then again I use TONS of mascara). The brush is really good, and the formula really doesn&#x27;t flake or clump at all. Really happy with this. Might experiment with some other brands next time, but if those disapoint, this will definitley be what I come back to.</li>
            <li> Great mascara for a great price</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this except that is a good mascara, works well, and is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the LashBlast Volume because it keeps my naturally straight eyelashes curled, so I decided to try out this mascara that promises volume &amp; length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s terrible! Once I put it on, my lashes straighten out right away. I bought the \\&quot;water resistant\\&quot; one, but it rubs off so easily it&#x27;s ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have straight lashes that you need to curl, don&#x27;t bother with this. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great mascara!  Does not clump, or smear.  Leaves me with great lashes, opening up my eyes a little bit as well.</li>
            <li> I like the way this mascara tube handles, the feel of the canister, the brush style. It goes on easily and does seem to produce nice black lashes, but it seems to separate the lashes, too. I guess that&#x27;s a good thing. Haven&#x27;t stabbed myself in the eyeball yet, which I tend to do with curved brushes. This one is not curved.</li>
            <li> Covergirls Lashblast mascara .. i got to try it as a sample many good things being a Buzzagent .. get free stuff to try as soon as new products hit the market .. i have ok type of eyelashes and this one worked real well the secret is the brush very good quality it just sweeps every hair on the eyelash and of no clumps or heavyness and it comes in diff shades too so a must buy ,,, love it</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever tried to get long lashes but got frustrated by the clumps then this mascara is the perfect solution. I first thought that the many short bristles would actually create more clumps on my lashes when I received the sample but the first time I used this I found out that is not at all the case. I applied the mascara and it made my lashes noticeably longer and fuller, but there were no clumps. I wondered if I could get even longer lashes and so I added another coat, then another. There were ZERO clumps and there was a very noticeable improvement in my lashes. I was so impressed! I&#x27;ve never found a mascara that works so well, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive \\&quot;designer\\&quot; mascaras to drugstore mascaras. This works well and even leaves enough money in your wallet to buy some eyeliner to complete the whole look!</li>
            <li> does a good job of thickening and lengthening lashes.</li>
            <li> Length---yes.  Volume--no.  The product states that both are provided but other mascaras that I use provide much more volume.  The price is very reasonable so that will add to the value.  I did not have flaking and the mascara washes of easily.  I would not go out of my way to buy this product again but I would not avoid it either.</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashes... You don&#x27;t need to apply very much at all. Super effective!</li>
            <li> I have tried &#x27;many&#x27; mascara&#x27;s that claim to build lashes without clumps, when I saw a review in Allure mag about the Cover Girl brand in the PURPLE TUBE..I thought I&#x27;d give it a try...THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend!</li>
            <li> i have used this item before so i know what to expect. i will stick to getting it from local stores instead of online because what i received was a dried out clumpy mascara that feels old. amazon allows you to request a replacement but i would just like to get my item at once hassle free from now on. buying make up online might not be the best idea. i have tried to look up the product packaging to verify freshness but no luck.&lt;br /&gt;from past experience i can say i like this mascara. it is pretty volumizing.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;so I received the replacement and had the same issues, clumpy old mascara that gives you the two eyelashes look and looks and feels wrong. I want to say that this is not my experience with Covergirl mascara, but with Covergirl mascara bought on Amazon. I wrote this review before, it got deleted, I complained about it getting deleted as I dont think that is very ethical of Amazon and I got some generic message that the issue is looked into. My recommendation, buy this but just not from here. and let&#x27;s see again if this will be deleted once again. if it does I have my answer about how really trustworthy the reviews are here and will go shop somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It looks great and it was a great price!</li>
            <li> Packaging and shopping was great. But I&#x27;ve learned of higher quality mascaras. This one all works great though.</li>
            <li> Lives up to the promises on the box.  It doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge and it adds both volume and length in a full and well defined lash.  I find it works best when I also use my eye lash curler!  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5-stars is that it has a straight brush and a curved brush to curl would take it up to 5-stars!</li>
            <li> This mascara was just ok for me. The brush kind of clumps the mascara on it, so you have to be very careful that it doesn&#x27;t clump on your lashes. I also felt it didn&#x27;t glide down my lashes smoothly, so some lashes would stick together. Once it&#x27;s on though, it seems to last. I don&#x27;t wear mascara everyday, so when I do, I sometimes forget I have it on and will rub my eye. I did that while wearing this and it didn&#x27;t smudge all over. I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline Great Lash mascara for many, many years, and I&#x27;m going to stick with that. I don&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying this, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> Over all this was good product.  The applicator is nice and the mascara itself when on nicely.  I did have a bit of an allergic reaction (watery eyes) to if after wearing it for a bit.  It was quite sunny out and I think I rubbed some into my eye.  I&#x27;m quite sensitive to make-up however, so I&#x27;m not sure this would be an issue with anyone else.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of this mascara. I was looking to buy a new mascara and thought it would be super convenient with Amazon Prime to buy one. So, I looked up the highest rated mascara on Amazon and found this.    The brush is very fat and doesn&#x27;t hold much actual mascara. I mean, I am asian and my eyelashes are quite short, but this mascara didn&#x27;t remedy the problem at all. It looked like I hardly put any on and I couldn&#x27;t get it dark enough. I even tried it with my MAC mascara primer and it didn&#x27;t look much better.    I guess it just shows you can&#x27;t always trust reviews. I will try a new brand of mascara (still haven&#x27;t found one I absolutely love even after trying lash stiletto (forgot the exact brand), bare minerals, toofaced mascara, etc).</li>
            <li> Overall, I like how this mascara goes on. I use one coat and it really covers every lash and doesn&#x27;t clump or look caked on.  The big brush was a surprise and scary at first, but once I tried it realized it was easy to get close enough to the eye to evenly coat each lash. The mascara has a light feel, not heavy or stiff on the lash.  Maybe it&#x27;s just because you can see each lash, but they seem to have a long and full appearance. The mascara easily lasted over 11 hours and still looked fresh. I&#x27;m not fond of the shape of the tube. Because the bottom is so small and the middle so wide - 9 times out of 10 when you put it down, it falls over. Also because the cap is unevenly shaped, as I was holding it to apply the mascara, I had difficulty with it slipping out of my hand. I really like the product overall, you can get great coverage of each lash without it looking too thick or gaudy.</li>
            <li> The brush on this mascara is good for separating lashes and avoiding the clumping that occurs when you want to apply layers. It&#x27;s relatively durable too, standing up to hot weather. It&#x27;s not quite as good as waterproof, but it&#x27;s better than most. The only complaint I had was the brush is a little bulky, making it hard to apply to the smaller lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I received my tube of mascara as part of a [...] campaign. I really didn&#x27;t expect much. For years I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara to give me more volume. I have a drawer full of failures. I&#x27;m blessed with long lashes - but they aren&#x27;t very thick. Every volume mascara I&#x27;ve tried has failed and only lengthened my lashes. It looked like I had spikes growing out of my eyelids! CoverGirl LashBlast Fusion is the first mascara to actually give me VOLUME!! My lashes look nice and thick. It also gives a touch of length that makes my lashes look even and not staggered. No flaking. No smudging. No irritation. Stays put but is easy to wash off. Plus the Volume!! What more to say? I&#x27;m a convert and will definitely buy the next tube.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I tried it out at my friend&#x27;s house and i fell in love! I got it as soon as possible!! The only problem I have with it is that it smudges if I rub my eyes, but that&#x27;s with almost all makeup! But anyways, it makes my lashes so long and gives them so much volume! When I showed my dad, he thought my eyelashes were real! It has like no clumps!!!!! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I love it so much. I really hope this isn&#x27;t one of those products that is on the shelves for 6 months then mysteriously disappears.</li>
            <li> This made my lashes look longer and fuller without too much smear, but it just didn&#x27;t last. Two hours later it looked like I wasn&#x27;t wearing any mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is nice is you like the very natural look. personally i prefer something that goes on a bit heavier, like falsies. i found this one too light for my taste...</li>
            <li> Oh my god I love this mascara it&#x27;s really an excellent product and the price it&#x27;s right!! The effect on your eyelashes are so huge and dramatic... I&#x27;m now buying two more tubs</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara since it came out and I don&#x27;t think I will ever change unless they discontinue it.  I have tried other brands, even the pricey ones, and I always get panda eyes by the end of the day (you know that shadow you get).  This one does not flake or give you those eyes and best of all, it makes your lashes amazing.  I have had people comment on how real my false eyelashes look.....what false eyelashes!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the waterproof version recently for a trip to Hawaii and works equally as well as the regular and really is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best things about this mascara, it works, and it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> Bought this mascara in very black and I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase. Applicator applies mascara well with no hassles and no fuss.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping I would get everything I wanted in a mascara. I&#x27;m not looking for a whole new set of lashes, but thicker and darker ones. (My natural eyelashes are long, but blond at the tips making them appear shorter.) The mascara corrected the issue of the light color, but it started to flake at the ends about 3 hours into wearing. I didn&#x27;t pile it on, I only used one coat. Now that it is cooler outside, I will try using the mascara again to see if the summer heat was the issue.&lt;br /&gt;As for the thickness, it did make my lashes about twice their normal size. It didn&#x27;t really lengthen them though. I haven&#x27;t found a mascara yet that does, because of how thin the ends of my lashes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because the color is great, and the volume is great, but the flakiness was a big issue for me.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!! Best mascara ever! ;)</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara! It doesn&#x27;t rub off easily and it is pretty flexible. I don&#x27;t need to reapply it throughout the day and when it comes time to wash it off It&#x27;s easy to remove</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a fusion of volume and length, but unfortunately when applying this mascara I find that I have to apply it many times in order for it to be noticeable at all. It does not volumize or even lengthen that well. After you have applied it a lot, it is decent, but don&#x27;t expect extremely noticeable lashes. One good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t smudge and it seems to come off easily when I wash my face. I probably will not purchase again though, because I prefer something that is going to volumize better.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  I had read some poor reviews regarding this mascara being dried up when opened, but I hoped that was just a fluke.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  Mine was dried up as well.  I am not a happy camper right now...money down the drain.  I learned a lesson:  do not purchase items on Amazon that can expire.  To return the tube of mascara would end up costing me more money, so I will just cut my loss and move on.  Beware when ordering this product...you too may receive a tube of mascara that is \\&quot;All Dried Up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have tried a LOT of different brands of mascara ranging from $5 to $30+. A couple of my favorites are Diorshow and Lancome Definicils. I have very short, thin lashes and only about 15% of mascaras I have tried are even adequate.  This mascara works great for me!  I would say it is the second best drugstore brand I have ever purchased, first being Max Factor Stretch &amp; Separate- which has been discontinued in the states :(  This mascara stays on all day without leaving black marks under my eyes and gives me plenty of volume without flaking.  I will definitely continue to purchase this as one of my beauty staples.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect product for my thin lashes. It extended and filled in my lashes without clumps. It worked as described and I will get it again.</li>
            <li> I figured i would try a new type of mascara so i bought this. first off the brush hurts my eye lids when i try to get the mascara to the roots of the eyelashes because it is plastic with plastic little \\&quot;spikes\\&quot;. the color the mascara i bought was the darkest black they offered, it takes so many layers for it to look like i even put any of it on. now this is perfect for someone who likes to wear just a tiny bit of mascara but i have natural blonde hair so my eyelashes are very light. this doesnt do the trick at all. if i was able to return it after trying it i would. i will never purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Even though the mascara (formula) is SUPERB for volumizing/lengthening, the brush is not good for skimpy lashes.  I use my favorite comb-on from another mascara I was using and the combination is PERFECT.  I won&#x27;t be wasting my money on any other mascara...unless of course they eventually discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this particular mascara several times now.  It&#x27;s so inexpensive.  Because of the way the brush is designed, I don&#x27;t experience any clumping or flaking.  It&#x27;s easy to take off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I am forever in search of the perfect mascara. Well, now I need search no more. I love this stuff! The brush is just big enough to give me maximum coverage without getting in my way. My lashes look longer and fuller when I use this product, and I don&#x27;t end up with spiky eyelashes or dark circles after just a few hours. It washes off without a problem and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I wear my contacts. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I love Cover Girl mascara, so I was excited to try out this new version.  It worked very well.  I usually find that a need several coats to get the look I like.  With this, I managed to get the look with just two coats.  It was pretty easy to get good coverage on most of my lashes.  The one part I did not like was that since the end is blunt there was no fine tip for me to use to get those little lashes on the end.  I can say that it held up well to San Antonio heat and humidity with no flaking or smearing.  It came off easily with my regular facial cleaner.  All together it was very nice and I will certainly continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I have posted pictures of the brush versus a typical brush as well as how it looks on my eyes - showing one with and one without.  I thought the images might be more helpful than a mere description. The pictures are available under the picture of the product as additional views. **</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my mascara. I&#x27;ve tried other people&#x27;s favorites, many drugstore and so-called premier brands that cost three times as much. Some common pitfulls include clumping, smearing, and burning in the eyes. Not things I&#x27;d put up with from a $6 mascara, and definitely not a $25 one.    Fortunately, this mascara only had mild, mild clumping that was easily brushed out, and none of the other pitfalls. It lasted all day and I didn&#x27;t end up with the raccoon look that a lot of other mascaras cause.     I will be purchasing this mascara until something better comes along, as the price and quality are both good.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to wear. Thick enough but not messy with a natural look and feel to it. It stays in place and is also useful as a touch up filler. Truly beautiful easy breezy cover girl.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY mascaras since I first began wearing make up; always with a goal to get thicker, longer lashes (without having to go with falsies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cover Girl Lash Blast Fusion is a mascara that doesn&#x27;t easily clump and is VERY waterproof. As for really noticing any lengthing or thickening, though, I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase this? I would, after trying a couple of other brands and I found they didn&#x27;t work as I&#x27;d like either.  It would be in my top 5 choices.</li>
            <li> Cover Girl is a brand we have all used at one time or another and there are several products that I use on a regular basis. I did not feel that this really lived up to its promises (my opinion). Not sure what I was expecting for most mascaras claim to add volume and length. To get the volume you must apply several coats (as in several!) to get it built up on your lashes. Most mascaras are this way. Not really into the Tammay Faye look so my opinion may be a little biased. Works so so but nothing special. Guess I will stick to my old brand when this is used up.</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes that tend to get clumpy with certain brands. While my favorite brand was YSL, spending over $20 on mascara was crazy and my wallet was not liking it. Read a review online about Cover Girl Last blast fusion and figure would give it a go. Well let me tell you, that after using these for a few weeks this is my holy grail when it comes to mascara. Lashes are full, dark, and no clumps or access product all over my eyes. Totally worth trying if you are looking for a new mascara.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the applicator but the mascara give my lashes volume.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I went through dozens of mascaras and this is the most legit. In my opinion, it&#x27;s better than clinique and lancome. Not clumpy AT ALL. The waterproof ones work well too.</li>
            <li> I received this as a BzzAgent. I have to say, I wasn&#x27;t super impressed with it. To me, it&#x27;s just pretty average. Pros were that it didn&#x27;t flake or clump, added a good amount of volume, and comes in a cute tube (purple is my favorite color). Cons were that it takes several coats to get a lot of volume and decent length, it doesn&#x27;t increase length that much, the tube is a bit on the bulky side, and the wand is a little awkward to handle and apply. It didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me, but I thought it was pretty average and good enough if you don&#x27;t want tons of volume and length.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all - while I love Cover Girl&#x27;s mascara&#x27;s this one did not live up to the marketing.  I was not impressed with the lengthening nor thickening that it provided.  I found it to be an average mascara but it worked well as a second application over my current favorite mascara.      I would neither recommend this mascara nor steer people away from CoverGirl&#x27;s Lash Blast Fusion but do not buy this if you are planning for long, thick luxurious lashes as you will sadly be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I notice a big difference between mascaras. This one worked well enough for me. Didn&#x27;t clump much, didn&#x27;t smudge, but didn&#x27;t provide much lengthening definition. I prefer a little softer black or a dark brown for daytime, but this is a good color for evenings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian with longer eyelashes than most other Asians but this mascara did absolutely nothing for me.     It clumped and smeared three hours into a school day. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I hate looking like a racoon.</li>
            <li> I like big lashes, and this did not do it for me. The LashBlast in the orange tube worked better than this did.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes look thicker and longer.  It goes on without clumping.  The regular (not waterproof version) stays put and does not give you raccoon eyes by the end of the day and is easily removed.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This lengthens AND volumizes my lashes, making them look fuller! This is great because my lashes are thin and short, this made a noticeable change! My friends noticed my lashes were longer &amp; thicker on the first day I wore this! :)</li>
            <li> This mascara seems to work just as well as the orange lashblast when it comes to volumizing my lashes. I have naturally long lashes, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like it adds much length to them. Overall, I think this mascara is pretty good. I don&#x27;t get any clumps when I use it and it separates my lashes pretty well. I will definitely keep using this mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Mascara to be found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get definition of every lash with this stuff! Makes them look longer and 3 times fuller while still looking natural! This stuff is better than any other mascara I have ever tried, all the others like to clump up and look like spider legs.&lt;br /&gt;I like to try new things but will not stray from this mascara again!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a mascara that makes your eyes look huge, doesn&#x27;t clump, comes off easily, and is cheap... Give this mascara a try! In my opinion, best drugstore mascara out there.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite drug store mascara. It is only one of the few that actually lengthens and volumizes my eyelashes. Because I&#x27;m Asian, my eyelashes are short and barely visible but this mascara brings out my eyelashes. However, I only use this as a base and use about 2 or 3 other mascaras to give my eyelashes the full volumized effect. This mascara alone does a pretty good job, but using other masacaras combined can give me the look I want</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup junkie, and I love this mascara...if this isn&#x27;t doing it for your lashes then maybe you just don&#x27;t have any? The brush is able to get all of your lashes, top and bottom and the formula stays on for a very very long time (if you wanted you could sleep in it!). It gives your lashes a full long look without looking clumpy and tacky like a teenage girl incapable of applying mascara.</li>
            <li> (Mrs. Brcik&#x27;s review) I love this product and I got it for a good deal on here when purchased. Goes on great and stays on. : )</li>
            <li> I have been buying this mascara for years. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> LashBlast stays on my lashes all day without smearing and comes off easily  without abuse to your eyes. Love it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best!  I love the long thick lashes it gives me. I used two coats of it and I have already had two people ask me today what kind of mascara I use.</li>
            <li> i got it it was brand new but it was dryed out like if they put it on the sun i made my eyelash clump did not like it at all</li>
            <li> I currently use LashBlast Fusion mascara by CoverGirl, and I am very pleased with the product.  The mascara comes in a small, dark purple tube, and it is packaged in a plastic and paper case.  The mascara brush and the tube of mascara are packaged apart from one another for freshness.  When you first remove the product from its case, simply unscrew the cap from the top of the tube, place the mascara brush into the tube, and begin to use your new mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LashBlast Fusion mascara is designed to make eyelashes appear longer and more voluminous.  The brush contains several tiny, rubber bristles.  The mascara itself is black, very thick, and it is not waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LashBlast Fusion mascara has several positive qualities.  Because of this, I have bought this brand of mascara for about three years, and I continue to buy it.  Some of its positive qualities are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The LashBlast Fusion mascara is inexpensive and easily found in stores or online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The mascara is not waterproof, so it comes off eyelashes easily with eye makeup remover.  Although it is easily removed, it stays on lashes well throughout the day without flaking or smudging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The tiny bristles keep excess mascara off the brush.  Therefore, when you go to apply the mascara onto your lashes, it will go on smoothly onto your lashes without clumping.  Unlike other mascaras I have used, this mascara adds volume to each individual eyelash instead of clumping several lashes together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. When the mascara dries, your eyelashes will still feel and look soft.  The LashBlast Fusion mascara will not leave your eyelashes looking crunchy and dry like some of its competing brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The LashBlast Fusion mascara is perfect for casual daytime makeup and also for a more dramatic evening look.  To achieve this look, apply a few coats of mascara onto your lashes.  For a more natural look, just apply one coat onto your lashes.  Unlike other mascaras, you can apply a few coats to add volume, and your lashes will still not clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The mascara adds length and volume to your lashes without making it look like you have a ton of product on your eyes.  Even with a few coats of the product, your makeup will look natural and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only warning is that the commercials make the product sound like your eyelashes will look much more dramatic than they end up looking.  I personally prefer a cleaner, natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several mascaras, but I have not found one that lives up to the quality of LashBlast Fusion mascara.  It is inexpensive, does not smudge or flake, comes off easily with makeup remover, does not clump, adds volume and length to each individual lash, and works well for a casual or more dramatic look.  The LashBlast Fusion mascara is a wonderful makeup product that I would strongly recommend to anyone.an apply a few coats to add volume, and your lashes will still not clump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.

            <li> I have been using this formula since it came out and for a good reason - I have simply never found anything better. I used to use Chanel and found this is better at elongating and thickening the lashes for a quarter to a third of the price. Seriously, stop messing around with pricy designer brands and bow down to lash blast fusion!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara- it makes my eyelashes look longer and thicker and doesn&#x27;t flake off through the day all at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a Great Lash girl but read some good reviews about this and decided to give it a try.  I like it, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with smudging and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> would have given a star rating except for the &amp;#34;clumpiness of the mascara&amp;#34;.  Prefer and softer result</li>
            <li> Its my favorite drugstore mascara. Goes on very dark, a few coats will really lift and separate your eye lashes. People sometimes ask me if they are fake!</li>
            <li> this mascara... has a flat end on the brush i have no idea why but i guess gotta have its purpose, the thing is so much mascara accumulates at the end when you take the brush out you need to be careful not to create a mess, overall its fine good not great, gives you a simple, quick look rather than anything else.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this product since it had so many wonderful reviews and provided both volume AND length. However I am definitely disappointed in this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  First off I found the mascara too be clumpy. Secondly I do not think it added any length, tho I do feel my lashes are fuller with this mascara then most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However the MAIN PROBLEM I have with this product is that the arms on the brush are just too soft to either grab my lashes or to remove clumps. Both of which are necessary to do when using this mascara because it does create clumps and does not define well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Maybe if you used this brush with a mascara that has a thinner consistency. Or if you were to use a stiffer brush then comes with this product for this thick-consistency mascara. But as it is, the brush that comes with this mascara does not suit the consistency of the mascara itself at all. Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve used!  It is rarely on sale in stores.  So when I saw it at much cheaper price..I had to buy it!  Arrived super fast too!</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara!  First time out of the tube, my lashes look perfect!  It usually takes a time or two with new mascara for me to get my lashes to look like this.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the brush tip is rounded instead of tapered and it&#x27;s slightly hard to get the ends of my lashes.  I had doubts when I saw the unusual brush, but this is definitely my new mascara.</li>
            <li> I spent many years and many dollars trying to find the best mascara out there.  I finally found CoverGirl Lash Blast and was super happy with it and used it for 1-2 years.  When this formula came out I knew I had to try it.  It is just as great as the original, but with just a touch better lengthening skills!  Not only does it look great but I never have clumping and flaking is almost nonexistent.  One coat is very natural looking (for me) and two (which is what I usually wear) is a bit more dramatic.  This is very builable without getting ugly.  This never feels heavy or stiff on my eyes, and sometimes with just one coat it doesn&#x27;t really feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything at all.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with it running under my eyes, which has been an issue for me with mascaras in the past.  Before getting Lasic I was a contact lens wearer and never had any issues in that regard.  Some people might not like the size of the wand because it is large, but I got used to it really fast, and grew to really like it.  I feel like one tube could last me without drying out until well after the 3 month mark (when it should be thrown out).  Overall this is a phenominal mascara at any price!</li>
            <li> I like mascara to look natural but gives some volume and length. Lashblast does that for me.  But I bought the waterproof and it was a waste.  Wasn&#x27;t waterproof at all. I had 4acoon eyes all summer long g.</li>
            <li> CoverGirl&#x27;s new mascara that gives a blast of volume and incredible length for dramatic lashes with full length volume. It&#x27;s their first ever volume + length mascara, and trust me it works! It has a huge super-volumizing brush and a new buildable fiber-stretch lengthening formula that work together to thicken and extend the look of individual lashes.    This is a fantastic mascara! I know a lot of people ned to get used to the big brush but I really liked it. I&#x27;m clumsy with mascara as it is but I wasn&#x27;t much clumsier with the bigger brush. It actually made it easier because it&#x27;s so big and has so many bristles (I guess that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re called?) so you won&#x27;t miss a lash and have to go back to it and then crap! messing up. Because that&#x27;s what usually happens to me.    The mascara didn&#x27;t make your lashes clump or look messy, I actually think that the lengthening and voluminizing that the mascara did actually created a super dramatic and awesome look with your eyes.    I chose the \\&quot;very black\\&quot; color but they also have black, black brown, and brown. Also the mascara is only $8.99 in all stores. I know for a fact they sell CoverGirl at almost all drug stores, Targets, WalMarts, grocery stores, and much more.    Overall, what can I say? CoverGirl does it again! Easy to use and a great product at a reasonable price. Awesome!    Buy It! Check out a Target or drugstore near you!</li>
            <li> This mascara provides good coverage and mimimal clumping.  However, I have sensitive eyes, and I found the smallest spec that comes off in my eye causes burning and irritation.  I live in an area where allergies abound and my eyes have a tendency to water.  Hence the two star rating.  I would not recommend for someone with sensitive eyes or an allergy sufferer.  Also, I did not find it made my eyelashes any longer or thicker than other mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li> This worked wonderfully to quickly and cleanly give me long and thick lashes.  I love it.  It only took a few strokes and my lashes went from short and sweet to long, thick and hot!  The handle is very easy to maneuver and there was no clumping on the brush.  There was just enough product on the brush, I didn&#x27;t need to remove any before applying to my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long black lashes really make my eyes pop and add a lot of beauty to my face.  Folks have been asking me what was so different about me?  Was I sleeping better?  Was I losing weight?  Did I get a hair cut?  No, it&#x27;s just longer and lusher lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the Lash Blast Fusion to go on very chunky at all like other mascaras I&#x27;ve used in the past. While I do think it helped keep my lashes straighter they didn&#x27;t seem extremely long, maybe just a little. One reason I don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of mascara is I rub my eyes a lot and I think that mascara irritates them. After rubbing my eyes with this mascara on it didn&#x27;t come off all over my finger like others have but it did leave some smudges around my eyes. And for some the actual appearance of the tube may matter and I think this tube is pretty cute and pretty large and easy to hold onto. You wouldn&#x27;t lose this in a bag of makeup!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I usually use CoverGirl LashBlash Length or Maybelline brand, but this CoverGirl LashBlast Fusion is the only one that makes a really noticeable difference and doesn&#x27;t clump. My lashes appeared longer and fuller with just one coat. Also, the brush is well-designed, so I did not have to use a separate eyelash brush to separate my lashes.  It did not affect my use of contact lenses, and caused no unpleasant reactions with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very flattering and I will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, but I am not sure whether it is the brush or the actual mascara that makes the difference. The brush in this tube of mascara has short bristles packed closely together all around the wand and it seems to do a nice job of distributing and separating the lashes. The mascara itself sometimes gives off a slight glue-like smell just as I am using it but it fades quickly. Doesn&#x27;t seem to run or smear much at all and washes off nicely with warm water &amp; soap. I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is one of the best mascara&#x27;s I have purchased in a while. It goes on smooth with no clumping. It takes a few coats to really extend out the lashes but still shows no sign of clumping. What I love best about it is the fact it washes off so easy. The last mascara I purchased that advertised lash extension was such a pain to wash off. I would wash and wash and it came off all stringy. I don&#x27;t like using makeup remover so this to me is a real bonus.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I received a free sample, and even though I normally don&#x27;t like mascara, I decided to give this one a try.  There was no clumping, and it really added thickness and length to my lashes. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product as a BuzzAgent and I have LOVED it ever since I opened the package!  The mascara goes on smoothly without any clumping.  Best thing, no smudging.  I don&#x27;t know why, but I have a huge \\&quot;smudge\\&quot; problem (perhaps its my eye cream I use).  I have honestly been looking a very long time for a mascara like this.  Only downside for me is the huge clunky container, but its nothing compared to having great lashes.  Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for at least 5 years. Every once in a while I try something different but nothing satisfies me like this product. I have naturally long, full eyelashes but this definitely perfects them. I always get compliments on my eyes and lashes</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara of all time!!!  So great with contacts it doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara. I&#x27;m one of those women who must try every type of makeup there is out there (much to my poor husband&#x27;s dismay!) Needless to say, I have tried MANY a mascara. However, I keep coming back to this CoverGirl LashFusion in Very Black. It does not clump when applying. Also, although I do not use the waterproof formulation (I find that this tends to dry out and pull out my lashes) it does stay on pretty well. It does not causes black circles under my eyes. Occasionally, I will have a small speck on my cheek that has flaked off of my lashes, but I do tend to put quite a few coats on. I notice that when I only use one coat, I don&#x27;t get the flaking.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it&#x27;s my go to product. Doesn&#x27;t flake, and has nice full, thick coverage, which is what I look for in a mascara.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup often, and when I do, I don&#x27;t wear much.&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect mascara for someone looking to make their eyelashes look fuller and longer, but still natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara brush comes out of the tube cleanly and without clumps and bumps.  It goes on smooth and easy.  It has good staying power.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it comes OFF smooth and easy without greasy makeup removers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this out and she was very pleased.  It doesn&#x27;t clump; it separates your lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t smear or run even in 100° Texas heat.  It almost is as good as  department store brand mascaras.</li>
            <li> This review was done by my wife.&lt;br /&gt;I am a faithful Maybelline pink and green tube user.  I have tried multiple brands even high end department store mascaras and always come back to the same pink and green tube.  When I first tried this mascara I was impressed by the fuller bristles and larger applicator brush.  It goes on really smoothly and coats my lashes perfectly.  I usually have a few small clumps when I first apply, but not with this applicator.  It really does make my lashes look fuller because it coats them so nice and evenly.  It only takes one coat to cover them which is a change for me because I usually have to do two coats in order to get coverage. The very black color also makes them look longer.  I am pleasantly surprised by this new mascara and would definitely purchase over my old standby.</li>
            <li> Tried this product after using another one of the Cover Girl products. So far, I really like it. I&#x27;ve used it for about two weeks. The color is rich and black - very black is a great descriptor because that is what I like and it lives up to its name. It is easy to apply but I always recommend curling lashes first, regardless of the brand, as it adds that additional punch. I often have a problem with raccoon specs...little black dots under my eyes but that didn&#x27;t happen with this one. I would recommend using it again during the work day - certainly adds more pizzazz as we get to look a little more tired during the day.  Inexpensive, effective, recommended!!!! Got it promo through manufacturer. Love it anyway. Amazon.com has a $3 coupon right now, so why not try it?</li>
            <li> I received this mascara for free from a promotional campaign. I love the brush on the wand, and this mascara is really great for creating fuller lashes. I prefer a lengthening mascara though, and this doesn&#x27;t do much in that department. I&#x27;ll probably stick with a lengthening mascara in the future.</li>
            <li> Great cover and great color! Would not of tried it of not for the great price but now that I have I will buy in the future for sure!</li>
            <li> Goes on too thick and makes your lashes stick together.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!! Awesome deal thank you!! Recommended!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara for my short lashes...I don&#x27;t leave home without it.  Makes my lashes look so much fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> It worked well while it lasted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few months and it does the job. It does not clump,  provides length,  and is easily removed. This mascara is my second choice to Bobbi Brown lash glamour extreme.</li>
            <li> The product is just okay. I did expect a intense look seeing as they advertised a false lash look appeal, but really thats not what was provided. Also, mascaras usually begin to clump after several uses, and this one clumps on the brush constantly and then leaves the clumps on your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase it again? Unfortunately not...</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Globbed up&amp;#34; in a short period of time and it seems like a skimpy amount of product for the size of the mascara.  I had to add some water to make it smooth again.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is even better than I expected it to be. Just as good as expensive brand that I no longer need to buy!</li>
            <li> Did not feel like it has the same quality as other covergirl products.</li>
            <li> I love cover girl mascara. I saw this mascara offered at a fantastic price on Amazon. I decided to purchase two. This mascara is true to the cover girl brand. It is easy to apply. Yields a midnight black long beautiful lash. It was a great price, delivered to my door and worked as advertised. All of those are reasons to buy it again. I definitely would recommend this for all women.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!!! Lengthens and volumizes my lashes!! I used alone on one side and compared to the the side which had both primer and another mascara and they  both looked the same length!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through like 20 different types of mascara. I used a lot of Clinique and lancome until i ordered this. I just bought my 5th one I think lol soo ya, buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on mascara.  Sometimes $20 or more for one tube.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve discovered the secret to really great lashes: FRESH Covergirl mascaras (in the big thick tubes)&lt;br /&gt;All of them work well.  The orange, green, and purple tube mascaras are great.&lt;br /&gt;And they are priced low enough that I can use a new tube every month.&lt;br /&gt;I never use a mascara for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;This keeps the mascara fresh and bacteria free.  And it doesn&#x27;t have time to dry out and get flaky.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this again from One Tree Brands, and I just wanted to add that the seller&#x27;s speedy replies to my emails made this purchase experience all the better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline has always been my favorite brand; I&#x27;ve actually never liked Cover Girl.  I tried this only because I read such rave reviews and because my sister also said she liked it.  Without mascara, my lashes are kind of regular, probably on the skimpy side, but these make me look like I have falsies on.  Actually, when I wear falsies, it looks similar to having this mascara on.  I don&#x27;t like the packaging (I dislike fat tubes), but this is good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Amazon shipped this to me in like a day; that was awesome.</li>
            <li> when i put this on! my eyes looks so beautiful! it dosent gets messy! they look so full and long! i just loved it!</li>
            <li> It burns my eyes sometimes don&#x27;t know way I been using all brands of mascaras and never had this trouble before and my eye lashes don&#x27;t really look that long or full with it</li>
            <li> This stuff works magic! Brings volume to my lashes like never before, will totally be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> The BEST mascara by Covergirl. Length plus non-clumpy volume... What more could you want. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Great everyday mascara. Absolutely waterproof!</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara. No Clumps!</li>
            <li> One of the best mascaras ive ever had. Does not clump my lashes together, or give me a 2-eyelashes look. Seperates lashes very well. Not the most dramatic look from a mascara that i have gotten and does not lengthen my lashes as much as others i have tried. But if you are looking for a good quality mascara for a good price that doesnt clump your lashes together- great buy</li>
            <li> i really like this mascara i got it and the size fooled me it works really good not clumby and it goes on amazingly get this stuff worth it</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. It makes my lashes look even bigger and fuller than they did already. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It works great! That is why I bought 4 of them!</li>
            <li> This mascara is not that great. I purchased it after reading many reviews and watching the videos.  I do not like it that much.  It seems to just add color to my lashes since they are light.  As far as adding length or volume, forget about it.  It seems to be drying out already also and I have only had for a week.  I would not buy  this particular Cover-girl mascara again. I am going to stick with L&#x27;Oreal. I purchased the color in very black and I am glad I did otherwise I would not even look like I have mascara on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this! Clings to my lashes so well and really lengthens them!</li>
            <li> It holds curl, does not smudge, you are getting your money&#x27;s worth. Good quality for an item around $7. Better than Maybelline Great Lash, slightly better (on the no smudging part) than Loreal. Still not comparable to some of my favorites such as Lancome and Shiseido brand (those brands are 4 times more also).</li>
            <li> This mascara was just like every other mascara I have used and on top of that it irritated my eyes very badly.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite mascara. And I love it because of the brush. Lots of people complain about the size of the brush, but the thick wand and brush are sturdy and thus allow you to swipe the product on your lashes without the brush going all &#x27;floppy&#x27; on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinner wands and their thinner brushes tend to move around too much, so you don&#x27;t get a steady swoop. With this brush, you don&#x27;t need to try and try again to put mascara on the same area. One swoop and you move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush also has tons of thin spiky &#x27;bristles&#x27;, spaced perfectly, allowing for great separation and coverage of each individual lash, and avoiding the *horribly tacky* look of clumped lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is long-lasting for a non-waterproof, and does not wear off throughout the day, yet can be removed very easily when you&#x27;re ready.</li>
            <li> I always wear waterproof mascara &amp; must have blacked out when I ordered this NON-waterproof mascara last week! To be fair, it looks great when applied. I don&#x27;t like the fibers...when they get wet, they just fall off under your eyes. I&#x27;m giving this tube to a friend who uses it already &amp; I&#x27;m going back to my LashBlast Waterproof!</li>
            <li> I bought them for my freinds and aunts, who love them very much. You know, they are of different age ranges, but CoverGirl makes them bueatiful. It&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> Love it! my fave brand!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It seems to dry out fast but it&#x27;s still worth it. I have a monthly subscription.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent drug store brand mascara that I use in between buying my favorite more expensive brands.  Good value</li>
            <li> The main thing I like about it is that is doesn&#x27;t give me spider eyelashes. The brush itself combes nicely leaving my eyelashes spread out without so much black ink on them. I get an almost natural look without so much clumping. If your looking for a mascara that really extends the eyelashes out then your better off trying another kind of mascara, personally Lancome Hynose Drama does the job pretty good but I don&#x27;t use that one everyday since its too much mascara for me to wear everyday. But when I want a more toned down look on my eyelashes that works really well, this it the one.</li>
            <li> I always hated the fact that a particular mascara either lengthened my lashes or they plumped my lashes.  This one truly does both jobs well (and doesn&#x27;t clump).  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different mascaras and this is the only one I buy.  Wish the double packs were available here on Amazon (but I have found them at Costco on occasion).</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Cover Girl really holds to its advertising.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often, but it is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! It is so easy to apply and it stays put all day. It does not smudge at all and it gives volume and length to my puny lashes. I am very pleased with Covergirl and their products lately!&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent this product for free to review for my unbiased opinion. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> My friend and I LOVE this mascara!  It makes your lashes look long and it&#x27;s great for separation as well.  Worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li> I liked this mascara. Its very natural looking before multiple coats. It gave me nice volume! Not much length at all so i would pair it with another. It holds curl pretty well. Its not my favorite mascara but it works good and does what its supposed to do (:</li>
            <li> This is a very good overall mascara. There are so many choices with mascaras now that it all depends on what you need. This is a very good day time look. It makes all your individual lashes thicker and separates them to look good. It lasts a long time without flaking.</li>
            <li> I prefer to spend less time on mascara than putting three or more coats on in the morning. The big fat brush doesn&#x27;t really help; in fact, it seems to make it harder to get into the corners of my eyes. It takes at least three coats to look like there&#x27;s anything on the lashes at all, and after all that, it&#x27;s still not great. I will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> Excellent, no clumping, very satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;the bristles are perfect for getting perfect lashes.  I recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for years.  Great lengthening and thickening without the clumping go others.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I do have naturally long lashes, but when I wear this mascara I am consistently asked if I am wearing false lashes (which to me is a positive). It&#x27;s just like DiorShow but is so much more affordable and I believe it doesn&#x27;t dry out as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: I am heavy handed with mascara and prefer the bold look vs a more natural look...both are possible with this mascara but if you prefer a natural look I would not be the best at judging if you&#x27;d be happy with this product.</li>
            <li> definitely makes my lashes look longer and fuller; lasts all day, but washes off easily when I&#x27;m ready for it to.</li>
            <li> I have used much more expensive brands of mascara, but I won&#x27;t anymore! This is the third time I have purchased CG Lash Blast Fusion. I use an extremely moisturizing under eye cream that breaks down most mascaras. Not this one! It goes on without clumps and doesn&#x27;t flake or pill.</li>
            <li> I love LashBlastFusion! My lashes are now fuller, longer &amp; sexier than ever! And, what I appreciate most is that at the end of a long workout, it doesn&#x27;t smear in my eyes or run down my face when I&#x27;m sweaty. Thanks CoverGirl for another dependable mascara!</li>
            <li> I do believe this mascara is a great alternative to higher end mascara and maybe I&#x27;m being a mascara snob by not giving it 5 stars (or I&#x27;m spoiled by benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re real but don&#x27;t want to justify spending that kind of craziness on mascara all the time ;) ) However, I plan on using this mascara for everyday wear, I do think it&#x27;s pretty good! It lengthens and is build-able, doesn&#x27;t clump, easily washable and separates lashes well. I haven&#x27;t noticed if it does much for volumizing but that&#x27;s ok by me. Pretty good if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive alternative to the high end!</li>
            <li> My Girls love their new CoverGirl Mascara and they are the experts, Trust me!  Overall a great Product and easy to use and works Great! Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use and looks great on. I only apply in the morning and it last all day.</li>
            <li> I have been around the block with mascaras. This is a personal favorite \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; mascara of mine, because it both thickens and lengthens lashes. The staying power is pretty solid. My only frustration is that it goes on a little bit moist and sometimes ruins eyeshadow. It dries quickly though and holds up pretty well. I generally only have to touch up if I want to transition my make-up from day to night. The color is also very nice. While it says \\&quot;very black\\&quot; it isn&#x27;t so dark that it&#x27;s apparent you&#x27;re wearing make up if you are trying to get the natural look.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything that special about it other than it was a GREAT value. Other than that all that I can say is that it&#x27;s about the same as any other mascara that I&#x27;ve used. No complaints.</li>
            <li> love all of the covergirl mascaras!</li>
            <li> I had a coupon so decided to try this in the very black.  I was pleasantly surprised and really like it......I think it is a good mascara for everyday wear......2 decently-applied coats is all I need and I don&#x27;t have long lashes but this mascara does lengthen them to the point where it does look like I have long lashes.......just not frighteningly long.  This mascara makes your lashes look pretty without all of the \\&quot;dramatics\\&quot;.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was hoping for something different from my ordinary mascara brush.  Some reviews said it didnt clump and that there was no chuck at the end of the brush.....yes and yes!  I wouldnt buy again</li>
            <li> This, coupled with Maybelline Great Lash as a first coat, gives you the best lashes EVER! Why buy more expensive mascara?</li>
            <li> great product!, delivered fast. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works great, mostly.  Makes my lashes look plump and awesome.  I do notice that at the end of the day, it does start to break off and leave black pieces on my face though.</li>
            <li> Great volume,  great length! A little watery for my liking but work with it and it looks great !</li>
            <li> Normally my eyes are very sensitive to mascara, but this formula never irritates at all. I have tried almost every brand on the market but because of the burning sensation and teary eyes I was giving up on mascara altogether. This formula is light but provides coverage that look dense. The silicone wand is amazing for separating lashes. I have never had any clumping no matter how sloppily I apply it. This also does not have a pungent smell like some other mascaras I have tried. Very cheap and does better than the ones $20+ that I have tried!</li>
            <li> More than many other cosmetic products, I think mascaras are very individual, in that what one Person A loves and swears by may do nothing for Person B, and vice versa. In any case, I have a drawer full of high-end mascara samples but I decided to give drugstore a try, and I was honestly surprised that I like this one as much as I do. It&#x27;s not going to stop traffic, it&#x27;s not high-drama, and I doubt anyone will think you&#x27;re wearing false eyelashes, but it&#x27;s great for everyday. It darkens, separates, and thickens enough that it looks like my own lashes, but better. Depending on your expectations, you may be disappointed with that performance, but it&#x27;s enough for me most of the time and I think this could become my go-to mascara for work and regular life.  Again, though, with mascara in particular - your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I simply love this mascara, easy to use and always reliable for beautiful lashes. Once tried and I think, that I will not use any other mascara!</li>
            <li> it is way too big of a wand, my eyes are sensitive to the product as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give long or big lashes and runs bad.</li>
            <li> Never clumpy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. covers your eyelashes beautifully with just a couple of coats. will order again in the future. thank you</li>
            <li> Better than the other one which my wife already used. She likes it, Not that much pricy especially compare with some famous brands</li>
            <li> This product is one I&#x27;ve been buying for a while, i love it it gives me long defined lashes. The first time i actually used this product it was gifted to me by my sis and since that day I fell in love i recommend everyone to purchase this product and give it a try the mascara is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have the worst time finding a mascara that doesn&#x27;t leave smudge marks below my eyes, even with some waterproof tubes. This is great. No clumps on my lashes and I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon by day&#x27;s end.</li>
            <li> I usual don&#x27;t use mascara because it doesn&#x27;t give me the affect that I want however I was surprised by LashBlastFusion.  I noticed right away the difference it made, my lashes appeared longer and more obvious.  The brush pulls out very smooth and didn&#x27;t clump.  I&#x27;m really impressed with the overall look and feel.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara-third time buying it</li>
            <li> Its okay. Doesn&#x27;t clump but isnt that dark</li>
            <li> Good mascara for the price.  Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t clump. Stays on pretty good most of the day.  Comes of easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have to admit I hate the packaging. Really would prefer a more simpler tube and a smaller brush. The mascara itself is amazing and love it in both the Very Black and Brown and they are becoming my new favorites. Though I still love my [[ASIN:B004AZZ0QK Benefit Cosmetics They&#x27;Re Real! Mascara]](See Review) this is close and a lot cheaper and easier to get. They&#x27;re Real does seem to give a bit more volume but not much plus as a Makeup artist student I can also get this in brown which I use a lot of. This also seems to hold longer and is almost weightless even with three or more layers on. It is not waterproof which is what I normally favor so careful around rain or tears. I am still debating which one I like more between this and Benifit&#x27;s, but either way, it&#x27;s one of the best mascara&#x27;s out their and a great buy.</li>
            <li> separating , volume , length , super black and looks so natural but build-able . i would repurchase it for sure</li>
            <li> This is THE best mascara. Gives my eyelashes both volume and length</li>
            <li> At best this product adds a little color to your lashes, but it certainly does not add the volume it claims to. The regular Lash Blast (orange bottle) is far more effective. This mascara does not lengthen nor does it add volume to the lashes. I&#x27;m planning to purchase a different mascara is as this one is terrible as far as over the counter mascaras go.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this mascara, given my loyalty to the original orange LashBlast and CoverGirl products in general. Sadly, they were not fulfilled. I found it to be on the dry side, and took too many coats to make the difference that I look for when wearing mascara. I have long, dark lashes anyway, so it doesn&#x27;t take a miracle product to make them stand out - and this just didn&#x27;t do the trick. I might be willing to retry it in the hopes that maybe it was just that one, but so far I am unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I love the original lash blast, it&#x27;s my go-to mascara. This one though was disappointing. The formula was flakey and hard to build on and didn&#x27;t do much for my lashes. Wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Great Mascara, builds &amp; separates lashes well, no flaking and in great colors! I&#x27;ve used this mascara for a year now and still loving it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and love it.  As the aging process is setting in more and more I find that this product still makes my lashes look thick and long.  Since I have sensitive eyes I don&#x27;t use the waterproof.  Highly recommend.</li>
