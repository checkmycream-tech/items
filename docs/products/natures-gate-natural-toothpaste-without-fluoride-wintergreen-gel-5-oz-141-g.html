            <li>It&#x27;s good when you can get it onto your brush, but no guarantees that&#x27;ll be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this Wintergreen Gel is not so good.  </li>
            <li>tastes good, no flouride</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes it but not as good as Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li>Even with the difficulty of use, this is a great product as compared to the many others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Some non-fluoride toothpastes don&#x27;t taste all that great, but Nature&#x27;s Gate has a great mild, minty flavor.</li>

            <li>Buy it, try it and you will love it!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d rather have healthy teeth, though!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong flavor taste but it has been working great.  </li>
            <li>The taste is nice and not too strong, and my dentist has been happy with my home care since I started using this toothpaste, so if you need vegan toothpaste I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are amazing.</li>
            <li>I have not found it to hold its own against the effects of spicy food on one&#x27;s breath, and I feel like it has zero</li>
            <li>I leaves a not so nice after taste.</li>
            <li>I will not be getting this kind again.</li>
            <li>good flavor AND FLUORIDE FREE!</li>
            <li>Also has a nice taste.</li>
            <li>Very nice, mild flavored toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>The gel feels great and the wintergreen taste is fresh and not over powering like some toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes great and is very refreshing as far as your breath goes.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like it better than TM also</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would recommend this product as a safe alternative to fluoridated pastes.</li>
            <li>I wish that it made more of a lather</li>
            <li>This product took some getting used to but It was strangely refreshing without all of the additives.</li>
            <li>after I really enjoyed it</li>
            <li>and now I love it.</li>
            <li>I use it in between meals but can&#x27;t use it as my AM toothpaste to get rid of my lovely morning breath.</li>
            <li>My family&#x27;s favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Flavor is ok, but needs to be stronger.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus I feel like its a better choice for my family.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s vegan (?)</li>
            <li>but it tastes better</li>
            <li>Pretty good safe paste, dont expect a lot of flavor.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels very clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>to change for a new product, have been a great change for me.</li>
            <li>easy to use, love the gel and</li>
            <li>Most importantly, make sure not to over brush your imouto&#x27;s teeth as it will become quite addicting.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s an all natural toothpaste and that it has a really GREAT Wintergreen taste.</li>
            <li>great natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s flouride free.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re reluctant to give that up, this is a good choice (many natural toothpastes are made without fluoride).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But something like conditioner that I go thru very quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame as wintergreen is my favorite so far taste wise.</li>
            <li>still recommend this toothpaste, because I know it&#x27;s good for the gums, it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>We went fluoride free 2 years ago and started with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>So, I emailed the manufacturer and was told that this is not gluten free and that the manufacturer never claimed it was gluten free.</li>
            <li>For me, that&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gluten free</li>
            <li>i enjoy using natures gate toothpaste every morning.</li>
            <li>Natural toothpaste is good to have.  </li>
            <li>My review was originally written at a time when this listing was for the FLUORIDATED version of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Love this brand so much!</li>
            <li>Most other toothpastes leave my mouth feeling like it&#x27;s been destroyed, but this leaves a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li>From one tube to the next, the consistency would either be good</li>
            <li>I really wish I could have given this toothpaste a better rating.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam much, though it brushes ok.</li>
            <li>Not overly sweet, which I like.</li>
            <li>My first tube was easy to use.</li>
            <li>teeth and my mouth feel fresh and clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but you quickly get used to it.</li>
            <li>More natural and cruelty free product.</li>
            <li>Very good product, if you are like me and prefer not to be forced to use fluoride in your toothpaste</li>
            <li>Best natural toothpaste without toxic chemicals waste known as fluoride.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural, not tested on animals and vegan, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the freshest breath.</li>
            <li>It feels natural and leaves my teeth feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>The other flavor of this toothpaste is way better, this one just melts in your mouth, it does not foam up and give you a good deep clean</li>
            <li>Great taste and feel clean after, unlike all other natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The dentist said my teeth are in great condition at every appointment after using this for the past year.</li>
            <li>Love this tooth paste, I&#x27;ve gone back to Crest, but will be returning to this more natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of their flavors (strictly non-fluoridated, as I&#x27;m in no need of a chemical lobotomy) with high levels of satisfaction, yet this wintergreen gel just does not get my teeth and mouth clean enough</li>
            <li>I have used it for several months and I am very pleased with it; teeth look clean and white.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first rule in selling to distributors.</li>
            <li>I love Nature&#x27;s Gate Toothpaste, but I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>but next time I will make sure I get the paste.  </li>
            <li>Much healthier for the body!</li>
            <li>This item arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>if my dentist cusses me out at my next appt i will update this comment...:)</li>
            <li>Flavor is ok, mild, not really the &amp;#34;Hey</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was thrilled to find a toothpaste without FLOURIDE &amp; especially one that is natural!</li>
            <li>While the difference would seem to only be visual, I have noticed that this kind doesn&#x27;t seem to foam up as nicely as the white opaque pastes do.</li>
            <li>So far so good thought it was a little spicy or salty but has my mouth feeling fresh with out microbeeds or fluoride</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothpaste -- no weird \\&quot;natural\\&quot; taste or consistency or texture.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this toothpaste was mild in taste, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>Mild minty flavor and all natural.</li>
            <li>i have found Natures Gate toothpaste at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Our family really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>When I got the packages, it said absolutely nothing about gluten on them</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing Nature&#x27;s Gate Creme de Peppermint toothpaste for quite some time as it  stopped the canker sores that I was plagued with my whole life.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like it that much.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t un-gel very well</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it all the time, since it doesn&#x27;t brush teeth better than Colgate Total Gel (for example), but I use it at night, because I know it&#x27;s natural, and I use Colgate in the morning.</li>
            <li>And it certainly doesn&#x27;t meet the high standard for brushing your imouto&#x27;s teeth either, you need all the help you can get to feel clean after that as it</li>
            <li>I like the Nature&#x27;s Gate brand quite a lot, I use it when I&#x27;m too lazy to make my own toothpaste</li>
            <li>In particular, I have been trying to choose cruelty-free options.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a decent flavor</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave the overwhelming toothpaste &amp;#34;fresh breath&amp;#34; feel like other toothpastes do, but it helped me realize that we are getting a huge amount of sugar in the other pastes.</li>
            <li>Taste takes a little getting used to but is refreshing.</li>
            <li>have been trying to replace my conventional toiletries/personal products (shampoo, conditioner, soaps, toothpaste, deodorant, etc) with more natural options.  </li>
            <li>This never quite makes me feel fresh enough.</li>
            <li>We have already gone through two tubes when it would normally take us over a month to use one tube of Colgate.</li>
            <li>I like the flavor instead of the really harsh peppermint most toothpaste has</li>
            <li>This gel is too thick and the wintergreen isn&#x27;t that nice.</li>
            <li>I ordered three so will have to live with it</li>
            <li>This would be great for allowing someone who is skeptical or hasn&#x27;t tried natural toothpaste before.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste feels very natural.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend if you want a truly natural toothpaste</li>
            <li>It smells okay, but the taste and consistency are gag-worthy - so much so that my typically easy-going husband actually flat out said that it makes him want to gag!</li>
            <li>and I missed the minty, sudsy tingle of the old toxic stuff I was used to!  </li>
            <li>love this tooth past.  </li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate uses natural, non-toxic ingredients in their products and they do not test on animals!</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product for you and your family!</li>
            <li>but not sure if all the chemicals in it is any better.</li>
            <li>Am awaiting a refund ,Will not purchase my Natures Gate toothpaste in this manner,as the product was evidently old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t foam much, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal.</li>
            <li>Actually the consistency on this product, as well as the consistency on the Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoo I used to use, wound up being very, ironically, inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>, boy, that becomes a big problem if it is 2x or 3x as much as supermarket</li>
            <li>that becomes a big problem if it is 2x or 3x as much as supermarket</li>
            <li>Maybe it was just really old, but I&#x27;m not chancing it again.</li>
            <li>Wow OH WOW.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s all natural and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is like a green gel and it seems like you have to use twice a much to even get your month to feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>I began making my own toothpaste, but got tired of digging it out of the mason jar</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have that fresh mouth wash flavor like other pastes.</li>
            <li>However, one thing to be aware of is that this particular flavor is not an opaque white paste like other Nature&#x27;s Gate flavors, but rather it is clear.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste might taste a bit bitter at first, but I got used to it</li>
            <li>Not sure how clean it is getting my teeth either.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T HAVE ANYTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT OTHER THAN I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>The taste can be a bit odd at first</li>
            <li>My only complaint is how much paste I have to use per brush compared to other flouride free brands,</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been making an effort to minimize, as much as possible, the many unnatural and unhealthy additives to our food, water, health and hygiene products.</li>
            <li>However, the paste can be hard (if not impossible) to squeeze from the tube.</li>
            <li>Fluoride is a poison which affects the brain as much as any other bodily function, yet we are only ever told of the one beneficial effect of fluoride, which is that it can strengthen tooth enamel.</li>
            <li>Super thick and gummy.</li>

            <li> So, I emailed the manufacturer and was told that this is not gluten free and that the manufacturer never claimed it was gluten free.</li>
            <li> For me, that&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gluten free</li>
            <li> i enjoy using natures gate toothpaste every morning.</li>
            <li> Natural toothpaste is good to have.  </li>
            <li> My review was originally written at a time when this listing was for the FLUORIDATED version of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Love this brand so much!</li>
            <li> Most other toothpastes leave my mouth feeling like it&#x27;s been destroyed, but this leaves a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li> From one tube to the next, the consistency would either be good</li>
            <li> I really wish I could have given this toothpaste a better rating.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam much, though it brushes ok.</li>
            <li> Not overly sweet, which I like.</li>
            <li> My first tube was easy to use.</li>
            <li> teeth and my mouth feel fresh and clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but you quickly get used to it.</li>
            <li> More natural and cruelty free product.</li>
            <li> Very good product, if you are like me and prefer not to be forced to use fluoride in your toothpaste</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste without toxic chemicals waste known as fluoride.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural, not tested on animals and vegan, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the freshest breath.</li>
            <li> It feels natural and leaves my teeth feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> The other flavor of this toothpaste is way better, this one just melts in your mouth, it does not foam up and give you a good deep clean</li>
            <li> Great taste and feel clean after, unlike all other natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The dentist said my teeth are in great condition at every appointment after using this for the past year.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste, I&#x27;ve gone back to Crest, but will be returning to this more natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of their flavors (strictly non-fluoridated, as I&#x27;m in no need of a chemical lobotomy) with high levels of satisfaction, yet this wintergreen gel just does not get my teeth and mouth clean enough</li>
            <li> I have used it for several months and I am very pleased with it; teeth look clean and white.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first rule in selling to distributors.</li>
            <li> I love Nature&#x27;s Gate Toothpaste, but I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> but next time I will make sure I get the paste.  </li>
            <li> Much healthier for the body!</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> if my dentist cusses me out at my next appt i will update this comment...:)</li>
            <li> Flavor is ok, mild, not really the &amp;#34;Hey</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was thrilled to find a toothpaste without FLOURIDE &amp; especially one that is natural!</li>
            <li> While the difference would seem to only be visual, I have noticed that this kind doesn&#x27;t seem to foam up as nicely as the white opaque pastes do.</li>
            <li> So far so good thought it was a little spicy or salty but has my mouth feeling fresh with out microbeeds or fluoride</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothpaste -- no weird \\&quot;natural\\&quot; taste or consistency or texture.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this toothpaste was mild in taste, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Mild minty flavor and all natural.</li>
            <li> i have found Natures Gate toothpaste at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Our family really likes this product.  </li>
            <li> When I got the packages, it said absolutely nothing about gluten on them</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Nature&#x27;s Gate Creme de Peppermint toothpaste for quite some time as it  stopped the canker sores that I was plagued with my whole life.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like it that much.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t un-gel very well</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it all the time, since it doesn&#x27;t brush teeth better than Colgate Total Gel (for example), but I use it at night, because I know it&#x27;s natural, and I use Colgate in the morning.</li>
            <li> And it certainly doesn&#x27;t meet the high standard for brushing your imouto&#x27;s teeth either, you need all the help you can get to feel clean after that as it</li>
            <li> I like the Nature&#x27;s Gate brand quite a lot, I use it when I&#x27;m too lazy to make my own toothpaste</li>
            <li> In particular, I have been trying to choose cruelty-free options.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a decent flavor</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave the overwhelming toothpaste &amp;#34;fresh breath&amp;#34; feel like other toothpastes do, but it helped me realize that we are getting a huge amount of sugar in the other pastes.</li>
            <li> Taste takes a little getting used to but is refreshing.</li>
            <li> have been trying to replace my conventional toiletries/personal products (shampoo, conditioner, soaps, toothpaste, deodorant, etc) with more natural options.  </li>
            <li> This never quite makes me feel fresh enough.</li>
            <li> We have already gone through two tubes when it would normally take us over a month to use one tube of Colgate.</li>
            <li> I like the flavor instead of the really harsh peppermint most toothpaste has</li>
            <li> This gel is too thick and the wintergreen isn&#x27;t that nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered three so will have to live with it</li>
            <li> This would be great for allowing someone who is skeptical or hasn&#x27;t tried natural toothpaste before.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste feels very natural.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend if you want a truly natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> It smells okay, but the taste and consistency are gag-worthy - so much so that my typically easy-going husband actually flat out said that it makes him want to gag!</li>
            <li> and I missed the minty, sudsy tingle of the old toxic stuff I was used to!  </li>
            <li> love this tooth past.  </li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate uses natural, non-toxic ingredients in their products and they do not test on animals!</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this product for you and your family!</li>
            <li> but not sure if all the chemicals in it is any better.</li>
            <li> Am awaiting a refund ,Will not purchase my Natures Gate toothpaste in this manner,as the product was evidently old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t foam much, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal.</li>
            <li> Actually the consistency on this product, as well as the consistency on the Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoo I used to use, wound up being very, ironically, inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> , boy, that becomes a big problem if it is 2x or 3x as much as supermarket</li>
            <li> that becomes a big problem if it is 2x or 3x as much as supermarket</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just really old, but I&#x27;m not chancing it again.</li>
            <li> Wow OH WOW.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is like a green gel and it seems like you have to use twice a much to even get your month to feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> I began making my own toothpaste, but got tired of digging it out of the mason jar</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have that fresh mouth wash flavor like other pastes.</li>
            <li> However, one thing to be aware of is that this particular flavor is not an opaque white paste like other Nature&#x27;s Gate flavors, but rather it is clear.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste might taste a bit bitter at first, but I got used to it</li>
            <li> Not sure how clean it is getting my teeth either.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T HAVE ANYTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT OTHER THAN I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> The taste can be a bit odd at first</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how much paste I have to use per brush compared to other flouride free brands,</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been making an effort to minimize, as much as possible, the many unnatural and unhealthy additives to our food, water, health and hygiene products.</li>
            <li> However, the paste can be hard (if not impossible) to squeeze from the tube.</li>
            <li> Fluoride is a poison which affects the brain as much as any other bodily function, yet we are only ever told of the one beneficial effect of fluoride, which is that it can strengthen tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Super thick and gummy.</li>
            <li> I am not a weakling either, but  I have to lay the tube on the counter and mash it flat while hoping I actually get some on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The taste is quite odd and it made my teeth very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My family had the same opinion, it doesn&#x27;t last very long while brushing</li>
            <li> The flavor of the toothpaste is flat and as I noted doesn&#x27;t seem to freshen your breath.</li>
            <li> Only toothpaste we have used for a long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it is considerably more expensive, ounce-for-ounce, than Crest or Colgate or the other mainstream brands, it&#x27;s an expense that you don&#x27;t repeat so often that you notice it in your pocketbook.  </li>
            <li> very condensed and hard to squeeze out but probably</li>
            <li> Must be old and dried up.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> After using this cement like paste for a couple days my mouth was SO dry.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer it now over Crest or any other brand!</li>
            <li> formula changed a bit and it&#x27;s harder to get out of the tube now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a little while but have noticed less plaque buildup behind my front teeth with this toothpaste which is a positive I hadn&#x27;t anticipated.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, Nature&#x27;s Gate as well as some other companies offer fluoride-free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> We choose not to use toothpaste with fluoride due to adverse health effects it causes.</li>
            <li> toothpaste is hard to get out of the tube, finally it did squeeze out, but it comes out in two strips!!  </li>
            <li> This gives a sudsy-ish, slightly tingly wintergreen flavor without harmful ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The 3 pack that I order from Amazon costs less than buying &amp;#34;top shelf&amp;#34; name brand toothpaste.</li>
            <li> i read that toothpastes are color coded by a little bar on the bottom and a black bar means a lot of chemicals???</li>
            <li> The gel is a little sticky, though.</li>
            <li> and you end up losing a little clump of it (either by spitting or by it dropping off of your toothbrush), but that doesn&#x27;t keep me from ordering it over and over.</li>
            <li> It was completely dried out and unusable .</li>
            <li> My second tube was impossible to use (I had to cut it open and transfer toothpaste to another squeezable container).</li>
            <li> The customer service department was not super helpful and didn&#x27;t believe me when I complained.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;a little bit hard</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it is so thick it is hard to get out of the tube!  </li>
            <li> Was afraid to try all natural toothpaste...was worried it would taste horrible, but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but then it gets very thin when mixed with water, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your toothbrush at all.</li>
            <li> or else it was so hard</li>
            <li> Hard to get out of tube.  </li>
            <li> Thick and hard to get out of tube.</li>
            <li> This GEL formulation seems too thick for the tube and takes hard squeezing to get it out,  </li>
            <li> and there are at least a dozen ingredients that I didn&#x27;t recognize.</li>
            <li> (at least it feels that way).</li>
            <li> It might be difficult to switch from brash and harsh pastes and washes but this still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so darn thick</li>
            <li> The paste is so unbelievably thick that I struggled to get any out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely not a good experience - recommend avoiding this one altogether.</li>
            <li> In case you didn&#x27;t know, FLOURIDE is not good for you ...&lt;</li>
            <li> Very hard to get out of tube and spread over your brush and teeth.</li>
            <li> The flavor is very weak, and the gel was so thick, I struggled to squeeze it out of the tube!  </li>
            <li> but that is just prohibitively expensive</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this toothpaste at all.  </li>
            <li> Never realized that fluoride was so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best Toothpaste ever. My granddaughter steals it every time she visits. Only toothpaste we have used for a long time! Buy it, try it and you will love it!</li>
            <li> It was completely dried out and unusable . Am awaiting a refund ,Will not purchase my Natures Gate toothpaste in this manner,as the product was evidently old. i have found Natures Gate toothpaste at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> I picked this up while looking for an affordable, fluoride-free, all-natural toothpaste. I will not be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t foam much, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal. It smells okay, but the taste and consistency are gag-worthy - so much so that my typically easy-going husband actually flat out said that it makes him want to gag! I have not found it to hold its own against the effects of spicy food on one&#x27;s breath, and I feel like it has zero lasting power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not a good experience - recommend avoiding this one altogether.</li>
            <li> The taste is nice and not too strong, and my dentist has been happy with my home care since I started using this toothpaste, so if you need vegan toothpaste I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> We went fluoride free 2 years ago and started with this toothpaste. I love it! I actually prefer it now over Crest or any other brand!</li>
            <li> Our family really likes this product.  We get good results from our dental visits too, which is the biggest plus of all...</li>
            <li> I have just used up 3/4 packs. The toothpaste feels very natural. My only complaint is how much paste I have to use per brush compared to other flouride free brands,</li>
            <li> Though the listing calls this gluten-free toothpaste, it isn&#x27;t. When I got the packages, it said absolutely nothing about gluten on them and there are at least a dozen ingredients that I didn&#x27;t recognize. So, I emailed the manufacturer and was told that this is not gluten free and that the manufacturer never claimed it was gluten free. The person who emailed me basically said that Amazon lied about it and that there&#x27;s nothing they can do about that. I would beg to differ. Nature&#x27;s Gate- don&#x27;t sell to distributors who misrepresent your products. That&#x27;s the first rule in selling to distributors. I&#x27;ll never buy another Nature&#x27;s Gate product again.</li>
            <li> EDIT:  My review was originally written at a time when this listing was for the FLUORIDATED version of this toothpaste.  The listing has been partly modified and now features a non-fluoridated toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FURTHER EDIT:  Actually the consistency on this product, as well as the consistency on the Nature&#x27;s Gate shampoo I used to use, wound up being very, ironically, inconsistent.  From one tube to the next, the consistency would either be good or else it was so hard, you&#x27;d have to put it onto the counter and lean on it to get any to come out.  The customer service department was not super helpful and didn&#x27;t believe me when I complained.  So, I have changed the rating from 5 stars to 3.  It&#x27;s good when you can get it onto your brush, but no guarantees that&#x27;ll be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to replace my conventional toiletries/personal products (shampoo, conditioner, soaps, toothpaste, deodorant, etc) with more natural options.  In particular, I have been trying to choose cruelty-free options.  I have had some successes and some failures in these efforts.  Either I can&#x27;t find a natural/cruelty-free option that works well for me (this is the case with deodorant, for example) or I find one that I do like but that is just prohibitively expensive (conditioner is a case in point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste, I am happy to report, works on all levels.  It&#x27;s a very \\&quot;normal\\&quot; toothpaste -- no weird \\&quot;natural\\&quot; taste or consistency or texture.  It has fluoride so if you&#x27;re reluctant to give that up, this is a good choice (many natural toothpastes are made without fluoride).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is considerably more expensive, ounce-for-ounce, than Crest or Colgate or the other mainstream brands, it&#x27;s an expense that you don&#x27;t repeat so often that you notice it in your pocketbook.  For me, that&#x27;s important.  I don&#x27;t mind spending five bucks for toothpaste since I only buy it a couple times a year.  But something like conditioner that I go thru very quickly, boy, that becomes a big problem if it is 2x or 3x as much as supermarket brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.  Give it a try.y, that becomes a big problem if it is 2x or 3x as much as supermarket brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> very condensed and hard to squeeze out but probably since doesn&#x27;t contain all those cancer causing chemicals</li>
            <li> Made the switch 1.5 years ago, and haven&#x27;t missed the sweet/fluoride-y stuff one bit</li>
            <li> Very good product, if you are like me and prefer not to be forced to use fluoride in your toothpaste</li>
            <li> Glad to have found this on Amazon. This is the only toothpaste I can use, the sugary big names make me literally gag before I can finish brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I leaves a not so nice after taste. But otherwise it works. I will not be getting this kind again. We&#x27;ll be going back the the actual paste version.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Tastes great and a perfect alternative than what I was using. Never realized that fluoride was so bad.</li>
            <li> I like the Nature&#x27;s Gate brand quite a lot, I use it when I&#x27;m too lazy to make my own toothpaste or I want to give my gums a break from the peroxide. I&#x27;ve tried most of their flavors (strictly non-fluoridated, as I&#x27;m in no need of a chemical lobotomy) with high levels of satisfaction, yet this wintergreen gel just does not get my teeth and mouth clean enough (at least it feels that way). My family had the same opinion, it doesn&#x27;t last very long while brushing so I have to reapply to cover a norman brushing session, and my mouth tastes like I haven&#x27;t brushed all day by the end of the day (I brush 2x daily, and after meals). It&#x27;s a shame as wintergreen is my favorite so far taste wise. And it certainly doesn&#x27;t meet the high standard for brushing your imouto&#x27;s teeth either, you need all the help you can get to feel clean after that as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the two packs of 4 tubes I ordered and will be getting another flavor from Nature&#x27;s Gate in exchange. Stay away from the wintergreen until they reformulate it to match the effectiveness of the rest of their product line. Most importantly, make sure not to over brush your imouto&#x27;s teeth as it will become quite addicting.</li>
            <li> I have become increasingly concerned about harmful chemicals in the products I use.  I began making my own toothpaste, but got tired of digging it out of the mason jar and I missed the minty, sudsy tingle of the old toxic stuff I was used to!  So I decided to give this a try. This gives a sudsy-ish, slightly tingly wintergreen flavor without harmful ingredients.  My mouth feels very clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is so thick it is hard to get out of the tube!  I am not a weakling either, but  I have to lay the tube on the counter and mash it flat while hoping I actually get some on the toothbrush.  It may actually be easier to dig the homemade stuff out of the mason jar after all!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a decent flavor but it&#x27;s so darn thick you have to use pliers on the tube to get it out. Color and texture reminds me of ointment too. I don&#x27;t think it has any whitening capabilities either. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a toothpaste that is good  for you and works great</li>
            <li> toothpaste is hard to get out of the tube, finally it did squeeze out, but it comes out in two strips!!  Must be old and dried up.</li>
            <li> In case you didn&#x27;t know, FLOURIDE is not good for you ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOOK IT UP!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find a toothpaste without FLOURIDE &amp; especially one that is natural!</li>
            <li> No flavor.  Hard to get out of tube.  Can&#x27;t wait till I use it all up.  Will not purchase this again.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> good flavor AND FLUORIDE FREE!</li>
            <li> love this tooth past.  easy to use, love the gel and the taste is great.  I like it better than TM also</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Nature&#x27;s Gate Creme de Peppermint toothpaste for quite some time as it  stopped the canker sores that I was plagued with my whole life.  But this Wintergreen Gel is not so good.  The flavor is very weak, and the gel was so thick, I struggled to squeeze it out of the tube!  Maybe it was just really old, but I&#x27;m not chancing it again.</li>
            <li> Taste takes a little getting used to but is refreshing. Thick and hard to get out of tube. I will continue to use it rather than ever use a fluoride paste.</li>
            <li> I wanted a gel toothpaste for a SonicCare toothbrush.  I purchased this product because it is a gel with fluoride and without whitening.  I like it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been making an effort to minimize, as much as possible, the many unnatural and unhealthy additives to our food, water, health and hygiene products. Fluoride is a poison which affects the brain as much as any other bodily function, yet we are only ever told of the one beneficial effect of fluoride, which is that it can strengthen tooth enamel. Thankfully, Nature&#x27;s Gate as well as some other companies offer fluoride-free toothpaste. This toothpaste tastes great and is very refreshing as far as your breath goes. Teeth feel very clean afterwards. However, one thing to be aware of is that this particular flavor is not an opaque white paste like other Nature&#x27;s Gate flavors, but rather it is clear. While the difference would seem to only be visual, I have noticed that this kind doesn&#x27;t seem to foam up as nicely as the white opaque pastes do. Also, it is somewhat more difficult to push out of the tube than the others as well. We have been through several tubes now and they all seem to take quite a bit of pressure to squeeze any out. Otherwise, I would recommend this product as a safe alternative to fluoridated pastes.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste.  I wish that it made more of a lather but I believe that its doing its job. It also helps to whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love Nature&#x27;s Gate Toothpaste, but I didn&#x27;t pay close enough attention when I ordered this.  I got the gel and I really don&#x27;t like it that much.  I ordered three so will have to live with it but next time I will make sure I get the paste.  This gel is too thick and the wintergreen isn&#x27;t that nice.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste without the fluoride.  Also has a nice taste.</li>
            <li> This product took some getting used to but It was strangely refreshing without all of the additives. Much healthier for the body!</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste that saves me from canker sores and gum problems.</li>
            <li> Love this brand so much! It&#x27;s great! I just prefer the paste instead of the gel</li>
            <li> Best natural toothpaste without toxic chemicals waste known as fluoride. At the time I was heavliy researching fluoride and I wanted to find an alternative healthier toothpaste my unce introduce me to this toothpaste through his amway business. He hadn&#x27;t had any information on fluoride at the time and his company sold the at $10 each. after I really enjoyed it so I looked for it on amazon and found them a lot cheaper for a bundle. 4 for $12.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> So far so good thought it was a little spicy or salty but has my mouth feeling fresh with out microbeeds or fluoride and it&#x27;s gluten free</li>
            <li> Was afraid to try all natural toothpaste...was worried it would taste horrible, but I love this stuff. My teeth feel great, this toothpaste does what it should! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The other flavor of this toothpaste is way better, this one just melts in your mouth, it does not foam up and give you a good deep clean</li>
            <li> We choose not to use toothpaste with fluoride due to adverse health effects it causes. Some non-fluoride toothpastes don&#x27;t taste all that great, but Nature&#x27;s Gate has a great mild, minty flavor. Even our kids use it without complaining! Nobody in our family of four has had a cavity since using this toothpaste either!!</li>
            <li> Great tasting product. I have used it for several months and I am very pleased with it; teeth look clean and white. However, the paste can be hard (if not impossible) to squeeze from the tube. This will vary from tube to tube. My first tube was easy to use. My second tube was impossible to use (I had to cut it open and transfer toothpaste to another squeezable container). Even with the difficulty of use, this is a great product as compared to the many others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this toothpaste. The ingredients are amazing. The taste can be a bit odd at first but you quickly get used to it.</li>
            <li> I really wish I could have given this toothpaste a better rating. I love the fact that it&#x27;s an all natural toothpaste and that it has a really GREAT Wintergreen taste. The problem is that it is a mother-bear to squeeze the gel out of the tube! And, once it comes out it simply sticks to itself and you have to fight it to stay on the  toothbrush. I&#x27;m hoping that my complaints are about an isolated issue that perhaps only this one batch and tube has. But, realistically, I doubt it.</li>
            <li> More natural and cruelty free product. Cannot get better than that!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste might taste a bit bitter at first, but I got used to it and now I love it. The dentist said my teeth are in great condition at every appointment after using this for the past year.</li>
            <li> tastes good, no flouride</li>
            <li> Pretty good safe paste, dont expect a lot of flavor.</li>
            <li> It might be difficult to switch from brash and harsh pastes and washes but this still gets the job done. Flavor is ok, mild, not really the &amp;#34;Hey I just brushed!&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> This never quite makes me feel fresh enough. I love that it&#x27;s natural, not tested on animals and vegan, but it doesn&#x27;t give me the freshest breath. I use it in between meals but can&#x27;t use it as my AM toothpaste to get rid of my lovely morning breath. For that I prefer Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. Arrived ontime.</li>
            <li> No harmful chemicals here! The gel feels great and the wintergreen taste is fresh and not over powering like some toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried before. This would be great for allowing someone who is skeptical or hasn&#x27;t tried natural toothpaste before.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste we use now as I was trying to de-fluoride our house.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong flavor taste but it has been working great.  No complaints from the dentist and I purchased this almost a year ago.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate uses natural, non-toxic ingredients in their products and they do not test on animals! The 3 pack that I order from Amazon costs less than buying &amp;#34;top shelf&amp;#34; name brand toothpaste. I completely recommend this product for you and your family!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. It feels natural and leaves my teeth feeling healthy. This doesn&#x27;t leave the overwhelming toothpaste &amp;#34;fresh breath&amp;#34; feel like other toothpastes do, but it helped me realize that we are getting a huge amount of sugar in the other pastes. Also, this one doesn&#x27;t foam, which may be a drawback to some. I&#x27;d rather have healthy teeth, though!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam much, though it brushes ok. I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it all the time, since it doesn&#x27;t brush teeth better than Colgate Total Gel (for example), but I use it at night, because I know it&#x27;s natural, and I use Colgate in the morning. I like to have my teeth thouroughly cleaned and white, that&#x27;s why I still have to use Colgate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d still recommend this toothpaste, because I know it&#x27;s good for the gums, it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> love it! taste great.&lt;br /&gt;a little bit hard to get it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Received this in a gift basket and it is not something I would ever buy again. The paste is so unbelievably thick that I struggled to get any out. After using this cement like paste for a couple days my mouth was SO dry. This is a complete waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this toothpaste at all.  The taste is quite odd and it made my teeth very sensitive.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My family&#x27;s favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Super thick and gummy. Very hard to get out of tube and spread over your brush and teeth. Flavor is ok, but needs to be stronger. Not overly sweet, which I like. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> to change for a new product, have been a great change for me. i enjoy using natures gate toothpaste every morning.</li>
            <li> Buy one of their PASTES instead.  This GEL formulation seems too thick for the tube and takes hard squeezing to get it out,  but then it gets very thin when mixed with water, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your toothbrush at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice, mild flavored toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a little while but have noticed less plaque buildup behind my front teeth with this toothpaste which is a positive I hadn&#x27;t anticipated.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this toothpaste was mild in taste, which I prefer. Mild minty flavor and all natural.</li>
            <li> great natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpaste cleans teeth and freshens breath, and it is an organic product!  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> We purchased this product to reduce the amount of fluoride intake at our home.  The toothpaste is like a green gel and it seems like you have to use twice a much to even get your month to feel fresh.  We have already gone through two tubes when it would normally take us over a month to use one tube of Colgate. The flavor of the toothpaste is flat and as I noted doesn&#x27;t seem to freshen your breath. Not sure how clean it is getting my teeth either.</li>
            <li> I like the flavor instead of the really harsh peppermint most toothpaste has and I prefer gel to paste. For some reason I cannot find this toothpaste locally. I wish I knew why!</li>
            <li> Excellent Service;  Accurate Product Description</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth and my mouth feel fresh and clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s flouride free.</li>
            <li> This stuff has me looking for toothpast, or tube keys to help get it out of the tube. Wow OH WOW.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. I like that it&#x27;s all natural and that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. I also like the Wintergreen flavor. The gel is a little sticky, though. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t un-gel very well and you end up losing a little clump of it (either by spitting or by it dropping off of your toothbrush), but that doesn&#x27;t keep me from ordering it over and over.</li>
            <li> Flouride free and works good!</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste, I&#x27;ve gone back to Crest, but will be returning to this more natural toothpaste. Plus I feel like its a better choice for my family.</li>
            <li> i uses twice daily. doesn&#x27;t have that fresh mouth wash flavor like other pastes. love that it&#x27;s vegan (?) but not sure if all the chemicals in it is any better. i read that toothpastes are color coded by a little bar on the bottom and a black bar means a lot of chemicals??? if my dentist cusses me out at my next appt i will update this comment...:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.  Natural toothpaste is good to have.  Most other toothpastes leave my mouth feeling like it&#x27;s been destroyed, but this leaves a good clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it but not as good as Burt&#x27;s Bees but they don&#x27;t make it any longer so we are still looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T HAVE ANYTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT OTHER THAN I LOVE IT!!! iT TASTES GOOD AND FLUORIDE FREE!!!</li>
            <li> formula changed a bit and it&#x27;s harder to get out of the tube now but it tastes better i think.</li>
            <li> Great taste and feel clean after, unlike all other natural toothpaste. No chalky after taste. Highly reccomend if you want a truly natural toothpaste</li>
            <li> I will never stop using it.</li>
            <li> A pleasant tasting toothpaste that you can feel holistically good about using.</li>
