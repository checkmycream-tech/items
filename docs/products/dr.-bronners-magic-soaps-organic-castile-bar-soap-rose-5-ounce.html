    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very wonderful soap.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it at all and will return to using Dove, which I think is the best.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product (and it arrived in good condition in a timely fashion!)</li>
            <li>This is great .</li>
            <li>I have been told it&#x27;s great for shampoo</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite scent, but a truly awesome product, nonetheless.</li>
            <li>This is a good soap, nice lather.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a rose scent</li>
            <li>I purchased the Rose soap bar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell didn&#x27;t smell like rose to me at all...</li>
            <li>Excellent product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Good soap, but the scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li>The soap didn&#x27;t have a very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>Although, I wished I could smell the rose more.  </li>
            <li>While the Rose was okay, I liked the lavender fragrance better...</li>
            <li>and they were so clean and smelled so good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously magic, I wash my makeup brushes with it and it was the quickest I have ever gotten it done</li>
            <li>Will be buying more and the liquid version of this</li>
            <li>I was just expecting a more pungent fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the lavendar scent as well.</li>
            <li>love love this soap and store will be shopping again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum, this is a great natural soap for body!</li>
            <li>It has a very rich lather and great for a variety of skin problems, such as acne or even psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Nice pure soap</li>
            <li>It will go in and lather quite nicely, but then when washed out it will leave your hair feeling like one large clump on your head.</li>
            <li>However, unlike those types of soaps, your body still feels clean and it does not feel like there&#x27;s a film over your skin.</li>
            <li>I love this Rose soap and the fact that it&#x27;s a pure product that makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>but I use many natural products</li>
            <li>So while it is effective, I would have to use this daily to keep my hair from getting too oily and I don&#x27;t like how it makes my hair feel after I wash</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and using it as a body wash has cleared up my dry patches and greatly improved the state of my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a subtle rose and hemp.</li>
            <li>After reading you can use this for many different things including body and hair, I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Which was the reason I went with this soap in the first place.</li>
            <li>As soon as you dry, the feeling is gone and my skin feels fairly hydrated compared to my old body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender soap, so I decided to try some other fragrances.  </li>
            <li>The coconut oil really makes it soft, smooth and bubbly.  </li>
            <li>If you like subtle then this soap is great.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve read that you can certainly use this for hair, I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The bar of soap was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>It has a very medicinal, herbal smell.</li>
            <li>All of these soaps really lather up well....</li>
            <li>It also washes really clean....and....</li>
            <li>Like most natural shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, it didn&#x27;t remove enough oil from my hair either.</li>
            <li>The lather is fine, but that&#x27;s about the only decent thing for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The feeling of the soap as a body wash leaves your body sticky when still in the water like many other bar soaps.</li>
            <li>Perhaps other scents may be better, but I&#x27;m not taking another chance of throwing away my hard-earned money.  </li>
            <li>It feels very much like putting regular bar soap meant for body onto your hair.</li>
            <li>Was afraid the rose smell might be too much</li>
            <li>I even use it for the grandbabies because it is very gentle on the skin, and it seems to relieve their little bottoms if they have a diaper rash.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much of a rose scent</li>
            <li> Nice pure soap but, its drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Rose soap bar. This stuff is seriously magic, I wash my makeup brushes with it and it was the quickest I have ever gotten it done and they were so clean and smelled so good. I also washed some pennies that were stuck together in my car door handle with God knows what and nothing was on sticking them including soaking them in alcohol. I rub the little bit of this on them and ran them through my hand they unstuck almost immediately. Will be buying more and the liquid version of this</li>
            <li> Very wonderful soap.  Although, I wished I could smell the rose more.  Keeps your skin soft and fresh.  I use it on my face as well.</li>
            <li> The bar of soap was packaged very well. The soap didn&#x27;t have a very strong fragrance. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is great . No problems at all!</li>
            <li> I love this Rose soap and the fact that it&#x27;s a pure product that makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> After reading you can use this for many different things including body and hair, I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m all for multi-purpose products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell didn&#x27;t smell like rose to me at all... Which was the reason I went with this soap in the first place. It has a very medicinal, herbal smell. I&#x27;m not too fond of it but I use many natural products so I&#x27;m used to it. However, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feeling of the soap as a body wash leaves your body sticky when still in the water like many other bar soaps. However, unlike those types of soaps, your body still feels clean and it does not feel like there&#x27;s a film over your skin. As soon as you dry, the feeling is gone and my skin feels fairly hydrated compared to my old body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, for hair... While I&#x27;ve read that you can certainly use this for hair, I wouldn&#x27;t. It feels very much like putting regular bar soap meant for body onto your hair. It will go in and lather quite nicely, but then when washed out it will leave your hair feeling like one large clump on your head. Like most natural shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, it didn&#x27;t remove enough oil from my hair either. So while it is effective, I would have to use this daily to keep my hair from getting too oily and I don&#x27;t like how it makes my hair feel after I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, this is a great natural soap for body! I have sensitive skin and using it as a body wash has cleared up my dry patches and greatly improved the state of my skin. Just don&#x27;t expect it to smell likes roses and be wary of washing your hair with it.</li>
            <li> Good soap, but the scent isn&#x27;t as strong as I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li> I really liked Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Lavender soap, so I decided to try some other fragrances.  While the Rose was okay, I liked the lavender fragrance better...it seemed stronger and had a \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; smell.  All of these soaps really lather up well....I only have to re-lather ONCE during a shower.  The coconut oil really makes it soft, smooth and bubbly.  It also washes really clean....and....it&#x27;s organic! I will continue to buy this product (and it arrived in good condition in a timely fashion!)</li>
            <li> Wish the smell were sweeter. But will buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the rose scent and what little scent it does have is rather unpleasant.  I don&#x27;t like it at all and will return to using Dove, which I think is the best.  I wanted to try something different after reading some reviews and was disappointed.  Perhaps other scents may be better, but I&#x27;m not taking another chance of throwing away my hard-earned money.  The lather is fine, but that&#x27;s about the only decent thing for me.</li>
            <li> This is a good soap, nice lather. I was just expecting a more pungent fragrance. It&#x27;s more of a subtle rose and hemp. If you like subtle then this soap is great.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite scent, but a truly awesome product, nonetheless. It has a very rich lather and great for a variety of skin problems, such as acne or even psoriasis. I have been told it&#x27;s great for shampoo but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. I even use it for the grandbabies because it is very gentle on the skin, and it seems to relieve their little bottoms if they have a diaper rash. Excellent product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this soap hoping it would help with my itchy skin. It does just that. I even use it on my face and have had no problems. Will definitely continue to use this and all other scents of this soap. Was afraid the rose smell might be too much but it is not over lowering at all. Love the lavendar scent as well.</li>
            <li> Made me a bit rashy and the aroma is not great.</li>
            <li> love love this soap and store will be shopping again.</li>
