            <li>For those of you that already use this product but wonder why its so cheap compared to the rip off stores in Vegas or the mall....no worries.</li>
            <li>It was no longer available</li>
            <li>so I came to you and found it was available and</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t notice anything special about this product.  </li>
            <li>I came home and decided to look up the prices since the eye serum really did take away the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with oily acne filled skin for years and in two weeks I look years younger with healthy looking skin.</li>

            <li>First, it&#x27;s not a gel</li>
            <li>I have tried other products from department stores and this Dead Sea product worked just as good as or even better that some of the leading anti wrinkle products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, unscented and absorbs easily, but it&#x27;s no better than other products of its kind.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, but I think only because it adds moisture to your wrinkles to soften them.</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper than what it sold for in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li>Notice a really improvement w lines under and around eyes.</li>

            <li>Thanks for your prompt attention.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a light, white cream.  </li>
            <li>The jar is way plenty of product, not your typical eye cream sized jar, so in that respect, I&#x27;m pleased and am willing to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>I have tried some other products that are better.  </li>
            <li>Definitely see a difference right from the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Great product if you have dark circle below your eyes, within a few minutes the area looks brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>This product is new and is NOT expired.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I used this eye gel, however this is the first time I purchase the Deja Vu Dead Eye Gel  from Amazon, for what ever reason this particular product dose not work, I&#x27;m not sure if this is authentic, I was very hesitant to buy it, because I&#x27;ve never seen it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just ordering my 2nd jar of DejaVu Eye Gel because I&#x27;m so pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen in tightening the skin under my eyes and reducing the dark circles quite noticeably.  </li>

            <li> Would like to purchase more. If u don&#x27;t have for good price can u forwRd my interest to someone that can offer me a deal on 3 products I&#x27;m looking for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susaniselern@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> I definitely see improvement.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received this product two days after I ordered -- which was fast!  I had seen a demonstration done on myself in Las Vegas I June -- and this worked instantly.  I was amazed what this product could do.  It seemed to stretch the wrinkles from my lower and upper eyelids.  When I found this product on Amazon, I decided to order it.  It was much cheaper than what it sold for in Las Vegas.  I use several Dead Sea Eye products and have gotten results.  I have tried other products from department stores and this Dead Sea product worked just as good as or even better that some of the leading anti wrinkle products.  I recommend buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I was in a store in NY, and the guy tried to charge me $125 for this!!! It works fine, but I think only because it adds moisture to your wrinkles to soften them. I dont think it actually makes them go away!&lt;br /&gt;For the money I paid here, its a fine product. Not sure I&#x27;ll re-order though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just ordering my 2nd jar of DejaVu Eye Gel because I&#x27;m so pleased with the results I&#x27;ve seen in tightening the skin under my eyes and reducing the dark circles quite noticeably.  And I&#x27;m a senior, so that&#x27;s impressive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure I would recommend this product. Reason being is that I have used it for a week and all I have gotten is a big rash around my eyes. I&#x27;m planning on returning it back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> For those of you that already use this product but wonder why its so cheap compared to the rip off stores in Vegas or the mall....no worries. This product is new and is NOT expired. I just received it and it doesn&#x27;t expired for another 2 years from now! For those of you who never used it before and is wondering if it does work I can&#x27;t state on that yet. I just started using it last night. i will follow up with a review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> As a man I was skeptical but believe its really helped my skin. I&#x27;ve dealt with oily acne filled skin for years and in two weeks I look years younger with healthy looking skin. I can&#x27;t speak for everybody but its amazing for me.</li>
            <li> Great product and I love using it.  I would most definitely recommend it to all my friends and family.  I was also so pleased as how quickly amazon shipped this product to me.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product was one I had purchased over a year ago at my local mall. It was no longer available so I came to you and found it was available and many times cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I tried this product, to help me with my fine lines around my eyes.  Also, I wear contacts and my eyes are sensitive.  This product does work, however, it is gritty and you need to be careful not to get any in your eyes.  I would not recommend using it on your eyelids, just underneath your eye.</li>
            <li> I am ccnfused about this product. The sales people in the malls have said that product sold on amazon is expired or used but not&lt;br /&gt;Authentic  which  is why it is half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to talk to someone to get this clarified  Can anyone clear thus up&lt;br /&gt;For me??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.  Its a nice combination of gel and cold cream.  I get lots of compliments on my skin.  I like their night cream also - its very rich and I use it only about once a week.  I use a different night cream on the other nights.  Its a good balance.</li>
            <li> I love this product line but refuse to pay mall prices for it. Finding it here as a prime member was a bonus!</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel.  Helps shrink bags and lighten dark circles.  Paid a lot more at the mall kiosk.</li>
            <li> I just got back from Vegas where the sales guy almost had me for the tune of $200. Thank God I left my credit card back in my hotel room. He was pissed that I told him that I couldn&#x27;t buy it right then since I didn&#x27;&#x27;t have my CC. He was so damned pushy. I came home and decided to look up the prices since the eye serum really did take away the fine lines under my eyes. I was shocked to see the prices so low. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product if you have dark circle below your eyes, within a few minutes the area looks brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and it tends to make my eyes water even though I keep it away from my actual eyes.</li>
            <li> I only use this gel at night around my eyes - I already have a day eye cream that I prefer to use with my Bare Escentuals makeup.  I can&#x27;t say that I see any difference in the amount of lines around my eyes, but I will keep using it - just never know.  The jar is way plenty of product, not your typical eye cream sized jar, so in that respect, I&#x27;m pleased and am willing to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> Definitely see a difference right from the first time I used it.  Notice a really improvement w lines under and around eyes. Apply 2 x a day</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I used this eye gel, however this is the first time I purchase the Deja Vu Dead Eye Gel  from Amazon, for what ever reason this particular product dose not work, I&#x27;m not sure if this is authentic, I was very hesitant to buy it, because I&#x27;ve never seen it so cheep. Please have some to contact me from customer service department, I would really like a refund. Thanks for your prompt attention.</li>
            <li> Love Déjà Vu products! This eye cream is wonderful, smooths out lines and dark circles. Great price for this item!</li>
            <li> What more can I say, wrinkles just melt away with this product. A+&lt;br /&gt;Its perfect and it didnt cost as much as it does at the Mall!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.  I have tried some other products that are better.  Contains parabens.  Left my eye area about the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using this anti-wrinkle gel for about a month now.  First, it&#x27;s not a gel - it&#x27;s a light, white cream.  I also don&#x27;t notice anything special about this product.  It&#x27;s light, unscented and absorbs easily, but it&#x27;s no better than other products of its kind.  I will go back to using Aveeno lotion which looks and feels the same, but costs much less.</li>
            <li> the Deja Vu night cream is wonderful...my skin feels so soft and healthy.  Wrinkles and creases are softened.  Over all love it.</li>
            <li> It is okay. I need something to get rid of the laugh lines around my eyes and I just cannot seem to find the right product. The eye gel helps soften them but they are still there.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a great frie.nd around Christmas time.  She has been using this on a regular basis and she LOVES it!!</li>
            <li> No miracles here, folks. Just regular moisturizer. Moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t turn back the clock. Six more words required. Done now.</li>
