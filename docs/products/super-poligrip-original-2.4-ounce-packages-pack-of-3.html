            <li> Let&#x27;s face it.... what can be said about denture adhesive.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried a few, and I found this to be a better one.</li>
            <li> Will always buy this, thank you</li>

            <li> I have used this Product for years, but &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; of going to the Drug Store for this Product, so resorted to the Internet for my needs for this Product.  James  L.  Powell.</li>
            <li> !Incredible product! It protect my gums and lasts more than 24 hours. It hasn&#x27;t any flavor and give you safety to speak and eat. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product, would recommend this produce to my friends. If you wear dentures you should use this product.Pretty good price.</li>
            <li> Hubby has tried them ALL. This is the one. Keeps his partial false teeth in place. Doesn&#x27;t hurt. Doesn&#x27;t sting. Doesn&#x27;t not last during the day. He won&#x27;t use any other product. This this is like glue and it&#x27;s the best one he could find. No cons here because he&#x27;s tried them all.</li>
            <li> Thank you for taking my money, I could have give you from my heart a donation, but at this time I am going to say it was a donation, thank god I can give</li>
            <li> Grips well and lasts all day. Does not have a scent and does what it is supposed to do. Have not tried something different so there is nothing to compare.</li>
            <li> Keep trying the different brands and always end up going to Poligrip.  I think I will quit experimenting.  I do wish the outlet on the tube was round instead of flat.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have tried. Love it more now that I found a better way to purchase it</li>
            <li> Works well as advertised.</li>
